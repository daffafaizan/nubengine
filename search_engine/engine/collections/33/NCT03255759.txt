        1. What impact can we project if additional diagnostic information were to be provided to
           clinicians in terms of patient outcomes, costs, and antibiotic use?

        2. What are the workflow constraints on returning diagnostic results to clinicians and/or
           antibiotic stewardship programs? Overall, the aim is to assess the added value and
           acceptability of a multiplexed molecular diagnostic assay in the identification of
           pathogens in patients presenting with bacteremia at hospitals in LMICs and to assess
           health care providers' satisfaction with the assay.
