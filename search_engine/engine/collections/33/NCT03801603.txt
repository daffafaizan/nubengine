      vaccination program aimed at accelerating vaccine uptake among rural and Native American
      adolescents ages 11-17. HPV vaccination coverage with at least one dose remains
      disproportionately lower among rural adolescent compared to adolescents residing in urban
      areas and the rate of series completion is lower among Native American adolescent girls
      compared to non-Hispanic White adolescent girls.
