      hypertriglyceridemia, modest elevations of LDL cholesterol, low levels of HDL cholesterol,
      and LDL phenotype pattern B (small, dense LDL particles). Statins are first line therapy, and
      reduce LDL cholesterol levels without affecting LDL particle size. Fenofibrate addresses the
      triglycerides, HDL cholesterol levels, and LDL phenotype, so is recommended as second level
      therapy. The third element is niacin, but for insulin resistant patients, a question has been
      whether niacin might be exacerbating the underlying pathophysiology of Metabolic Syndrome
      patients. In SNARED, niacin was compared to the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone in study
      subjects already on statin and fenofibrate.

      All volunteers participating in SNARED exhibit LDL phenotype pattern B despite statin therapy
      at the time of recruitment. Comparisons of LDL phenotype at baseline are to be compared to
      measurements made after 4 months of statin + fenofibrate. If the LDL phenotype converts to
      pattern A (large LDL particles), this is a study endpoint. Otherwise, study subjcts are
      randomized to receive statin+fenofibrate+niacin, or statin+fenofibrate+rosiglitazone for six
      months, at which time lipid phenotype will again be determined..
