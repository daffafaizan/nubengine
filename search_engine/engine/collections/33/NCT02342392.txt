        1. Compare the vascularity of primary pterygium before and 1 week after intralesional
           ranibizumab (0.3 mg/0.03 mL) injection.

        2. Compare the size of primary pterygium before and 1 week after intralesional ranibizumab
           (0.3 mg/0.03 mL) injection.

        3. Compare the recurrence rate at 1 year after pterygium excision surgery between the group
           with and without intralesional ranibizumab injection.
