    
      This is a Phase II, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the assigned drug)
      and single arm study. The study will consist of a screening period of maximum 8 weeks, an
      initial treatment period of 48 weeks, a post week 48 treatment extension period of 4 years
      (Cohort 1 only), and a 4 week follow-up (cohort 2 only) period. Participants who withdraw
      from the trial on or before the Week 48 visit or subjects with ongoing (serious) adverse
      events ([S]AEs), laboratory abnormalities, or viral load increase at the last on-treatment
      visit in the extension, will be seen for a follow-up visit 4 weeks later. The initial 48-week
      treatment period will be structured into 2 age Cohorts; Cohort 1 (Aged greater than or equal
      to [>=] 12 to less than [<] 18 years) and Cohort 2 (Children Aged >= 6 to < 12 years). The
      trial is designed to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (based on
      intensive PK analysis) and the short-term safety and antiviral activity of rilpivirine (RPV).
      Participants will receive RPV 25 milligram (mg), or weight-adjusted dose orally once daily
      for 240 weeks when administered in combination with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The trial will also evaluate long-term (48 weeks and 240
      weeks [Cohort 1]) safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in combination with
      the background regimen of 2 NRTIs. Patients safety will be monitored throughout the study and
      during the follow up visits.
