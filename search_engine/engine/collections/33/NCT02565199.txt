      patients practice performing a movement and become better at performing the trained movement
      over time. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which uses magnetism to
      excite neurons near the surface of the brain, may further improve performance. Healthy adults
      made larger training-related improvements in their motor performance when they received rTMS
      over the primary motor cortex during motor training. There is evidence that the premotor
      cortex may be a more effective target than the primary motor cortex for rTMS for some stroke
      survivors. In the current study, the investigator will determine the effect of rTMS over the
      premotor cortex on training-related improvements in motor performance in healthy adults.
