      patients will be enrolled at up to 5 clinical sites in the U.S. Twenty eyes of 20 patients
      will be enrolled which means that only one eye will be treated with study treatment in
      patients who present at Visit 1 with bilateral ME. In situations where both eyes of a patient
      are eligible for the study, the eye with the shorter duration of ME will be the study eye.9
      The investigator will designate the study eye when both eligible eyes have been diagnosed
      with ME at the same time. Potential patients who are interested in participating in the study
      will be provided an informed consent form (ICF) prior to screening. Patient eligibility will
      be assessed at Visit 1 (Day 0), the baseline visit, by spectral SD-OCT and measurement of
      IOP, in addition to review of the patient's medical and ophthalmic history and recent
      concomitant medications history. Study Treatment will be administered on Day 0, Day 4, and
      Day 9 (Visits 1, 2, and 3). Subjects will be scheduled to return to the clinic for
      post-treatment assessments during Visits 4 and 5 (Day 14 and Day 21 or Day 28).
