    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating study of
      Tanibirumab which is a fully human monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR). This study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic cancer
      who are refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic options. Tanibirumab will be
      administered intravenously to such patients over 60 minutes on Day 1, 8, and 15 (subject to
      change pending PK and toxicity data). Each treatment cycle will be a minimum of 28 days in
      length. The dose escalation study employing a 3 + 3 design is designed to identify the RP2D
      which will be based on safety, tolerability and PK of the RP2D. This study is expected to
      enroll a total of approximately 18-24 patients.
