    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the effect on the biological activity, as assessed by prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) response, of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib in patients with D0
           prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To document the safety and feasibility of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib in patients
           with early-stage prostate cancer.

        -  To evaluate the effects of the combination of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib on
           nuclear factor-kB (NFkB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), prostaglandin E2
           (PGE2), and IL6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral atorvastatin calcium once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and after completion of study
      therapy for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
