      tubes with clot-activator. As per routine procedure, samples were centrifuged upon arrival in
      the lab and stored at 4Â° C until measurement. 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were quantitated
      separately. Results from subjects <18 years were excluded from the analysis. The study was
      approved by the local Ethics Committee.
