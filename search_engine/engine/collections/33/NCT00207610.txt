      deficiency advocate selective screening and treatment of anemia at about 6 weeks postpartum.
      However, among some groups, such as low income women, data suggest that anemia and iron
      deficiency are common. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three stategies to
      prevent iron deficiency among low income postpartum women in Mississippi.

      Comparisons: Clinics will be randomized to one of three strategies: 1)Selective anemia
      screening and treatment of anemic women, 2)universal anemia screening and treatment of anemic
      women, or 3)universal iron supplementation of 65 mg a day for three months.
