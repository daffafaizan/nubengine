      parameter of triglycerides. Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of fish oil on
      reducing triglycerides in subjects taking fish oil at similar doses provided in our product
      (see references).

      Additional metabolic parameters will be measured as secondary endpoints, including abdominal
      obesity, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c, skin glycation
      (AGEs), pulse wave velocity, skin carotenoids, serum 25(OH)D concentrations, weight, and LDL
      density, particle size and number. The novel nutritional supplement contains many nutrients
      that have been shown to improve metabolic parameters.
