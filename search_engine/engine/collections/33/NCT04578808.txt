      Previous retrospective studies have suggested that post gadolinium arterial wall enhancement
      (AWE) of unruptured intracranial aneurysms on MR imaging may reflect aneurysm wall
      instability, and hence may highlight a higher risk of UIA growth over time. This multicentric
      prospective cohort aims at exploring vessel wall imaging findings of UIAs with consecutive
      follow-up to substantiate these assumptions.The objective is to develop diagnostic and
      predictive tools for the risk of IA evolution. The aim is to demonstrate in clinical practice
      the predictive value of (AWE) for UIA growth. The growth will be determined by any
      modification of the UIA measurement. Both UIA growth and the UIA wall enhancement will be
      assessed in consensus by two expert neuroradiologists.The French prospective UCAN project is
      a non-interventional international wide and multicentric prospective cohort. UIA of
      bifurcation between 3 and 7 mm for whom a clinical and imaging follow-up without occlusion
      treatment was scheduled by local multidisciplinary staff will be included. Extensive
      clinical, biological and imaging data will be recorded during a 3 years follow-up (visits at
      1 and 3 years after inclusion).
