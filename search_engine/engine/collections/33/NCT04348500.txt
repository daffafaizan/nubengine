      be randomized to receive the anti- IL-6 drug clazakizumab 25mg IV or placebo. Patients will
      be followed for improvements in clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters which are part of
      our COVID-19 lab panel described below. Patients will receive SOC supportive treatment and
      will be followed for 14 days. If a patient from either group progresses to the need for
      mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, or develops clinical signs of deteriorating COVID-19
      disease, and there are no serious treatment related SAEs, at the discretion of the
      investigator or treating physician, the patient may receive a single dose of open-label
      clazakizumab 25mg IV. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and
      this dose of open-label clazakizumab.

      Enrolled patients will receive clazakizumab 25 mg or placebo (0.9% saline) given by IV
      infusion over 30 minutes. Clazakizumab will be administered in 50 mL of 0.9% saline on Day 1.

      COVID-19 lab panel and clinical parameters will be monitored to determine if patients are
      progressing towards need for ventilation and/or ECMO. The parameters below will be monitored
      and patient status will be assessed by the clinical team.

      If patients do develop these criteria, open-label clazakizumab 25 mg IV may be administered
      as discussed above. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and this
      dose of open-label clazakizumab. Patients ventilated with or without ECMO will continue to be
      monitored post-treatment for signs of improvement, (i.e., decreasing FiO2 requirements, CXR
      improvements, CRP reductions, extubation and discharge home) or death.
