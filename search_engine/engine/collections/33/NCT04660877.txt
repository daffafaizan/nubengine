      test the acute blood and muscle response to an ingested amount of either cheddar cheese or
      milk. Approximately, one month after the first experiment (Metabolic Study #1), the
      participant will complete the second experiment (Metabolic Study #2) which was exact in
      design and at the same time of day as the first study but the participant ingested the
      alternate food product. The morning of the metabolic studies, the participant will arrive at
      the clinical research center after a 10h fast. A catheter will be placed in the participants'
      arm for blood sampling. Next, the participant will undergo a fasted thigh skeletal muscle
      biopsy. Following the muscle biopsy, the participant will consume either cheddar cheese (65g)
      or milk (370 mL) each amounting to 20g of protein. Subsequent muscle biopsies will occur at
      60 and 180min after product ingestion. Blood sampling will occur in the fasted state and
      periodically after ingestion of the products (up to 300min).
