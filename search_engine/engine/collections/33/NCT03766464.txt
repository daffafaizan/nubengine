      This prospective clinical study will be performed with adults (20 to 60 years) and elderly (>
      60 years) (WHO-World Health Organization) who will be had undergone PSG at the ISP , a
      private medical outpatients clinic from January to December 2019 to evaluate the influence of
      SB, AB and OSAS on signs and symptoms of TMD. The individuals will be assessed clinically and
      diagnosed for TMD using the "Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders", for SB and
      OSAS using PSG, and AB using the smartphone application. Specific statistical tests will be
      determined after preliminary analysis of the data (Î±= 0.05).
