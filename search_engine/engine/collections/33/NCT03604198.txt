    
      This study is designed to allow continued therapy with relacorilant, a potent, selective
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist in patients who have successfully completed
      participation of a Corcept-sponsored study of relacorilant (referred to as the "parent"
      study). Patients may qualify to enter this extension study if they complete their last
      treatment visit in their parent study and in the Investigator's opinion will benefit from
      continued treatment.

      Once-daily dosing with relacorilant may continue for patients who receive clinical benefits
      (as judged by the Investigator) until relacorilant is commercially or otherwise available or
      the study is stopped by the Sponsor. A patient's dose may be maintained, reduced, or
      increased based on individual response and tolerability.
