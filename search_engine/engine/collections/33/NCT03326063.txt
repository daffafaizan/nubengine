      oral ifetroban in patients with AERD. At the end of the 4-week treatment phase (ifetroban or
      placebo) each subject will undergo a graded oral aspirin desensitization procedure in order
      to initiate high-dose aspirin therapy, which is standard-of-care at our institution and is
      the only available therapy known to modify the course of AERD.
