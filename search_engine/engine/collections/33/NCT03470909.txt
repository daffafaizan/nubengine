      inclusion criteria receive additional biopsies from the remaining skin envelope in order to
      quantify the amount of residual breast tissue.

      Since the investigators will assess, 142 breasts will be investigated. This means a maximum
      of n=142 patients will be included (corresponding to a minimum of n=71 patient).

      On the specimen additional histological sections in radial direction will be performed.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of Skin- Sparing and Nipple-Sparing
      Mastectomy. On each predefined location in the wound cavity the investigators will
      investigate where residual breast tissue (RBT) will be found or not. If no RBT can be
      detected at all predefined breast locations this breast will be classified as having no RBT
      (=RBT negative). If breast tissue can be detected the investigators have a RBT positive
      breast.
