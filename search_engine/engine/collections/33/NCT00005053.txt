      patients with metastatic or inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the
      response rate in this patient population after this treatment. III. Determine the duration of
      objective response in these patients on this treatment. IV. Determine the toxic effects of
      this regimen in these patients. V. Assess the impact of hydration on the toxicity profile of
      this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive glufosfamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Arm II:
      Patients receive glufosfamide as in arm I. Patients are hydrated with excess physiological
      saline solution 4 hours before and for 3 hours after treatment with glufosfamide. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with an objective complete response continue treatment for a maximum of 2 courses
      beyond confirmation of response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients (8-16 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
