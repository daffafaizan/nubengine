    
      Progression of enteral feeding in preterm infants is still controversial. The neonatologist
      needs to provide adequate caloric intake avoiding the risk of food intolerance and
      necrotizing enterocolitis.

      Objective: To establish the safety and effectiveness of fast enteral advancement compared
      with traditional advancement.

      Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial with infants less than 34 weeks and between
      1000 and 2000 grams at birth conducted at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogot√°,
      Colombia.

      Methods: 30 cc versus 20 cc / kg / day advancing in infants between 1000 and 1499g and 40cc
      versus 20 cc / kg / day advancing in infants between 1500 and 1999g.

      Outcomes: days to reach full enteral nutrition, days of parenteral nutrition (PN) and/or
      intravenous fluids (IVF), days to regain birth weight, episodes of food intolerance,
      anthropometric measurements and weight gain at 40 weeks; rate of late onset sepsis,
      hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and mortality. Data will be
      analyzed with Student t test or Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson Chi-square or Fisher test.
      Multiple linear regression will be performed.

      Ethics: This Protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of Pontificia
      Universidad Javeriana and San Ignacio Hospital. Informed consent will be requested to
      parents.
