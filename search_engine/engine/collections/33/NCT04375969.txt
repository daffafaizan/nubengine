        1. To assess the influence of WBC and HIIT on insulin sensitivity and establish the role of
           myokines (irisin and IL-6) in this regulation. To find the answer for the question if
           the rise of mentioned myokines cause a decrease of authophagy protein HMGB1.

        2. To characterize potential effectiveness of these intervention protocols on bone and
           energy metabolisms by stimulating in vitro cultured normal human osteoblastic primary
           cells and Î²-pancreatic cells with sera obtained from patients at different time points
           during treatment.

        3. To establish, which procedure is most effective at improving insulin sensitivity:
           training or training supported with WBC treatment, which factors modify this response
           (body composition or physical capacity of subjects)

        4. To establish if training supported with WBC treatment impairs adaptive changes of
           trained subjects

        5. To determine the potential beneficial effects of the intervention protocols on the
           metabolic homeostasis, and assess how long these changes are maintained over a period of
           four weeks or three months.
