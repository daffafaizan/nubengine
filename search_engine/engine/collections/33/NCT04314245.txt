      assay analyzes the DNA methylation/somatic mutation profiles of bladder cancer-specific
      biomarkers non-invasively using urine specimens collected before invasive
      diagnosis/treatment. The performance characteristics(sensitivity and specificity) of the
      assay for detection of urothelial carcinoma is evaluated in comparison to pathology or
      cystoscopy.
