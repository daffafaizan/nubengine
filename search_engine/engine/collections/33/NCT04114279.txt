      a laparoscopic DA repair, as well as a video of a laparoscopic DA repair prior to testing the
      simulator. On the day of testing, they will also be given an opportunity to practice on the
      DA simulator. A pretesting survey will be completed to gather demographic information,
      surgical experience and self-reported comfort level at performing a laparoscopic DA repair.
      The survey responses will be used to stratify participants into experts (pediatric surgeons
      with ≥3 laparoscopic DA repairs and/or ≥5 advanced pediatric MIS procedures), intermediates
      (pediatric surgeons with <3 thoracoscopic TEF/EA repair or laparoscopic DA repairs and/or <5
      advanced Pediatric MIS procedures) and novices (general surgeons or trainees without advanced
      Pediatric MIS experience) for analysis of results.

      Participants will then be asked to perform a laparoscopic DA repair on the simulator. Their
      performance will be video recorded. Recordings include only the surgery being performed in
      the simulator, as a result there will be no identifying information in the recordings. Time
      to completion will be recorded. Two independent assessors will score the participants
      performance using the objective structured assessment tool (OSAT) global rating scale (GRS)
      and a task specific checklist. The repaired DA samples will be blinded and assessed for
      quality of anastomosis by scoring for completeness, patency, suture density, % of square
      knots, and leak pressures (see appendix 3).

      Upon completion of the simulator testing a post-procedure survey will be completed by
      participants regarding their experience and to provide feedback on simulator.
