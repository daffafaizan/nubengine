      arginine, zinc and vitamin C on collagen type I synthesis in patients undergoing inguinal
      hernia repair.

      The patients in the intervention group are given 55 mg zinc, 1251 mg vitamin C, and 15 g
      arginine once daily 14 days pre-operatively and post-operatively. Both groups receive high
      quality protein (1.5 g protein/kg body weight) daily during the same period. Hernia repair is
      done using the Lichtenstein technique. Drainage tubes are placed in the wound during the
      surgery. Epidermal wounds (10 mm) are made via the suction blister method on the ventral
      forearm of the patients on the day of surgery. Blood samples are drawn at day -14, day 0, day
      1 and day 2. The surgical drain is emptied and fluid collected at day 1 and day 2.The healing
      of the suction blisters is assessed by clinical criteria until healing.
