      Sleep apnea is potentially a life-threatening disorder commonly associated with the aging
      process. Often sleep apnea is accompanied by considerable morbidity for both physical and
      mental health; the associated excessive daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular abnormalities, and
      cognitive impairment impact greatly on daytime functioning. In 1990, the prevalence of sleep
      apnea in the general population was undetermined, and there was much speculation regarding
      its natural history.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      For the prevalence study, 4,364 randomly-sampled men selected from the general population and
      stratified by age were evaluated for risk factors for sleep apnea. A total of 741 men found
      to be at risk were evaluated in the sleep laboratory to determine the degree, if any, of
      sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing. Prior to recording subjects in the sleep
      laboratory, a thorough history was obtained from each subject and a physical examination
      completed. All men entering into the first four years of the prevalence portion of the study
      who were found to have sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing were reevaluated yearly over
      a five year period in the natural history part of the study. The natural history portion also
      included 150 men previously studied in the sleep laboratory for apnea but who were not part
      of the random sample of 4,000 and who were not part of the prevalence study.
