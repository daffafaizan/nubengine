      AL-78898A or a sham injection. The study eye was assessed before and after each injection to
      ensure that the injection procedure and/or study medication had not endangered the health of
      the eye. The Investigator determined each month whether the patient was eligible to receive
      the next injection. The study was terminated due to a high likelihood that continued
      enrollment would reach the predefined study stopping criteria based upon the number of
      patients with drug deposit formation, which made an assessment of efficacy futile.
