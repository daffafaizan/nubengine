    
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, flexible dose
      titration, add-on study. Male or female subjects aged 18-70 years suffering from Major
      Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV, with a HAMD-17 score greater than 21 and a
      CGI-Severity of Illness score greater or equal to 4, will be started on open labeled
      citalopram treatment. The dose of citalopram may be increased form 20mg to 40mg over a six
      week period, depending on investigator assessment of tolerability and efficacy. At the end of
      this treatment, subjects with a HAMD-17 score greater or equal to 14 and a CGI-Severity of
      Illness score greater or equal to 4 will be considered as partial or non-responders and will
      be entered into the double blind phase of the study. Subjects will be randomized to either
      mecamylamine or placebo for a further 8 weeks. Citalopram medication will remain constant
      while mecamylamine (or placebo) can be increased from 5.0 to 7.5 to 10.0mg based on
      investigator assessment of tolerability and efficacy.

      Plasma samples for citalopram assay will be collected at the start and end of the double
      blind phase to exclude any mecamylamine effect being due to a drug:drug interaction.

      Approximately 500 subjects will be entered into the open-label phase of the study and
      approximately 160 into the double blind phase. The study will be conducted in India and the
      USA.
