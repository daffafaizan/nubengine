      seizures. However, there is no consensus on the appropriate duration of prophylaxis with this
      anticonvulsant postpartum.The objective of the present study is to compare effectiveness of
      12 hours of magnesium sulfate versus 24 hours (standard treatment) in stable patients with
      preeclampsia.
