      condition. The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next
      morning were given orally one tablet of the test drug (Lisinopril 10 mg, produced by PT Dexa
      Medica) or one tablet of the reference drug (ZestrilÂ® 10 mg, PT Boehringer Ingelheim
      Indonesia, Indonesia, under license from Astra Zeneca UK Ltd.).

      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after drug administration. Seven days after the
      first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate
      drug.

      The pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, t max, and t1/2, were
      determined from plasma concentrations of lisinopril, using liquid chromatography with tandem
      mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) method.
