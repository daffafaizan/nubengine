    
      By employing long-term electrocardiographic monitoring, this study plans to determine:

        1. the frequency and types of cardiac arrhythmias that occur in patients with uncontrolled
           seizures and

        2. whether these are increased above the general population in the same age group.

      The specific aims:

        1. Identify the types, frequency, and duration of cardiac arrhythmias that occur in
           patients with refractory epilepsy and compare these data to available normative data.

        2. Correlate abnormal heart rates and rhythms to specific clinical data:

             1. seizure type,

             2. seizure frequency,

             3. probable location of seizure onset in the brain, when such data are available,

             4. duration of seizures, and

             5. type(s) and number of anticonvulsant medications being used.

        3. Correlate cardiac arrhythmias to clinical symptoms
