      visual, and auditory feedback in order to inform you on desired movement changes. This will
      take place at the Human Performance Laboratory at Stanford University. Motion analysis will
      be done while you perform movement activities (such as locomotion).

      Prior to performing these movement tasks the investigators will attach reflective markers to
      your body using tape, pre-wrap and/or ace bandages. The investigators will record motion of
      your body's movements using infrared cameras which capture anatomical data from the
      reflective markers on your body.

      The investigators will provide you with feedback to inform you of desired movement
      modifications. Haptic feedback devices such as vibration motors and skin stretch devices will
      be attached to your body via velcro straps and will be used to give "touch" feedback. There
      will be a computer monitor in front of you during testing to provide visual feedback. Sounds
      will be played using speakers near the testing area to provide auditory feedback.

      The time needed for set up and performance of the above set of tests is approximately 90
      minutes. You will be performing walking and other movements for only a small part of that
      time. The rest of the time will be spent preparing you for the experiment. After the
      investigators examine your movement data, if some of the data appear inaccurate or the
      investigators are unable to process the data, the investigators may ask you to repeat the
      movement analysis at a later time.
