      with negative clinical outcomes. Critically ill patients may lose about 25% of their skeletal
      muscle mass within 7 days of admission to the intensive care unit. Besides increased protein
      catabolism, other factors inherent to the ICU environment contribute to muscle loss,
      including patient immobility and interruptions in nutrient delivery. This combination of
      factors is especially debilitating in patients with preexisting low muscle stores due to
      sarcopenia, chronic illness, or malnutrition. Although preservation of skeletal muscle mass
      is important for recovery in critically ill patients, the mechanism of muscle wasting is not
      unknown. Muscle wasting is a multifactorial process and it may be the consequence of several
      events, including oxidative stress, inflammatory conditions and muscle remodeling. Omega-3
      fatty acids with their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anabolic effects can be a key
      factor for an effective treatment.
