      "do you feel you have a urinary tract infection". All participants will provide baseline
      urine specimens obtained by transurethral catheter (to avoid vulvo-vaginal contamination) and
      will complete a UTISA questionnaire to assess their current urinary tract symptoms.
      Participants will be randomized to the SUC treatment algorithm or the EQUC treatment
      algorithm. Treating physicians will receive either the SUC results or the EQUC results from
      the clinical laboratory and the results will be part of their clinical record. Treating
      physicians will follow the Loyola FPMRS treatment algorithm. Women in the study will also
      give consent for us to contact them using email, text messaging or phone call within 7-10
      days after "treatment plan" has been implemented. The treatment plan options will include no
      treatment if the culture results show no pathogenic bacteria. All participants will be
      queried 7-10 days after their treatment plan (by email or text) "do you feel you continue to
      have a urinary tract infection". Women who respond "yes' will be asked to return for a second
      urine specimen which is our standard protocol. The second urine specimen will be analyzed
      using EQUC culture techniques only. Again, a treatment plan will be developed by the
      attending physician and the patient participant will be queried 7-10 days after the plan is
      implemented.
