      which led to a re-assessment of the strategic goals of the PF-04856884 program. The study
      enrolled the Phase 1b portion only. Subsequently, on 25-Oct-2012, due to data safety signals
      in a separate clinical trial with PF-04856884 (CVX-060), all PF-04856884 studies were
      discontinued and ongoing patients on B1131001 were permitted to remain on study at a reduced
      PF-04856884 dose if determined to have been deriving clinical benefit.
