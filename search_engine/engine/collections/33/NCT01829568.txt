      I. To determine the recommended phase II doses of ibrutinib and lenalidomide for combination
      with rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and its major metabolite (PCI-45227) when
      combined with lenalidomide and rituximab.

      II. To determine the pharmacodynamics of basophil activation and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)
      occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over a 24-hour period of ibrutinib
      when given in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide and ibrutinib.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ibrutinib PO QD on
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and once weekly at weeks 13, 21, 29, and 37.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 8 years or every 6 months or annually for 10 years.
