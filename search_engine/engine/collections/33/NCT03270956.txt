    
      NKA is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells obtained from each individual
      subject's kidney biopsy.

      All subjects enrolled will receive NKA. Subjects will receive their first NKA injection as
      soon as the NKA product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. After 6 months (+4
      weeks), a second injection will be given, as appropriate. Each subject's baseline rate of
      renal decline, based on adequate historical clinical data obtained 24 months prior to
      screening visit, will serve as a comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal
      insufficiency over time.

      The rate of progression of renal insufficiency (assessed via serial measurements of eGFR
      through 24 months after the last NKA injection) will be compared against the individual
      subject's rate of eGFR decline through 24 months following the final NKA treatment. The rate
      of progression of renal insufficiency from subjects (if any) who received a single NKA
      injection may be compared against that from subjects who received two NKA injections.
