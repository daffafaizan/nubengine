      continuously bio-monitored at baseline (1-7 days prior to treatment initiation) and during
      induction chemotherapy up to completion of 6 cycles using the Garmin Vivofit wearable device.
      For those patients continuing with ASCT, patients will be bio-monitored up to 90 days post
      ASCT. The study will include a total of 40 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma participants in
      two cohorts with 20 patients in each cohort (Cohort A and B). Cohort A will be comprised of
      patients <65 years. Cohort B will be comprised of patients >/= 65 years.
