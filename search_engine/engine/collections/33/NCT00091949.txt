      ischemic stroke, subsequent stroke and heart attack are major causes of death and disability.
      Within 4 years of the initial TIA or ischemic stroke, 16 percent of patients will have a
      recurrent stroke and 9 percent will have a heart attack. Prevention of further vascular
      events, therefore, is critically important to the health of patients with stroke.

      The IRIS trial will test a new treatment strategy based on evidence linking insulin
      resistance to increased risk for stroke and other vascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a
      condition in which insulin, a normal human hormone, does not work effectively because the
      body is resistant to its effects. This condition can lead to diabetes and is thought to cause
      blood vessel disease, including stroke and heart attack, in patients with and without
      diabetes.

      Insulin resistance affects up to 50% of stroke patients and is effectively modified with
      thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. In addition to reducing insulin
      resistance, these drugs have other favorable effects on blood vessels, reduce blood vessel
      inflammation, and potentially prevent atherosclerosis. Currently marketed TZDs include
      rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.

      The IRIS is a clinical trial that will enroll 3936 subjects at approximately 170 hospitals in
      Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the US. After an
      initial screening blood test, each participant will be randomly assigned to take either
      pioglitazone or placebo tablets. Recruitment will be completed during 2005-2012, and all
      participants will be followed for a minimum of 3 years.
