    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether the cellular and viral micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) changes in plasma
      and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMNCs) correlate with the diagnosis and outcome of
      sepsis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To distinguish systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without infection from
      sepsis and septic shock.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (before surgery), the day
      after surgery, either the day of hospital discharge or the day of sepsis diagnosis, and 6
      days after the baseline blood draw if still hospitalized.

      GROUP B: Patients undergo blood specimen collection at baseline (day of sepsis diagnosis),
      the day after baseline, and on day 7 from baseline if still hospitalized.
