      increased rates of graft failure due to acute rejection in the short term and chronic
      rejection, or coronary vasculopathy in the longterm. Many studies in renal, pancreas and lung
      transplantation suggest favorable outcomes when HLA matching occurs and unfavorable outcomes
      when HLA mismatching occurs and circulating donor-specific antibodies are produced.

      However, in heart transplantation this association is less clear. Advances in recognition and
      identification of HLA antibodies have resulted in more specific information regarding HLA
      mismatching and outcomes. This study is aimed at analyzing outcomes in pediatric heart
      transplant based on recipient-donor HLA incompatibility and the post-transplant production of
      donor-specific HLA antibodies.

      Hypothesis:

        1. HLA systems' genes class I & II matching results in a survival/rejection benefit in
           pediatric heart transplant recipients.

        2. Mismatched transplants with donor-specific HLA antibodies have decreased overall
           survival.

      A Multivariate Analysis of data will be performed by both Emory and Children's investigators
      and research support staff.
