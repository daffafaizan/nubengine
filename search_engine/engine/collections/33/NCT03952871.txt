      output by non-invasive supra sternal ultrasound and the measurements performed by invasive
      monitoring (trans pulmonary thermodilution or right heart catheterization) in intensive care
      patients already equipped with an invasive monitoring. Cross sectional study was performed in
      Reims university hospital. Patients who will be included in this study are patients who
      already have an invasive cardiac output monitoring such as trans pulmonary thermodilution or
      right heart catheterization for many reason as septic shock, cardiogenic shock or any shock
      state. Cardiac output will be measured by supra-sternal and transthoracic echography and by
      invasive monitoring (trans pulmonary thermodilution or right heart catheterization).
      Intra-class correlation coefficient will be calculated to assess the concordance between the
      measurement of cardiac blood flow by non-invasive supra sternal ultrasound and the
      measurements performed by invasive monitoring.
