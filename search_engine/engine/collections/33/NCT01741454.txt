      added benefits in ameliorating stent-related symptoms in participants who have had unilateral
      placement of a ureteral stent for urolithiasis. This objective will be assessed by
      determining the mean difference in the urinary symptom index domain of the Urinary Stent
      Symptom Questionnaire, which is a validated tool used to assess stent symptoms. The
      investigators suggest that a 15% further decrease in the index score in the experimental
      group, compared to the control group would represent a clinically significant improvement in
      urinary symptoms, based on the prior studies evaluating lower urinary tract symptoms in
      patients with stents. The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with Tamsulosin
      and Tolterodine ER will yield greater symptom relief than tamsulosin alone.

      Initially, a 7-day design (medical starts 7 days before stent insertion) was conducted to
      determine whether combination therapy with Tolterodine ER and Tamsulosin is more effective
      than monotherapy with tamsulosin alone in reducing stent symptoms.

      Previous studies showed that tolterodine ER therapy significantly reduces urinary symptoms by
      week 4 of medication therapy. Given the evidence that tolterodine ER requires a longer
      duration to have maximum benefit, in the second phase, investigators increased the duration
      of medication to start 2 weeks prior to surgery and continued for 7 days after surgery, for a
      total of 21 days of medication, to test whether combination therapy is more effective than
      monotherapy in reducing stent symptoms
