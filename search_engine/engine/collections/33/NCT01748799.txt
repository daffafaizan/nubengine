      self-titrated dosages of SATIVEX® (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol /cannabidiol combination in a
      buccal spray) on withdrawal from cannabis and craving among cannabis dependent subjects.
      Subjects in this study will undergo an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
      Subjects will be regular cannabis-users who are not currently seeking treatment for cannabis
      dependence. Subjects will participate in each of 8 conditions, lasting 5 weekdays each (an
      ABACADAE study design); four smoke as usual conditions (SAU) and four cannabis abstinence
      conditions. During each abstinence condition (B, C, D, E conditions), subjects will be
      allocated to one condition including self-titration of placebo, fixed dose of placebo,
      self-titration of SATIVEX (up to a max of 40 sprays per day, equal to 108mg THC) or fixed
      dose of SATIVEX (40 sprays per day). Each medication phase will be followed by a washout
      period where individuals will be requested to smoke cannabis as usual (A condition). The
      experimental conditions will be: type of SATIVEX® spray used (active vs placebo), and
      titration regimen (fixed or self-titrated). This pilot study will allow us to demonstrate the
      feasibility of our approach and to determine the sample size to use secondarily for a larger
      study. Our ultimate goal is to determine optimal conditions to use for a subsequent
      randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of SATIVEX® in treatment of Cannabis
      dependence among treatment-seeking subjects.
