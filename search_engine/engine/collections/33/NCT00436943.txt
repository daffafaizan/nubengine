      smoking status assessment data sheet in routine consults. This is a quality improvement study
      design to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a more formal smoking status
      evaluation in a resident/faculty driven outpatient clinic. This will be an observational
      study in which differences in quality measures will be compared between baseline and
      re-measurement periods. Population target: 900 patients screened before and after the
      implementation of the QI intervention. Primary outcome: smoking status evaluation. Secondary
      Outcome: number of patients advised to quit, plan implementation for smoking cessation,
      smoking cessation program referrals, number of NRT and bupropion prescription.
