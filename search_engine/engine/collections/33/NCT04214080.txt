      trainings and communication studies are used in addition to Neurodevelopment treatment
      approach in the treatment of children with CP. Because of their impact on postural control,
      neck-trunk stabilization exercises are very important for therapeutic interventions designed
      to improve quality of life with activities of daily living.

      As the increases in neck muscle strength are related to trunk stabilization, trunk
      stabilization exercises are thought to have positive effects on neck muscle strength. In
      addition, since the neck and trunk are complementary to each other, it is supported by the
      literature that neck stabilization exercises and trunk stabilization exercises should be
      applied together.
