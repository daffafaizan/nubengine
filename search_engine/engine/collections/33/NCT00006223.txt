        -  Compare the failure-free survival and overall survival in patients with acute myeloid
           leukemia in complete remission treated with maintenance flt3 ligand vs observation
           alone.

        -  Compare the long-term immunologic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the long-term safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to complete remission
      (CR) (first vs second vs third or subsequent) and post-remission therapy (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive flt3 ligand subcutaneously daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Patients begin treatment or observation
           within 4 weeks after documentation of CR after induction therapy or within 4 weeks after
           discharge from hospital after post-remission therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 139 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 28 months.
