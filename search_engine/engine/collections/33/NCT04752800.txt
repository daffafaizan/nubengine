      between subjects, where some stroke patients may not receive any additional benefits from
      therapy. Thus, it is necessary to use a biomarker that manages to elect those who will
      possibly benefit from the electric current. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
      investigate whether the EEG measures of functional connectivity of the target network of the
      stimulation are associated with the response to ipsilesional anodic ETCC in patients with
      stroke in the late subacute phase. as well as to observe if these findings can be associated
      with a clinical improvement of the patient. For that, a randomized, double-blind,
      sham-controlled clinical trial will be carried out with 60 people with stroke, recruited at a
      referral hospital in jo√£o Pessoa.

      After recruitment they will be randomized into two groups: Group 1 - active stimulation and
      group - 2 sham stimulation. Participants will receive 10 sessions of ETCC, for 20 minutes, on
      alternate days (3 times a week), where the electrodes will be positioned over the primary
      motor cortex. 3 minutes of EEG at rest will be taken from each participant, and they will be
      instructed not to be actively involved in any cognitive or mental activity. In the first and
      last meetings, evaluations will be carried out, the outcomes assessed will be: motor
      function, quality of life and functional connectivity.
