      in cerebral blood flow safely, without generating adverse effects unknown to the technique.

      Our specific objectives:

        1. Perform tolerability and safety tests of magnetic stimulation on the facial nerve.

        2. Establish the optimal stimulation threshold associated with tolerability in order to
           apply it to the final design of the Magnetic Stimulation (MS) system.

        3. Measure whether the threshold found shows any increase in cerebral perfusion in the
           subject with respect to their baseline.
