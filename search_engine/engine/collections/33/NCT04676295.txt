      Power calculations were performed in order to detect 5.5 mmHg reduction in maternal systolic
      blood pressure with a power of 80% and a 2-sided p-value of 0.05 for the difference between
      the groups (intervention and control PE) (NICE 2011). Accounting for a 20% loss to follow-up
      or missing data, a sample of 148 women in the PE intervention group and 148 women in the PE
      control group is needed.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To assess cardiovascular health and CVD progression in families (mother, child and
           father) 8-12 years following a PE pregnancy compared with non-PE control families.

        2. To assess the effectiveness of a behavioral 12-month lifestyle intervention in mothers
           and their children 8-12 years following a PE pregnancy to lower blood pressure and
           improve their CVD risk profile overall.

        3. To assess the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention on the awareness of CVD risk
           after a PE pregnancy.
