      receiving stretches only, the addition of 30-45 min of progressive resistance training during
      the hemodialysis session will counteract the burden of renal disease and will result in:

        1. A feasible and safe exercise modality for ESRD patients.

        2. Will contribute to improved nutritional status and reduced systemic inflammation

        3. Will result in improved quality of life
