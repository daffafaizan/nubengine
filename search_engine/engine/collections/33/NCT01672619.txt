      of a curved surface as well as the skullcap. If you do not receive fixation, however, trace
      the helicoid of the bone osteotomy can turn on a spring that can expand or contract depending
      on the direction of the force that is received. This form of osteotomy was therefore chosen
      by the authors to induce bone compliance areas of secondary defect that should expand or
      compress indirectly during the process of dynamic remodeling of primary defect with springs.
