      constipation, few clinical trails have evaluated its efficiency. In the majority of prior
      studies only the effect of a single type of fiber was evaluated. Each type of fiber presents
      a particular characteristic, which determines its action mechanism and performance in
      different parts of the colon. Therefore, theoretically, greater effectiveness could well be
      observed when different types of fibers are associated into a single product for fiber
      supplementation.

      A randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled was performed to evaluate the effect of a
      dietary fiber mixture in constipated pediatric patients.

      Children aged between 4 and 12 years were included in the study and the initial diagnosis of
      functional chronic constipation was made in accordance with the Rome III criteria. The
      children having attended the Pediatric Gastroenterology Ambulatory of the Federal University
      of Sao Paulo and the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia hospital in Sao Paulo city. All of the
      children were undergoing constipation maintenance treatment with the use of a laxative in a
      dosage less than 1.0 ml/Kg for milk of magnesia, mineral oil or lactulose or less than 0.5
      g/Kg for polyethylene glycol 3350.
