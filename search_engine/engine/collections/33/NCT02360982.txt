      arthroplasty and femur fracture surgery were enrolled into the study. Patients were allocated
      into two groups to receive regional anesthesia (group R, n=50) or general anesthesia (group
      G, n=70). Hemodynamic and blood parameters, potential risk factors of delirium including age,
      sex, duration of surgery, the type of anesthesia, coexisting disease, smoking and amount of
      drug used delirium tests (CAM and DRS-R-98), hospital stay and costs were recorded for all
      patients.
