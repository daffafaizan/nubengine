    
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the indicated treatment for many
      life-threatening illnesses affecting both adults and children. Transplant recovery and late
      effects require long-term medical care. At the same time that the family faces a medical
      crisis, a resulting financial crisis may also be pending, but is often pushed to the
      background due to the necessity of first preserving life. A large proportion of patients
      undergoing HSCT incur significant financial burden from out-of-pocket costs and a decrease in
      household income. Predetermined variables, both medical and demographic, gathered at the
      pre-transplant clinical consultation have the potential to predict the patients at greatest
      financial risk. This study will describe both the out-of-pocket costs and the income changes
      that may result from HSCT to help patients and their caregivers have a clearer picture of
      these costs and develop a financial plan. Health care providers can utilize this information
      to better inform patients and connect them to resources.
