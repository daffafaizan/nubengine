      and maximum tolerated/ recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of MVC-101. Dose escalation will
      occur in a 1+3 and then 3+3 design in patients with advanced solid tumors. Once the MTD/RP2D
      is determined, a Cohort Expansion Phase will be enrolled to further characterize safety and
      initial anti-tumor activity in patients with HNSCC, CRC or NSCLC.
