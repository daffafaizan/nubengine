      predicting Overall Survival (OS) after esophagectomy for cancer. Furthermore we believe in a
      more devastating impact on OS from underweight and not from overweight.

      By preoperatively identifying risk patients for poorer OS, especially the non-tumoral deaths,
      this can be a tool to tailor postoperative nutritional strategies to counter further weight
      loss and bringing postoperative weight to normal ranges.
