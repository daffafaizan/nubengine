    
      This is an open label, single arm Phase II trial that will examine how safe and effective it
      will be for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to discontinued first line tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

      The main goal of this study is to determine the potential role of dasatinib (the study drug)
      in helping patients with CML attain a sustained treatment free remission.

      During this study the safety and tolerability of Dasatinib will be evaluated by means of drug
      related toxicity, adverse event reports, physical examinations and laboratory safety
      evaluations.

      The study period for an individual patient is expected to be approximately between 30-72
      months.

      A total of 135 patients will be recruited from 10 Canadian centres.
