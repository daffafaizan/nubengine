      absent or dysfunctional protein called CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which
      functions as a chloride channel. Lubiprostone is a medication indicated for constipation that
      activates type 2 chloride channels (ClC-2) and has the potential to be an effective treatment
      for constipation in adults with CF. It has the potential to correct the underlying disorder
      by utilizing a chloride channel whose activity does not depend on CFTR. This project is a
      prospective open-label pilot study to examine the safety and effectiveness of lubiprostone
      when used in adults with CF with constipation. The specific aims are as follows: 1) Determine
      the effectiveness of lubiprostone for constipation in participants with CF, and 2) Determine
      the short term safety of lubiprostone in adults with CF. Data will also be collected to
      generate further information about the effect of lubiprostone on nutritional status.
