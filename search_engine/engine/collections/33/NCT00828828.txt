      noncaseating granuloma[1]. T helper cells response is exaggerated at the site of disease and
      cellular immunity depressed in peripheral blood[2]. Cutaneous anergy, lymphopenia and
      inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio in peripheral blood suggest T helper cells involvement[3].

      The action of humeral immune system in sarcoidosis is a matter of controversy. Standard
      hepatitis B virus vaccination did not provoke protective antibody titer in patients with
      sarcoidosis[3]. Although antibody response against influenza vaccine in patients with
      sarcoidosis is not well described, this vaccine is highly recommended in patients with
      chronic pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD and fibrosis [4, 5, 6]. In this study we aim
      to evaluate the humeral response to the influenza vaccine in sarcoidosis patients and assess
      vaccine safety.
