      surgeries. The goal of our randomized, prospective, multicentric, internet-based study is to
      compare rate of SSI after surgery of colon and rectum by using triclosan-coated suture for
      abdominal wall closure. Two arms are separeted by computer randomization at abdomial wall
      closure: application of triclosan-coated and non-coated PDS suture (PDS vs. PDS-Plus).
      Triclosan is an antiseptic materia which we hope provides better local infection control at
      the site with reducing the risk of bacterial colonisation.
