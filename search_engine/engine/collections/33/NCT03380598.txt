      routine (control group) or to usual care plus a web-based support system (intervention
      group). The system is based on a smartphone application connected to a scale and an activity
      measuring wrist-band. Data is automatically transferred from the accessories to the
      smartphone, where data is presented graphically. The data is transferred to the clinic for
      support. The system is developed for communication between the clinic and family. The
      randomization was done at the start of individual treatment and lasted for 6 months.
      Investigators studied the families and health care professional's experience of using the
      web-based support system as well as changes in BMI standard deviation score in the control
      and intervention group.
