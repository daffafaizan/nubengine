    
      The objective of this first-in-man study is to confirm the performance and safety of the
      CARLO® robotic surgery device (manufactured by Advanced Osteotomy Tools SA) for the execution
      of preoperatively planned midface osteotomies.

      The study is designed and powered to confirm, in clinical use across multiple sites, that the
      CARLO® device can be used to accurately perform straight-line mid-face osteotomies according
      to preoperative plans, and with results and a safety profile that are comparable to current
      state-of-the-art osteotomy methods. Multiple risk mitigations are in place to ensure safety,
      especially for the initially enrolled patients.

      A postoperative follow-up of up to 28 days will be included in this study, in order to assess
      initial soft tissue healing and recovery, and to enable the identification of any soft-tissue
      injuries that would not have been immediately apparent.

      After end of study of each individual patient, safety monitoring will go on for the duration
      of the study until the last visit of the last patient.
