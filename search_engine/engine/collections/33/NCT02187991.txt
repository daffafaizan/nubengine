      paclitaxel therapy in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer and highly proliferative
      ER+ and HER2- breast cancer is based on the unmet clinical need for effective strategies to
      prevent or delay resistance to taxane therapy in the metastatic setting. Synergistic or
      additive effects have been observed in breast cancer xenograft models which involved
      alisertib added to either paclitaxel or docetaxel. Alisertib inhibited the Pgp-mediated
      efflux of paclitaxel in a cell culture model. In addition, Aurora Kinase A is frequently
      overexpressed in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and expression levels have been shown
      to be prognostic in both of these breast cancer subtypes. The combination of alisertib with
      paclitaxel has also been investigated in a Phase 1 study in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic ovarian and breast cancers, with preliminary evidence of activity in both tumor
      types including 6 PRs (partial response) and 3 SD (stable disease) in 11 patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.
