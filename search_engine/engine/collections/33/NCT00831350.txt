      occlusion, wet age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. The role of the
      vitreous or composition of the vitreous cavity has been examined in diabetic retinopathy on
      many occasions in the past and clinically it has been felt that a posterior vitreous
      separation leads a quieting and involution of diabetic retinopathy, both proliferative as
      well as pre-proliferative retinopathy. This clinical observation has never had any basic
      science data to support it. However, it has recently been shown that in cat eyes with
      posterior vitreous separation the vitreous cavity has a much lower VEGF concentration than in
      cat eyes with an attached posterior vitreous. This may be due to the fact that flow of oxygen
      from the retinal vasculature is increased by PVD. Vitreous oxygen levels are inversely
      associated with vitreous VEGF levels. As oxygen tension increases, VEGF levels will decline.
      This suggests if higher amounts of VEGF are present in the eye without PVD perhaps a powerful
      anti-VEGF drug, such as ranibizumab, may be of greater benefit to treat VEGF dependent
      retinovascular disease. To try and answer this question clinically, we have suggested that an
      analysis of the vitreous status in treatment naive eyes with retinal vein occlusion beginning
      ranibizumab therapy be undertaken to see if eyes without a posterior vitreous separation
      would achieve greater improvement in vision and a return to more normal retinal physiology
      compared to eyes with a posterior vitreous separation. No study has assessed PVDs in RVO
      patients receiving potential treatment.
