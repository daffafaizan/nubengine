    
      Objective.- To determine the safety and efficacy of orally delivered 4-aminopyridine for
      motor weakness due to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) under a FDA approved protocol (IND No:
      58,029).

      Setting.- Tertiary care outpatient rehabilitation center directly attached to a university
      hospital.

      Subjects.- Subjects who are unable to ambulate more than 200 feet without assistive devices
      and have residual nonprogressive motor weakness due to GBS more than one year out from the
      initial episode.

      Design.- Subjects will be randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over
      design, which had two eight-week treatment arms with a three-week washout. The average dosage
      at 4 weeks will be 30 milligrams (mg) per day.

      Patients who demonstrate improvement will be continued on the medication for an additional
      three months. Assessments will be performed every two weeks during the randomized trial and
      every month for those continued for up to three months on the medication.
