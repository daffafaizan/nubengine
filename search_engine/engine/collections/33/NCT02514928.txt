      pancreatic head cancer, celiac and SMA nerve plexus are often involved. Many surgeons started
      to improve the surgical approach of pancreatoduodenectomy by extending the extent of surgical
      resection including an extended lymph node dissection and nerve plexus clearance in the hope
      of achieving better long-term survival rate. Postoperative complications such as diarrhea and
      malnutrition were reported after celiac and SMA nerve plexus resection during
      pancreatoduodenectomy. As a result, resection of the nerve plexus on the right half of celiac
      and SMA associated with extended pancreatoduodenectomy was recommended. This study is
      performed to confirm whether resection of the nerve plexus on the right half of celiac and
      SMA associated with extended pancreatoduodenectomy could improve survival and relieve pain of
      pancreatic cancer patients.

      Subjects undergoing surgery will be randomized to extended pancreatoduodenectomy with
      resection of the nerve plexus on the right half of celiac and SMA versus standard
      pancreatoduodenectomy. Subjects will be followed every two months for survivorship or death
      to assess pain, quality of life measures, and narcotic pain control usage. The primary
      endpoint of overall survival and the secondary endpoint of disease-specific free survival
      will be determined at two year post surgery.
