      the Roy Adaptation Model (RAM) for improving MI patients' self-efficacy, quality of life and
      lifestyle adaptation.

      Methods: In this parallel randomized controlled trial (n = 33/group), the control group
      received routine care, while the intervention group received a telephone follow-up
      intervention, which consisted of a pre-discharge education program and three telephone
      follow-up sessions based on the RAM. Data were collected before discharge, and in the 12th
      week after discharge included quality of life, coping adaptation process, self-efficacy and
      lifestyle changes.
