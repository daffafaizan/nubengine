      arthroplasty will help in many different areas of medicine. Gabapentin is one pain control
      modality that has been used by many different orthopaedic surgeons with excellent
      retrospective results. Gabapentin, however, has never been studied, to the investigators
      knowledge, in a prospective randomized fashion in the United States for total knee
      arthroplasty. This study will be the first of its kind to truly compare the effects of
      gabapentin, a drug that has been proven safe in many other areas of medicine, with placebo
      for total knee arthroplasty by analyzing post-operative narcotic usage, function and sleep
      quality.
