    
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, superiority and parallel controlled clinical study.
      Third-party institutions will generate random codes according to random numbers of the
      software and divide them into two groups (Compound Azintamide Enteric-coated Tablets Group,
      Oryz-aspergillus Enzyme and Pancreatin Tablet and Ursodeoxycholic Acid Tablets Group) in a
      ratio of 1:1. Random numbers will be sealed and stored in radiopaque envelopes, which will be
      managed by a designated person not involved in the specific study.

      Specific intervention measures: If dyspeptic symptoms occur after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy and are randomized, the experimental group takes Compound Azintamide
      Enteric-coated Tablets, and the control group takes Oryz-aspergillus Enzyme both Pancreatin
      Tablet and Ursodeoxycholic Acid Tablets. They were registered before medication and on days
      14 and 28 after medication, and gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed at each follow-up
      visit
