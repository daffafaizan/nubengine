    
      This is a multicenter observational study evaluating the incidence and severity of
      neurocognitive impairment in adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19. All study
      participants will be assessed by clinical and neurological examination as well as
      comprehensive laboratory tests using biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury at study day 1 (day of
      study inclusion), day 3, day 7 and day of hospital discharge. A panel of biomarkers (among
      others NSE, S100B and neurofilament proteins) will be measured. Clinical assessment will be
      performed using validated delirium tests (among others CAM-ICU, ICDSC) and scales to assess
      the neurocognitive performance of study participants before and three months after study
      inclusion (among others Short Blessed Test).

      A group of patients with a comparable severity of disease but without the detection of
      SARS-Cov-2 will serve as control group and will undergo the same clinical and laboratory
      examinations.

      We hypothesize, that:

        -  patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop delirium and neurocognitive impairment
           than patients without COVID-19

        -  patients with a preexisting neurocognitive deficit are more vulnerable to neurocognitive
           impairment in the course of COVID-19 than patients without a preexisting neurocognitive
           deficit

        -  Specific biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury correlate with the clinical severity of acute
           neurocognitive impairment and can predict the 3-month neurocognitive outcome of patients
           with COVID-19
