      are working with COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, operating theaters, wards and
      emergency department. In the care of those patients different workgroups are involved:
      anesthesiologists, anesthesia and ICU nurses and respiratory therapeuts.There is insufficient
      data on the seroprevalence in different workgroups, different areas of the hospital,
      insufficient data on connection between SARS-CoV2 nasal swabs and antibodies and the rate of
      asymptomatic infections.

      300 hundred HCW will be tested for SARS-CoV2 with nasal swab test and blood withdrawal for
      SARS-CoV2 antibodies. At the same time a questionnaire with epidemiological anamnesis, risky
      contacts and the use of personal protective equipment will be filled.
