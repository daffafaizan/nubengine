      irradiation with or without ABC. Patients will receive radiation therapy at a dose of 180-200
      cGy per fraction for 23-27 fractions to a total dose of 4600 - 4860 cGy. Additional radiation
      to the lumpectomy bed or mastectomy scar is at the discretion of the treating physician. The
      total dose to the tumor bed or mastectomy scar cannot exceed 6600cGy. Treatments will be
      given Monday through Friday.

      After the completion of radiation therapy, patients will be seen on the following schedule:

      A follow up examination will take place every 3-6 months for the first two years, then every
      4-6 months for years for the next 3 years. After 5 years follow-up evaluations will occur
      annually. A SPECT scan will be obtained at 6 months post therapy.

      Patients must be 18 and older and must have histologically confirmed (by routine H&E
      staining) invasive adenocarcinoma or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the left breast.

      Patients must have also undergone a segmental mastectomy (SM) or Mastectomy.

      Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the breast at any time for any
      reason.

      Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential for fetal harm as a result of this
      treatment regimen.
