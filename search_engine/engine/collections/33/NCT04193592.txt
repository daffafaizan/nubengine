    
      An open-label clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administering
      pirfeniodne for 52 weeks to subjects with HPS-ILD. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria
      without contraindications for the study will be provided pirfenidone 2403 mg/day. Efficacy
      will be evaluated through interval testing of pulmonary function tests, patient reported
      outcomes, adverse events and survival. Safety will be assessed by determining adverse events,
      hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality.
