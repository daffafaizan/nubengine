      routine vitrectomy surgery at an university hospital to a designed listening program during
      surgery or to nothing in order to determine whether music listening during surgery can
      measurably result in decreased patient pain assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Pain scale.
      Secondary outcome measures will be blood pressure, need for anxiety medication, postoperative
      pain medication, and patient overall experience.
