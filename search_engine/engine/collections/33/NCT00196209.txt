      fibrillation: Cardioversion vs. catheter ablation. Cardioversion is a low risk standard
      treatment option for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. However, mid- and long
      term efficacy (regarding the maintenance of sinus rhythm) is low. Catheter ablation is an
      invasive treatment which has been reported to result in up to 60-70% of patients in stable
      sinus rhythm. However, it is a potentially dangerous invasive procedure with potentially
      fatal complications.
