      for the relief of pain and arthritis. However, the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of ulcer
      bleeding by 4-fold. Current evidence indicates that combination of conventional NSAIDs and a
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI) reduces the risk of ulcer complications. The alternative strategy
      is to replace conventional, non-selective NSAIDs with NSAIDs selective for cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2 inhibitors). Recently, there are concerns about the cardiovascular safety of COX-2
      inhibitors and conventional NSAIDs. Because of such concern, patients requiring
      anti-inflammatory analgesics who have cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. smoking,
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) should receive prophylactic low-dose aspirin.
      However, concomitant low-dose aspirin negates the gastric sparing effect of COX-2 inhibitors
      and augments the gastric toxicity of nonselective NSAIDs. Thus, gastroprotective agents such
      as PPIs should be co-prescribed to patients with high ulcer risk who are taking aspirin plus
      a COX-2 inhibitor or a nonselective NSAID.
