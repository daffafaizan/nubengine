      highly strain specific and to be directed at a hypervariable portion of the viral gp120. The
      F105 human monoclonal antibody reacts with the CD4 binding region of gp120 and has been shown
      to neutralize the IIIB, SF2, and MN strains of HIV at concentrations readily achievable in
      humans.

      In Part A, three cohorts of four patients each receive a single intravenous (IV) injection of
      F105 human monoclonal antibody at 1 of 3 doses. The IV catheter will remain in the patient's
      arm for 12 hours after injection for subsequent drawing of blood samples. The third group
      (highest dose) will be studied only after the first two groups are analyzed for
      pharmacokinetics. No more than two patients are enrolled per week. Patients on Part A undergo
      follow-up three to four times within the first week after injection and weekly thereafter for
      7 weeks. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity data generated from Part A will be used to select two
      dose levels for intermittent administration in Part B. In this part, cohorts of four to six
      patients receive one of two doses of F105 for 8-12 weeks.

      Per 9/30/94 amendment, eight patients receive one dose of F105 every 21 days for four doses
      (dose determined from analysis of Part A data).
