      common method in total knee arthroplasty. Adding morphine to the local anesthetic injected
      intrathecally prolongs the analgetic effect, but may give the usual opioid side effects. The
      Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) technique has proven effective in reducing postoperative
      pain in total knee arthroplasty. In the LIA technique a long-acting local anesthetic
      (ropivacaine), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are
      infiltrated intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if spinal anesthesia together with the LIA technique
      provide better postoperative pain relief and mobilization than spinal anesthesia with
      addition of morphine to the local anesthetic intrathecally. Primary end-point is morphine
      consumption the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary end-points are pain intensity, knee
      function, time to home readiness, hospital stay, side effects and patient satisfaction.
      Patients are followed up to 3 months after surgery.
