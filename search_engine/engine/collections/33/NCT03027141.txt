      looking at their pre-injury and their injured face with activity when they are looking at the
      persons face with whom they are familiar with. This will identify whether there are
      differences between how the brain responds when patients view their current facial appearance
      and when viewing their face before facial disfigurement. Investigators will then scan the
      patients post-operatively when the transplant team deems the patient ready; this will depend
      on reduction of post-operative swelling, improved communication with the treatment team, and
      patient psychological status. Activity in the brain will be compared when participants are
      looking at pictures of the familiar other person, with pictures of their pre-injury,
      pre-transplant disfigured face and pictures of their post-transplant facial appearance.
      Participants will be scanned again, at least two months later, with the same set of stimuli.
      Activity in the brain will be compared when participants look at their pre-transplant
      disfigured face and their new face, compared with activity when they look at the familiar
      other. This will allow investigators to see the differences in how the brain responds to the
      new facial appearance over time.
