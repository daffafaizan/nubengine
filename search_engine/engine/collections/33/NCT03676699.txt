      consequence of severe sepsis with high mortality rate, in which there is major disturbance on
      the cellular, metabolic and circulatory levels . Patients who suffer from malignancy or under
      chemotherapeutic treatment are at higher risk of sepsis.Postoperative cancer patients carry
      both the risk of underlying malignancy with superimposed risk of major surgical
      procedure.Upon recognition of septic shock, management should start promptly, aiming at
      effective restoration of the intravascular volume, identification, control of source of
      infection and starting empiric intravenous antimicrobials. This is a common problem in
      critically ill patients especially in presence of sepsis. Monitoring effective fluid
      resuscitation and patient's hemodynamic status is achieved through different techniques
      mainly by measuring central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)
      and transpulmonary thermodilution along with chest radiography analysis.Recently lung
      ultrasound evolved as a novel tool for assessment of extravascular lung water (EVLW) and lung
      congestion. It is a bed side noninvasive assessment tool. EVLW accumulation is diagnosed
      through interpretation of B-Lines which are echoic Vertical, comet-tail-like lines extending
      from the pleura line to the screen edge without fading .The normal lung pattern of no-echo
      signal or black lung, changes into black and white pattern with lung congestion, then into
      white lung pattern with alveolar pulmonary edema .This study aims to investigate the
      correlation between lung ultrasound and IVC collapsibility index in assessment of fluid
      responsiveness in cancer patients with septic shock.
