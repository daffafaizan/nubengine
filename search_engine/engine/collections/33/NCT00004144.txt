        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine when given concurrently with
           bryostatin 1 to patients with advanced refractory cancer.

        -  Access the pattern of toxicity of this drug regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, duration of response, and overall survival in
           patients treated with this drug regimen.

        -  Determine the influence of bryostatin 1 on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, immediately followed by bryostatin 1 IV over
      24 hours, weekly for 3 weeks (days 1, 8, and 15). Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and bryostatin 1 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxic effects.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2-3 patients per month will be accrued for this study.
