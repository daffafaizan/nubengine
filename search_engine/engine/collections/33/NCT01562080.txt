      berberine, folic acid and coenzyme Q10 (Armolipid Plus ®, Rottapharm) produced a significant
      improvement in lipid profile in patients with moderately elevated cholesterol levels of low
      density lipoprotein (LDL-C) plasma.

      Taking into account the potential effect of Armolipid Plus ® on the lipid profile, it is
      important to investigate the effectiveness in the field of cardiovascular prevention to
      define its position in prevention programs.
