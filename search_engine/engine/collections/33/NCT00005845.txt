      I. To determine the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of the farnesyltransferase
      (FTase) inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
      treated on a one week on/one week off schedule.

      II. To determine the effect on R115777 on a one week on/one week off schedule on FTase
      activity, prenylation of RAS and other substrates and on downstream effects.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
