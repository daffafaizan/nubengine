      life changes after breast cancer surgery, as well as looking at the cosmetic outcomes for the
      same patient group. The study is conducted prospectively, with patients being included
      forward in time when they are diagnosed with breast cancer in Kristianstad hospital, Sweden.
      The study started in January 2019 and is expected to continue enrollment for two years, with
      the aim of recruiting 300 patients. The patients fill out a quality of life questionnaire
      (Breast-Q) at baseline, which is defined as time of diagnosis, and second Breast-Q
      questionnaire 1-year post surgery. Photos are also taken of the breasts both preoperatively
      and postoperatively and the photos are assessed by a computer program validated to assess
      cosmetic outcomes after breast cancer surgery, called BCCT.core, and secondly the cosmetic
      results of the breasts are evaluated by the surgeon and patient herself on a 10-grade scale.
      In addition study specific items covering for example psychiatric comorbidity, BMI and
      smoking are retrieved.

      The study hypothesis is that patients undergoing breast cancer surgery overall have a good
      quality of life 1-year after their diagnosis, especially if they are treated with a surgical
      approach that takes into account both the best oncological treatment as well as the best
      surgical technique for cosmetic outcome, so called oncoplastic surgery. The other hypothesis
      is that cosmetic results will be overall favorable for the group of patients who are operated
      with breast-conserving techniques, and most favorable in those patients who have undergone
      oncoplastic surgery. Secondly the study aims to see if there are other patient related
      variables that affect the quality of life or cosmetic outcome, for example cytostatic
      treatment, a high body mass index, smoking or psychiatric history prior to diagnosis.
