    
      Patients having elective arthroscopic rotator cuff repair will be randomized to one of the
      two groups.

      Group 1: This group will receive Interscalene block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator
      aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

      Group 2: This group will receive Suprascapular and Axillary nerve block (ultrasound guided
      and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia.

      Performance time, quality and efficacy as well as any side-effects of the blocks will be
      evaluated in terms of pain scores in recovery room, after 4- 6 hours and the next morning,
      opioid usage and patient satisfaction.

      Primary hypothesis:

      • Combined Suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks provide similar postoperative analgesia as
      compared to interscalene block for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

      Secondary hypothesis

      • Interscalene block is associated with more side effects and complications as compared to
      suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block.
