      before becoming pandemic. Respiratory disease is the main form of disease causing acute
      respiratory distress as the main cause of death.

      Increased number of cases worldwide had put an enormous load on public health resulting
      lockdowns, quarantines and curfews. Predicting number of cases is hard as the increment of
      cases between communities differ.

      Time series had been used in different fields of science to predict, such as signal
      processing, mathematical finance, weather prediction. In medicine, time series analysis were
      used in number of admitted patients to hospitals. Aim of this study is to predict the total
      number of Covid-19 cases worldwide using time series anaylsis.
