      frequent than ST-segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) now. NSTE-ACS patients
      sent to early PCI procedure is large and increasing rapidly in China.Quite a few trials have
      focused on high loading dose statin before PCI to improve cardiovascular outcomes in ACS. In
      Asian, high loading dose statin therapy showed different outcome. Rosuvastatin (RSV) is one
      of the most potent statins.Nowadays, quite a few experts think ACS patients undergoing PCI
      not only need loading dose statin, but also post PCI intensive statin treatment is rather
      important. Chinese consensus and western guidelines recommend intensive statin treatment in
      these patients. However, Chinese consensus referred to the western study as there's no
      relevant intensive statin treatment peri-PCI study in China until now.

      Thus this study is designed to explore the efficacy of intensive statin treatment peri-PCI
      (early loading dose-RSV 40 mg or 20mg before PCI and subsequent 20mg post PCI) in
      periprocedural myocardial injury and 30 days MACE reduction in Chinese NSTE-ACS patients and
      explore efficacy of 30-day RSV 20 mg post-PCI treatment in lipid profile, inflammatory
      factors compared with baseline.
