        -  Assess the degree to which modafinil can reduce fatigue in cancer patients receiving
           chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the relationship between depression and fatigue in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on day 5 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive oral
           modafinil once daily.

        -  Arm II: Beginning on day 5 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive oral
           placebo once daily.

      Treatment in both arms continues until day 7 of course 4 of chemotherapy in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Fatigue and quality of life are assessed on day 7 of courses 2-4 of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 837 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 2.5 years.
