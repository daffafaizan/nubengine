      Barrett's oesophagus with and without lesions from the same level will be obtained
      prospectively. Lesions will be delineated by 3 expert endoscopists and the overlap between
      all delineations for each image, regarded as the "sweet spot", will be used as the gold
      standard. The images will then be assessed by a group of non-expert endoscopists (trainees
      and nurse endoscopists) as well as senior endoscopists with no interest in Barrett's. First,
      white light images will be assessed, followed by a wash-out period and then NBI. Assessments
      will be carried out using a computer application designed in MATLAB. Observers will be also
      asked to complete the following 1) Paris classification of lesion 2) delineation of the
      lesion on the screen 3) rate the ability to delineate the lesion for each of the two
      respective imaging modalities (using a Visual analog scale (VAS score 1-10), 4) choice a
      single point for virtual diagnostic biopsy. Thus, the quantitative interobserver agreement of
      the delineations for WLE and NBI will be calculated. VAS scores for the ability to delineate
      the lesion will be compared between WLE and NBI. Rate of inclusion of the biopsy point in the
      sweet spot on WLE and NBI will be compared.
