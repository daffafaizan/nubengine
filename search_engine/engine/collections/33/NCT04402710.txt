      an online, two arm ([self-compassion intervention + ideal care] versus [health information +
      ideal care]) intervention designed to increase physical activity among individuals at risk
      for type 2 diabetes.

      Primary research question: Is an online, two-arm intervention ([self-compassion intervention
      + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care]) focused on increasing physical
      activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes feasible using Thabane and
      colleagues model of feasibility (2010)?

      Secondary research question: Is an online, two-arm intervention ([self-compassion
      intervention + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care]) focused on increasing
      physical activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes acceptable to both
      participants and research personnel?

      The secondary research objective is to explore whether an online, two-arm intervention
      ([self-compassion intervention + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care])
      focused on increasing physical activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes
      leads to changes from pre- to post-intervention in self-compassion, physical activity levels,
      nutrition, self-regulatory skill use, experience of exercise barriers, personal growth
      initiative, negative affect, and engagement in other health behaviours (e.g. stress
      management).

      This pilot and feasibility study is a single centre, randomized, active controlled, six week
      intervention with baseline and follow-up assessment at intervention-end, 6- and 12-weeks
      post-intervention. It follows a quantitative-dominant, mixed-methods design. They will
      supplement this trial with interviews after follow-up testing with participants and study
      personnel. These interviews will provide feasibility and acceptability information.
