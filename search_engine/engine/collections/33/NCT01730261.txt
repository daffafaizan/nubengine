      to individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury who also have emotional dysregulation. 80 subjects
      with significant emotional dysregulation will be enrolled and will receive 24 60-minute
      emotional regulation sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered online via a group meeting
      software. Study participation will last 28 weeks: 4 weeks of baseline, 12 weeks of treatment
      (24 sessions) and 12 weeks of follow-up. Assessments will be conducted at each of four
      timepoints: T1 (baseline), T2 (pre-treatment assessment), T3 (end-of-treatment assessment)
      and T4 (follow-up assessment). In addition, a subset of the measures will be administered
      bi-weekly for the duration of the study. Assessments will consist of a variety of measures
      designed to measure executive functioning, problem solving skills, and quality of life. All
      assessments will be completed online, using a web-based data collection. Attendance and
      treatment compliance will be tracked, and outcomes will be monitored using online data
      collection methods. Treatment satisfaction and participant subjective experience (including
      technical difficulties that make access to web-delivered treatment impossible) will also be
      assessed.
