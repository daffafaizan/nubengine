      disease(CKD), by reducing the accumulation of nitrogen catabolic substances, and by delaying
      the progress of CKD and proteinuria, but the effects of the different degree's protein diet
      on the renal progression remain to be determined.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of low protein diet and α-keto acid tablet
      in retard the progress of CKD. This is a randomized, open-label, prospective study, 120
      patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into three groups at
      the ratio of 1:1:1. Group I patients will receive low protein diet(0.6g/kg BW), group II will
      receive low protein diet supplemented with α-keto acid, while group III will take very low
      protein diet(0.3g/kg BW) supplemented with α-keto acid. The changes of glomerular filtration
      rate in CKD will be evaluated after 1 year treatment.
