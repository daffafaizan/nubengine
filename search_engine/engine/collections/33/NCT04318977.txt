      evaluated. The active study arms are high-frequency rTMS and iTBS of the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex to treat negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The control arm will include
      the same number of patients as each active arm and includes both sham rTMS and sham iTBS in
      the same proportion as the active treatments.

      Standards of the trial will be harmonized across four clinical centers with the aim to pool
      data for analysis. Each center is responsible for ethical approval and adherence to good
      clinical practice by itself (Sponsor).
