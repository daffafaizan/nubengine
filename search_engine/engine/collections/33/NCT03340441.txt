    
      Primary objective of this study is to compare the temperature measured by the PRIZMA to the
      oral and Armpit temperature measured by a gold standard device in order to develop and
      evaluate a skin to body temperature conversion table.

      Secondary objective is to collect and compare data of ECG, Respiration and SpO2 collected
      from the Prizma device to the data collected from gold standard devices for reference of
      noise level and for future development of the PRIZMA device.
