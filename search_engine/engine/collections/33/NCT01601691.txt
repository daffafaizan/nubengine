      wall leading rectum adverse effects in long term for some patients. A resorbable spaces
      between prostate and rectum could decrease the incidence of these side effect. In this trial,
      men with prostate cancer with intention to curative treatment by low dose brachytherapy will
      be recruited. Diluted DuraSeal will be applied between rectum and prostate at the end of the
      brachytherapy seed implantation procedure. After the implantation of the brachytherapy seeds,
      a needle is placed between rectum and prostate through perineal skin under transrectal
      ultrasound guidance. The proper position of the needle is confirmed by the injection of 10-15
      ml sterile saline solution. After that, DuraSeal components are diluted in 1:1 with sterile
      saline and 6-10 ml of this diluted product will be injected using DuraSeal applicator. The
      resolution of the spacer will be followed by repeated plain computer tomography (CT) of
      pelvis performed a day before operation, a day after the operation, 4 weeks after the
      operation and 8 weeks after the operation. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis
      performed 8 to 16 weeks after the operation. The space created between prostate and rectum
      will be documented by plain CT and magnetic resonance imaging. Rectum radiation dose will be
      calculated based on these scans. Time to DuraSeal resolution will be evaluated from the
      scans. Possible side effects will be collected by subject interviews during follow-up visits
      at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the operation.
