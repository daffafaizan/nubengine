      activity and psychosocial outcomes (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behavioral
      symptoms, self-concept and academic achievement as assessed through recent grade) among young
      adolescents and to develop intervention to enhance motivation towards physical activity among
      young adolescents. Randomized Control Trial design will be used in this study to examine the
      impact of school-based intervention on motivation towards physical activity and psychosocial
      outcomes. After assessing their motivation toward physical activity and psychosocial outcomes
      intervention will given for 10 weeks, in which participants will be asked to participate in
      10 minutes exercise activity on regular basis from Monday to Friday during school timings.
      Assessment will be done to find out that whether the school based intervention will be
      effective for them in motivation towards physical activity and reduction psychosocial
      outcomes (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behavioral symptoms, self-concept and
      academic achievement (as assessed through recent grade)) among adolescents or not. This
      results of this study will be used in promoting active lifestyle may help the adolescent to
      develop long-term positive healthy habits and targeting adolescents through encouraging
      physical activity in school or educational setting and social surrounding. To make decision
      about effective programs and policies to promote physical activity should be taken in
      account, by providing empirical support for public health messages that encourage
      participation in school spots as a mean to reduce the burden of poor mental health. Physical
      activity programming must align with the predictable developmental changes in adolescent
      exercise capacity and motor skills, which affect the activities in which they can
      successfully engage. These programs specifically designed to improve psychosocial outcomes,
      such as self-concept, social behavior and self-efficacy of adolescents as these are the most
      important determinants of participation in physical activities.
