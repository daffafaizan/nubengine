    
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of Fabry disease in
      the different organ systems, understand its pathogenesis, and develop adequate clinical
      outcome measures for therapy trials. Development of sensitive outcome measures is a
      prerequisite of enzyme or gene replacement trials in patients with Fabry's disease. STUDY
      POPULATION: Patients with Fabry disease of all ages. The patients are not foregoing available
      treatment to participate in this protocol. Experimental treatment is not part of this study.
      STUDY DESIGN: Patients will typically be seen once a year at NIH. Patients will have
      comprehensive testing in order to evaluate the state of their health as affected by the Fabry
      disease. OUTCOME MEASURES: All potential clinically relevant areas will be evaluated
      comprehensively with a particular emphasis on the vasculopathy and the peripheral neuropathy
      of Fabry disease.
