    
      National multicenter,randomized, open-label, active-controlled with three parallel
      groups.Eligible patients are randomized to receive LactiSal 1% vaginal gel, LactiSal 50 mg
      vaginal tablet or clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal tablet for 6 days. Control examaminations are
      performed 10 after entry and 4 weeks after control visit 1.

      The study investigates the clinical efficacy and safety of Lactisal 1% vaginal gel and
      LactiSal 50mg vaginal tablets in the intended use, i.e. vaginal application, and the
      following intended claims:

        -  Treatment of vaginal yeast vaginitis

        -  Relieves vaginal itching, burning, redness and discharge in case of yeast vaginitis

        -  Inhibition of yeast colonization in the vagina in case of yeast vaginitis. The study is
           designed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Lactisal 1% vaginal gel and
           LactiSal 50 mg vaginal tablets to a current standard drug therapy, i.e. clotrimazole 100
           mg vaginal tablets.

      While LactiSal is classified as medical device class IIa, the comparator is a medicinal
      (pharmaceutical) product. The study represents a "mixed" study, comparing the efficacy of a
      medical device with a pharmaceutical product.
