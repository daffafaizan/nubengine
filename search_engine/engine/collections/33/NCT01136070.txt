      over time could help us to better understand the psychosocial sequelae of burns and to
      identify potential interventions which may serve to improve the quality of life in burn
      patients.

      The original protocol has been modified to include more assessment times. The original
      protocol was set up to assess patients after patient discharge from the inpatient burn unit
      and at 6 and 12-months post discharge. The present protocol has been modified to capture
      assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months post-burn. Patients will be
      assessed at these time points or until they are discharged from the outpatient burn clinic.
      In addition, inclusion criteria have been modified to include patients who are anticipated to
      have a follow-up visit to the burn outpatient clinic at 3 months post-burn. The original
      protocol required an anticipated follow-up for 12 months post-hospital discharge.
