      develops due to vascular causes, causes focal or global brain damage, begins acutely, and
      progresses with neurological symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer. Ä°t is stated that stroke is
      the third leading cause of disability worldwide. As a result of stroke, sensory disturbances
      may occur in individuals as well as motor symptoms.

      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sensory training, which
      will be applied to the trunk in addition to Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk
      functions, sense, balance and gait. The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the
      effects of Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functional capacity, balance and
      gait performance.

      Our study consists of two groups: Bobath-based trunk training group and, sensory training
      group in addition to Bobath-based trunk training. All participants will be randomly
      distributed (using software at http://www.randomizer.org). First, 20 patients will be
      included in our study and the total number of patients will be determined by calculating the
      effect size with the interm analysis to be performed later. Exercises will be applied to the
      individuals participating in the study 3 days a week, 8 weeks and 24 sessions in total.
      Exercises will be applied to the individuals after conventional therapy session. The
      information of individuals who agree to participate in the study and meet the criteria for
      admission to the study will be recorded with a demographic information form. The scales,
      questionnaires and tests determined to evaluate the individual's trunk position sense and
      functions, balance and walking performance will be applied before and after the study.
