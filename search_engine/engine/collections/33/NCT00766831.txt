      (conducted in more than 1 center), prospective (study following participants forward in time)
      dose-ascending study to evaluate the clinical usefulness of hydromorphone OROS in improvement
      of sleep disturbance caused by cancer pain.Total duration of study will be 3 weeks. The study
      consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (up to 1 week), Treatment phase (2 weeks), and
      Extension phase (12 weeks). The study will include 6 visits: Day -7, Day 1, Day 15, Day 43,
      Day 71, and Day 99. During screening phase, potential participants will receive strong oral
      (long acting) opioid analgesic (for 7 days) until Day 1 and the participants will be
      evaluated for participation in clinical study on Day 1. During treatment phase, participants
      will receive hydromorphone OROS (8 milligram [mg] to greater than or equal to 32 mg), once
      daily for 2 weeks, and the dose will be adjusted every 2 days from Day 3 at the
      Investigator's discretion and according to the strong oral (long acting) opioid analgesic
      administered from screening phase to Day 1 (the initial dose of the study drug will be
      determined by converting the dose of the previously administered analgesic to that of the
      daily dose of oral morphine with the equivalent analgesic effect to the study drug [dose with
      equivalent analgesic effect; Hydromorphone OROS dose: oral morphine dose =1:5]). Participants
      who completed treatment phase and suffer from continuing cancer pain will be enrolled to
      extension phase and study drug will be administered as per Investigator discretion for 99
      days. Participants primarily will be evaluated for improvement in sleep disturbance measured
      by Korean Brief Pain Inventory (KBPI). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
