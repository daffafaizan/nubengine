      advanced breast cancer will be enrolled on the study prior to receiving neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Patients will receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant eribulin followed by 4 cycles of
      dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC).

      All patients will have a baseline biopsy prior to study entry to determine eligibility.
      Patients will undergo repeat breast imaging and optional biopsy after completing 4 cycles of
      eribulin. Patients will then receive 4 cycles of dose-dense AC. Patients will undergo repeat
      breast imaging followed by surgical resection within 30 days of completing last cycle of
      chemotherapy. Patients who are not surgical candidates after completion of chemotherapy will
      be asked to undergo optional repeat biopsy prior to receiving additional treatment at the
      discretion of the investigator. Patients will continue to be followed per standard practice
      guideline after surgery

      Clinical response will be determined by clinical breast examination prior to each cycle of
      chemotherapy and by breast imaging performed at baseline, after completion of eribulin, and
      prior to surgery. Pathologic complete response (pCR) will be determined at the time of
      surgical resection. Correlative biomarker studies will be performed on tumor samples at the
      completion of the clinical trial.
