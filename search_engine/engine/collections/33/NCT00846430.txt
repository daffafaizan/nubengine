      pegylated interferon alpha-2b. If the patients have at least a partial response after six
      months, they may continue on the same treatment for up to two years. If the patient
      experiences less than a partial response, or has progressive disease after six months of
      therapy, then vincristine and temozolomide will be added to the celecoxib and interferon
      alpha-2b backbone. Response to treatment will be assessed after a minimum of six months,
      presuming the patient has not experienced progressive disease. Total duration of therapy on
      study is two years for any individual treatment plan.
