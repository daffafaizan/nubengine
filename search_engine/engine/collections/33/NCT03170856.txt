      exercise while a patient may still be experiencing symptoms. Some patients will be given a
      dose-dependent exercise prescription based on their own sub-maximal output. They will
      aerobically exercise at this given threshold for 8 weeks, while heart rate and symptom
      duration is tracked. Some patients will only follow physician prescribed exercise, while
      undergoing the same heart rate and symptom monitoring for 8 weeks.
