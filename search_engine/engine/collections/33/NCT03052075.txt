      parathyroid database within the Department of Surgical Oncology at the University of Texas MD
      Anderson Cancer Center. The patient cohort for this study consists of all patients with
      primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroidectomy and also had pre- and
      post-operative DEXA studies performed. The database will be reviewed to obtain patient and
      disease characteristics, laboratory values, DEXA imaging results, and surgical outcomes.
