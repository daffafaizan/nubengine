      patients with a duplication of exon 2 in the DMD gene. Preclinical data shows that the small
      nuclear RNA (snRNA) construct delivered by the scAAV9.U7.ACCA vector causes significant
      skipping of exon 2, resulting in exclusion of the exon from the mature messenger RNA (mRNA)
      with a high degree of efficiency, leading to mRNA containing only a single exon 2 (wild type
      [WT] mRNA) or no copies of exon 2 (Del2 mRNA). Translation of the wild-type mRNA results in
      entirely normal dystrophin protein, whereas translation of the Del2 mRNA via translational
      initiation of an internal ribosome entry sequence, or IRES) results in a highly functional
      isoform expressed in patients known to walk into their eighth decade.

      The study is designed as an open-label trial to assess safety and obtain preliminary efficacy
      data. scAAV9.U7.ACCA will be delivered to the systemic circulation via peripheral limb vein.
