      participants enrolled in the LTOG cohort studies. We will perform long-term Chronic Lung
      Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) phenotyping of lung transplant recipients who participated in
      the LTOG cohort studies utilizing data collected for routine clinical visits. Surviving lung
      transplant recipients who participated in the LTOG cohort studies will be recruited to enroll
      in the longitudinal portion of the project. The longitudinal component will include follow-up
      data collection at 6 month intervals while alive until study termination, study withdrawal,
      or no longer being seen for follow-up at the participating center. Follow-up data collection
      will include clinical data collected by study coordinators by reviewing medical records,
      functional assessment through administration of the Short Physical Performance Battery
      (SPPB), blood collection and surveys. Data from this project will be linked to data and
      samples collected during the LTOG cohort or ancillary studies.
