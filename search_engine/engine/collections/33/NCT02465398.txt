    
      This is a multi-centre, non-comparative, prospective post-market surveillance study involving
      surgeons skilled in shoulder replacement surgery. Each case enrolled will receive an
      Anatomical Shoulder Fracture implant. All system components are CE (Conformité
      Européenne)-marked and commercially available. Patients will be selected according to the
      subject selection criteria.

      All patients will undergo pe-operative, intra-operative and post-operative physical
      examination, radiographic evaluation according to the hospital's routine procedure and
      collection of quality of life metrics. Follow-up evaluations are to be conducted at 6-12
      weeks (x-rays only), at 6 months and annually thereafter for a minimum period of 5 years post
      hospital discharge. Follow-up evaluation at 10 years post hospital discharge is optional.
