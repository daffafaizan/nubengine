      In each study, the contact lens was evaluated in conjunction with three solutions: Opti-Free
      Replenish, ReNu MultiPlus, and Clear Care. The total enrollment number of 75 represents a
      combined enrollment of the three studies, with some subjects participating in more than one
      study.
