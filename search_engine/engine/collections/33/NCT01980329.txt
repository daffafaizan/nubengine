      and its oxidative metabolites. A single oral dose of 300 mg maraviroc will be given to 24
      eligible healthy individuals who will be screened and determined to have specific CYP3A5
      genotype - 8 homozygous wild type (2 CYP3A5*1 alleles), 8 heterozygous (1 CYP3A5*1 allele and
      1 mutant allele), and 8 without wild type genotype (2 mutant alleles). Blood samples will be
      drawn and urine samples will be collected immediately before and during a 32-hr period
      following the dose. The concentrations of maraviroc and its oxidative metabolites from the
      blood and urine samples will be measured and the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc and its
      metabolites will be compared among the three groups with different CYP3A5 polymorphic status.
