        -  Compare time to progression in women with progressive, stage IV, estrogen or
           progesterone receptor- and HER2/neu-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab
           (Herceptin) with or without tamoxifen.

        -  Correlate response with type of measurement (immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ
           hybridization) of HER2/neu expression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare objective response rate (complete or partial response) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior adjuvant
      treatment (yes vs no), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and prior aromatase inhibitor
      treatment (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab as in arm I and oral tamoxifen once daily on days
           1-21.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (140 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 28 months.
