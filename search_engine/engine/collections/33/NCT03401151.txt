      changes in physical performance, cardiac function, and prognosis in patients with heart
      failure, and changes over time. Therefore, the investigators will investigate patients with
      severe heart failure at 'baseline' and on a second follow-up occasion after 12-16 months.

      The secondary and tertiary objective is to investigate how changes in the metabolic signature
      of blood and satellite cells coincide with changes in physical performance, cardiac function,
      and prognosis in patients with heart failure, and changes over time. Patient recruitment is
      expected to occur over 36 months.

      The study will be conducted in Sweden at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge.
