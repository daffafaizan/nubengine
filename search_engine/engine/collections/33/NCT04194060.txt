      operative hospital stay, ERAS(Enhanced recovery after surgery), a multi-modal and
      multispeciality approach to perioperative management may reduce the length of hospital stay.
      In the preoperative period, patients will be counselled regarding the operative procedure and
      particulars of the perioperative management.In the intra-operative period short acting
      general anesthetic agents and short acting muscle relaxants will be used.Intravenous fluid
      administration will be goal directed. After the operative procedure, bilateral rectus sheath
      block will be administered. Patient will also receive post-operative nausea and vomiting
      prophylaxis. Nasogastric tube will be removed immediately after the operative procedure. In
      the post operative period, patients will be encouraged to ambulate early. Enteral nutrition
      will be initiated as early as possible. Indwelling catheters will be removed in the early
      post-operative procedure.
