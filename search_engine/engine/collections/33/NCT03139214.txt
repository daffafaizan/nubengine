      Families, or SAAF). Families (mothers with their 11 year old child) were randomized to either
      the parenting intervention or to a control group. Those in the intervention group received 7
      group sessions with the parent and child aimed at promoting better family relationships.
      Those in the control group received 3 mailings about child development and stress management.
      At age 25, youth were assessed on metabolic syndrome. The investigators hypothesized that the
      parenting intervention would produce reductions in metabolic syndrome relative to the control
      group, particularly for those families that started out high in difficulties with parenting.
