      self-paced mindfulness program can help reduce anxiety related to memory loss. Participants
      will be involved in the study for a total of 10 weeks. Participants will log on to an online
      mindfulness program 4 days per week for about 10-20 minutes each. The total program will last
      3 weeks. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires before starting the
      program, during the program, and after they complete the program.
