      examining larger doses of magnesium in patients receiving cisplatin and the effect of
      intravenous magnesium administration on blood magnesium levels. In previous studies it was
      found that patients with lower blood magnesium levels were at higher risk of acute kidney
      injury. The study is looking to determine the best dose(s) of intravenous magnesium to
      administer safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants. The purpose of
      the study is also to determine the dose of intravenous magnesium needed to achieve a target
      level.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved magnesium for people with
      mesothelioma receiving cisplatin but it has been approved for other uses.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment at
      participant's preoperative visit with their thoracic surgeon. Intravenous magnesium will be
      administered in the hospital, the night prior to surgery, and take place over 36 hours.
      Participants will followed for 4 days on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3.

      It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.
