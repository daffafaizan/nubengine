      I. To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that pre-therapy computed
      tomography-based (CT) mass transport properties correlate with overall survival.

      II. To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that local control of pancreatic
      and hepatobiliary tumors correlate with changes in computed tomography-based mass transport
      properties of the tumors after cytotoxic therapies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CT scan at baseline and after 4 to 6 cycles of
      fluorouracil/irinotecan/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin, or after 4 infusions of
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (or other gemcitabine-based regimens), or 6 to 12 weeks after
      radiotherapy for hepatobiliary cancers. Patients may undergo optional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans prior to therapy, after two weeks of therapy, and at the time of the
      first restaging CT scan.
