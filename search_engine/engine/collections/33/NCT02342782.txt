      I. To determine if administration of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA (yttrium Y 90 basiliximab), when
      given in combination with standard dose BEAM, as conditioning for autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplant (AHCT), is safe, by evaluation of toxicities, including type, frequency,
      severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-basiliximab/DOTA when given in
      combination with standard dose BEAM, in patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) as
      part of conditioning for AHCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery in terms of neutrophil and platelet
      engraftment time.

      II. To estimate radiation doses to the whole body and normal organs through serial imaging
      studies.

      III. To estimate overall survival, progression-free survival, non-relapse mortality and
      cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at 100-days (non-relapse mortality [NRM] only),
      1-year and 2-years.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 basiliximab.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 basiliximab intravenously (IV) on days -21 and -14, carmustine
      IV over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6, cytarabine IV twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2,
      etoposide IV BID on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 100, and 180 days and 1,
      1.5, and 2 years.
