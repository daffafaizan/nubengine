      drosophila to undergo skin prick tests in order to determine if a specific sensibilization to
      drosophila exists. Then, a blood sample is taken from these persons to research specific IgE
      directed against drosophila. By this way, investigators hope determine if a specific allergy
      to drosophila exists, its characteristics as prevalence, symptoms, populations concerned...in
      order to better protect laboratory workers and prevent allergy incidence.
