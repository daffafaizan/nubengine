      are required either in the acute or in the post-acute care. Rehabilitation techniques based
      on protocols that selectively stimulate specific pathways along the central nervous system
      have been considered effective in enhancing neurologic recovery thereby improving functional
      abilities. The rationale relies on the assumption that the stimulation of the corticospinal
      tract, primary motor cortex, and spinal cord might induce neuronal reorganization of
      structures that are largely involved in the control of voluntary movements. In this line of
      reasoning, protocols involving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been
      found effective in enhancing corticospinal synaptic transmission, attenuating neuropathic
      pain, improving spasticity and sensorimotor function after iSCI. However, controversial
      findings have also been reported, as other studies showed unaltered central pain, as well as
      cortical excitability and sensorimotor function. The lack of consistent results is probably
      associated with differences in stimulation parameters, number of sessions, site of
      stimulation, chronicity and levels of injury, and outcome measurements of the previous
      studies. Thus, it is clear that there are remaining gaps in our knowledge and the development
      of new studies, preferably prospective fully double-blind placebo-controlled trials, is
      necessary to complement the current knowledge about the effects of rTMS in patients with
      iSCI.
