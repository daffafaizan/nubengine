      CFTR with little to no function. No approved therapies exist for patients with PTC mutations
      including W1282X, a unique mutation exhibiting partial CFTR activity even in its truncated
      form. CFTR modulators alone enhanced CFTR function in patient cells from W1282X/G542X CFTR.
      Several published studies have shown CFTR modulators alone and/or in combination with
      readthrough (RT) agents benefit W1282X CFTR. Clinical studies further support an aspect of
      this notion, where two W1282X patients showed beneficial effect to Ivacaftor treatment.
