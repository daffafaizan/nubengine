    
      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product (ATIMP) in adults (age ≥16) with (1) high risk,
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) CD19+ B-ALL; (2) r/r DLBCL; (3) r/r CLL/SLL and (4) r/r indolent
      B-NHL. The ATIMP for this study is cryopreserved autologous patient-derived T-cells
      transduced with the lentiviral pCCL.PGK.alpha.CD19CAT-41BBζ vector, CD19CAT-41BBζ CAR T-cells
      (referred to sub-sequently as CD19CAR T-cells) which is classified as a gene therapy
      medicinal product. Patients will undergo an unstimulated leucapheresis for the generation of
      the ATIMP. The ATIMP will take approximately 15 days to generate. During this period,
      patients may receive "holding" chemotherapy as per institutional practice to maintain disease
      control. The study will evaluate ATIMP safety and efficacy and the duration of disease
      response in adults with high risk / relapsed CD19+ B-ALL, DLBCL, B-CLL/SLL and indolent
      B-NHL.

      Patients will receive pre-conditioning lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      60mg/kg on Day -6 and fludarabine 30mg/m2 administered over 3 days (Day -5 to Day -3).
      Patients with DLBCL only will also receive a single dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg at day -1.

      Patients recruited to ALLCAR19 will be treated with different dosing schedules, depending on
      their underlying disease. Patients with B-ALL and B-CLL/SLL are considered at high risk of
      CLL/CRES so receive split dosing, with the sec-ond dose only given in the absence of severe
      toxicity 9 days later. Please note CAR T-cell dosing in ALLCAR19 is flat i.e. not dependent
      on patient body weight or surface area.

        -  Regimen A1: Patients with B-ALL with a baseline marrow blast% of ≤20% receive a split
           dose with a first dose of 100 x 106 CD19 CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 310 x
           106 CAR T-cells

        -  Regimen A2: Patients with B-ALL with a baseline marrow blast% of >20% receive a split
           dose with a first dose of 10 x 106 CD19CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 400 x
           106 CAR T-cells

        -  Regimen B: Patients with DLBCL receive a single dose of 200 x 106 CAR T-cells

        -  Regimen C: Patients with CLL/SLL will receive a split dose with a first dose of 30 x 106
           CD19 CAR T-cells and a possible second dose of 200 x 106 CD19 CAR T-cells.

        -  Regimen D: Patients with indolent B-NHL receive a single dose of 200 x 106 CAR T-cells

      The study will evaluate ATIMP feasibility and safety of generating CD19CAR T-cells and for
      B-ALL patients only, efficacy and the duration of disease response to CD19CAR T-cells.

      After completing the interventional phase of the study all patients, irrespective of whether
      they progressed or responded to treatment, will enter long term follow up until 10 years
      post-CD19CAR T-cell infusion.
