      in term premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Prospective randomized studies comparing IBC
      placement to oxytocin use in induction of labor for term PROM do not exist. Intracervical
      Balloon Catheter has been shown to reduce duration of labor for women with intact membranes
      undergoing induction of labor. The practice at this institution is to use oxytocin to start
      contractions when a woman has PROM. This study will examine IBC compared to oxytocin use in
      term PROM. This will allow for the evaluation of a cervical ripening method for term PROM
      that may improve women's outcomes. Other outcomes for this study are rates of infection
      during labor, cesarean section, and adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes.
