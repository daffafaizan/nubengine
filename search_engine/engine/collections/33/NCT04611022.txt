      intervention on the primary outcomes. The educational intervention will be delivered to 200
      participants by a trained CHE who will conduct educational workshops to deliver the
      educational materials at DHHA outpatient clinics. The CHE will administer the pre- and
      post-intervention survey to workshop participants. The follow-up survey will occur over the
      phone at 3 months post baseline only for parent participants that indicate having
      unvaccinated children or are a young adult participant and indicated not being vaccinated at
      baseline. The last follow up survey will occur over the phone at 6 months only for those
      parent participants that indicated having unvaccinated children at the 3 month follow up
      call, or are a young adult participant and indicated not being vaccinated at the 3 month
      follow up call. Additionally, the investigator will use a one-group post-test design to
      assess the impact of the intervention on the secondary outcomes. At the patient-level, the
      investigator will track participants that receive (a) 1st dose, 2nd dose, or 3rd dose of the
      HPV vaccine; and the number of referrals to care by recording the number of patients received
      (b) referrals to health insurance, discount or no-cost HPV vaccine programs; or (c) to other
      services to facilitate HPV vaccine dose completion. To assess clinic-level impact, the
      investigator will track each clinic's HPV vaccine rates for adolescents (9-17 years old) and
      young adults (18-26), and compare rates from before the investigator started the intervention
      and then quarterly there after the investigator had introduced the intervention to each
      respective Denver Health clinic.
