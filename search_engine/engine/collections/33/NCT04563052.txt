      overall health risk reduction strategy. Toxicants identified in outdoor air pollution, fine
      particulate matter (PM2.5), and photochemical ozone cause a systemic inflammatory response to
      the heart and lungs after exposure. Inside the home, health issues from exposure to carbon
      monoxide (CO), PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are
      intensified when the home is sealed with the windows and doors closed. This exploratory study
      seeks to promote health by teaching participants about strategies to reduce risks related to
      indoor and outdoor effects of air pollution.

      Data collection will consist of an electronic demographic data collection form, home air
      quality assessment, pre-test and post-test around an educational program and follow-up
      interview one month after the educational program. Avoidance of air pollution as a health
      risk reduction method is identified in the literature, however, there is limited research
      addressing the influence of education on avoidance of environmental toxins as a health risk
      reduction strategy. Therefore this study will provide a foundation for developing broader
      educational and behavioral initiatives to improve health outcomes. Due to the COVID-19
      pandemic, all aspects of this study will be completed either on-line via the Internet or by
      telephone.
