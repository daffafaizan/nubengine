      cells in peritoneal lavage fluid after resection of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
      DNA isolated from cells obtained by peritoneal lavage was analyzed by denaturing capillary
      electrophoresis with respect to mutations in hotspots of the K-RAS gene. This gene is mutated
      in 30% of rectal tumors. Exfoliated tumor cells (as assessed by the presence of mutated DNA)
      were found in lavage fluid from 19/237 of the patients, and the presence of tumor cells was
      associated with poor overall survival. Based on these encouraging results the investigators
      have designed a more comprehensive prospective study, using a novel, validated set of cancer
      specific DNA methylation - based biomarkers present in the vast majority of all colorectal
      tumors (sensitivity 94%, specificity 98%).Using these tumor cell associated biomarkers, the
      investigators aim to determine the presence of exfoliated tumor cells in peritoneal lavage
      samples from patients undergoing surgery for LARC. Lavage will be performed prior to and
      after manipulation of the tumor to provide data regarding both spontaneous and iatrogenic
      tumor cell exfoliation and their respective contribution to patient outcome. If detection of
      exfoliated tumor cells is predictive of tumor recurrence, this would support an active
      approach to postoperative chemotherapy, possibly in the form of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
