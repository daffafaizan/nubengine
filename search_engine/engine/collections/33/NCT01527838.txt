      Cohort 1 will enroll eligible subjects for whom a single CB unit has been identified that
      meets the minimum HLA-matching criteria and has a minimum pre-cryopreservation total
      nucleated cell (TNC) dose of at least 2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Cohort 2 is identical to Cohort 1,
      except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between 2.0 - <2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Finally,
      Cohort 3 is identical to Cohort 2, except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between
      1.5 - <2.0 x 10^7 cells/kg. If no safety rules are triggered, the study will proceed to the
      next dosing cohort. Within a dosing cohort, no more than three subjects may be before Day 42
      at any one time, unless they have already engrafted neutrophils. The final dosing cohort is
      defined as the last cohort where 12 evaluable subjects are treated and no stopping rules are
      triggered. The corresponding TNC dose level will be considered the minimally acceptable TNC
      dose level.
