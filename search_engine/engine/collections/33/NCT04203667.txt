      increases with polyp size, with polyps < 10 mm having < 1% risk of cancer, polyps of 10 mm
      having a 10% risk of cancer and polyps of 20 mm having a greater than 10% risk of cancer. It
      is also understood that a polyp of < 1 cm takes approximately 10 years to transform into
      invasive colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, adenomas greater than 5 mm are normally treated.
      Polyps with tethered bases resulting from scarring are often the most challenging to resect
      endoscopically. The scarring can be caused by previous attempts at resection, previous deep
      biopsies, or tattoos placed too closely. These polyps often do not lift and can be impossible
      to snare even when stiff snares are used. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and
      knife-assisted resection (KAR) are techniques that have been shown effective in the
      management of scarred polyps, however these techniques have not been widely adopted in the
      West. Argon plasma coagulation has been more commonly used to ablate adenomatous tissue in
      scarred polyps but this technique does not allow for the histological assessment of the
      scarred polyp and is less effective than ESD. The EndoRotor provides a technique whereby the
      lesion can be effectively removed without adjunct procedures with collection of tissue for
      histological assessment.
