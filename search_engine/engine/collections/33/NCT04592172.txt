      potentially of broad development and wellbeing in early childhood. A bedtime routine, in and
      of itself, embodies the characteristics of nurturing care and early child stimulation
      especially for at-risk children. It is consistent with the Lancet Early Childhood Series
      Steering Committee emphasizing the need for nurturing care, which includes adequate health,
      nutrition, security and safety, responsive caregiving, and early learning opportunities, to
      help young children (ages 0-5 years) reach their full developmental potential, and to build a
      strong foundation for subsequent development, health, and wellbeing. Common, adaptive
      components of a bedtime routine can contribute to an array of positive developmental outcomes
      beyond improved sleep, inclusive of language development, literacy, child emotional and
      behavioral regulation, parent-child attachment, and family functioning, among other outcomes.
      Although studies have been conducted on the relationship between bedtime routines and sleep,
      there have been few studies looking at bedtime routines and other developmental outcomes.
