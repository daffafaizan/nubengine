    
      Participants will be recruited from the local university sports clubs. Club chairpersons will
      be asked to send an email to club players. Players interested in participating in the study
      will be asked to attend a meeting where the study will be explained to them. Those who were
      interested will then be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Group allocation:

      A four block randomization method will be used to allocate participants to the Nordic
      hamstring exercise protocol or the single leg bridge protocol.

      Interventions:

      The Nordic hamstring exercise program or the single leg bridge program.

      Testing procedure:

      The eccentric strength of the participants' hamstrings will be recorded before and after the
      exercise intervention.

      A 10 point visual analogue scale will be used to record the level of muscle soreness
      experienced after each training session.
