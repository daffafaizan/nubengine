    
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the population structure of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis complex in Benin, and implications for tuberculosis presentation, diagnosis and
      outcome The primary objective is to compare the characteristics of ancestral lineages of
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, such as M. africanum West African 1 (Lineage 5), with
      modern M. tuberculosis in Benin.

      This study will build on the system of nationwide surveillance already implemented for
      retreatment patients and recruit in addition a representative random sample of new patients.
      So for this study sputa from retreatment patients and from a sample of new patients, from the
      24 tuberculosis (TB) clinics (Centres de Diagnostic et de Traitement de la Tuberculose)
      selected all over the country (Benin), will be shipped from TB clinics to the ''Laboratoire
      de Référence des Mycobactéries'' (LRM), Cotonou (National Reference Laboratory for
      Mycobacteria, Cotonou) if they consent. All retreatment patients will be recruited into the
      study and each 4 new patients detected after detection of a retreatment patient will also be
      recruited into the study.

      At enrolment, a questionnaire will be used to collect from consenting participants
      information such as: Participant place of residence (rural or urban as determined by
      population density); ethnic group; age; sex; Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) status;
      Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine scar...

      Spoligotype analysis will be used to determine the population structure, as it allows the
      classification of most Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates in lineages, including
      strains with single or few copies of IS6110.

      The external quality evaluation (assurance quality) of the laboratory analyses to be
      performed at the LRM (National Reference Laboratory for Mycobacteria) in Cotonou, Benin
      during the study, will be performed by the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp in
      Belgium.
