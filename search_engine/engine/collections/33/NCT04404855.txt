      to surgery. Results will be presented to Infectious Disease pharmacist within 48-72 hours to
      help select the most appropriate antibiotics, and independently as part of routine care,
      surgeons will choose the antibiotic that they would use in each case, while the Infectious
      Disease pharmacists would select their optimum choice. Approximately 220 subjects will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either NGS antibiotic recommendation or standard
      of care (SOC) prophylaxis prescribed treatment. Subjects assigned to standard of care will
      have urine cultures sent for analysis, and the physician will choose antibiotics based on
      results as per usual practice. Subjects assigned to the NGS group, in addition to routine
      urine culture results, will have NGS urine culture results sent to an investigational drrug
      (ID) pharmacist, and recommendations will be shared with the physician to determine the
      antibiotic selection. The physician will ultimately decide the appropriate antibiotics to
      prescribe. Approximately 7-14 days after surgery, the research staff will conduct a telephone
      call to ask about any post-operative infections, complications, and any additional
      antibiotics that were prescribed.
