    
      The NITRATE-CIN trial is a single-centre, randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial,
      which plans to recruit, over a period of 2 years, 640 patients presenting with acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS) who are at risk of CIN.

      Patients will be randomised to either dietary inorganic nitrate therapy or placebo.

      The primary endpoint will be the development of CIN (KDIGO criteria). A key secondary
      endpoint will be whether nitrate therapy impacts upon persistent renal impairment over a
      3-month follow-up period. Additional secondary endpoints include the measurement of serum
      renal biomarkers (e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and urinary albumin at 6,
      48 h and 3 months following administration of contrast.

      Findings from NITRATE-CIN will potentially demonstrate that nitrate attenuates
      contrast-induced acute and chronic kidney injury and influence future clinical practice
      guidelines in at-risk patients undergoing coronary angiographic procedures.
