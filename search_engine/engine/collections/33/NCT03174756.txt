      conducted. Participants were randomly assigned using block randomization in five groups: HOCl
      0.025% and 0.05%, CHX 0.12 and 0.2% and sterile water as placebo. Participants were
      instructed to use each rinse with 10 ml of each solution for 30 seconds after dental
      prophylaxis. Samples of saliva were taken at baseline and after 30 seconds, 1, 3.5 and 7
      hours to assess substantivity establishing the bacterial viability by the fluorescence method
      with the SYTO 9/propidium iodide dual staining. All participants were assessed with the
      Turesky visible plaque index at baseline and at 7 hours and adverse events were assessed. For
      the comparisons of the viability of the different rinses between times, the statistical test
      of generalized linear mixed model [GT1] adjusted to treatment, time and treatment-time
      interaction was used.
