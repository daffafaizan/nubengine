      might result from cosyntropin adherence to the tube and loss of the delivered dosage. It was
      shown that 21.6-58.6% of ACTH dosage had not been recovered when pushed through 20.3 cm
      plastic tube, and loss of ACTH may be up to 70% when cosyntropin was delivered through a
      plastic 30 cm scalp vein set.

      Moreover, it was previously shown that afternoon cosyntropin testing was associated with a
      sevenfold increased likelihood of failing the 1μg test. However, in that study, investigators
      used a 20.3 cm plastic tube, which might have led to uncompleted cosyntropin delivery. In
      ther current study investigators will study afternoon 1μg cosyntropin cortisol stimulation
      using a short 2.5 cm tube.
