      representative sample of older women from BrasÃ­lia, Brazil (n>244 subjects), will be
      recruited and invited to undergo body composition measurement using dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry. Moreover, the Sarcopenic Obesity index and isokinetic strength evaluations
      will be performed. It will be a single-blind randomized, controlled 24-week clinical trial,
      in which experimental group will receive a progressive resistance training program, meanwhile
      control group will receive instructions to maintain their lifestyle habits. Randomization
      will be conducted by computer-generated list in blocks of 10. Additionally, body composition,
      strength assessment, and sarcopenic index will collected and compared after the intervention
      period.
