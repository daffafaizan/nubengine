      430 preschoolers reported in Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine in March of 2004,
      a similar preparation with a slightly lower dose of Vitamin C decreased upper respiratory
      infections by 55% (308 to 138). We are repeating this study to see if our results confirm or
      contradict those of the previous study.
