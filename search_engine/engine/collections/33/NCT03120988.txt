    
      The objective of this study is to quantify the levels of catabolic markers in osteoarthritic
      (OA) knee synovial fluid microenvironment (ME) before lavage treatment with platelet poor
      plasma (PPP) and to determine whether the anti-catabolic capabilities of the PPP are
      sustainable or if the diseased synovial fluid returns to pre-lavage catabolic marker levels
      within the 6 week period of the study.

      This data will be used to determine if treatment of a diseased (OA) knee with PPP lavage
      would be a suitable therapy for knee OA patients either as a stand-alone treatment or to
      improve outcome by preparing a patient's knee microenvironment for further treatment with
      cellular therapies. Incidence of post-operative complications, adverse events, re-injections,
      and surgical intervention; change in pain score will be considered while determining these
      direct and indirect associations upon completion of the PPP lavage treatment. Correlation of
      subject reported clinical outcomes for the PPP lavage treatment will be evaluated to
      determine whether the treatment provides beneficial clinical outcomes.
