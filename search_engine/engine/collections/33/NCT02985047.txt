      hospital due to a crisis and associated increased suicidal ideation, recommendations for
      clinical care are still conflicting. The risk for iatrogenic effects of inpatient care are
      considerable, and long hospital admissions without a clear treatment structure may predict
      decompensation in functioning. This has resulted in a clinical practice of avoiding admission
      for individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

      Brief admission (BA) as an intervention has a longstanding history in the delivery of mental
      health services in the Netherlands. The core elements of brief admission were determined
      through consultation with Dutch researchers, interviews with individuals with experience,
      Dutch clinicians familiar with Brief Admission, and local guidelines from hospitals familiar
      with implementing this crisis management intervention. Core elements of the intervention were
      standardized into a protocol, and an educational manual was developed to train clinicians
      involved in the trial. An objectively rated fidelity measure was developed in order to ensure
      adherence.
