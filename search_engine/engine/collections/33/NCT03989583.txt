      That makes the technique useful for different applications like in construction/ building,
      ecology, industry and medicine. Evolution of thermographic equipments makes it more
      accessible. It is a non- contact, non- invasive technique that helps researchers monitoring
      body temperature. So that, it is used to investigate ocular, liver, kidney and brain
      diseases, dental diagnosis, breast cancer detection or even sports injuries.

      It is increasing the use of thermographic imaging in podiatry, so the main trials concerned
      to diabetes mellitus, vascular disorder or dermatological applications.

      Nevertheless, there is little known about children´s foot temperature. Main studies are
      related to core temperature or variations in temperature among different parts of the body of
      enfants.

      In consequence, the investigators found a lack of information related to such a significant
      topic, not only for podiatrists, but also for population in general.
