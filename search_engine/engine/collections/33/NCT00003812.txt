      followed by consolidation chemoradiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung
      cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population. III.
      Describe the pattern of relapse, documenting carefully the location of relapse with respect
      to the original disease volume and the radiation treatment field in these patients. IV.
      Determine the overall and failure free survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV on days 1-5 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously every day starting on day 6 until blood
      counts recover. The course is repeated once beginning on day 22. After restaging, patients
      begin thoracic radiotherapy daily, five days per week, for 6-7 weeks. On the same day that
      radiotherapy begins, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour (day 43) and etoposide IV
      over 1 hour daily for 3 days (days 43-45). The consolidation chemotherapy is repeated every
      21 days for a total of 3 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease undergo
      prophylactic cranial irradiation. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then at least every year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-18 months.
