      Therefore, this interventional concept is of limited use today. However, dual antiplatelet
      therapy (DAPT) is not necessary after POBA. Contrary, 3rd generation drug-eluting stents
      (DES) proved to be very effective showing delayed restenosis only in 5-15%, but require DAPT
      for at least 6 months. Drug-eluting balloons (DEB) might be a promising trade-off between
      POBA and DES, since they effectively inhibit neointimal proliferation despite minimal
      duration of DAPT. However, there is still very limited data on this interventional strategy.
      Thus, we aimed to investigate feasibility of fractional flow reserve (FFR) - guided use of
      paclitaxel-eluting balloons (Sequent Pleaseâ„¢, B Braun) with provisional bare metal stenting
      for elective PCI of de novo coronary lesions, evaluating the 6-month outcomes by angiography
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
