      examination with measurement of height and weight, body composition and fasting blood sample.
      All subjects will performed a cognitive testing at rest and a maximal cardiopulmonary
      exercise test (CEPT) with gas exchange analysis. During CEPT, cerebral oxygenation (measured
      by near-infra red spectroscopy) and cardiac hemodynamics responses (impedance cardiography)
      will be measured continuously.
