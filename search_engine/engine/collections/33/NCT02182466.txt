      Imaging EMEA, Hamburg, Germany) provides direct visualization of the colon mucosa, enabling
      the investigator to diagnose colonic disease. CCE is a complementary means to flexible
      ileo-colonoscopy andt safety, quality assurance and quality control of CCE is not well
      understood. There are about 15 000 investigations performed worldwide until now, but
      systematic data on performance in a community based setting are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate safety, quality assurance and quality control of colon capsule
      endoscopy.
