      omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA), fibers, protein as well as mineral, vitamins (trace elements)
      are essential for cancer patients to improve health status and tolerability of chemotherapy.
      Hence, oncologic nutritionist strongly recommends cancer patients (with cachexia) to consume
      a diet rich in protein and dietary fibers along with balanced essential micronutrients like
      vitamins and minerals (Van Norren et al., 2009; Yeh et al., 2013). From the above statement,
      it cleared that nutritional support is a crucial aspect of multi-modal cancer care, by
      improving the overall health status by suppressing various adverse events as well as enhance
      treatment regimen for a speedy recovery. Hence, the present multi-centered, randomized
      clinical trial was framed to evaluate the efficacy of ready to use balanced nutritional
      formula-PCNF (rich in ω-3 FA, fibers, MTC, BCAA, and micro-nutrients), in various cancer
      patient by checking calorie intake and overall health status through assessing various
      anthropometric and biochemical parameters especially total proteins, pre-albumin, and
      transferrin.
