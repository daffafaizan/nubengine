      objective is to determine

        1. Do bronchiolitis patients tolerate aerosolized Infasurf?

        2. Does aerosolized Infasurf induce an improvement in respiration?

        3. If it does how large a dose is required to observe a positive effect?

        4. Is the positive effect transient, if so what is the range of duration of the effect?

        5. Does retreatment also result and a positive response?

        6. Does aerosolized Infasurf result in more rapid sustained improvement? is superior to.
