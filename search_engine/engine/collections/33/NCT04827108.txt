      inhibitors and neuroleptic drugs. Nevertheless, anti-emetics alone are not sufficient to
      manage these two symptoms. This poor symptom control could be due to healthcare
      professionals' perception that nausea and vomiting are solely biological problems, and their
      heavy reliance on pharmacological treatment for management. After literature search, we can
      identify only one validated instrument, the Pediatric Nausea Assessment tool (PeNAT),
      assessing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children. Yet, this instruments is not
      available in Chinese. This study aims to translate and validate an instrument (PeNAT) which
      can assess nausea and vomiting among Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents undergoing
      chemotherapy
