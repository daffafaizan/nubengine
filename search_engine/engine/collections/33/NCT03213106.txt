      to several aetiologies, from degenerative to genetic and vascular diseases. Patients will be
      submitted to a neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the dentate nucleus
      contralateral to the most symptomatic side. After that, participants will be randomly
      assigned to 5 active or 5 placebo sessions of 1Hz TMS over the located area. After the first
      5 sessions and a period of at least 4 weeks washout, patients will cross over and receive
      other 5 sessions, active or sham. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before and
      after active and sham cluster of sessions.
