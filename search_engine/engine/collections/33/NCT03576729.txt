      system (CNS) impairment. The role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress is one avenue of
      investigation which may clarify the broad neurological impairment in MPS I. Finding
      biomarkers that accurately describe the underlying and ongoing brain pathology is a key not
      only to understanding the disease, but also to understanding the possibility of new
      therapeutic approaches for MPS I patients.

      The investigator will compare patients with Hurler syndrome, and Hurler-Scheie or Scheie
      syndrome, with healthy controls. There will be 10 participants in each group, resulting in a
      total of 30 participants. Within the Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome group, the investigator
      will examine the association of clinical severity with the proposed measures. These findings
      might help determine whether hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which is the treatment
      for Hurler syndrome patients, results in decreased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as
      compared to Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome patients, who are treated by enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT). Additionally, these findings might help determine whether therapies directed
      at reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in MPS I could enhance neurological
      outcomes.

      Study hypothesis: neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are present in MPS I subjects and
      are reflective of disease severity.
