      wide. Patients are diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
      (FIGO) stage III to IV disease in 75%. The 10-year survival of women with advanced-stage
      ovarian cancer is 10% to 15% and has not improve in the past 20 years. Despite treatment with
      maximal cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and platinum-based chemotherapy, approximately 70% of
      patients with advanced-stage disease relapse within 18 months. Given this high number of
      recurrences, new approaches are needed to improve outcomes for these patients. Historically,
      peritoneal carcinomatosis represents a devastating form of cancer progression with a very
      poor prognosis.

      Objectives:

      Compare overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among ovarian cancer
      patients who underwent into cytoreduction and HIPEC procedure vs patients who only received
      systemic chemotherapy in a 10-years follow up of a case-control study

      Methods:

      Cases were defined as patients treated by cytoreduction and HIPEC, and were matched (1:2)
      with patients treated with chemotherapy only, defined as controls. PFS and OS in the two
      groups were measured and compared. PFS was calculated from initiation of treatment to
      progression, death or to the last known follow-up. OS was calculated from initiation of
      treatment to death or to the last known follow-up.
