      devastating and disabling disease.

      Shire Human Genetic Therapies (Shire HGT) is developing a sulfamidase enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT)rhHNS for patients with MPS IIIA. rhHNS is being administered into the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device
      (IDDD), because when administered intravenously (IV) it does not cross the blood brain
      barrier (BBB).

      This is a multicenter study designed to collect long-term safety and tolerability data in
      patients with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A (MPS IIIA) who received rhHNS via a surgically
      implanted intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD) in study HGT-SAN-055 and elected to
      continue therapy.Patients will continue in the treatment group as they participated in the
      HGT-SAN-055 study (rhHNS administered by IT injection 10 mg once per month, 45 mg once per
      month or 90 mg once per month.

      The study duration will be a maximum duration of 8 years of rhHNS treatment or until rhHNS is
      commercially available, the patient discontinues from the study, the Sponsor stops the study,
      or the Sponsor discontinues the development of rhHNS.
