      (CDSMP), tailored towards workers on sick-leave. The original program has been developed by
      The Stanford Patient Education Research Center. The translation and adaptation has been
      conducted by The Danish Committee for Health Education.

      Previous studies have examined the program with respect to specific chronic diseases (e.g.,
      Arthritis), quality of life, well-being and health-care utilization, though non-otherwise
      specified workers on sick-leave and return work have not been examined before.

      The framework of CDSMP is social-cognitive learning theory in which self-efficacy plays a
      central role.
