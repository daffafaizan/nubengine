      syndrome (PCOS), who underwent either unilateral or bilateral laparoscopic diathermy at the
      Clinical Hospital Split, Croatia. PCOS was diagnosed following the Rotterdam consensus
      criteria. In the ULOD group, we treated the right ovary with thermal dose of 60 J applied per
      one cubic centimeter of ovarian. In the comparator, BLOD group, all patients received 600 J
      per ovary. The follow-up period encompassed six menstrual cycles for all subjects.Sample size
      was based on the test of the primary hypothesis that ULOD treatment would result in a higher
      ovulation rate than BLOD. In our pilot study in 61 patients, ovulation rates were estimated
      to 44% in the BLOD arm and 69% in the ULOD arm. Assuming 5% significance and 80% power, we
      calculated that the minimal sample size for a one-sided test had to be 96 patients.

      The aims of our prospective study:

        1. Compare the efficiency of the right ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume
           (60 J/cm3) with the BLOD method at constant dose and to assess treatment efficiency and
           predict ovulatory response based on clinical parameters (right or left ovary and its
           volume) and received thermal doses.

        2. Evidence the effects of ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume on endocrine
           (changes in androgen and AMH) and reproductive outcomes (ovulation rate) in
           clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS.

        3. To determine whether unilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling (ULOD) using thermal doses
           adjusted to ovarian volume diminishes ovarian reserve less than bilateral LOD (BLOD)
           using a fixed thermal dose
