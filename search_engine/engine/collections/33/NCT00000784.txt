      resulting in an incorrect assessment of the effects of the investigational therapeutic agent.
      Since the special populations targeted by the CPCRA for inclusion in HIV-related clinical
      research do not typify those traditionally included in clinical trials or compliance
      research, it is necessary to elucidate and examine the special needs of these populations and
      to determine the extent to which these needs manifest themselves as potential barriers to
      protocol compliance.

      Patients who are enrolled on protocols CPCRA 006 and/or 007 are given a baseline
      questionnaire to complete during the enrollment visit for the qualifying treatment protocol.
      The survey concerns the patient's work, primary language, support systems, residence status,
      perception of disease and treatments, and substance use. At 4-month follow-up visits,
      patients are asked to complete a self-report questionnaire, which assesses the patient's
      perceptions of difficulties in protocol compliance requirements, clinic/office visits, and
      health beliefs. The duration of patients on this study will be defined by the qualifying
      protocol requirements.
