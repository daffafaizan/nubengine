      drug-drug interactions with rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, pravastatin, atorvastatin, and
      simvastatin in healthy male and female subjects. Thirty-four (34) subjects will be enrolled
      in Part 1 (rosuvastatin) and based on review of the PK and safety/tolerability data, a
      decision will be made on whether to proceed with Part 2. Part 2 consists of 2 arms
      (sulfasalazine and pravastatin). Twenty-six (26) subjects will be enrolled into each arm.
      Part 3 consists of 2 arms (atorvastatin and simvastatin). Twenty-four (24) subjects will be
      enrolled into each arm after enrollment in Part 2 is completed. Subjects will be in the study
      for up to 72 days, including a 28-day screening period, 6-14 day in clinic period, and a
      30-day follow up period post last dose. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at
      pre-defined time points throughout the study.
