      beginning early in training, much-needed data is lacking on interventions to decrease burnout
      and improve well-being amongst resident physicians. The primary objective was to design and
      evaluate the impact of a departmental-level burnout intervention for otolaryngology
      residents. The secondary objective was to describe how residents utilized and perceived the
      study intervention.

      All current residents in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Minnesota were
      solicited for participation. Inclusion criteria included all residents willing to complete
      the study protocol. Exclusion criteria included the principal investigator. All 19 eligible
      residents consented to participate. All participants were assigned two hours of weekly,
      protected non-clinical time alternating with a control period of no intervention at 6 week
      intervals.

      Burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Mini-Z Questionnaire
      (Mini-Z). Well-being was measured by the Resident and Fellow Well-Being Index (WBI) and a
      quality-of-life (QOL) single-item self-assessment (SA). In addition to baseline demographic
      survey, participants completed the aforementioned surveys at approximately 6-week intervals
      from October 2017 to July 2018.
