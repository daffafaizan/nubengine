      polyunsaturated fatty acids, were provided for 6 weeks to healthy men, in a randomized
      controlled intervention study with two arms.

      Healthy, untrained, non-obese male subjects (27-45 years) were included in the study. The
      experimental diets are eucaloric, and thus provided so the subjects remains weight stable.

      Before and after the intervention, two experimental days was conducted (2 experiments before
      and 2 experiments after the intervention).

      At pre-intervention, subjects completed a high-fat meal test and insulin sensitivity was
      measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. On both days, blood and tissue biopsies
      were obtained. These two experimental days were repeated at the end of the 6 weeks
      intervention.

      The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was combined with stable isotope infusion (deuterium
      labelled glucose) in order to measure hepatic glucose production. Before the clamp, a
      catheter is inserted into the femoral vein, to enable measurement of insulin stimulated
      glucose uptake across the leg. Biopsies are obtained by the needle biopsy method from the
      vastus lateralis muscle and peri-umbilical subcutaneous adipose tissue. Blood samples were
      analyzed for glucose, insulin, inflammatory markers, gut hormones, adipokines, plasma fatty
      acid composition, and lipoprotein profile. Indirect calorimetric was also applied to measure
      substrate oxidation during the experimental days.
