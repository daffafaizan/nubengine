      25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 25OHD ) level was found to be associated with preeclampsia,
      gestational diabetes, infectious diseases, decrease in fetal bone mineralization, and
      increase in fetal respiratory infections and infant wheezing [1].

      Requirement of vitamin D is primarily met by the exposure of skin to sun and secondarily by
      intake of food. The provision of vitamin D from the skin depends upon melanin pigment, the
      use of sun screens, age, dressing style and seasonal changes [1]. Placenta plays an important
      role in Vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy and some independent risk factors increasing
      the risk of placental dysfunction at fetomaternal interface also influence vitamin D
      metabolism [2,3]. Nevertheless, there can be a pathological change resulting from the effects
      of environmental factors on the placenta .
