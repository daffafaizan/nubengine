      Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most important treatment choices in locally advanced
      NSCLC. Combination of RT and chemotherapy could improve treatment outcomes. However, the
      combined modality could not be used in many patients due to severe toxicities. EGFR-TKI shows
      great efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC, and many phase I/II studies established its safety
      in combination with RT. This phase II study is to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      the combination of RT and erlotinib in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC. Eligible
      patients include patients with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC, who are not suitable for or refused to
      receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Eligible patients will receive oral erlotinib (150mg
      qd)throughout the course of thoracic RT (60-70 Gy). The primary endpoint is progression free
      survival and the second endpoints are overall survival and any grade III and above
      toxicities. We are going to recruit 50 patients for this study.
