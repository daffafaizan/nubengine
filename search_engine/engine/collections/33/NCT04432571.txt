      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and saved upwards of 60 million life-years, progress has been
      uneven and adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 14-24 years represent a key group left
      behind. Compared to adults, AYA with HIV face more numerous, more diverse and more intense
      barriers to adherence and retention. The investigators will utilize a SMART study design in
      two stages among 880 AYA with HIV in Kenya to improve retention and viral suppression. In
      stage 1 AYA will be randomized 1:1 to either (1) standard of care education or counseling vs.
      (2) electronic navigation. Participants who do well (no lapses in retention, medication pick
      up and viral suppression) will be maintained on these low-intensity interventions, whereas
      those who fail will be re-randomized a second time to one of three re-engagement
      interventions (stage 2): (1) standard of care tracing, (2) a conditional cash transfer and
      (3) in-person peer navigation. The primary outcome will be a combination of visit adherence
      and documented viral load suppression. The investigators anticipate that enrolling 880 AYA
      will result in 99% power to detect a 15% difference in the primary outcome between
      intervention groups. The investigators believe this study will yield evidence specific to AYA
      with HIV, quantify the relative magnitude of different sequenced interventions, capture the
      costs, and have direct relevance for public health programming to end the AIDS epidemic
      through engaging adolescents and young adults with HIV.
