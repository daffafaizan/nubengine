    
      Patients of the Department of Endocrinology, who routinely perform bone density tests, DXA
      (Dual Energy X-ray absorpiometry) test on the lumbar spine, proximal femoral and distal
      radius, will be invited for a visit, and after signing the informed consent form, the
      following data will be collected: age, BMI, first menstrual period and last menstrual period,
      family history of osteoporosis, history of osteoporotic fractures, smoking, alcohol use and
      exercise habits. In addition, blood tests will be performed: calcium phosphate, albumin,
      alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D level, thyroid function, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) FSH
      (Follicle Stimulating Hormone), Estradiol, and serum bone turnover index (CTX P1NP). Amount
      of blood taken: 12 ml The patients will then be sent to the Alfredo Federico Strauss Center
      for Computerized Neuroimaging at Tel Aviv University for an MRI study of the distal radius.
      The study results will be analyzed by an expert bone radiologist from the Sourasky Medical
      Center to reject any kind of pathology (such as a fracture, inflammation, tumor), and further
      analyzed for bone marrow fat fraction by Tel Aviv University researchers. In the case of
      abnormal findings, they will be mentioned in the report and the participants will receive
      recommendations from the appropriate expert.
