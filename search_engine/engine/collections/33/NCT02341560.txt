      enroll approximately 800 subjects with recent-onset NAION. Subjects will be randomized into
      one of 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, and assigned to receive QPI-1007 and/or a sham procedure.
      Subjects will have a two in three (66%) chance of receiving active treatment (no sham
      procedure) and a one in three (33%) chance of receiving sham procedure (no active treatment).
      Total study time involvement is approximately 12 months.
