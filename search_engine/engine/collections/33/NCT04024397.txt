      to new opioid users who do not progress to UPOU. At each site, opioid-na√Øve adults who
      receive opioid prescriptions will be enrolled. Opioid prescriptions (both written and filled)
      and self-reported opioid use will be followed, and those subjects progressing to UPOU will be
      identified in real time. Matched samples of patients who do and do not develop UPOU will be
      recruited for assessment of framework elements related to patient characteristics,including
      biochemical confirmation of opioid use, pain-related measures (including psychological
      variables), and medical and social histories. Using the information gathered in Aim 1,
      structural equation modeling will be utilized to evaluate the associations UPOU and the
      patient domain.
