    
      Mpowerment (MP) is an evidence-based community-level, structural, social and behavioral
      intervention for HIV prevention developed for YMSM that targets individual and community
      empowerment and mobilization, self-affirmation, sexual self-knowledge, and creation of a
      supportive social environment. MP has been widely used in the U.S., but not in a mostly
      Muslim setting. This project will adapt and pilot MP for the sociocultural issues facing YMSM
      (age 18-29) in Beirut. There will be a 2-year pilot implementation of MP, with longitudinal
      cohorts of YMSM in Beirut and Jounieh, the latter being the control community. Primary
      outcomes will be unprotected anal sex and HIV testing, with secondary outcomes being
      engagement in peer outreach, and perceived peer norms related to condom use and HIV testing.
