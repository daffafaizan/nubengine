      enrolled are treated with tocilizumab. Two-week (14 days) and one-month (30 days) lethality
      rates are the co-primary endpoints.

      The parallel cohort includes patients who are treated with tocilizumab and cannot enter the
      phase 2 study because:

        1. emergency conditions or infrastructural or operational limits prevented registration
           before the administration of the experimental drug or

        2. they had been intubated more than 24 hours before registration or

        3. the phase 2 study has been closed due to reached sample size.

      This means that, after closure of the phase 2 enrolment, patients who might be eligible for
      the phase 2 study will be included in the observational cohort study.

      The same information planned for the phase 2 cohort is required also for the parallel cohort
      study whose sample size is not defined a priori, and that will close at the end of the
      overall project. All the patients enrolled are treated with tocilizumab.

      In both study groups (phase 2 and parallel cohort), participants receive one dose of
      Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 800mg per dose). A second administration (same dose)
      can be given after 12 hours if respiratory function has not recovered, at discretion of the
      Investigator.
