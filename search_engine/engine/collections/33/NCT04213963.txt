      the severity of hypertension. The wide variation of the reported PA prevalence is due to
      different study design and population. Very few data derive from well designed prospective
      study. Additional problems in the interpretation of study results are the different
      diagnostic cut-off used in various centers and the low diffusion of the adrenal vein
      sampling, that has a central role in the PA diagnosis.

      Resistant hypertension (RH) is a condition of insufficient BP control, despite appropriate
      lifestyle measures and treatment with at least 3 drugs at full dose, including a diuretic, in
      patients whose adherence to therapy has been confirmed. The primary aim of our study is
      define prospectively the prevalence of PA in RH.

      Moreover, emerging evidence supports the crucial role of elevated serum aldosterone in
      promoting cardiovascular disease, independently from high BP levels. Aldosterone improves
      oxidative stress, inflammation, impairs insulin metabolic signaling, reduced
      endothelial-mediated vasorelaxation and is associated to cardiovascular and renal
      abnormalities. However, current data on the contribution of PA on cardiometabolic
      complications have heterogeneous results.

      The secondary outcome of our study is to investigate prospectively the association of PA with
      cardiometabolic complications in a cohort of patients with RH.
