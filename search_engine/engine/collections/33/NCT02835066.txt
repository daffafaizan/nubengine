    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the correlation of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
      outcomes with clinical/treatment variables as well as a panel of both function/fitness and
      psychosocial health assessments in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the panel of function/fitness and psychosocial health assessments with
      patient's smoking history/status as a predictor for treatment related toxicity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The documentation of the NSCLC lung population from this prospective combined with others.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients scheduled for surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy complete the European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire
      (QLQ)-core 30 (C30) and QLQ-Lung Cancer 13 (LC13) in addition to psychosocial health and
      smoking status questions from baseline up to 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment, 5-6
      weeks after treatment begins, and 5-6 months from the start of treatment. During the same
      time points, patients also undergo function/fitness assessments including standard health
      measurements, short physical performance battery (SPPB), 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and a
      grip strength test.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
