      underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia. Before and after the induction of
      anesthesia, StO2 monitoring and VOT were performed to investigate the effect of anesthesia on
      microcirculation. To investigate the effect of age on microcirculation, the patients were
      divided into two different groups, young (< 65 yrs) and old (> 65 yrs) groups, and the
      VOT-derived parameters and hemodynamics between two groups were compared.
