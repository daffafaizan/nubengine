      reflection of their non-affected limb in a mirror. There was also a placebo group and these
      patients walked on the treadmill and viewed a mirror in an altered position. Patients were
      referred through Hospital Health Professionals. Prior to trial commencement all participants
      were given comprehensive trial information and provided signed written informed consent. A
      total of 30 participants were recruited. Patients attended the study for 30 minutes per day,
      three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome assessment prior to the
      beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three month followup assessment. All
      assessments were carried out by a Chartered Physiotherapist specialising in stroke
      rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome measures for lower limb
      motor function, muscle tone, walking speed and endurance.
