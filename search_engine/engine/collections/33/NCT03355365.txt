    
      The IT-MSC-NP treatments and all clinical assessments will take place at a single center
      (Tisch MSRCNY). Study subjects will be assigned to blocks stratified by baseline EDSS score
      (3.0-4.0, 4.5-5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) and disease subtype (SPMS or PPMS). Study subjects are
      randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to study treatment and placebo at initial randomization.
      Subjects in each block will be randomized into placebo or treatment group. In the second
      year, treated subjects will cross over to the placebo group and placebo subjects will cross
      over to the treated group.

      The total study duration will be 3 years upon enrollment. Each study subject will be required
      to attend up to 18 study visits, to include 1 screening visit, 1 bone marrow visit, 1
      baseline visit, followed by study visits every 2 months during the treatment period of two
      years (12 treatment/LP procedure visits and 2 outcome visits), and an additional follow-up
      visit at the end of year 3.
