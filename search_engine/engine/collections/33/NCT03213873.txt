      essential for balance control. New findings suggest that intensive, challenging and
      cognitively demanding exercises could induce neuroplasticity in PD. A new balance training
      (the HiBalance program) have therefore been developed; emphasizing critical aspects of
      balance control through highly challenging and progressive exercises incorporating
      dual/multi-tasking (Conradsson et al, 2012). In an RCT, the HiBalance-program was shown to
      improve balance, gait and physical activity level in favor for the training group (Conradsson
      et al, 2015). In this proposal the investigators will combine physiotherapy, neurology and
      neuroimaging to characterise and determine the effects on physical and cognitive symptoms as
      well as structural and functional changes and wet biomarkers in the brain after the training.

      Participants will be recruited through Karolinska University Hospital and via announcements
      in relevant forums like for instance the Swedish Parkinson Association. According to earlier
      power calculations for detecting effects in balance and gait measures after this particular
      intervention, the investigators anticipate 40 to 50 participants in each group to detect
      significant changes.

      The investigators will perform both per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis
      using mixed model or repeated measurement ANOVAs if the data is normally distributed.
