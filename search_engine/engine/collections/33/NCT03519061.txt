      saline rinse twice daily for 90 days. At the completion of this therapy, their clinical
      situation will be reassessed and patients will either proceed to surgery or not. If eligible
      patients choose not participate, they will be offered surgery up front. The study will be
      assessing symptom scores using the SNOT-22 validated patient reported symptoms score, CT
      scans, and other measures. The study hypothesizes that a significant portion of patients that
      otherwise would have progressed to surgery will no longer need to have surgery based upon
      improvements in their overall symptoms scores after using budesonise irrigations.
