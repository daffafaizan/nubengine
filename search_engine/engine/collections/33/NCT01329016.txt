      regimens are currently used for the management of GDM. Following failure of diet therapy,
      insulin, glyburide and metformin are all used in the treatment of GDM with the oral
      medications providing comparable outcomes with insulin but easier route of administration and
      schedule. The proposed work will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      of glyburide and metformin alone and in combination in order to lay the foundation in
      establishing dosage and response information that could be utilized in designing a phase III
      randomized trial that will ultimately evaluate GDM treatment optimization.
