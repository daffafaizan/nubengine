      that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network,
      but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that
      processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss
      problems. In a pilot trial in 43 obese participants, investigators tested the feasibility of
      the Habit mobile application when paired with a shortened (8 week) behavioral weight loss
      intervention. Feasibility outcomes included frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app
      and each feature, recruitment, and retention. The investigators also performed analyses on
      problem solving skills and weight loss at 8 and 16 weeks, which will inform a subsequent
      randomized controlled efficacy trial. Data will support an efficacy trial of a Habit-assisted
      brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss
      intervention alone with 1 year follow-up. The investigators overarching goal is to develop
      mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible
      while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden reach.
