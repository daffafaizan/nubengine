      informed consent will undergo a 1 day screening period to determine eligibility for study
      entry. At day 0, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a
      double blind manner (participant and investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to metformin glycinate (620
      mg, taken orally, twice daily) plus standard treatment or placebo (taken orally, twice daily)
      plus standard treatment, both for 14 days.
