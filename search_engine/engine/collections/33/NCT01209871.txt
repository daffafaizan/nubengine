      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of using a novel lymphoma deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) vaccine encoding macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3a)-fused lymphoma
      idiotype in single chain format.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the vaccine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine to generate tumor-specific cellular and
      humoral immune responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive autologous lymphoma immunoglobulin-derived single-chain variable fragment
      (scFV)-chemokine DNA vaccine intradermally (ID) at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.
