      Anemia in STEC-HUS is treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. It can causes
      hypervolemia, hyperkalemia, exacerbate the thrombotic state of the disease, transmit
      infectious agents and trigger antigenic sensitization. Anemia is mainly due to hemolysis, but
      deficit of erythropoietin synthesis (EPO) may aggravate it. Although recombinant human EPO is
      frequently used in children with STEC-HUS there is no adequate evidence of its benefit. If it
      is confirmed that EPO reduce the number of RBC transfusions, its administration could
      diminish the aforementioned risks and also reduce costs.

      Objective:

      To determine if EPO administration decreases the number of RBC transfusions and; secondarily,
      to assess if its levels influence on transfusion requirement.

      Methodology:

      Randomized, open controlled clinical trial. We will include 28 patients (14 per arm) <18
      years with STEC-HUS admitted to our hospital. They will be grouped after randomization:(1)
      One to standard of care (RBC transfusions with hemoglobin ≤7 mg / dl and/or hemodynamic
      instability) and (2) the other to standard of care plus EPO (50 u / kg subcutaneous three
      times weekly) and RBC transfusions with hemoglobin ≤7 mg / dl). Serum EPO will be measured by
      ELISA and together with the clinical and laboratory variables, association with RBC
      transfusions number will be sought. Written informed consent and assent when appropriate,
      will be requested prior to enter into the study.
