    
      A multi-centered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study
      to compare the safety and efficacy of Omnitram (30 mg to 120 mg daily) and placebo in
      patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy. For subjects receiving treatment for
      neuropathic pain prior to study enrollment, their treatment will be tapered and stopped at
      least 2 weeks before they will be enrolled. Approximately fifty subjects will be randomized
      in a double-blind manner to a 4-week treatment period of Omnitram or placebo. After a washout
      of at least one week, patients will cross-over to the other treatment for a second 4 week
      treatment period with Omnitram or placebo.

      During the first two weeks of each treatment period, guided by efficacy and tolerability, the
      dose will be increased from 3 tablets to 12 tablets per day given in three equal doses at
      approximately at 8 am, 2 pm and 8 pm (i.e., if the tablet is Omnitram, 30, 60, 90 or 120
      mg/day). During the final two weeks of the treatment period, the doses will be kept constant
      at the highest tolerated titrated dose. Up to six tablets daily of 500 mg oral acetaminophen
      can be used as rescue medication except on the last 4 days of each treatment segment (Days
      26, 27, 28, and 29).
