      thromboembolic risk, while taking into account the risk of bleeding.

      It is known that patients admitted for acute pathology have an eight-fold higher incidence of
      thromboembolic events than the general population.

      The Padua Prediction Score (PPS) is currently considered the best score available for the
      evaluation of thromboembolic risk in hospitalized patients, while the IMPROVE score was
      developed and validated for the assessment of bleeding risk in the same population of
      hospitalized patients.

      In a recent study, data from the real world showed us how many of the patients admitted in
      Internal Medicine were at high thrombotic risk according to PPS and almost 90% of these were
      simultaneously at low hemorrhagic risk according to the IMPROVE score: in these patients
      pharmacological prophylaxis could therefore be prescribed during a safe stay.

      Until now only a small prospective monocentric quasi-randomized study has shown that the use
      of systematic PPS reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events (symptomatic and
      non-symptomatic) upon discharge, compared to clinical judgment alone.

      For these reasons, FADOI Foundation has promoted a multicenter controlled randomized cluster
      study in a real-life context among patients admitted to medical area departments. The aim of
      the study will be to analyze the effects of a systematic evaluation of patients (in centers
      that do not require the use of any score for the evaluation of thromboembolic risk), using
      the Padua Prediction Score (PPS) and the IMPROVE Bleeding score vs only clinical judgment for
      the use of antithrombotic prophylaxis and clinical outcomes (thromboembolic and haemorrhagic
      events). The main objective of the study is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      systematic evaluation of the thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk in reducing the number of
      major complications in patients admitted to Internal Medicine, at a 90-day follow-up after
      hospital discharge.
