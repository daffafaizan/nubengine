      giving way, pain, and weakness and recurrent risk, which may lead to functional
      insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic ankle
      instability using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) and investigate the
      independent associated factors.

      The data was collected from adult volunteers by questionnaire including sociodemographic
      information, general medical condition, history of orthopedic surgery, pain intensity, and
      the number of painful areas of the foot. 273 adult volunteers participated in the study,
      through face to face or online. Subjects are classified as having CAI with a CAIT score â‰¤27.
