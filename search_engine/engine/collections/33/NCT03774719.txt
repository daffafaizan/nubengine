    
      Hand-carried ultrasound is an increasingly popular imaging modality and is widely used by
      emergency physicians, intensivists, trauma doctors and cardiologists. Renal ultrasonography
      is commonly ordered for patients with acute kidney injury, with a main focus on identifying
      obstruction of the collecting system, a rare but potentially reversible cause of acute kidney
      injury.

      This study's aim is to evaluate if nephrology and internal medicine trainees can accurately
      rule out dilation of the renal collecting system on ultrasound (hydronephrosis) using
      hand-carried ultrasound (HCU). Trainees will undergo a short, uniform and well described
      ultrasound training program. Patients will be adults that are hospitalized and have acute or
      subacute kidney dysfunction. The investigators will assess sensitivity, specificity, positive
      and negative predictive value of HCU compared to radiology performed ultrasound, and
      calculate potential cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system.
