    
      A randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover design will compare the short-term (two and
      four week) response to FDSP intake compared to an isocaloric control powder in overweight and
      obese adults. Twenty overweight or obese male or postmenopausal females (40-65 years of age)
      will be randomized to consume 39 g of FDSP or a control powder for four weeks in a crossover
      design with a four week washout period. Changes in stool microbial communities and microbial
      metabolites will be assessed, and examined for their potential influence on microvascular
      function.
