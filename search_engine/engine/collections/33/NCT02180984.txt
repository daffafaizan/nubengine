      include the evaluation of the effects of rTMS on food craving, body weight, brain activity,
      cognition, general psychopathology, hormonal regulation and neurobiological markers. Methods:
      Sixty obese females with BED will be randomized to receive 20 sessions of rTMS (n=30) or
      placebo (n=30) scattered 3 days/week.

      Expected Results: Primarily it is expected that rTMS intervention will decrease BE frequency.
      Consequently, body weight will be reduced. It is also expected that food craving be
      decreased, cognitive performance be enhanced, and neurobiological markers be improved.
