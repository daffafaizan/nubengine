    
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of supervised
      exercise training intensity -concomitant to lifestyle counselling- as a Primary Health Care
      intervention tool for the management of the metabolic syndrome in low active adults with one
      or more metabolic risk factors.

      Secondary aims of the study are to investigate the effects of these interventions on systemic
      inflammation and adipose tissue function, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and
      sedentary habits, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with regard to health
      related quality of life.

      The general hypothesis is that adults with risk factors for metabolic syndrome participating
      in interventions for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle that together with counselling
      strategies will include supervised physical exercise of vigorous intensity will present
      greater improvements in terms of metabolic risk, physical condition, physical
      activity/sedentary behaviours and psychological parameters at the end of the intervention and
      at 6-months follow-up than participants in interventions for the promotion of a healthy
      lifestyle that will include counselling plus physical exercise of low-to-moderate intensity
      or interventions based exclusively on counselling.

      It is a three arms controlled randomized clinical trial implemented in the Primary Health
      Care setting and of 10 months duration.

      Adults aged 30 to 52 years with metabolic risk factors will be randomized in three
      intervention groups that will be given one of the following: assessment on healthy lifestyle
      plus high intensity physical exercise supervision (3 individual and 6 group sessions + 16
      supervised training lessons); assessment plus low-to-moderate intensity physical exercise
      supervision (3 individual and 6 group sessions + 16 supervised training lessons) or
      assessment-based programme without physical exercise supervision (3 individual and 6 group
      sessions).

      The main output variables evaluated will be: a) risk factors for the metabolic syndrome
      (waist circumference, blood pressure, and plasma triglycerides, high density lipoproteins and
      glucose), systemic inflammation and adipose tissue functionality, physical activity habits
      and sedentary conducts, dietary habits, quality of life related to health, self-efficacy and
      empowerment. The economic cost will also be analysed to determine the cost-effectiveness of
      the program. These variables will be assessed 3 times alongside the study: at baseline, at
      the end of the 4 months intervention, and at 6 months follow-up. It has been estimated to
      recruit 33 participants per group, which are 100 participants.
