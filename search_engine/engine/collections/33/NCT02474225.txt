      to treat a variety of retinal and choroidal neovascular diseases. The introduction of
      additional fluid into the vitreous cavity by intravitreal therapy would be expected to cause
      an immediate rise in the intraocular pressure.

      Although there is one study showed no significant changes in the intraocular pressure many
      retrospective studies showed the impacts on the intraocular pressure elevation. The
      investigators aim to prospective evaluate the intraocular pressure change in non-glaucomatous
      patients receiving an intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
