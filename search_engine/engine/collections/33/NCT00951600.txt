    
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 10 mL of oxcarbazepine 300
      mg/5 mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5rnL) was administered using a 10 mL
      graduated syringe, during each period of the study under the supervision of trained study
      personnel, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.

      A total of forty (40) subjects were administered a single oral dose of the test or reference
      formulation of 10 mL of oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5 mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine
      300 mg/5mL) according to a randomization schedule. Thirty-five (35) subjects completed both
      the periods of the study.
