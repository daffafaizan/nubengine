    
      Lateral epicondylitis, also called tennis elbow, is the most common disease in elbow-pain
      symptoms. The major mechanism is overuse of the flexors, extensors and supination muscles in
      the wrist, causing micro-trauma in the muscles attachment to the lateral epicondyle of the
      elbow. The long-term accumulated and poor repaired trauma causes myofascial trigger points in
      the related muscles. Patients often describe pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain
      can be further elicited with passive wrist flexion and by resisting active wrist extension.
      Symptoms also include weakness in the grip strength and limitation of elbow motion.
      Therefore, it can have a major impact on the patient's activity of daily life, including
      turning a doorknob, lifting a full coffee cup to mouth, or wringing out a dish rag.

      Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN), as one of the dry needle treatments, performed by swaying a
      disposable Fu's subcutaneous needle parallel to the underlying muscles after penetrating the
      skin to the subcutaneous fascia. With the reperfusion activities, myofascial pain and soft
      tissue pain caused by myofascial trigger points can be decreased effective simultaneously. So
      far, there is no solid research or clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment
      yet.

      The investigators will conduct the randomized experiment to evaluate the immediate,
      short-term, and long-term effect of FSN. The outcome measures include visual analog scale,
      patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation questionnaire, pressure pain threshold, pain-free grip
      test, muscle tone changes and ultrasonographic evaluaton of the common extensor tendon.
