      session are repetitive and do not rely on the physiotherapist's expertise, and could be
      performed and observed by automated means. The developed system will detect patient body
      postures and movements with data collected through sensors such as accelerometers. This data
      will be pattern matched to a predetermined movement pattern and feedback will be provided for
      patients regarding accuracy of their exercises. This data can be logged for the
      physiotherapist to examine at a later time. By automating this component of a rehabilitation
      session, the system will allow the physiotherapist to focus diagnosis and other tasks that
      will better utilize their training. The specific application for this prototype will be
      post-operative knee/hip replacement patients, so all devices must be non-invasive and must
      not interfere with normal recovery processes.

      A previous version of this experiment on healthy participants has been successfully
      performed. This study would like to examine the feasibility of this system on rehabilitation
      subjects, as the movement patterns of a subject in physical rehabilitation may be
      dramatically different then a healthy subject. No intervention is suggested by the system, as
      this study is observational.
