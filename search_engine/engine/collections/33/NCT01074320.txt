    
      Specific Aims: 1) identify a core set of instruments for measuring musculoskeletal symptoms,
      2) model the time course and predictors of change in musculoskeletal symptoms, 3) explore the
      effect of musculoskeletal symptoms on adherence to AIs in women during the first 6 months of
      AI treatment.

      Methods: We will prospectively assess musculoskeletal symptoms due to treatment with
      aromatase inhibitors. Post-menopausal women beginning AI treatment for hormone responsive
      breast cancer will be invited to join this study.
