      with low-dose twice daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy can safely be switched to
      other modes of controller therapy without loss of asthma control. Patients demonstrating good
      control on twice-daily low-dose ICS will be randomized to one of three treatment groups:
      once-daily low-dose ICS (fluticasone), leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast), or
      once-daily combination therapy (fluticasone-salmeterol).
