      endometriosis based on symptomatology who plan on undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy will be
      offered enrollment in the study. They will complete preoperative pain assessments with the
      tools outlined above. At the time of diagnostic laparoscopy, patients found to have
      endometriosis will be staged according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine
      guidelines. Patients with Stage 4 or deeply infiltrating endometriosis will be excluded from
      the study. At that point, the patients will be randomized in the operating room to either
      laparoscopic excision of endometriosis or laparoscopic ablation with the argon beam
      coagulator. Patients will be stratified according to the presence or absence of the
      Levonorgestrel-Intrauterine Device.

      Pain assessments will be performed immediately postoperatively in the recovery area. Pain
      assessments will again be performed at 4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. We will use the VAS
      pain scale and validated questionnaires.
