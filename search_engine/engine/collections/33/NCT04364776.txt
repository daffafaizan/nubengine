    
      Specific aim (one):

      To collect and analyze CT scans at diagnosis and after chemoradiation, and assign them to a
      specific radiomic signature (blind assessment).

      Specific aim (two):

        -  To correlate the radiomics signatures to clinical outcome: the main measure will be
           progression-free survival at 6 months, the second will be overall survival at 24 months.

        -  As an exploratory study, to investigate for the tumor mutational burden (TMB, on biopsy
           tissue baseline) and its possible correlation with response/progression.

      This is an observational longitudinal retrospective/prospective study.

      Criteria for study entry:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer
           (NSCLC)

        -  Age 18-80

        -  Stage IIIA-C disease judged to be unresectable by a multidisciplinary team including
           pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists.

        -  Signed informed consent

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Inability to sign the informed consent

        -  Absence of analyzed CT images

      Treatment:

      As per indication, patients should have received a thoracic radiation dose of at least 54 Gy
      to the primary tumor and lymph nodes; all techniques are allowed. Conventional fractionation
      or mild hypofractionation is also allowed. All different platinum-based chemotherapy regimens
      are admitted for the present study in combination with radiotherapy, given either
      concomitantly or sequentially, according to International Guidelines for combination therapy
      in locally advanced NSCLC.
