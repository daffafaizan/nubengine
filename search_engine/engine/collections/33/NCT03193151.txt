      histology (the Banff system), an arbitrary international empirical consensus based on lesions
      and rules, similar in principle to the kidney, heart, and lung histology systems. Recent
      data-driven approaches using molecular and conventional technologies indicate that such
      systems frequently produce incorrect diagnoses - perhaps 40-50% in abnormal kidney or heart
      transplant biopsies and even more in lung biopsies, with great potential for harm to patients
      due to inappropriate treatment.

      To address this unmet need and improve diagnostics in the area of organ transplantation, the
      Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC, University of Alberta) has developed a new
      diagnostic system - the Molecular MicroscopeÂ® Diagnostic System (MMDx) that interprets
      biopsies in terms of their molecular phenotype, and combines the molecular and
      histopathological features of transplant biopsies, plus clinical and laboratory parameters,
      to create the first Integrated Diagnostic System. The MMDx, developed first in kidney
      transplant biopsies because phenotypes are well established, will now be adapted to liver
      transplant biopsies. The present study will develop a Reference Set of liver biopsies, adapt
      the MMDx system to assess and report molecular phenotype of liver biopsies; and validate and
      refine this system in 300 unselected prospectively collected for clinical indications and a
      standard of care biopsies from North American and European Centers. In addition to
      demonstrating the real-time feasibility and potential value of this System in patient care,
      the study will develop and optimize a transparent and user-friendly reporting format to
      communicate this information to clinicians and obtain detailed feedback to improve its
      utility.

      Thanks to increasing interest and support from participating centers, INTERLIVER has already
      processed 509 biopsies from 455 participants.
