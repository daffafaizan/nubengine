    
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an online, self-guided ACT-based
      narrative intervention for adults currently taking antidepressant medication. To test the
      effects of LifeStories on depression severity, quality of life, general functioning and
      psychological inflexibility, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial
      with two conditions (LifeStories and waitlist control) using a sample of 150 adults currently
      taking antidepressant medication. Interested individuals will complete a screening survey to
      determine eligibility. After being informed about the study and potential risks, eligible
      participants who provide informed consent will be asked to complete a baseline survey.
      Participants will then be randomized to LifeStories or a waitlist control conditions, each
      lasting 4 weeks. Those in the waitlist group will be asked to not use other self-help
      websites or books for four weeks, after which they will be given weekly access to LifeStories
      modules. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a midtreatment survey 2 weeks
      after baseline, and a posttreatment survey 4 weeks after baseline (i.e. after completing the
      4-week video intervention for those in the active condition).
