      approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of
      combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms of action [Celli,
      2004, GOLD 2009]. As disease progresses from mild to moderate, regular treatment with one or
      more long-acting bronchodilators is recommended. Inhaled bronchodilators, including beta2
      agonists and anticholinergics are included with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) therapy and are
      mainstays of therapy in patients diagnosed with COPD. Since GSK573719 Inhalation Powder is
      expected to be used for chronic management of COPD as long-acting muscarinic antagonist
      (LAMA), this study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term
      administration of GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 125 mcg in Japanese patients with COPD at doses
      possibly used to be in Japan.

      In this study, patient safety will also be monitored by evaluating pulmonary function and
      clinical symptoms.
