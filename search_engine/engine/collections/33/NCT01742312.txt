      performance in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. All patients will be assessed by a
      Consultant Anaesthetist and a medical member of the Research team before commencing
      chemotherapy and after finishing their course. These assessments include a nutritional
      assessment, performance status assessments, blood assays, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA) scans, cardio-pulmonary exercise (CPEX) testing and a muscle biopsy.
