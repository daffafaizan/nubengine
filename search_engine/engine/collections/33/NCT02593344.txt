      measure of flow-mediated dilation (reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tone index). The
      pulmonary function will be assessed by the measures of the FEV1, the forced vital capacity
      (FVC) and the expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75%). The relationship between these
      parameters of the pulmonary function and the peripheral endothelial function will be
      analyzed. In addition, a relationship between peripheral endothelial function and the level
      of asthma control (Asthma Control Test (ACT)), the cardiovascular risk factors (SCORE INdex)
      and the treatment for asthma (controllers) will be also assessed.
