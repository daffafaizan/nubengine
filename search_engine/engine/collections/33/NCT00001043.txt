    
      ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain, the most prevalent strain of
      HIV-1 in the United States, has been developed. A previous study showed that a combination
      vaccine strategy, consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with a gp160
      subunit vaccine, resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and longer
      duration than either vaccine alone. Thus, a live vector/subunit boost approach using the MN
      rgp160 vaccine merits investigation.

      AMENDED 8/94: Volunteers are randomized to receive 800 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) or
      adjuvant control (placebo) on one of two dosing schedules. Sixteen volunteers receive
      candidate vaccine and four volunteers receive placebo.

      ORIGINAL (replaced): Volunteers are randomized to receive either HIVAC-1e on days 0 and 56
      followed by immunization with MN rgp160 vaccine on days 224 and 364, or DryVax control on
      days 0 and 56 followed by placebo on days 224 and 364. Ten volunteers are entered on the MN
      rgp160 vaccine arm and two volunteers on the placebo arm.

      PER AMENDMENT 7/96: Two additional booster immunizations of 600 mcg of MN rgp 120/HIV-1
      vaccine given at study months 22 and 24 to consenting St. Louis University volunteers.
