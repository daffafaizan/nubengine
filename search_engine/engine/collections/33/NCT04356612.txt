      orthopaedic procedures. While healthier patients usually undergo non-major orthopaedic
      procedures using regional anesthesia to facilitate faster discharges, prolonged PACU
      discharges are frequently encountered necessitating characterization and identification of
      modifiable variables. This is a retrospective chart review to determine the etiologies
      contributing to prolonged PACU discharge at a major Orthopedic Ambulatory Center.
