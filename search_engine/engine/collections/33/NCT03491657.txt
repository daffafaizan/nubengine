      within-wound care design, in the current study, pediatric patients being treated for severe
      burn injuries will receive music distraction during some portions of their wound care (active
      comparator condition), and they will receive what we predict will be an unusually strong
      distraction, immersive virtual reality (the experimental treatment) during other comparable
      portions of the same wound cleaning sessions. During virtual reality, each patient will look
      into virtual reality goggles, and will play a simple cartoon-like virtual reality game
      SnowWorld during burn wound cleaning. After each wound care session, the patient will rate
      how much pain they experienced during wound care during No VR (music only) compared to how
      much pain they experienced during wound care during virtual reality, on each study day, for
      up to 10 study days per patient. Treatment order randomized.
