      shown to improve outcomes. However, it has not been studied in patients who have had a Fontan
      heart operation. Study participants will receive either placebo or carvedilol for 12 weeks,
      at the end of the 12 weeks participants will perform an exercise test. Then study
      participants will receive treatment with placebo or carvedilol for 12 weeks (opposite of what
      participants go the first 12 weeks) and will again perform an exercise test.
