    
      This study intends to evaluate the levels of selected biomarkers of exposure to selected HPHC
      and of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzymatic activity, as compared to smokers continuing
      smoking CC ad libitum, after 5 days of ad libitum use.

      Additional parameters will be explored, such as: cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) enzymatic
      activity, nicotine pharmacokinetics, product evaluation and safety, marker of platelet
      function, and HST.

      After screening, subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 9 days, including the Day of
      Admission, 2 days of baseline during which all subjects will continue to smoke their usual CC
      for a 5-day exposure after randomization. After leaving the clinic on the Day of Discharge,
      the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7 days. All subjects will
      receive smoking cessation advice at screening, at Day of Admission and at Day of Discharge.

      This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on
      Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use
      (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the
      applicable regulatory requirements.
