      resections

        1. Advantages 1) Less postoperative ascites production 2) Reduced postoperative pain 3)
           Feasible in selected cirrhotics who have contraindications to open surgery 4) Less
           intra-abdominal adhesions (easier salvage transplantation) 5) Shorter recovery time 6)
           Shorter length of stay 7) Reduced financial cost

        2. Disadvantages 1) No manual palpation or exploration of the liver parenchyma possible
           (with the pure laparoscopic approach) 2) High demand in surgical skill (especially major
           resections)
