    
      Methods: The randomized double blinded clinical trial will recruit 440 healthy kindergarten
      children aged 3-5 years with caries and with parental consent. The sample size is sufficient
      for the appropriate statistical analyses. The children will receive 0.004 mL 38% SDF (typical
      amount applied per manufacturer's instructions) to treat each caries lesion. The children
      will be classified into high and low caries rates and equably allocated into eight groups of
      SDF application time: 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 seconds. The children will be
      followed up for 6 months in their kindergartens. Clinical examinations after 6-months will be
      conducted to assess whether the caries is arrested. Information on confounding factors, such
      as oral hygiene habits and the use of other fluoride agents, will be collected through a
      parental questionnaire at the baseline and follow-ups. The examiner, the children and the
      children's parents will be blind to the treatment allocation. The analysis will determine the
      significance of differences between the means of arrested caries at the various follow-ups;
      and Cochran-Armitage test will be used to evaluate the exposure (SDF-application time) to
      response relationship.

      Significance: This study will help determine the optimal application time in SDF treatment.
      The study provides an evidence-based protocol for the use of silver diamine fluoride to
      arrest tooth decay in primary teeth of young children.
