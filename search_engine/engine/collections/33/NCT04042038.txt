      therapy (CBT) is the best treatment option available for OCD, although it achieves optimum
      results in less than half of the patients. The investigators will investigate the main neural
      circuits that predict CBT outcome in OCD and the neural changes associated with CBT in two
      separate randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one in an adult sample and another in a
      pediatric sample. In this two RCTs, OCD participants will be randomized to either intensive
      CBT (20 sessions in 1 month) by a experienced clinician or a waiting-list control (WLC) and
      will be assessed (by a blind assessor) and scanned before and after CBT. Patients will be
      offered CBT if they have been randomized to the WLC. At baseline, the investigators will also
      compare OCD patients with a group of healthy controls (HC). Secondary goals of the project
      include 1) assessing potential differences between children/adolescents and adults in the
      neural mechanisms involved in CBT for OCD; 2) assess the effectiveness of intensive CBT for
      children/adolescents and adults.
