    
      This is a prospective Phase II randomized multi-institutional controlled pilot trial
      comparing the regimen of single agent rituximab with 6 weeks cytotoxic therapy with oral
      cyclophosphamide to eradicate or suppress autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibodies in
      individuals with acquired hemophilia A. Patients will be randomized to receive either of
      these two regimens when their autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibodies prove to be refractory
      to initial upfront immunosuppressive treatment with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (or
      equivalent corticosteroid doses) for 3 weeks. Patients will be randomized to the treatment
      cohorts according to the biostatistical methods.
