      arterial catheter if the surgery required it (30 patients in this arm), otherwise the
      investigators used an oesophagus tube (20 patients). We also monitored every 50 patients with
      a non-invasive method 3M spot on (Zero-heath-flux technic) in order to measure its fiability
      and validity during the surgery.
