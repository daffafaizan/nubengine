      transplantation is available to only a minority of patients due to lack of a matched sibling
      donor, advanced age of the patient, or cost. Clinical studies at NIH and elsewhere have
      demonstrated excellent response rates and improved survival with immunosuppressive
      treatments. Laboratory data implicate underlying cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated suppression
      of hematopoiesis as the likely proximal cause of disease in most patients. In earlier
      clinical protocols we treated SAA with cyclosporine A (CSA) (86-H-0007), antithymocyte
      globulin (ATG) (87-H-0124), and combined ATG and CSA (90-H-0146). While intensive
      immunosuppression is most effective, relapse is common and some patients also develop second
      hematologic complications like myelodysplasia. In this protocol, we modify our regimen by
      delaying the introduction of cyclosporine to promote ATG tolerizing effects and adding
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a new agent that, like ATG may be relatively specific for
      activated lymphocytes, in an effort to reduce the high relapse rate.
