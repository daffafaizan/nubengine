      implantation, which could lead to many major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Social
      media have been proven effective in improving lifestyles and blood pressures control, but few
      studies have attempt to improve DAPT adherence through social media.Therefore, eligible
      patients will be enrolled through scanning QR code and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an
      intervention group or control group with 12 months of follow-up.The investigators will find
      out the prevalence of DAPT discontinuation and prove the hypothesis that using social media
      will improve DAPT adherence among patients requiring DAPT following DES implantation..
