      (PurIST) subtyping of pretreatment Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS/FNA)
      samples to determine pancreatic cancer subtype. Neoadjuvant therapy is directed based on the
      molecular subtype (classical vs. basal). Patients with classical subtype will receive a
      standard chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) and patients with basal subtype will receive an
      alternative standard therapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel).
