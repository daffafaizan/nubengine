      August 31, 2019 were reviewed to explore the correlation between early induction of labor and
      caesarean birth after 38 + 0 weeks. The hypothesis of the study is that induction of labor in
      primiparas with low-risk pregnancies at 38 + 0 to 40 + 6 gestational weeks will increase the
      cesarean rate, compared with those receiving labor induction at more than 41+0 gestational
      weeks.
