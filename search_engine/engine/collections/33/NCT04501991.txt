      our outpatient diabetes clinic during the lockdown for COVID-19 (March 9, 2020-May 04, 2020)
      were contacted by phone. Patients who accepted to take part of the study received a medical
      prescription for routine analysis via email. They were asked to perform blood drawing one
      week after the end of the lockdown period and transmitted us the results.

      We then compared the metabolic profile tested one week after the end of the lockdown with the
      last value and the mean of the last three determinations performed before the pandemic
      emergency.
