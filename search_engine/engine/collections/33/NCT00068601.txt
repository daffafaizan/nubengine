      Primary

        -  Compare the rate of premature ovarian failure in women with stage I-IIIA hormone
           receptor-negative breast cancer treated with chemotherapy with vs without goserelin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the rate of ovarian dysfunction in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare ovarian reserve in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Describe the pregnancy rates in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 40 vs 40
      to 49) and planned chemotherapy regimen (3- to 4-month/course anthracycline-based vs 6- to
      8-month/course anthracycline-based vs 3- to 4-month/course non-anthracycline-based vs 6- to
      8-month/course non-anthracycline-based). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm 1: Patients receive cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy alone. Patients are
           followed at 1, 2, and 5 years.

        -  Arm 2: Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every 4 weeks beginning 1 week
           before start of cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy. Treatment continues until
           completion of chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 416 patients (208 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
