      result of various alterations in oxygenation parameters and sleep macro- and
      micro-architecture. We aimed to compare the tiotropium Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler and the
      HandiHaler in terms of their effects on sleeping oxygen saturation (SaO2) and sleep quality
      in patients with COPD. In a randomized, parallel-group trial involving 200 patients with mild
      to moderate COPD (resting arterial oxygen tension >60 mmHg while awake), we compared the
      effects of 6 months' treatment with the two devices on sleeping SaO2 and sleep quality.
