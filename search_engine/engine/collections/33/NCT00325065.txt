    
      Objective:

      The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to use targeted manipulations with intranasally
      administered oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in conjunction with neurocognitive
      and neuroimaging paradigms to evaluate claims that OT and AVP inhibit and facilitate,
      respectively, the effective processing of aversive signals.

      Study Population:

      A total of 216 healthy male and female adults between 20-40 years of age.

      Design:

      This protocol will involve a series of independent studies. Each study will require one visit
      in addition to a screening visit, involves a physical and psychiatric assessment. The study
      visit itself will involve pharmacological challenge followed by neurocognitive or
      neuroimaging testing.

      Outcome Measures:

      Moreover, we wish to examine whether increased vasopressin levels will increase, and
      increased oxytocin levels decrease, the neural response in the amygdala and other limbic
      structures to aversive stimuli. In addition, we wish to assess whether OT and AVP
      administration will lead to the facilitation of conspecific recognition as appears to be the
      case for other mammalian species.
