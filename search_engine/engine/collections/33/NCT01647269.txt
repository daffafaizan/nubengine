      conventional treatments, such as drugs, do not control their symptoms sufficiently or cannot
      be tolerated.

      The first two clinic visits will involve assessments. Participants will fill in a number of
      questionnaires and be examined by a psychiatrist and a neurologist. At the second visit, the
      patient will provide consent for participation and will undergo formal tests to find out if
      the participant is suitable and willing to undergo the research study and to record the type
      and severity of their Tourette syndrome symptoms.

      The third visit will be an admission to hospital to have the deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      devices implanted. The admission to hospital should be around five days in duration.

      At the first post operative follow-up visit, the patient will be placed into a "stimulator
      on" group or a "stimulator off" group. To try and make sure that these groups are the same to
      start with, each patient is put into a group by chance (randomly). This visit will take place
      around six weeks after surgery. In this trial, the participant will have an equal chance of
      being in the "on" or the "off" group first. This trial is also a "blinded" trial, neither the
      patient nor the researchers performing the assessments will know which group the patient is
      in.

      At the next visit, 3 months later, the patient will have a further assessment. If their
      stimulators have been "on" for the first 3 months, they will be switched off. If they have
      been "off" they will be switched on.

      At the next visit, 3 months later, the patient will be assessed again and then given the
      opportunity to carry on the trial with the stimulators switched on for long term follow up.
