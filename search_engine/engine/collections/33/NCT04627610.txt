      significant impact on quality of life. A very large number of therapeutic approaches can be
      proposed (functional treatment, surgical techniques by perineal approach and surgical
      techniques by anterior approach).

      D'Hoore and Pennix described Ventral Rectopexy with prosthetic reinforcement which is
      accepted as a standard of treatment in much of Europe for externalized prolapse but remains
      maligned in much of the world. Due to the relatively recent appearance of this technique and
      the great variability in the management methods, the long-term results of Ventral Rectopexy
      have been little studied.

      This surgical technique is the preferred approach offered at CHU Grenoble Alpes. Pr Faucheron
      have internationally recognized experience in surgical grip with a very high patient volume
      in recent years.

      The objective of this work is to describe the long-term results of this technique.
