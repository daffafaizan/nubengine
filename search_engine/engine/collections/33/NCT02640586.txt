      response and pathological complete response(pCR) of patients with rectal cancer who received
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation. MR radiomics,convolutional neural networks, morphological
      parameters and quantitative functional parameters derived from diffusion-weighted MR images
      will be integrated for model construction.
