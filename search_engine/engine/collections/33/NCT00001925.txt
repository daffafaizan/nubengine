      particular theory of essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, has gained support from
      various studies. These studies point to the olivary nucleus as possible central rhythm
      generator. Cells in the olivary nucleus show spontaneous rhythmic discharges that can be
      suppressed by alcohol. Since alcohol is known to suppress tremor in some patients with
      essential tremor, one can theorize that it is through its effect on the olivary nucleus; that
      is, the inferior olive is the generator of the tremor. Given this assumption, we intend to
      study the effect of alcohol on three different kinds of tremor: the 8-12 Hz component of
      physiological tremor, symptomatic palatal tremor and essential palatal tremor. Our hypothesis
      is that the central generator of each of these types of tremor lies in the inferior olive and
      that the ingestion of alcohol should reduce the amplitude of the tremor, similar to the
      effect of alcohol seen in essential tremor.
