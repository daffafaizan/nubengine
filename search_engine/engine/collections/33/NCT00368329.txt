      using hypofractionated radiosurgery in locally advanced esophageal cancer. The dose
      escalation will be delivered using an image-guided radiosurgical boost to the tumor volume,
      following a neoadjuvant regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and conventionally
      fractionated radiotherapy. In addition, we will evaluate the utility of PET-FDG before and
      after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in predicting the pathologic response to pre-operative
      treatment. We will study the effect of this regimen on pathologic complete response rates and
      complete resection rates at surgery among patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer
      and determine patterns of failure and rates of progression-free survival. Finally, we plan to
      characterize in an exploratory manner the correlation between molecular markers and
      pathologic findings following pre-operative chemoradiation.
