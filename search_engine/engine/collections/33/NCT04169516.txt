      culprit and non-culprit intracoronary hemodynamic measurements were performed and repeated at
      6-month follow-up. 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) was performed at 6-month
      follow-up visit to determine absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF). The resistance values of
      each vessel were calculated using the coronary pressure data and the MBF values obtained from
      13N-ammonia PET data. Such physiological measures were compared between culprit and
      non-culprit vessels in baseline and 6-month follow-up.
