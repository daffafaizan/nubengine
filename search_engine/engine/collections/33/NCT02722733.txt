      eligible patients suffering from Hodgkin's Lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL, NHL).
      AutoHSCT allows to further improve results of the therapy. Nowadays, 99% of the procedures
      are performed using peripheral blood as a source of stem cells. Hence, the crucial point is
      to harvest adequate number of stem cells allowing hematopoietic recovery. The number of 2 Ã—
      10^6 CD34+ cells/kg is considered the minimal level in autoHSCT. There are two main
      mobilization strategies being used: based on G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy
      (cyclophosphamide (CY) at dose range 1.6 g/m2 is mainly used in HL and NHL setting). However,
      a proportion of patients (5-40%) fail to collect the minimum number of cells required. Novel
      agents, like plerixafor, CXCR4 inhibitor, may enable effective CD34+ cell harvest in "poor
      mobilizers". Nevertheless, the optimal first-line and cost-effective protocol for
      mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells has not been determined so far.

      Randomized trials compare chemomobilization with the use of CY + G-CSF to G-CSF alone, which
      had been conducted so far, did not demonstrate clear advantage of addition of CY to the
      growth factor. Intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC), 1.6 g/m2 plus filgrastim, has
      been shown to produce very high efficacy as a first or second-line mobilization regimen in
      patients with lymphoid malignancies. In a retrospective comparison, this strategy was
      significantly more effective than CY + G-CSF. This suggest that the type of chemotherapy
      agent added to G-CSF may play role in mobilization efficacy and that the combination of AraC
      and G-CSF may be more effective than G-CSF used alone. The goal of current study is to verify
      this hypothesis in randomized controlled trial.
