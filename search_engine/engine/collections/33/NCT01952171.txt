      congenital heart disease (CHD). Existing data suggests that CHD occur in Sub-Saharan Africa
      at frequencies similar to the rest of the world. In this application, we propose to utilize
      the unique advantages of Sub-Saharan Africa - a combination of the most genetically diverse
      populations in the world and of diminished environmental background effects (i.e. low
      prevalence of smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity in comparison to western countries) - to better
      understand the genetic basis for congenital heart disease. We will couple next generation
      genomic techniques with more traditional gene discovery methods to investigate CHD in two
      African countries: Uganda and Nigeria. The inclusion of syndromic and non-syndromic CHD
      observed in these populations as well as careful phenotyping (including echocardiography)
      will greatly enhance our potential to provide insight into the genetic architecture of CHD in
      African populations. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll families, in whom members have
      congenital heart malformations consistent with an error of early human development in our
      research protocol. Patients will be enrolled at the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala,
      Uganda, and at the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos,
      Nigeria, with the potential to include other African sites. High throughput genomic studies
      will be done at the NIH.
