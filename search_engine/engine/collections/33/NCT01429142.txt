      BACKGROUND: Adherence to HIV-medication is an important predictor of treatment success, yet
      between 25-40% of the patients does not always take the medication as prescribed. A
      nurse-delivered counseling intervention (AIMS: Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy)
      to optimize patient adherence has shown promising results in a pilot study and a randomized
      controlled trial among Caucasian, treatment-experienced patients. AIMS is a patient-centered
      counseling intervention to support self-regulation of medication intake, using feedback
      reports of electronically monitored adherence. AIMS has been evaluated positively by patients
      and nurses, and has been developed to be implemented in usual patient care against minimal
      time and monetary investments.

      OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of the AIMS intervention compared to
      "care-as-usual" in Dutch HIV-clinics among a representative sample of patients (all
      ethnicities, starting or already on treatment).

      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in seven HIV-clinics in the Netherlands
      and select 230 patients (details regarding sample size calculation: see below) eligible for
      intervention based on the following criteria: 1- All treatment experienced patients who
      started combination AntiRetroviral Therapy (cART) ≥1996, are >9 months on treatment, are
      continuing treatment, and had at least one detectable viral load (blips included) during the
      last 3 years (count starts after 9 months cART). 2- All treatment-naïve patients initiating
      treatment.

      After initial inclusion, treatment experienced patients with suboptimal adherence measured
      during a 2-month electronic monitoring baseline period will be eligible for randomization to
      the intervention or the control group. Treatment-initiating patients will be randomized
      directly after consenting.

      DESIGN: A prospective multicenter trial with randomization of patients within nurses.
      Eligible treatment experienced patients with suboptimal adherence after 2 months baseline
      adherence monitoring will be randomized to receive either usual care plus the
      AIMS-intervention, or care as usual. Next, randomized experienced patients will visit the
      clinic every 4-5 months, with a minimum of 3 visits during at least a 15-month period
      (including the baseline period a total of 17 study months). Treatment-naïve patients will be
      randomized directly after consenting. As part of the AIMS-intervention, intervention
      participants are encouraged to start with a 2-week readiness trajectory before initiating
      cART. After initiating cART, control and intervention participants return for a visit after
      2-4 weeks, 3-4 months, 6-7 months, 9-10 months, and 12-15 months.

      PRIMARY MEASURES: Viral load, health care usage, quality of life, and adherence data will be
      obtained. MEMS-data will only be collected among half of the control group (randomly assigned
      to MEMS y/n).

      OUTCOMES: 1- Primary cost-effectiveness outcome: a) costs per point increase in the
      proportion of patients with an undetectable viral load, b) costs per Quality Adjusted Life
      Year (QALY) gained. Secondary: Costs per one point increase in adherence as measured with the
      MEMS-caps.

      2- Primary effectiveness outcome: The number of detectable viral loads at study months 6-7,
      10-11, and 14-15 for experienced patients, and months 6-7, 9-10, and 12-15 for patients
      starting treatment. Secondary: Adherence according to MEMS-caps.

      **PROJECT OBJECTIVES SUB STUDY** BACKGROUND: HIV-nurses' tasks go beyond discussing and
      supporting adherence, and include promoting patients' sexual, mental, physical and social
      well-being. Hence, it will be important to establish whether delivering the AIMS-intervention
      impacts the quality/scope of usual clinic care on these other important domains. In addition,
      measuring the content of usual care during the trial provides the opportunity to explore
      whether this is related to patients' well-being (sexual, mental, physical, social) and
      satisfaction with care.

      OBJECTIVES: 1- To monitor the content of usual care on the different HIV-nursing domains and
      examine whether usual care content predicts patients' well-being and satisfaction with
      HIV-care at follow-up. 2- Explore whether delivering the AIMS-intervention has
      (dis)advantageous effects on the content and impact of usual care on domains other than
      adherence (sexual, mental, physical, social).

      PARTICIPANTS: HIV-nurses and patients in the study clinics.

      DESIGN AND MEASURES: HIV-nurses' usual care with regard to adherence, as well as mental,
      sexual, social and physical health will be assessed through questionnaires at randomization
      and at the end of the study. In addition, HIV-nurses will complete a brief online checklist
      after each study visit indicating the main topics discussed during that meeting. At
      randomization and after the study, patients will complete a brief questionnaire about their
      mental, social, physical and sexual health, and satisfaction with their care on these
      domains.

      PRIMARY OUTCOMES: 1- The relation between the content of care with patient satisfaction and
      well-being. 2- Potential effects of AIMS on the content of care and patient well-being and
      treatment satisfaction.

      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:

      During the initial grant application, a sample size was computed based on the assumption that
      only non-adherent, treatment experienced patients would be approached. However, following the
      input from participating clinics, the final inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated
      as explained below. An updated sample size computation was done after inclusion had been
      initiated, which was submitted to (date: 27th February, 2013) and accepted by (date: 15th
      April, 2013) the funder (ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and
      Development) using actual trial data in order to enhance accuracy of the estimates (the
      expected treatment effect is the same in both computations, the other estimates were adjusted
      to match then new criteria and available data).

      Initial sample size calculation:

      The sample size for the primary outcome measure was computed on the basis of a dichotomous
      dependent variable (detectable versus undetectable viral load), The data was planned to be
      analyzed using a multi-level model (patients nested within nurses) that would account for
      differential intervention effects between nurses. A total sample of 432 patients (18 nurses)
      was required to detect significant intervention effects at post-intervention with an alpha =
      .05 (two-sided) and 80% power, based on the following assumptions: depending on the nurse,
      (a) 60% to 80% of the patients have an undetectable viral load during usual care (i.e. ≥ 6
      months after start of cART), (b) this increases in the intervention condition compared to the
      control condition by 5 to 20 percentage points, and (c) a nurse recruits on average 25
      patients for the trial. (d) We expected a maximum dropout of 20%. We therefore intended to
      include 450 patients.

      Updated sample size calculation:

      The updated sample size computation is the following: A sample of 230 patients (22 nurses) is
      required to obtain 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect on viral load for at
      least one of three time points (for treatment-experienced patients: T1, T2, and T3; for
      treatment-initiating patients: T3, T4, and T5) with alpha=.05 (two-sided) and using a
      Bonferroni correction. Viral load at baseline is used as a covariate. A multilevel model is
      used with random intercepts and random treatment effects at the nurse level. The sample size
      calculation is based on the following assumptions: depending on the nurse, (a) 60% to 80% of
      treatment-initiating patients have an undetectable viral load during usual care (i.e. ≥ 6
      months after start of ART), (b) 15% to 20% of treatment experienced-patients and all
      treatment-initiating patients have a detectable viral load at baseline, (c) this increases in
      the intervention condition compared to the control condition by 5 to 20 percentage points,
      (d) a nurse recruits on average 11 patients for the trial, and (e) an expected maximum
      dropout of 10%.
