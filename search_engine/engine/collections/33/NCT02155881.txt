      treat allergy symptoms in people who have SAR. This study will look at improvement of allergy
      symptoms in Russian participants who take ciclesonide nasal spray.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Ciclesonide nasal spray 200 mcg

        -  Placebo nasal spray (dummy inactive nasal spray) - this is a nasal spray that looks like
           the study drug but has no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take 2 actuations per nostril at the same time each day
      throughout the study, and will be asked to record the severity of their allergy symptoms
      twice a day in a diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Russia. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 5 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
