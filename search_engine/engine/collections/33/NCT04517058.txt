      psychiatric diseases are very common. The prevalence of depression in patients with
      refractory epilepsy is about 60%. However, the early diagnosis is usually difficult due to
      the unclear mechanism and untypical clinical symptoms, and there are no extremely effective
      treatments for depression in patients with epilepsy until now. In this prospective,
      multi-center, cohort study, we aim to investigate and screen two different types of
      depression ("cognitive" and "somatic") in patients with epilepsy by using the combination of
      regular moods evaluating scales and heart rate variability instrument. The intervening
      methods of combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and serotonin re-uptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat the patients with comorbidity of epilepsy and
      depression. And resting-state functional MRI will be conducted in patients with the
      comorbidity of epilepsy and depression before and after the combing treatment of tDCS and
      SSRIs.
