    
      During an earlier phase 2 base trial (study # NCT00074997), HIV-1 infected patients received
      a gene therapy product (anti-HIV-1 Ribozyme [OZ1]). Gene therapy is an investigational
      treatment where genes are inserted into an individual's cells and tissues to treat a disease.
      The gene therapy OZ1 is thought to have anti-HIV-1 actions. This is an Observational Study to
      provide long term follow-up of those HIV-1 infected patients who received the gene therapy
      product (anti-HIV-1 Ribozyme [OZ1]) as part of the earlier study. Patients are seen twice
      yearly until 5 years from initial infusion of study drug has elapsed and then yearly until
      withdrawal or study completion. The study will monitor for and record any ill effects from
      the gene therapy product to provide long term safety information. Observational study - no
      investigational drug administered.
