      pylori eradication. My personal opinion is that the literature and guidelines are
      contradictory. The European guideline is that Helicobacter pylori should not be corrected
      unless there are "serious" symptoms . On the other hand, Helicobacter is a carcinogen. Quite
      often, parents ask us, children's gastroenterologists, to screen their children for
      Helicobacter because they are symptomatic and are being eradicated, and know that
      Helicobacter is contagious. This creates a difficult situation: not answering the question is
      not an option according to the parents' opinion. Going into the question and eradicating
      "classic" is against all guidelines.

      Hence this pilot project: 10 complaints-free carriers of Helicobacter pylori (> 5 years) will
      be treated with Helipyl for one month (product supplied by the company). Beforehand, at the
      end of the treatment and a month after stopping of the treatment, we do a C13 breath test.
