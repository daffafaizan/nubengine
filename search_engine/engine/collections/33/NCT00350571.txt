    
      We propose a 5-year Stage I behavioral therapy development study to: 1) prospectively
      evaluate risk factors for premature drop-out from outpatient treatment; 2) develop and test a
      manual of single session phone-and office-based interventions to re-engage these individual
      in treatment.
