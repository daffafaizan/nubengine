      respiratory tract infection, which however should be amenable to reduction by multi
      micro-nutrient supplementation. For becoming a successful healthy aging individual, the
      interrelationship between endogenous and exogenous factors must be positive and balanced.
      Introducing multi micro-nutrients through supplementation is an alternative which ensures a
      balanced micro-nutrient intake for enhancing the immune response and at the same time
      possibly enhancing the quality of life of the healthy free-living elderly individual.

      The role of nutritional intervention strategies have been shown to be beneficial in the
      prevention of infectious disease among the older population in order to reduce the burden of
      diseases, and also could prevent micro-nutrient deficiency and enhance immune response of
      older persons.

      The present study is related to primary prevention activities which aim to enhance the health
      status of the subjects, in particular to reduce the incidence and prevalence rate of
      infectious diseases, especially of upper respiratory tract infection. Supplementation is
      operationally achievable for implementation at the health center and could be set within the
      existing programs for older persons.
