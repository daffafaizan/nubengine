      battery for males with CTD, and to evaluate Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) along with
      other potential biomarkers. It is designed to explore developmental domains of interest and
      to examine the feasibility and utility of various neuropsychological assessments to measure
      domains of interest, and to identify possible endpoints for interventional studies. Study
      will also explore genotype-phenotype correlations.

      Clinical adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.

      This study was previously posted by Lumos Pharma, which has been transferred to Ultragenyx in
      June 2019.
