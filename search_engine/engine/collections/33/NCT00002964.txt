      malignant changes in patients with lesions of the oral cavity. II. Investigate whether
      porfimer sodium fluorescence can define areas of field cancerization in the oral mucosa,
      specifically satellite foci of malignant cells within the margins of an excision. III.
      Determine whether uptake of fluorescence is indicative of disease stage.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive porfimer sodium IV bolus and are kept in subdued light until
      examination with a fluorescence photometer 48 hours later. Patients must avoid sunlight and
      other intense lights for an additional 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be accrued per year.
