      Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is most often attributed to inactivating germline
      mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) tumor suppressor gene. Mutation carriers have a 24-70%
      lifetime risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma.

      -International consensus guidelines recommend endoscopic screening and surveillance of CDH1
      mutation carriers who decline risk-reducing total gastrectomy (TG). However, this approach
      lacks sufficient sensitivity for detection of occult, intramucosal foci of signet ring cancer
      cells (SRCC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC. Our team has established a systematic
      endoscopic screening protocol (Bethesda protocol) that demonstrates a higher rate of SRCC
      detection compared to historic controls using the currently recommended Cambridge method.

      Objective:

      -Determine if Bethesda protocol provides improved sensitivity for detection of early stage
      gastric cancer in CDH1 germline mutation carriers compared to the Cambridge method.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDH1 germline mutation.

        -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.

        -  Physiologically able to undergo upper endoscopy

      Design:

      -Phase II randomized study to compare Bethesda protocol and Cambridge method for detection of
      intramucosal SRCC in asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriers undergoing endoscopic screening or
      surveillance.
