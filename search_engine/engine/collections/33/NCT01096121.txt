    
      This is a multicenter study. In order to include 72 patients we should pre-include 400
      patients.

      They will be included in the study after signing the protocol consent. For final inclusion in
      the study, two albuminuria/creatinuria ratio should be over or equal to 3mg/mmol. If so,
      inclusion will be done and patient will be randomized (placebo/enalapril) by CLEANWEB
      software. A blood sample will be done.

      Treatment tolerance will be check up at day 7 (blood sample for renal tolerance and clinical
      examination), month 1(clinical examination), month 3(clinical examination), month 6(clinical
      examination), and month 9 (clinical examination). Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by
      albuminuria/creatinuria ratio at month 1, month 3, month 6, and month 9. Physiopathology of
      ACE efficacy will be studied at first day and month 9 by dosage of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.

      Treatment plain posology (0.5mg/kg/day) will be progressively obtained on a three months
      period, beginning at 0.2mg/kg/day.
