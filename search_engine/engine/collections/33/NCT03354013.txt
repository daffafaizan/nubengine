      their previous embryo developmental problems. This protocol artificially induces calcium
      rises in the oocyte, which mimics the natural oocyte activation process induced by the sperm
      factor PLCzeta. If 6 or more mature oocytes are collected at oocyte retrieval, 50%ICSI and
      50% ICSI-AOA will be applied. If less than 6 mature oocytes are collected, ICSI-AOA will be
      applied to all oocytes. Regardless of the treatment group (ICSI or ICSI-AOA), the best
      embryo(s) will be transferred back. Rest embryo(s) will be vitrified for future cycles.
      Patients will be followed up.

      Furthermore, an additional sperm sample will be produced to investigate the calcium inducing
      pattern of the patients' spermatozoa. Thereby, mouse and/or human (research-donated control
      oocytes) will be pre-incubated with a Ca2+ sensitive dye. Next, human spermatozoa will be
      injected into these mouse/human oocytes and the calcium pattern will be recorded under an
      inverted epifluorescence microscope.

      Both partners will give a saliva sample to screen for mutations possible genes involved in
      oocyte activation and embryo development.
