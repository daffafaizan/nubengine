      adoption of natural elements in daily life, even in hospitals, can characterize restorative
      environments and reflect in better health for patients. Contact with nature can be done
      indirectly through photographs. This clinical trial aims to verify the therapeutic potential
      of the nature images, previously validated in another part of this study, in the care of
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Anchored on the assumptions of the theory of
      Biophilia, and the environmental theory of Florence Nightingale our study hypothesis is that
      this intervention promotes well-being and promote more positive mood states, and reduce
      symptoms resulting from the treatment during chemotherapy session.
