      (KT) are frequently used in the conservative treatment of shoulder pathology. Even if some
      studies showed that KT is effective on pain, we think that it is due to positive thoughts of
      the patients about KT. The aim of the study to investigate the effectiveness KT application
      with different verbal inputs on pain, function and range of motion (ROM) on patient with
      rotator cuff tear. 97 patients (Group 1, n=32; Group 2, n=33, Group 3, n=32) were randomized
      into 3 groups according to verbal input given to patients about the effectiveness of KT;
      Group 1 (it has been limited evidence of KT is effective), Group 2 (it has been not known
      that KT is effective or not), Group 3 (it has been known that KT has excellent result). The
      same standard KT was applied to 3 groups. The rest, night and pain in activity were assessed
      by Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) before, after 30 min and 24 hours after KT application. ROM
      assessed by goniometer and the function was evaluated by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder
      and Hand (DASH) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score (ASES) before and 24 hours
      of KT application. Minimal clinically important difference and effective were calculated for
      the assessments used in the study.
