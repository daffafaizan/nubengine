      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes
      have been rising. Characterizing these disease states reveals that inflammation is a common
      feature of CMD; however, mechanistic links between inflammation and these disease states in
      humans remain poorly understood. In this protocol, we aim to characterize inflammation within
      the blood vessels, blood, fat and skin in diabetes and coronary artery disease compared to
      those without disease. We hypothesize that diabetes and coronary disease will be systemic
      inflammatory states and will provide an important frame of reference for parameters found on
      novel imaging techniques in another ongoing protocol trying to understand how skin
      inflammation affects risk for CMD and CVD (13-H-0065).
