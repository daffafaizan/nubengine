    
      Patients will be included in two different groups according to the vitreous status: group 1 -
      non vitrectomized eyes; group 2 - vitrectomized eyes. Patients will be followed-up according
      to the standard of care and a final analysis of the results will be performed at 12+/-1
      months of follow-up, which is the minimum follow-up period required for each patient. In
      group 1 the effect of VMA existence and PVD status will also be analyzed. The recruitment
      period will be of 6 months.

      Treatment All patients will be treated with IV ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg/0.05ml)
      following a PRN regimen. The injections will be performed in the operating room following the
      standard intravitreal injections protocol. When required, adjunct treatment, with macular
      and/or peripheral LASER (rescue LASER), will be also admitted at or after 24 weeks if
      persistent DME not improving after at least 2 injections.

      Treatment Schedule Repeat injections at every 4-week visit if eye "improves" or "worsens"
      (defined as ≥5 letter change from last injection or ≥10% CST change on OCT from last
      injection or CSF>300 μm at any timepoint).

      Defer injections if either BCVA of 85 letters and OCT CSF "normal" (CSF≤300 μm and
      non-existent intra- or sub-retinal fluid); or OCT CSF "normal" (CSF≤300 μm) and stable BCVA
      (defined as < 5 letters change from last injection) after two consecutive injections during
      the first 24 weeks, or after one injection if the initial stability period has already been
      achieved (OCT CSF "normal" and stable BCVA).

      Resume injections if BCVA or OCT worsens.
