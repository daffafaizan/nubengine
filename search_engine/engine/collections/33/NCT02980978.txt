      anthropometrics (height, weight, waist circumference) and complete a lifestyle assessment.
      They will formally consent to participation by signing a study consent form. The same
      measures will be collected after completion of the one year study.

      Study participants will receive two sessions of free lab work, a diabetes education book, and
      brief coaching with a registered dietitian/certified diabetes educator. In addition, those
      randomized to the phone coaching will have access to a registered dietitian/certified
      diabetes educator on a monthly basis for one year of personalized health coaching for free.
      The intent of this coaching is to help individuals achieve diabetes "optimal" care or meeting
      all 5 Diabetes Care measures (blood glucose, blood pressure, tobacco use, statin and aspirin
      use).

      This program is designed to complement usual clinic-based primary care, with coaches
      documenting lab, biometrics and medication adjustments in the EHR, along with documenting
      phone encounters and communicating directly with patients' PCPs as needed. Documentation in
      the EHR uses an order created specifically for the study indicating the patient's research
      status.

      Lab work required as part of this research study at baseline and 12 months is covered by the
      study. Any lab work and/or medication co-pays or fees outside of the baseline and 12 month
      study visits are the responsibility of the patient and/or their insurance
