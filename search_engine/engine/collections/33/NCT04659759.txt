    
      This proposal aims to provide a multi-faceted approach to addressing perinatal COVID-19
      infection by (1) improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity and
      durability over the course of pregnancy/postpartum in mother/baby dyad (2) understanding the
      downstream implications of maternal systemic inflammatory response with COVID-19 infection
      through study of fetal inflammatory response, placental pathology, and perinatal outcomes,
      and (3) to evaluate the interplay between socioeconomic characteristics, COVID-19, and early
      neonatal outcomes. (4) Evaluate antibody generation and durability in pregnant/breastfeeding
      women who receive any form of the COVID-19 vaccine
