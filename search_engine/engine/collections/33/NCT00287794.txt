      in the patients possibly due to severe pain of arthritis or unique biochemical disease
      activities. We do following studies; The study of sleep quality of the patients; The number
      of patients expected to be included in the study is 1,000. Inclusion criteria is the ACR
      criteria, and exclusion criteria is any defined disease conditions of sleep disorders in
      ICSD. The method includes questionnaire using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
      scoring and Epworth scoring, and actigraphy measurement for more than 3 days. In a portion of
      the patients, we measure clinical arthritis activities in conjunction with western blot for
      c-fos and wee-1 as well as routine clinical laboratory tests. Also in a portion of the
      patients, we do the polysomnography study; expected number of participants would be 100. We
      also plan to test the effect of good sloop on arthritis in a portion of the patients.
