      the prevalent conditions in this group, finding within them fragility hip fractures.
      Additionally, most of these patients have a large number of associated comorbidities, which
      may require greater specialization in care.

      To reduce the possible complications that may be related, different management protocols have
      been implemented, including pain management strategies such as preventive analgesics,
      regional blocks, and early surgery. Conventional treatment with the use of intravenous
      medications can have unwanted effects in geriatric patients with hip fracture, especially in
      those with greater comorbidity, since medications such as opioids can cause multiple adverse
      effects, including delirium. Also, not treating pain properly can cause complications such as
      depression and ulcers in addition to delirium.

      This is why the objective of this study is to define whether there is any association between
      the presentation of delirium in patients over 65 years of age with hip fracture who undergo
      iliac fascia block upon admission compared to those who receive only IV analgesia Therefore,
      this retrospective cohort study will be carried out with which it is sought to contribute to
      the knowledge to continue carrying out early pain management, with the aim of achieving
      better pain control, a decrease in opioid consumption and thus having a lower number of
      patients with delirium during hospitalization.
