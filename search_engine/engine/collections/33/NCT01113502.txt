    
      Primary Objectives (Phase I Portion): 1). To determine the safety and tolerability of
      eltrombopag in elderly subjects with AML 2). To determine the maximally tolerated initial
      starting dose of eltrombopag for elderly subjects with AML Primary Objectives (Phase II
      portion): 1). To better define the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in elderly patients
      with AML at the maximally tolerated starting dose Page 9 of 18 determined in Phase I portion
      of study. 2). To determine the incidence of peripheral platelet count improvement (using
      baseline and response parameters as defined below) for subjects with disease related
      thrombocytopenia. Secondary Objectives (Phase I and II): 1). To preliminarily determine the
      efficacy (using AML response criteria as defined below) of eltrombopag in elderly subjects
      with AML.

      2). To perform ex-vivo analyses using subject AML samples and stock eltrombopag to 1) assess
      leukemic proliferative capacity and 2) investigate potential eltrombopag induced cytoxic
      mechanisms for leukemic cell death. 3). To perform pharmacodynamic assessments of drug
      activity in leukemic cells using subject samples collected at various time points before and
      during drug exposure. 4). To preliminarily correlate pharmacodynamic findings with clinical
      response.
