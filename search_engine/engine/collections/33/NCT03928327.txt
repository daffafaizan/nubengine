    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788 (Mobocertinib). The study assessed the
      drug-drug interaction of TAK-788 with either a strong cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A inhibitor,
      itraconazole (Part 1) or with a strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin (Part 2) in healthy adult
      participants.

      The study enrolled 24 healthy participants. The study was designed to consist of 2 parts:
      Part 1- TAK-788 assessment with itraconazole Part 2- TAK-788 assessment with rifampin. Part 1
      had 2 cohorts:

      Part 1: Participants (n = 12) received a single oral dose of 20 mg capsule of TAK-788 on Day
      1 of Period 1 followed by 200 mg itraconazole oral solution once daily (QD) in Period 2 on
      Days 1 to Day 14 and a single oral dose of TAK-788 20 mg capsule were coadmistered on Day 5
      of Period 2.

      In Part 2 participants (n = 12) received a single oral 160 mg dose of TAK-788 capsules in
      Period 1 of Day 1 followed by 600 mg capsules of rifampin QD in Period 2 Days 1 to Day 13 and
      a single dose of 160 mg TAK-788 capsules was coadministered on Day 7 of Period 1. There was a
      washout period of 7 days between the dose of TAK-788 on Period 1 and the first dose of
      rifampin in Period 2.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was approximately 120 days (including screening period). Participants were
      contacted by telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
