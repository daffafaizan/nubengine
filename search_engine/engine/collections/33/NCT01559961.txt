    
      Single doses of TTI-1612, at seven escalating dose levels, will be administered
      intravesically to women with IC/BPS. Drug will be retained in the bladder for 30 minutes.

      TTI-1612 pharmacokinetics will be studied through the collection of blood samples at various
      time points, from 5 minutes to 8 hours post administration on dosing day, then at 24 and 48
      hours post dosing. Serum will be isolated for subsequent analysis and determination of the
      following parameters: maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed
      concentration (Tmax), area under the curve to the final time with a concentration above the
      limit of quantification (AUC 0-t) and to infinity (AUC 0-∞), elimination half-life (t½),
      clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vz).

      TTI-1612 safety will be determined through monitoring of the subjects' vital signs, ECGs,
      clinical laboratory evaluations, adverse events (if any) and physical examinations.
