    
      This is a prospective, single center, open-label, safety and tolerability study on the use of
      Myfortic after liver transplantation. Adult liver transplant patients who are experiencing GI
      symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/pain, dyspepsia) attributable to
      CellCept are eligible to enter the study. CellCept will be discontinued and replaced with
      Myfortic. The duration of the study will be 3 months, and during this time, we will assess
      the incidence and severity of GI adverse events, the incidence and severity of bone marrow
      suppression (leukopenia), and the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or disease in
      patients receiving Myfortic.
