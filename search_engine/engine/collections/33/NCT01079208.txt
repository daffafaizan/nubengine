      support breast feeding at both the international and local levels. After breast milk, infant
      formulas are the next best source of nutrition for newborn and growing infants. Science and
      industry are striving to develop formulas that mimic as close as possible the physiological
      responses to human milk. There are a multitude of factors that make human milk the
      physiologically ideal for the infant. Among these, two important factors are the level of
      protein and the presence of pre-and probiotics in breast milk.

      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate growth of healthy infants fed a partially
      hydrolyzed whey protein formula with a level of protein closer to breast milk, with or
      without synbiotics, during the first four months of life as compared to the growth of infants
      fed a partially hydrolyzed whey protein formula with a standard protein level (standard
      formula). Additionally, the infant's digestive tolerance of the starter formula and frequency
      of morbidity will be investigated until 6 months of age.
