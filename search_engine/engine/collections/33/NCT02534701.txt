      multicenter study to compare the safety and effectiveness of ERIC® device in combination with
      SOFIA™ Distal Access Catheter in acute ischemic stroke patients using clinical routine data.

      Patients who meet the imaging inclusion criteria for ERASER will be included in the cohort
      where collected and additionally analyzed data will be compared to a historical patient
      cohort (referred to as ERASER imaging =ERASER+). All other patients will be included in a
      registry (referred to as ERASER), where clinical information will be collected. The overall
      study duration is expected to be 18 Months. The expected duration of each subject's enrolment
      is approximately 90 days. Subjects will be followed with assessments at 90 days post stroke.

      The basic concept of ERASER+ is the use an infarct prediction algorithm that has been trained
      on a large dataset of historical imaging data of patients treated with IV tPA, apply it to
      the pre-treatment imaging and compare its predictions with the actual outcome.
