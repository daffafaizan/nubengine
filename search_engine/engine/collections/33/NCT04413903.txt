      Demographic data (age, gender, weight, height) of patients, duration of surgery and

      after induction, T2: Gas insufflation start in supine position, T3: Maximum gas pressure is
      reached in reverse trendelenburg position, T4:Before extubation. SAB, DAB, OAB, KAH, SpO2,
      Ppeek, PEEP, EtCO2, optic nerve diameter will be recorded at same times. Cognitive function
      test will be performed at postoperative 24th hour for comparing the first awaken routin MMDT
