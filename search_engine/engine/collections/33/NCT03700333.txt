      Gimeracilï¼Œand slows down the metabolism of 5-FU in high DPD enzyme expression tumor cell, so
      that 5-FU could bring the antimetabolic fiction more efficiently. Plenty of studies support
      that S-1 shows a desirable effect on advanced non-squamous NSCLC, and S-1 is more convenient
      compare with Pemetrexed. The curative effect of Pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of
      advanced non-squamous NSCLC has been proved to be valid. The purpose of our study is to
      explore whether S-1 could replace Pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of advanced
      non-squamous NSCLC.
