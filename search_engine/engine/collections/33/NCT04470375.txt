      Louisville, KY area via various sports team events. The investigators have secured a meeting
      room space at a large reception room at Lake Forest Country Club (Louisville, KY) on August
      4, 2020. Potential participants will call to schedule time for participation to allow for
      proper staggering of participants arriving on the day of data collection.

      Research team will set up informed consent space at the entrance to the reception room and
      stagger participant arrival time to reduce contact with other participants. This space will
      be cleaned and disinfected regularly during the consenting process as new participants
      arrive. Once student and parent arrives they will complete informed consent and COVID-19
      screening form before being allowed into research space (reception room). Each participant
      will be given a pen to keep during the research study and go home with also provided with
      hand sanitizer to use before and after. No pens will be reused with other participants. Masks
      will be made available for anyone that requests one, but they will not be required while at
      the testing location. Parents of child will be allowed to sit in waiting chair keeping 6 feet
      of distance from anyone else. The child research participant will be lead to a chair in the
      room and complete pre-test questionnaire and then they will be set-up with a Virtual Reality
      (VR) device (cleaned and disinfected between each use) and go through a VR educational
      experience (~30 minutes) on Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE). Upon completion of the VR
      educational session they will complete post-test questionnaire and then be able to leave.
