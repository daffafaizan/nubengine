        -  intervention group: a strategy in which EAT duration is determined by (1,3)-B-Dglucan
           and mannan serum assays, performed on day 0 (day of EAT initiation) and day 3. Early
           stop recommendation, provided before day 7, will be determined using an algorithm based
           on the results of biomarkers.

        -  control group: a routine care strategy, based on international guidelines, which
           recommend 14 days of treatment for patients without subsequent proven ICI, and who
           improve under antifungal treatment, or less in other situations.
