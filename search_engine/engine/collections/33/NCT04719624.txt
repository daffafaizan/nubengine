      preservation bone grafting after dental extraction. This is partly randomized, subject and
      outcome assessor-blinded, controlled, single center study. The total study duration for each
      patient is planned to be 10 months. In total 4 visits per patient are scheduled in this
      study.

      Subjects will undergo a single tooth extraction and then will be randomized to receive one of
      the four bone graft substitutes, which are Adaptos®-Si (one of the the two granula sizes),
      Adaptos®, or Geistlich Bio-Oss®. Gelatin sponge is applied on the bone graft filled
      extraction socket. Non-randomized part of the study includes the patients that have chosen
      the conservative treatment option with dental socket left empty and no intention for dental
      implant placement. Following a healing period of 5 months, a dental implant will be placed,
      unless the patient has chosen the empty socket. The subject will be followed for ten months
      following tooth extraction. Bone ridge horizontal and vertical change assessment will be done
      by CBCT (primary and secondary outcome) at the time of tooth extraction, and 5 months and 10
      months post-extraction.

      The study device Bio-Oss® (Geistlich Pharma) and Spongostan Absorbable Haemostatic Gelatin
      Sponge (Ferrosan Medical Devices) are CE-marked. The products are used within the indication.
