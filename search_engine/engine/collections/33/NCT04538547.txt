    
      The study is designed as a two arm prospective randomized controlled trial which will be
      carried out in the Department of Radiotherapy and Otolaryngology at PGIMER, Chandigarh.

      Inclusion criteria

        1. Histopathologically proven non keratinizing nasopharangeal cancers.

        2. Karnofsky performance status more than 70

        3. Stage T3-4, N0-3 patients (as per AJCC 8th edition).

        4. Patients willing for informed consent and regular follow up

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma

        2. Age >70 years

        3. Patients who have received previous chemoradiotherapy.

        4. Patients with uncontrolled co- morbid conditions like hypertension , diabetes or any
           renal impairment

      Randomization Patients will be randomized into the two study groups using computer generated
      randomization table given below.Total number of patients to be recruited will be 120 and will
      be divided into • Study Group A (N= 60): Accelerated Chemoradiotherapy followed by 3 cycles
      of Adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients will be treated with radiotherapy for 6 days per week from
      Monday to Saturday

      • Control Group B (N=60) : Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy followed by 3 cycles adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Patients will be treated with radiotherapy for 5 days per week from Monday to
      Friday.

      Treatment Protocol Clinical evaluation All patients enrolled in the study will undergo a full
      clinical examination including a complete head and neck check up Investigations All patients
      enrolled in the study will undergo the following investigations

        1. Complete Haemogram, Liver Function test & Kidney Function Tests, Blood Sugar

        2. Chest X Ray PA View

        3. X Ray Soft tissue neck

        4. ECG

        5. CECT Head and Neck/ Contrast enhanced MRI head and neck

        6. Biopsy from primary tumor and FNAC from neck nodes

      RADIOTHERAPY Chemoradiotherapy treatment protocol For radiotherapy planning patients will be
      immobilized using S type thermoplastic cast & will undergo a planning CT scan with 3mm slice
      thickness. The images will be transferred to Eclipse treatment planning system. All patients
      will be planned with 6MV photons using 4 arcs with SIB Rapid Arc technique using the dose
      prescription given below.

      PTV70: 70 Gy in 33 fractions PTV59.4 : 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions PTV50.4: 54 Gy in 33fractions
      Concurrent chemotherapy will be given using Cisplatin injection 40mg/m.sq weekly or
      100mg/m.sq 3 weekly along with radiotherapy in both the groups. Patients will undergo will
      undergo a repeat treatment planning CT scan at the 16th radiotherapy fraction and will be
      evaluated for adaptive re-planning.

      CHEMOTHERAPY Concurrent : Inj. CDDP 100mg/m2 D1 q 3weekly along with XRT

      Adjuvant:

      Inj. CDDP 80mg/ m2 D1 q 3 weekly x 3 cycles Inj. 5- FU 1gm/ m2 D1-4

      Patients weight will be monitored weekly during treatment.patients will be reviewed at 16th
      fraction of treatment. Patients with a weight loss more than 10 % or a decrease of neck
      diameter by more than 10% will be evaluated for need for adaptive re-planning.Where indicated
      patients will be replanned .

      Toxicity & Response Evaluation Patients will be evlautaed weekly for dermatological,
      mucositis,Dysphagia, haemtological ,gastrointestinal & constitutional toxicity using Common
      Terminology Criteria for adverse effects (CTCAE v3). Overall Response will be evaluated at
      end of treatment using Response evaluation criteria for solid Tumors (RECIST ).

      Follow up All patients included in the study will be followed up 2 monthly intervals during
      the first year, at 3 monthly intervals during the 2-3 years and 6 monthly intervals
      thereafter. At each visit a full clinical examination, toxicity grading and disease status
      will be evaluated.

      Statistics Assuming a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% a minimum of 110 patients
      need to be recruited to detect a difference of about 25% in failure free survival including a
      drop out rate of 10%.For statistical analysis data will be entered into SPSSv 20.Treatment
      toxicity will be compared between the treatment groups using independent 't' test. Pearson
      correlation test and logistic regression analysis will be used to evaluate prognostic
      variables.Survival analysis will be done using Kaplan Meir analysis. A p value <0.05 will be
      considered as statistically significant.
