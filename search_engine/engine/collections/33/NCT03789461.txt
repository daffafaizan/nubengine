      of obesity-related insulin resistance. Obesity is associated with changes in the composition
      of the intestinal microbiota, and the obese microbiome appears to be more efficient in
      harvesting energy from the diet. Colonization of germ-free mice with an 'obese microbiota'
      results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a 'lean
      microbiota', suggesting gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the
      pathophysiology of obesity. Obese and lean phenotypes can also be induced in germ-free mice
      by transfer of fecal microbiota from human donors. These data have led to the use of
      microbiota therapeutics as a potential treatment for metabolic syndrome and obesity.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) represents a clinically feasible way to restore the
      gut microbial ecology, and has proven to be a breakthrough for the treatment of recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection. Furthermore, clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate
      its use for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
      diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. Early results in
      human have shown that FMT from lean donor when transplanted into subjects with metabolic
      syndrome resulted in a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and an increased in
      intestinal microbial diversity, including a distinct increase in butyrate-producing bacterial
      strains. The therapy is generally well tolerated and appeared safe. No clinical studies have
      assessed the dosage of FMT in obese subjects.
