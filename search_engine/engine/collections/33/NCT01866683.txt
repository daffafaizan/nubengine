      laboratory, having its efficacy in improving autonomic heart modulation of hypertensives and
      elderly subjets proven. However, there is a lack of data addressing the effects of such
      interventions on EEG patterns of health fit male subjects, as well as there are no study
      investigating if there is a relationship between heart autonomic modulation changes and EEG
      patterns. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 month respiratory
      yoga training on heart rate variability, EEG, salivary cortisol and quality of life of health
      fit male subjets.
