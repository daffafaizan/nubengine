    
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of WX-0593 vs. crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive
      NSCLC who had not received prior systemic therapy, to obtain additional pharmacokinetic (PK)
      data from sparse PK sampling, to compare the quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving
      WX-0593 vs. crizotinib, to evaluate the status of exploratory biomarkers and correlate with
      clinical outcome, and to obtain germline DNA samples for possible pharmacogenetic analysis in
      the event that outliers with respect to efficacy, tolerability/safety, or exposure are
      identified.
