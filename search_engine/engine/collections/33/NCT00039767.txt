      preventing withdrawal occlusion of tunneled, open-ended venous access devices (VADs). At the
      Clinical Center approximately 25% of such VADs develop withdrawal occlusion requiring
      treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). Because withdrawal occlusion
      is frequently caused by the accumulation of clot at the catheter tip, open-ended VADs are
      routinely flushed with heparinized saline. In theory lepirudin should be more effective in
      preventing accumulation of fibrin at the catheter tip because it can counteract the potent
      clotting enzyme thrombin that is bound in the fibrin, whereas heparin is less able to do
      this. In this protocol the assignment of the flush solutions is randomized. Because most
      withdrawal occlusion presents within a few weeks of catheter insertion, blinded flushes of
      heparin or lepirudin are given at least daily for the first 3 - 4 weeks of catheterization.
      Then all VADs begin unblinded routine flushes with heparin. The primary study endpoint is the
      number of patients in each group requiring rtPA because of withdrawal occlusion during the
      first 4 months after a VAD is inserted. To detect a 50% reduction in rtPA usage with a
      one-sided significance criterion of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 147 patients will be required
      in each treatment arm, although the accrual goal is 170 patients per arm to allow for a small
      number of unevaluable subjects. Since most tunneled, open-ended VADs at the Clinical Center
      are used by patients on bone marrow transplant protocols of the NCI and NHLBI, these
      populations will be the primary sources of participants.
