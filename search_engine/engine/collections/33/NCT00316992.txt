      for chronic insomnia. While 20 -25% of these individuals have primary insomnia the vast
      majority have an additional condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several
      studies have looked at this and have estimated that 30% to 48% of the general population is
      affected at some time in their life with a form of insomnia that goes on for several months,
      and about one third of those are described as severely affected. Daytime symptoms of insomnia
      include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and irritability. Recent
      epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified significant insomnia
      related conditions or diseases that relate to work productivity, health care utilization, and
      risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output, absenteeism and
      greater rates of accidents.

      Ramelteon, is being developed as a sleep promoting agent based on agonism of melatonin
      receptor subtype 1 and 2. Ramelteon is marketed in the United States as Rozeremâ„¢ for the
      treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep initiation.

      Sleep problems are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is
      evidence that traditional hypnotics can cause adverse respiratory effects in insomniac
      populations with respiratory disorders, and so the safety and efficacy of new hypnotic agents
      must be ascertained in this group of patients.

      This study will examine if ramelteon has respiratory depressant effects in subjects with
      moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Study participation is anticipated
      to be about 6 weeks.
