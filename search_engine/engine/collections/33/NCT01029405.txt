      Patients will apply both test article AN2728 Ointment B (0.5% or 2%), and Ointment B Vehicle
      twice daily for 12 weeks. The assigned study medication will be applied to two comparable
      treatment targeted plaques identified at baseline. One test article will be applied to one
      plaque and the other test article to an anatomically distinct plaque. All efficacy
      evaluations will be measured from only the two plaques identified at the baseline visit.
