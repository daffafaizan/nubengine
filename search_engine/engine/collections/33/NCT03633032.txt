      radiation by using radiographs or computed tomography (CT) since conventional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) that does not require ionizing radiation cannot depict bony
      structures well. Modern MR techniques, collectively referred to as ultrashort time to echo
      (UTE) sequences, have overcome this issue by acquiring the signal data much faster and
      therefore are able to acquire sufficient MR signal from bony structures. The investigators
      want to investigate if UTE sequences are capable to depict bony anatomy and pathology similar
      to imaging examination techniques involving ionizing radiation. Healthy adult and minor
      participants, as well as adult and minor participants, referred for a clinically indicated
      MRI involving the skeletal system will be included.
