           4 months. This involves on average a weekly supervised exercise bout plus other
           unsupervised exercise bouts at home. We will ensure participants are physically able to
           embark on this by taking their medical history, physical examination and validated
           questionnaire (PARQ). This program is for the benefit on the patients' long term health.

        2. MR imaging to assess fat: occassionally these may pick up anomalies which require
           further investigation. A radiologist will screen the abdominal images and GP will be
           informed on anything requiring further investigation.

           No radiation is received during MR imaging.

        3. Physiological studies: Patients will be asked to attend for 2 non-consecutive days
           before and after the exercise intervention. Regular blood samples will be required as
           apart of these investigations.
