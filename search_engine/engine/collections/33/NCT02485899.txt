    
      BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient
      in patients with CLN2 disease (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or
      Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy
      (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to reduce the
      progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material, and improve the symptoms
      of disease. The Phase 1/2 study (190-201) evaluated the efficacy and safety of doses up to
      300 mg/every other week (qow) BMN 190 in patients with CLN2. The dose and regimen for this
      study (190-202) are based on the results of the 190-201 study. The rationale for this phase 2
      extension study is to provide patients who complete the 190-201 study with the option to
      continue BMN 190 treatment. The 190-202 study is an open label extension protocol to assess
      long-term safety and efficacy.
