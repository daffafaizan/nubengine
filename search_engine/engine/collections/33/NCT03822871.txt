      doses of CTT1403 in patients with PSMA-avid mCRPC with progressive disease on at least one
      androgen signaling inhibitor, followed by a dose expansion to further evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy and biological activity of CTT1403. CTT1403 is a PSMA-targeted
      177Lu-labeled radiotherapy being developed for prostate cancer with a unique PSMA binding
      scaffold and an albumin binding moiety to extend circulation half-life. The PSMA binding
      scaffold is shared with CTT1057, a PSMA-specific PET diagnostic imaging agent shown in Phase
      1 clinical trials to be specifically taken up by PSMA+ tumor. PSMA PET imaging by CTT1057
      will be used diagnostically to select patients with PSMA-avid disease for treatment. The
      purpose of this study is to identify the dose limiting toxicity and recommended phase 2 dose
      of CTT1403. Eligible participants with demonstrated therapeutic benefit will be offered a
      second dose of study drug.
