      with ADHD raises the question of potential effects of structured group therapy. Structured
      skills training groups have shown beneficial effects in some studies in an outpatient
      psychiatric context by reduction in ADHD symptoms in individuals who remained stable
      regarding medication status.

      Aims: The main objective for the trial is to investigate the potential effects of structured
      skills training groups in a clinically relevant but still controlled setting on broader
      outcomes including both symptomatic, functional and health related quality of life measures.

      Methods/Design: The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled parallel group
      design. At each outpatient site the enrolled patients are randomized into two groups for
      either Group 1 (G1) with start of weekly treatment in active structured skills training group
      lasting for 14 weeks or allocated to Group 2 (G2) with treatment as usual/clinical management
      and with 15 weeks delayed start of their group treatment for comparison wth patients in the
      other arm. Those patients in the control condition arm receiving treatment as usual or
      clinical management of individual patients (G2), are thereafter switched to active structured
      skills training group therapy.All patients are followed up after six months with assessments
      of primary and secondary outcomes.
