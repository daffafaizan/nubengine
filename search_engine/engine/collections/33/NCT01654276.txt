      including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. This
      cluster of features is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease, and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Hyperuricemia
      (elevated serum uric acid) is associated with insulin resistance and features of the MS in
      cross-sectional epidemiological studies. However, it remains unclear whether this association
      is causal or simply coincidental. If hyperuricemia CAUSES insulin resistance, then lowering
      serum uric acid by pharmacological means may result in improved insulin sensitivity and
      reversal of features of the metabolic syndrome. In some recent small studies, lowering serum
      uric acid with allopurinol was associated with improvement in some of the features and/or
      complications of the MS: Allopurinol use resulted in reduction in blood pressure in
      adolescents and improvement in exercise capacity in patients with chronic stable angina. A
      low urine pH is strongly associated with insulin resistance, and individual features of the
      metabolic syndrome. Similarly, a low fractional excretion of uric acid is also associated
      with metabolic syndrome feature. We therefore would like to examine the effect on febuxostat
      on these two parameters which have been linked with the metabolic syndrome.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether pharmacological lowering of serum uric acid
      with the medication febuxostat is associated with improvement in the degree of insulin
      resistance and various features of the metabolic syndrome.
