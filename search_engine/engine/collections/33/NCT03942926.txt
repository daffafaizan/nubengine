      rigid cast of bronchial tree. Confirmed drug therapy for plastic bronchitis is lacking.
      Recently, part of plastic bronchitis has been found to have dysfunction of lymphatic
      circulation in the lung. Pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome (PLPS) is regarded as a major
      mechanism of lymphatic plastic bronchitis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) has not been studied in
      plastic bronchitis, however, it has been shown effective in several lymphatic disorders, such
      as lymphangioleiomyomatosis, generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) including lymphangiomatosis,
      etc. We wish to test the effectiveness of sirolimus in lymphatic plastic bronchitis.
