      extremity (UE) activities in the home and community and whether specific instruction can
      enhance motor learning and carry-over.. Systematic reviews of robot-assisted therapy for the
      paretic UE confirm gains in motor capacity as measured by clinical assessments, but provide
      little evidence of improved UE performance during daily tasks and occupations. These findings
      may be attributed to the limited availability of rehabilitation robots to train the paretic
      hand and a primary focus on intensity of practice with little regard for other principles of
      motor learning and experience-dependent neuroplasticity. These principles, including the
      salience of training tasks, transfer of acquired skills to similar activities, and active
      engagement and problem solving, are key to task-oriented training paradigms in stroke (e.g.
      constraint-induced movement therapy) but have not been well integrated into robot-assisted
      therapy protocols. The transfer of robot-trained movements to UE activities within the home
      and community needs further exploration before widespread use in rehabilitation practice is
      expected.
