        -  0.01% atropine one drop nightly is safe and with no significant side effects.

        -  nightly instillations of 0.01% atropine does not influence tear production.

        -  0.01% atropine one drop nightly reduces the progression of childhood myopia in Russian
           children.

        -  nightly instillations of 0.01% atropine decreases the manifest refraction and,
           consequently, difference between manifest and cycloplegic refractions.

        -  effectiveness of 0.01% atropine depends on the age and myopia progression rate at the
           time the therapy was started.
