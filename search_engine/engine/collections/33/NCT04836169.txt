      and opioid tapering system providing alternate treatment options via self-service Cognitive
      Behavior Therapy (CBT) built into a mobile software app, patient medication usage, and
      tracking of patient PROs. It is designed to be used alongside Usual Standard of Care using
      Pill Bottles or to simplify, Usual Care with Pill Bottles (UCPB) treatment practices. The
      InCaveo EOA System is designed to improve a set of patient outcome measures, primarily Pain
      Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and secondarily the Visual Numeric Pain (VNS), Kinesiophobia
      (TSK) and satisfaction scores while facilitating the ability of patients to taper off their
      pain medication faster than through the use of USPB in the management of post-operative pain.
      In order to reduce confounding variables, the study will focus on pain management following a
      single surgical procedure: Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery.
