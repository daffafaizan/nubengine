    
      This open-label extension study is designed to further assess the long-term safety and
      efficacy of MCS-2. Subjects who have completed the 12-week treatment and procedures under the
      protocol MCS-2-TWN-a will be eligible for another 40 weeks of MCS-2 treatment at the same
      daily dosage as the active treatment given under the protocol MCS-2-TWN-a. Subjects are
      limited to those who are currently not being treated medically for BPH or LUTS.
