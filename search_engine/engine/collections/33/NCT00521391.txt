      involving moderate-intensity exercise is an added value to a standard smoking cessation
      intervention in term of likelihood of smoking abstinence.

      The secondary objectives are 1) to determine whether this tailored physical activity
      intervention prevents weight gain, reduces withdrawal symptoms, stress and improve mood and
      self-confidence in quitting; 2) to assess the effect of this tailored physical activity
      intervention on body composition and leptin concentration.

      We assess this intervention in a randomized controlled trial of 600 sedentary adults regular
      smokers recruited from the community allocated into one of the two groups (intervention group
      vs. control group) during a 10-week period and 3 follow-up visits (6 and 12 months
      follow-up). All subjects (intervention and control groups) participate in a smoking cessation
      program composed of a pharmacological treatment (including nicotine replacement therapy) and
      counseling. The intervention group attend the 10-week physical activity program blending
      moderate-intensity exercise (Swiss nationwide implemented program entitled "Allez Hop!") and
      lifestyle physical activity and the control group a 10-week health education program to
      ensure equal contact condition.
