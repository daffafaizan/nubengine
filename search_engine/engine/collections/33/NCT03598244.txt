      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a phase II dose of volitinib
      (savolitinib) administered orally daily in children with refractory, progressive or recurrent
      primary CNS tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of savolitinib in children with refractory,
      progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of savolitinib in children with refractory,
      progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of savolitinib within the confines of a
      phase I study.

      II. To perform a genomic analysis within the confines of a phase I study to investigate
      correlation between response to treatment (as measured by objective response or progression
      free survival [PFS]) and the presence of specific genomic alterations (e.g. MET
      amplification, chromosome 7q aneuploidy, MET mutation, or HGF amplification) and/or specific
      subgroups of disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive volitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 39 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      for up to 2 years.
