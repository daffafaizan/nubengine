    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALVAC-HIV
      and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 or bivalent gp120 protein/AS01(B). This study will also
      compare HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell response rates at the Month 6.5 timepoint (2 weeks after the
      fourth vaccination) of ALVAC-HIV and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 to each of the bivalent
      gp120 protein/AS01(B) vaccine regimens. Additionally, this study will compare HIV-specific
      Env-gp120 binding antibody response magnitudes at the Month 12 timepoint (6 months after the
      fourth vaccination) of ALVAC-HIV and bivalent gp120 protein/MF59 to each of the bivalent
      gp120 protein/AS01(B) vaccine regimens.

      The study will enroll 160 healthy, HIV-uninfected volunteers aged 18 to 40 years. Groups 1 to
      3 will consist of a total of 150 participants who will receive the vaccines at Months 0, 1,
      3, and 6, while 10 participants in Group 4 will receive placebos at Months 0, 1, 3, 6.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, semen, and/or stool samples.
