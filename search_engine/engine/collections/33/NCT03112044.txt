      number of available donors. Many potential donor lungs cannot be utilized in clinical
      transplantation because donors have chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV)
      infection. This study will test the possibility of safely transplanting lungs from HCV
      positive donors. Donor lungs will be subjected to Normothermic Ex vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP)
      for 6 hours for organ assessment and reduction of viral load prior to transplantation. After
      transplantation, recipients will be carefully monitored for HCV infection and if infection
      occurs, they will be promptly treated with highly effective antiviral therapy using newly
      approved DAAs. The aim of the study is to show that transplantation of lungs from HCV
      positive donors is safe in the era of DAAs. The hypothesis is that the rate of HCV
      transmission to recipients will be lower than previously described due to EVLP pre-treatment
      and any HCV transmission that does occur will be readily treatable and curable. If
      successful, the knowledge from this study can have a large impact to patients with end stage
      organ diseases by providing a large novel source of donors for lung and potentially other
      organ transplantations.
