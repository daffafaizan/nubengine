    
      Condition The purpose of the FACE intervention is to facilitate conversations about EOL care
      between adolescents and their legal guardians or surrogates in order to increase congruence
      in treatment preferences, to decrease decisional conflict, while supporting plans and
      actions, psychological adjustment and quality of life. This intervention will consist of
      three 60 to 90-minute sessions in a dyadic format with a trained/certified interviewer. Each
      session will be followed by a 15 minute assessment, using process measures to assess
      participants' ratings of the quality of the communication with the facilitator and
      satisfaction (negative and positive emotions in response to session) on a Likert scale. A
      research assistant, not the facilitator, will conduct the immediate post evaluation sessions.
      A Standard of Care comparison condition will also be assessed and measures administered at
      the same time intervals: at baseline, one week intervals for three weeks for process measures
      and Statement of Treatment Preferences, and at 3 month-post intervention follow-up.
