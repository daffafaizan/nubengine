      associated with a high risk of thrombosis. Serial measurements of vascular access blood flow
      predict access thrombosis. At the moment, the measurement of access flow is time consuming,
      operator dependent, so that it cannot be done with every treatment. We hypothesized that
      extracorporeal blood flow at pressure of -200 to -260 mmHg in arterial line has correlation
      with access blood flow and this can be used to estimate access blood flow.
