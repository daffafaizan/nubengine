      multimodal or general play or seated play groups. Each child will participate in 9 testing
      sessions (4 pretests, 3 posttests, and 3, 2-month follow-ups) and 8 weeks of multimodal or
      general intervention between pre-tests and post-tests. In the 8-week phase between the pre-
      and post-tests, each child will complete group-specific intervention-related activities with
      the expert clinician twice per week via telehealth or face-to-face interactions. Each session
      will last for a total of 30-45 minutes. If the study aims are achieved, the investigators
      will validate the use of cortical markers as a treatment response measure. Findings from this
      research will offer evidence for the use of various movement interventions for school-age
      children with ASD.
