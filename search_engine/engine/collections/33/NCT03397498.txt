    
      Specific Aim 1- To estimate, in cognitively normal OO, rates of 1) computer and internet use,
      2) willingness to participate in a computerized cognitive training program, 3) ability to
      comply with the program to its completion.

      Specific Aim 1a- To explore the relationships of baseline global cognition, sociodemographic,
      ADL/IADL, lifestyle, and biological characteristics with willingness to participate in, and
      with completion of a computerized cognitive training program.

      Specific aim 2 - To compare the effectiveness of the CogniFit. and games programs 2 months
      after initiation of the intervention (corresponding to the time to complete the
      intervention).

      Specific aim 2a - To compare the effectiveness of the CogniFit. and games programs 6 months
      after initiation of intervention Specific aim 3- To explore the relevance of the wide range
      of already available sociodemographic, lifestyle, ADL/IADL, and biological characteristics of
      subjects with the differential effectiveness of the programs.

      Results of this study will provide essential information for planning a large-scale trial of
      computerized cognitive training program for the OO.

      The current lack of disease modifying treatment to delay onset of slow progression to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the robust epidemiologic evidence suggesting modifiable
      protective life-style factors (eg. cognitive and physical activity have led to particular
      interest in life-style interventions that delay the onset or slow the progression of
      cognitive decline.
