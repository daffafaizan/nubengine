    
      The post market clinical investigation is designed to assess instrumented posterolateral
      fusion (PLF) using nanOss Bioactive bone void filler with autograft bone and bone marrow
      aspirate in patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative disc disease
      with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at one or two adjacent levels from L2-S1.

      Preoperatively, the participant will provide his/her medical history and complete self
      assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation and x-rays will be
      performed if recent x-rays are not available. Participants will undergo instrumented PLF with
      an interbody fusion device (with autograft or allograft) using nanOss Bioactive in
      combination with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in one posterolateral gutter and
      autograft alone in the opposite posterolateral gutter.

      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected and a clinical
      evaluation will be performed prior to discharge. Participants will be evaluated 6 and 12
      months postoperatively. One investigational site will participate in long-term followup of 24
      months. Each participant will complete x-rays and self assessment documents. A CT scan
      performed at the 12 month postoperative visit will be evaluated by an independent radiologist
      to assess fusion results. Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.
