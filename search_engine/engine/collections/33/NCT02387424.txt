    
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) represents one of the most important recent
      developments in the effort to prevent recurrent depression. Explicitly designed to modify
      core underlying vulnerability factors among recovered individuals with histories of
      depression, MBCT may have high applicability to the prevention of perinatal depression (PD).

      During this phase of the project the investigators will conduct a two-site pilot randomized
      clinical trial with pregnant women at high-risk of perinatal depression, comparing the
      efficacy of MBCT-PD to a control group in the prevention of depressive relapse and
      recurrence. Participants assigned to the control group will receive "ongoing assessment and
      referral" (OAR), consisting of routine screening and referral to behavioral health services
      within obstetric clinical settings within Kaiser Permanente (KP) in Colorado and Georgia. The
      investigators will randomly assign participants at each site to 8 weeks of MBCT-PD or OAR.

      During this phase, the investigators will address the following aims:

        -  Specific Aim 1: To test the primary hypothesis that participants receiving MBCT-PD will
           experience improved depressive outcomes compared to participants receiving OAR,
           including lower rates of depressive relapse/recurrence and lower depressive symptom
           severity as compared to participants receiving OAR.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To explore the secondary hypotheses that participants receiving MBCT-PD
           will report improved functioning as compared to participants receiving OAR on a range of
           secondary outcomes, including indices of anxiety and stress and obstetrical
           complications.

        -  Specific Aim 3: To explore potential moderators and mediators of depression outcomes.

        -  Specific Aim 4: To train and evaluate the ability of behavioral health care providers to
           administer the MBCT-PD program with fidelity.
