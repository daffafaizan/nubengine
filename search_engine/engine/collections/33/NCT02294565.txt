    
      The study is a single center prospective, non randomized, single arm, open label, single dose
      VST-1001 study for lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes draining a primary tumor
      site in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer.

      This study evaluates the combined modality technique of investigational VST-1001 with
      companion medical devices (replacing the blue dye) and 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid for
      concordance in lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes in patients who are
      undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) surgical procedure.

      This purpose of the Phase I study is to determine a safe and effective recommended dose of
      VST-1001 for intraoperative lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes draining a
      breast tumor. The purpose of the Phase II study is to further evaluate the Phase I study
      recommended dose of VST-1001 and to evaluate its ability to provide intraoperative
      visualization of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes draining the primary tumor in patients
      diagnosed with breast cancer.
