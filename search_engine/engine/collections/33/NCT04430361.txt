      emetogenic chemotherapy drugs containing cisplatin from September 2018 to December 2019 were
      selected. The patients were randomly assigned to megestrol group (megestrol acetate
      dispersible tablets+5-HT3 receptor antagonist+dexamethasone) or control group (5-HT3 receptor
      antagonist + dexamethasone) at 1:1. The dosage of antiemetic drugs in the control group:
      5-HT3 receptor antagonist 2.5mg, dexamethasone 12mg on the first day, 8mg on the 2nd-4th day,
      all were injected intravenously with 30min before chemotherapy for 5 days. The patients in
      the megestrol acetate group were given megestrol acetate dispersible tablets on the basis of
      the control group. 160 mg of megestrol acetate dispersible tablets were taken orally every
      morning on the day of the beginning of chemotherapy for 10 days. The main end point was the
      proportion of control of nausea and vomiting between the two groups during the delayed period
      (24-120 hours after the beginning of chemotherapy), that is, the proportion of complete
      remission (no vomiting and no need for rescue treatment) and complete prevention (no nausea
      and vomiting).The secondary end point was the control ratio of nausea and vomiting in the
      acute phase (0-24 hours after the beginning of chemotherapy) and the overall phase (0-120
      hours after the beginning of chemotherapy); the proportion of patients with grade 3-4 nausea
      and vomiting during chemotherapy; the adverse reactions related to antiemetic drugs and the
      score of quality of life of patients in both groups before and after treatment.
