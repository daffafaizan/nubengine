      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerable dose and assess the safety and tolerability of
           imatinib mesylate in combination with capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess the response with regard to the expression and/or mutation of the tyrosine
           kinase receptors PDGF-R and c-kit in gastric cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days -4 to 21 in course 1 and on days
      1-21 in all subsequent courses, oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, and cisplatin IV
      on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks* for 12 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *First course is 25 days.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 weeks.
