      epithelial cancers, is well-tolerated, has non-overlapping toxicities with radiation, and has
      been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vitro. Locally advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer is cured in a minority of patients with concurrent chemoradiation but newer
      agents are needed. In this study temsirolimus will be studied in combination with radiation
      in a phase I setting to establish safety.
