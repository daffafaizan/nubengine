      reproduction, is not only a challenge for medical science but also an economic and social
      problem. Infertility is a complex disorder with multiple genetic and environmental causes
      (Gill et al.,2018) One of the factors that may be responsible for this phenomenon is
      contamination of the environment with heavy metals Two of the most widely-recognized
      reproductive toxins are lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) (Wdowiak et al., 2018).

      Food, water and tobacco and smoking are the primary source of baseline exposure to lead and
      cadmium (Tong et al., 2000; Bernard, 2008) Each of cadmium and lead were inversely correlated
      with semen parameters as, ejaculate volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, live sperms and
      rapid mobility. ( Zaki et al.,2018).

      Reproductive contaminants found in follicular fluid (FF) and seminal plasma may compromise
      the quality of oocytes and or sperm, which may become one of the risk factors for
      reproductive outcome. The data available suggests certain chemicals or their metabolite
      reaches the seminal plasma and/or FF, indicating their possible impact in In Vitro
      fertilization (IVF) outcome ,However, more studies are needed with regard to relationship
      between exposure level and affected parameters. (Kumar et al., 2010).
