      outcomes of the adapted CTI compared to enhanced usual discharge planning services. More
      specifically, 60 participants will be randomized to either CTI (n=30) or enhanced usual
      discharge planning services (n=30) at the time of discharge. Participants in the CTI group
      will receive pre-discharge preparation and planning services, as usual, in addition to 9
      months of assertive outreach and support following discharge. Participants in the enhanced
      usual discharge services group will receive pre-discharge preparation and planning services
      and three telephone recovery check-up calls following discharge. Participants will complete a
      baseline interview (prior to randomization) and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments
      post-discharge. All participants will be invited to participate in gender and
      program-specific focus groups to explore barriers and facilitators to transition and the
      support received. This means that separate focus groups will be conducted for the CTI and
      enhanced usual discharge groups and for women and men. The investigators expect to conduct
      four focus groups: one for women in CTI, one for women in usual discharge services, one for
      men in CTI, and one for men in enhanced usual discharge services.
