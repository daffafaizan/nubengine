      is a 12-week run-in phase when all subjects receive Insulin Lispro and Insulin Degludec for
      12 weeks. After completing the run-in period, subjects then are randomized to a treatment
      group of either HDV- Insulin lispro + Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 40%) or
      HDV-Insulin lispro+ Insulin Degludec (Degludec dose reduced by 10%) for 12 weeks of
      treatment.
