      cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Study compared the CL Detect Rapid Test vs microscopic
      identification of Leishmania amastigotes in a stained lesion sample. Two diagnostic samples
      were collected from the subjects lesion in the following order: 1) obtained with a dental
      broach for use with the CL Detect Rapid Test and 2) a second sample was obtained by scraping
      for use in the microscopic identification of amastigotes. Samples were analyzed by microscopy
      and CL Detect Repaid Test by different operators who evaluated each sample independently
      blinded to the other assay result.
