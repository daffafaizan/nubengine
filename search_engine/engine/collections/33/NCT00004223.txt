      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium and failure of only 1 prior systemic
      regimen treated with docetaxel and gemcitabine. II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. For patients with complete or partial
      response or stable disease at 3 weeks, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months through year 2, every 6 months through year 5, and then annually thereafter
      until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-21
      months.
