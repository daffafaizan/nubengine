    
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine
      if recurrent platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with
      chemotherapy predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated
      with standard-of-care control therapy chosen by the physician.

      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (no mucinous, low grade serous, or pure sarcoma types),
      with â‰¤ 5 prior treatments, and a performance status 0-1 will have a tumor biopsy or a
      cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug response testing with
      multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment
      (chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from a provided list), or to a study arm of
      FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

      A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata
      based on number of prior platinum treatments and BRCA status to ensure balance within these
      cells.
