    
      Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD)are usual and frequent cause of admission in emergency
      room (ER). No validated clinical or biological predictor of evolution are available.

      The main objective is to determine the prognosis value of Mr proADM in addition to the
      clinical risk stratification for AE COPD patients in ER.

      Patients presenting with a AECOPD diagnosis in ER will have a blood sample collected and
      freezed at their admission. Mr proADM will be assessed at the end of the study. Clinicians in
      charge of patients will not have the result during the management of their patients. This
      study implies no change in the patients' management.

      Data related to the patients'demographic,current exacerbation and basic COPD characteristics
      will be collected.
