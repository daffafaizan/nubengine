      the retinal morphology after inverted internal limiting membrane flap (I-ILM) surgery for
      medium-to-large macular holes (FTMHs) using infracyanine green (IFCG) vs brilliant blue G
      (BBG). This prospective randomized study include 40 eyes with ≥ 400 µ idiopathic FTMH
      undergoing IFCG or BBG-stained I-ILM technique. Just before surgery, randomization is
      performed using the sealed-envelope technique, based on the patients' surgical chart number.
      The random allocation sequence is generated by the trial statistician pulling 41
      standard-sized pieces of paper out of a hat. Twenty pieces of paper are marked with the
      Letter I, for IFCG, and 21 with the Letter B, for BBG. The trial statistician then
      sequentially puts each piece of paper into 41 sealed opaque envelopes. These envelopes are
      numbered 1 to 41 and given to the surgeons. Patients are numbered randomly from 1 to 41 based
      on a surgical chart number related to the baseline testing session and intervention period.
      Clinical data collection and measurement of outcome variables are performed by personnel
      masked to the randomization process and not been directly involved in the patients' surgery.
