    
      The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, clinical and virologic effect of DAS1814
      for the treatment of PIV infections in up to 60 immunocompromised patients with no other
      treatment options.

      Eligible immunocompromised patients positively diagnosed with PIV infection will receive
      DAS181 by DPI or Nebulized formulation.

      DPI: 10 mg DAS181 will be administered for seven (7) consecutive days for up to a total
      cumulative dose of 70mg.

      Nebulized: DAS181 F02 formulation in solution will be administered for seven (7) consecutive
      days for up to a total cumulative dose of 28.9 mg.

      Assessment of viral shedding and viral resistance testing will be performed on collected
      viral load samples. Blood samples will be obtained to evaluate safety at each scheduled
      visit.

      Routine safety monitoring (including Adverse Event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory tests,
      vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and )2 levels) will be conducted in all subjects. A
      final safety assessment will occur at Day 28 (+/- 2 days) after enrollment/first dose of
      study drug. Survival, diary cards, and quality of life will be collected at Day 60 and 90. PK
      will be collected at each visit on all subjects from baseline/visit 2 to visit 11/Day 28.
      Immunogenicity samples will be collected at selected time points in all subjects.
