      or halt progression of renal dysfunction and reduce proteinuria (in those patients with
      proteinuric renal disease). Multi-drug medical regimens remain the cornerstone of therapy for
      medical-renal disease, often with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or an
      angiotensin receptor blocker. These therapies, though often efficacious, have not been shown
      to halt disease progression entirely, and the medical therapy of renal disease remains
      suboptimal.

      PTF is a safe, generally well-tolerated drug currently indicated for symptomatic and
      functional relief of intermittent claudication presumed due to chronic occlusive arterial
      disease of the limbs. A number of small studies in patients across a range of renal disease
      states show that PTF can reduce proteinuria, an important component of treatment of CKD. It
      is not known, however, if the drug will slow progression of CKD as measured by glomerular
      filtration rate.

      placebo
