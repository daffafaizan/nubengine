      pharmacokinetics of CD4-directed CAR-T cells administered with lymphodepletion, and to obtain
      the preliminary efficacy results in subjects who have been diagnosed with relapsed or
      refractory CD4 positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified,
      angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The auto-CAR-T cells
