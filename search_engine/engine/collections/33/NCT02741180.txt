      methods to enable the creation of high-quality cine CMR images in the presence of multiple
      kinds of arrhythmia. Two arrhythmia-tolerant imaging methods will be adopted, which are
      particularly useful in arrhythmia: 1) 3D imaging, which is useful for many purposes,
      including "road mapping" of electrophysiology (EP) procedures, and 2) late gadolinium
      enhancement (LGE), which is useful for delineating abnormal myocardium, including fibrotic
      regions that can serve as sources of arrhythmias.
