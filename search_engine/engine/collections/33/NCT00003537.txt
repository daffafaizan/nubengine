        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with anaplastic
           astrocytoma as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial
           response) or stable disease.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with
           anaplastic astrocytoma.

      OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which adults with anaplastic astrocytoma
      receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal +
      Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months,
      patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment.

      To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
      performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth
      years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study
