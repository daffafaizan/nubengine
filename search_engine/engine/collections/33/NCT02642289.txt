      Although these results are promising, more research is needed to explore the role of
      probiotics to improve physical, emotional and cognitive processes in different clinical
      populations that are associated with altered microbiome. Thus, the main aim of the present
      project is to explore whether the oral intake of probiotics might provide benefits to a group
      of patients with fibromyalgia.

      The investigators expect to found significant differences between some physical, emotional
      and cognitive measures assessed pre- and post-treatment demonstrating the effects of
      microbiota on the Central Nervous System as well as its potential as a therapeutic tool for
      the treatment of Fibromyalgia.
