      followed by HLA matched sibling peripheral blood stem cell or unrelated umbilical cord blood
      transplants in HIV infected adults with hematologic malignancies. II. Measure the effects of
      this treatment on HIV viral burden in the serum and tissues of these patients. III. Measure
      immune reconstitution following treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a combination of 3 antiretroviral agents beginning at least 3 weeks
      prior to the initiation of the myeloablative conditioning regimen. The antiretroviral agents
      are discontinued on days -5 to -1 prior to transplant. Beginning on day 0 the antiretroviral
      agents are restarted and continue indefinitely. Patients who are given umbilical cord blood
      (UCB) transplants undergo collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) prior
      to the myeloablative conditioning regimen in case there is UCB graft failure. Prior to PBSC
      or UCB transplantation on day 0, all patients receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen.
      The conditioning regimen consists of total body irradiation twice a day on days -9 to -5 and
      melphalan IV over 60 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients receiving UCB transplant also receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin over 6 hours on days -3 to -1. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 3 years, then annually for the next 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
