      thornless, erect blackberry brambles and to healthily consume fresh blackberries using Plate
      It Up Kentucky Proud recipes. Horticulture, nutrition, geriatric, and extension experts are
      working together to design a blackberry-growing program that engages seniors and their
      community in each step of the process, from planting to harvesting berries. The lessons will
      be delivered by experts in their respective field, with accompanying extension publications
      and supplemental materials provided for replication of the curriculum in other counties.
