      fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure. Since the prognosis and monitoring of these diseases
      are different from each other, The term chronic liver disease (CLD) implies a long standing
      irreversible change in the hepatic structure that may end in complications like cirrhosis
      leading to premature death. While liver needle biopsy is still recognised to be the gold
      standard for the assessment of liver fibrosis in the diagnosis and follow-up of chronic liver
      diseases, researchers tend to study non-invasive methods in the determination of liver
      fibrosis, as liver needle biopsy is an invasive, painful and expensive procedure, which can
      cause possible sampling errors and potential complications , Conventional ultrasonography is
      preferred for the investigation of chronic liver diseases in children, as it is non-invasive,
      cheap, feasible and available. Elastography, an ultrasonographic non-invasive procedure that
      measures tissue stiffness.

      Liver fibrosis is a result of chronic damage, and attacks and remissions throughout the
      course of the disease trigger the formation of fibrosis. Apart from being a direct indicator
      of liver damage, fibrosis has an important role in the development of hepatocyte dysfunction
      and portal hypertension. In a clinical aspect, knowing the state and progress of fibrosis is
      important in the assessment of treatment response for the severity and the prognosis of the
      disease. The degree of fibrosis in the liver is important in the determination of prognosis,
      and management of the process in chronic liver disease. Patients with fibrosis benefit from
      treatment in case of early diagnosis.

      Ultrasound Elastography is a non-invasive method.
