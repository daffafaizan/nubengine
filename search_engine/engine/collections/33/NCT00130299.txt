      Effective treatment of childhood obesity is widely recognized as instrumental to public
      health efforts to combat type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Evidence from animal studies,
      short-term human studies and epidemiology suggests that diets designed to minimize the rise
      in postprandial blood glucose, that is low glycemic index, may be useful in the treatment of
      obesity and related complications. This project proposes an month RCT comparing a low
      glycemic load diet to a conventional low fat diet. Both diet groups will receive identical
      treatment intensity, behavioral modification and physical activity recommendations. The
      primary endpoint will be change in percent body fat by dexa-scan at 18 months; other outcomes
      include insulin resistance and CVD risk factors. Compliance will be assessed by
      interviewer-administered, 24-hour dietary recalls.
