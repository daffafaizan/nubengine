        -  Compare the efficacy of premium internet intervention vs premium internet with telephone
           intervention vs basic internet intervention, as determined by 7-day point prevalence
           abstinence at 12 months, in adult smokers.

        -  Compare the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in promoting smoking cessation.

        -  Determine the effects of internet-based interventions on measured use of the
           intervention (frequency and duration of use, utilization of behavioral coping, expert
           advices, and e-mail) in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of internet-based interventions on variables important for
           behavior change including mediators (e.g., self-efficacy, use of internet social
           support) and moderators (e.g., gender, baseline motivation) of outcomes in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender and baseline motivation level. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (basic internet program): Patients are directed to a website of existing QuitNet™
           smoking cessation materials. These materials are not tailored and have no interactive
           features.

        -  Arm II (premium internet program): Patients receive free 6-month access to the QuitNet™
           website including interactive and individualized intervention features.

        -  Arm III (premium internet program plus telephone counseling): Patients receive free
           access to the QuitNet™ website as in arm II. Patients also receive up to 5 telephone
           counseling sessions, scheduled at their convenience.

      All patients are assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,205 patients will be accrued for this study.
