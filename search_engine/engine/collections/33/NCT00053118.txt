        -  Determine the feasibility of administering an outpatient protocol comprising high-dose
           carboplatin with autologous stem cell support and etoposide in pediatric patients with
           primary central nervous system malignancies.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin when administered in this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of carboplatin.

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV once daily for 6 days followed by a maximum of 5
      apheresis sessions. If the target number of peripheral blood stem cells is not achieved, some
      patients receive G-CSF and undergo apheresis as above after a 2-week rest.

      At least 3 days after completion of G-CSF, patients receive high-dose carboplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 1, stem cell reinfusion on day 3, G-CSF subcutaneously on days 4-18 and 43-61,
      and oral etoposide 3 times daily on days 21-42. Treatment continues for a maximum of 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
