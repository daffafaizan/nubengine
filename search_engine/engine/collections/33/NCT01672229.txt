      particularly hematological malignancies. The incidence of acute GVHD has significantly
      decreased due to significant improvements in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching of the
      donors and recipients, more efficient GVHD prophylaxis regimens and the use of
      reduced-intensity preparative regimen. However, cGVHD remains a significant cause for
      increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      While many of the patients with cGVHD respond initially to higher doses of steroids, cGVHD
      usually relapses during or following steroid taper. Because of the significant impact of
      steroids on this patient population, there is an urgent need for medications to take the
      place of high dose steroid use in this patient population.

      We hypothesize that bortezomib can modulate the immune system and can be used to treat GVHD.
      At the same time bortezomib post transplant can induce a graft versus leukemia or lymphoma
      effect. Bortezomib has been used with minimal toxicity in post transplant setting for
      patients with aggressive multiple myeloma and also for acute graft versus host disease.
