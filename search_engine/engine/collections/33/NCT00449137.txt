        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and best dose combination of fluorouracil and
           arsenic trioxide when given together with leucovorin calcium in patients with relapsed
           or refractory stage IV colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine if arsenic trioxide down regulates the expression of thymidylate synthase in
           tumor and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22 and
      fluorouracil IV over 24 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection and fine-needle tumor
      aspiration periodically to determine the effects of arsenic trioxide on thymidylate synthase
      expression in the tumor and in PBMCs.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
