      inclusion criteria mentioned hereafter. Thus, 23 patients aged 18 to 67 years having a birch
      and/or grass pollen allergy were included in the analysis. The study is in line with the
      Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by the responsible ethics committee (FF 118/2012 (4
      December 2012); Landesärztekammer Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany). All participating patients are
      informed of the nature and objectives of the study and signed an informed consent document.

      The CPT is conducted using standardized and registered allergen extracts (ALK- Abelló,
      Hørsholm, Denmark). At the first visit, a titrated quantitative CPT (tqCPT) is performed
      according to a standardized protocol. In case of a positive test result, CPT-results are to
      be confirmed at a re-challenge one week later. The final CPT takes place 3 to 4 weeks after
      the 2nd (confirmatory) challenge for analyzing the primary objective of the trial:
      reproducibility of the CPT symptom score. Furthermore, objective evaluation of the clinical
      reactions after the tqCPT is documented using a MATLAB software program to calculate the
      degree of redness in percent. This is then correlated with the (subjective) main
      investigators' evaluations and with the external observer's evaluations.
