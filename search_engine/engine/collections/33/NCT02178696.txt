    
      We performed a single-blinded two-week cross-over randomized controlled trial of two
      identical oral placebos (described as having either potentially "active" fast-acting
      antidepressant-like effects or to be "inactive") followed by a 10-week open-label treatment
      with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or in some cases, another agent as
      clinically indicated. The volunteers were studied with PET and the Âµ-opioid receptor
      selective radiotracer [11C]carfentanil after each 1-week "inactive" and "active" oral placebo
      treatment. In addition, 1 mL of isotonic saline was administered intravenously (i.v.) within
      sight of the volunteer during PET scanning every 4 min over 20 min only after the 1-week
      active placebo treatment, with instructions that the compound may be associated with the
      activation of brain systems involved in mood improvement. This challenge stimulus was
      utilized to test the individual capacity to acutely activate endogenous opioid
      neurotransmission under expectations of antidepressant effect.
