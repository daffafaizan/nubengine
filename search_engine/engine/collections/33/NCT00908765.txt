      exercise intolerance are ventilatory limitation leading to deconditioning and inactivity.
      However the weak correlation between exercise capacity and FEV1 implies that other factors
      than reduced pulmonary function contributes to this impairment . Several studies have found
      changes in skeletal muscle, with fibre shift, increased oxidative stress, increased
      inflammatory cytokines and impaired mitochondrial function, suggesting a lower limb
      dysfunction

      Numerous exercise studies in COPD patients have shown physiological and physiological
      benefits of training and endurance training is now regarded as an important part in pulmonary
      rehabilitation. It is still uncertain what type of endurance training that is most favourable
      for COPD patients.

      In patients with heart failure and metabolic syndrome aerobe interval exercise have be shown
      to be superior in improving aerobic capacity and cardiac function

      We therefore want conduct a study comparing training effects in patients with moderate to
      severe COPD, that participated in an identical training program that in HF and metabolic
      syndrome patients gave significant improvement in aerobic capacity, cardiac function and
      skeletal muscle function.

      Patients will therefore be assigned to either 4x4 minutes high intensity interval treadmill
      exercise or continuous moderate intensity treadmill exercise 3 times pr week for 12 weeks.
      Aerobic capacity and work economy, pulmonary,cardiac and skeletal muscle function before and
      after the exercise training will be measured.
