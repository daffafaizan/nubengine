      seem to reduce the duration of attacks and to reduce the likelihood of future attacks.
      Immunomodulatory agents, available in this disease over the last decade, reduce the frequency
      of severe attacks by about one third. The remainder of the treatments are symptomatic, aimed
      at reducing the disability already present.

      Recent research into the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor systems suggest that cannabis may
      have the potential for affecting both the pathogenic mechanisms and the symptoms of MS. In
      light of the autoimmune hypothesis of the etiology of MS, THC could directly alter immune
      function in a manner that might reduce (or increase) the primary pathology of the disease.

      Comparisons: Three treatment arms will be compared:

        1. inhaled cannabis and oral placebo

        2. inhaled placebo and oral THC

        3. inhaled placebo and oral placebo

      The effects of these agents analyzed at 3 weeks and 7 weeks.
