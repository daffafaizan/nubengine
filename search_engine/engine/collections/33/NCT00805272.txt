    
      Principal outcome:

      -Theoretic therapeutic impact evaluation of the use of IGRAS for diagnosis of LTBI in
      HIV-infected patients .

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Medico-economic impact of replacement of TST by IGRAs in LTBI screening in HIV infected
           patients.

        -  Concordance of IGRAs results with TST

        -  Concordance between IGRAs.

        -  Concordance between IGRAs in accordance to CD4 number(< 100, 100 à 200, 200 à 300, > à
           300/mm3).

        -  LTBI prevalence in the study group.

        -  Effective consequences of tests results on therapeutic outcome of the patients LTBI
           criteria and therapeutic recommendations

        -  One or 2 positive IGRAs test: LTBI recommended to be LTBI

        -  1 negative IGRAs test and one undetermined : no LTBI

        -  2 undetermined:

        -  No clinical risk and negative TST: no diagnosis, eventually new test at 3 months or
           after HAART onset.

        -  Clinical risk or TST> 10mm: LTBI recommended to be treated. Therapeutic outcome
           evaluation Effective consequences of IGRA's result on patients outcome at 6 months.

      Analyzed criteria:

      Therapeutic impact:

        -  Patients percentage with different therapeutic outcome based on usual recommendations

        -  Medico-economic impact

        -  Medico-economic impact of both tests as early and late cost - efficacy

        -  Statistics

      Primary criteria:

        -  Percentage of patients for whom therapeutic would have been changed by IGRAs results
           compared to usual diagnosis strategy.

      Secondary criteria:

        -  Concordance of IGRAs with TST

        -  Concordance between both IGRAs.

        -  Taille: 1000 patients

      Timing:

      -inclusions: 2 years
