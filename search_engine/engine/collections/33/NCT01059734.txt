        -  Estimate the distributions of topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) expression and single nucleotide
           polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  Estimate the distributions of mutations in TOP2 phosphorylation sites (by SNP analysis)
           in these patients.

        -  Investigate whether expression of TOP2 or mutations in TOP2 phosphorylation sites vary
           with patient or disease characteristics in these patients.

        -  Test whether TOP2 expression correlates with complete remission rates, relapse-free
           survival, and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Conduct preliminary analyses to estimate the distributions of TOP2 expression and
           mutations in TOP2 phosphorylation sites (by SNP analysis) in patients with relapsed
           and/or refractory AML.

        -  Investigate whether expression of TOP2 and mutations in TOP2 phosphorylation sites vary
           with patient or disease characteristics in patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML.

        -  Test whether TOP2 expression and mutations in TOP2 phosphorylation sites differ between
           previously untreated and relapsed/refractory AML patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived RNA specimens are analyzed for topoisomerase 2 transcriptional expression by
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for mutations within TOP2
      phosphorylation sites by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.
