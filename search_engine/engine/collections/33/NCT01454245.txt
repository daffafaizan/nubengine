      participating in this study as well as to all study staff), randomized (volunteers will be
      assigned by chance to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences of a single dose of 3 different
      capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels of drug)
      and relative bioavailability (i.e., the rate and extent of absorption of the drug in the
      body) of JNJ-39439335 (Part 1 of the study). The effect of food on the administration of
      JNJ-39439335 will then be evaluated on 1 capsule formulation of JNJ-39439335 (Part 2 of the
      study). The safety and tolerability of JNJ-39439335 will be monitored throughout Part 1 and 2
      of the study. In Part 1, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment
      sequences and will receive a total of 3 single doses of JNJ-39439335. Each dose (2 capsules)
      will be separated by 21 days. In Part 2, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 treatment sequences and will receive a total of 2 single doses of one formulation selected
      from Part 1; each dose will be separated by 21 days. Doses will be administered to healthy
      volunteers under fed and fasted conditions.
