    
      SOT recipients (kidney, liver and heart transplant) presenting CMV infection or disease were
      eligible for inclusion if they were ≥18 years of age and presented a positive CMV antigenemia
      (pp65) defined as ≥ 20positive cells/105 peripherical blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
      Patients excluded were those with severe CMV tissue invasive disease, unable to receive oral
      medication, absolute neutrophil counts less than 500/ mm3, platelets <25000 platelets/mm3,
      Hemoglobin< 80g/l or estimated glomerular filtration rate< 10 mL/min (according to the
      Cockcroft-Gault formula).

      Patients received a short induction treatment with ganciclovir i.v (Cymevene®; F. Hoffmann-La
      Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) at the dose of 5 mg/kg/12h, by a peripherical vein infusion of
      one hour, during 5 days followed by treatment with oral valganciclovir (Valcyte®; F.
      Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) at 900 mg/12h during 16 days, after meals, until
      complete a total of 21 days of treatment. In patients with impaired renal function
      ganciclovir i.v. and oral valganciclovir doses were adjusted at each visit according to
      estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) by Cockcroft-Gault equation, as recommended by the
      manufacturer.
