    
      Gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. In the
      absence of specific paediatric studies, it is not approved for the same condition in
      children.

      The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by a) the lack of a suitable paediatric
      formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin pharmacokinetics profile and c)
      efficacy and safety data in this specific population.

      The GABA-1 study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of gabapentin oral solution relative
      to tramadol and to document the Pharmacokinetic and safety profile of gabapentin in this
      indication.

      GABA-1 is a non-inferiority trial because gabapentin is expected to be equally effective but
      better tolerated than tramadol, thus providing a clinical benefit to affected children.
