    
      A randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to examine the post-prandial glycaemic
      response, metabolism of bioactives and appetite related sensations to 20% incorporation of
      yellow pea flour (untreated, heat treated with 0% moisture and heat treated with 10%
      moisture) into bread will be conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute in
      Winnipeg, Manitoba. Eligible participants who have provided consent will be asked to attend 4
      clinic visits in a fasted state. Participants will be given bread containing 20% yellow pea
      flour at 3 visits and bread with 100% wheat flour at 1 visit. At each visit participants will
      provide 7 venous blood samples via indwelling catheter, 7 capillary blood samples via finger
      poke, 2 urine samples, 5 questionnaires about their appetite and a questionnaire about the
      acceptability of the products. Each visit will last approximately 3h and be separated by 3-14
      days.
