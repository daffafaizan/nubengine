      cancer treatment and is considered the most adverse of non-hematologic events. Current
      pharmacological approaches to reduce CIPN symptoms can be ineffective and cause adverse
      effects.

      Constituents of this oil blend moderate pain signal transmission through non-competing
      inhibition of 5-HT, AchE, and Substance P, along with antagonism of TRPA1 and TRPV1. This
      study will test the hypothesis that an oil blend reduces CIPN symptoms and improves
      quality-of-life (QOL) in breast cancer patients. The Human Response to Illness model is used
      to underpin a convergent-nested-parallel mixed-methods design with intervention.
