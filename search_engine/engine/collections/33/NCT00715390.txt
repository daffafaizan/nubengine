      pediatric population. This was last investigated retrospectively in 1992 when the predominant
      volatile agent used for inhalation induction was halothane. Sevoflurane was approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration in 1995. Since that time, Sevoflurane has displaced halothane as
      the agent of choice for inhalation induction and has relegated halothane to be used in a
      narrow niche which primarily involves patients with very specific congenital heart diseases.
      It has been described that halothane has a larger proarrhythmic effect than sevoflurane for
      ventricular dysrhythmias. With the transition from the halothane to the sevoflurane era, a
      reassessment of the incidence and types of dysrhythmias occurring in non-cardiac pediatric
      patients is important.
