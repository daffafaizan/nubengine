      fetal pulmonary artery acceleration to ejection time ratio (PATET) by a single experienced
      clinician. After the delivery respiratory distress diagnosis made by a pediatrician who were
      blinded the doppler waveform measurements.Following the diagnosis, neonates divided into 2
      groups as RDS (+) and RDS (-). In addition of RDS diagnosis, neonatal features like 1st and
      5th minute APGAR scores, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and duration in NICU
