      our recently developed brain exercises that contains a series of our recently developed brain
      exercises, including orientation, associative memory, word-image association, recall memory,
      etc. Participant can receive an optional electrical stimulation called transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) simultaneously during the brain exercise tutor
      sessions.

      Each participant will have a dedicated tutor for Brain Exercises with three scheduling
      options:

      A) 5 days/week, 2 sessions/day each 30 min) for a period of 4 weeks, B) 3 days/week, 2
      sessions/day each 30 minute for a period of 8 weeks, C) Remote program, 5 days/week,
      40min/day for a period of 4 weeks (this option is not available for participants receiving
      tACS).
