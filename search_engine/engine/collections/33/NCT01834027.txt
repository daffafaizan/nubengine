        -  The patients will be randomized to two groups: jazz music or no music.

        -  Head phones will be applied to all patients included in the study; in one group jazz
           music will be provided through the headphones. The second group no music will be played.

        -  Blood pressure will be monitored by a non-invasive blood pressure cuff at 5 minute
           intervals throughout the patient's stay in the PACU.

        -  Heart rate will be measured, using a pulse oximeter, at the same intervals as blood
           pressure.

        -  Before the patient leaves the PACU, she will be asked to rate her perception of her
           levels of pain and anxiety on scales that use a numeric scale of 1-10. The primary
           variable outcomes are: heart rate and mean blood pressure. Secondary outcomes include:
           perceived pain, anxiety, and level of relaxation.

        -  headphones will be used to deliver one of the following sounds to the patients: 1) jazz
           music (BPM<100) by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, Dave
           Brubeck, etc.; or 2) no music providing.
