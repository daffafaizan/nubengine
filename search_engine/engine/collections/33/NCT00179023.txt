      significantly change energy balance and body weight in the long term. We will test the
      hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity contributes to resting and
      thermogenic components of energy expenditure (EE).

      This study is divided in four different parts: (1), (2), (3), (4).

      Part (1): we will gauge the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to resting energy
      expenditure, blood pressure, and determine differences between lean, obese, and patients with
      primary autonomic failure .

      Part (2): we will determine the degree of sympathetic blockade by a gradual infusion of the
      ganglionic blocker trimethaphan.[Part 2 has been closed]

      Part (3): we will determine the energy balance in patients with primary autonomic failure.

      Part (4): we will determine the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to
      lipolysis.[Part 4 has been closed]

      Subjects selections*:

      For part (1) and (2) we will study six groups of subjects (n = 40 for each group): patients
      with pure autonomic failure, patients with multiple system atrophy, healthy normal controls
      (BMI <= 25), obese controls (BMI 30-40) and obese hypertensive (BMI 30-40) and lean
      hypertensive (BMI 20-28). A time interval of at least 1 week is required for those subjects
      who wish to participate in part (1) and part (2). For part (3) we will study two groups of
      subjects (n=12 for each group): patients with autonomic failure, and their age sex-matched
      sedentary, healthy controls. For part (4) we will study two groups of subjects (n=12 for each
      group): healthy normal controls (BMI 20-25), obese controls (BMI 30-40).
