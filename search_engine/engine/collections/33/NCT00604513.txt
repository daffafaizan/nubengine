      theater-based after-school program to promote healthy eating, physical activity, and positive
      body image with children in grades four through six. This study, funded by the National
      Institutes of Health (NIDDK), is a collaboration between the University of Minnesota,
      Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, Saint Paul Public Schools, and Illusion
      Theater of Minneapolis. Four participating Saint Paul schools were randomly assigned to
      receive either a control or intervention after school program led by artists/educators from
      Illusion Theater. Students in the intervention schools received a fourteen-session curriculum
      with eight booster sessions, in which they received the following messages: increase fruit,
      vegetable, and water consumption, decrease soda pop, increase physical activity, and decrease
      television. Families received nutrition and activity information packets themed for each
      session. The messages were reinforced by theater education, dance, and music. A play
      structured around the aforementioned messages that included scene vignettes, choreographed
      dance, and professionally composed music was developed and rehearsed by the children. In
      December 2006 the children performed the play for their families at Illusion Theater in
      downtown Minneapolis. They later performed for their peers at school and again for family and
      school administrators at the conclusion of the program.
