      gastrointestinal lymphoma (GIL) patients by performing metagenomic shotgun sequencing on GIL
      patients' fecal specimen. Before immuno-chemotherapy, the feces specimen of GIL would be
      collected and stored for further laboratory examination. This study would NOT alter the
      subsequential treatment of the patients.
