        1. Fever, tachycardia, neutrophil count, urea and other laboratory parameters at five and
           ten days post first dose of clindamycin

        2. Limb swelling (by the measurement of limb circumference), skin surface temperature and
           tissue damage (by the proportion of the limb affected)

        3. Document the duration between initial systemic features and the development of local
           signs

        4. Examine the effect of the duration between systemic and local features and first dose of
           flucloxacillin on the subsequent duration and severity of cellulitis

        5. Examine the effect of duration between the first dose of flucloxacillin and the first
           dose of clindamycin on the subsequent duration and severity of cellulitis

        6. Identify and quantify possible side effects of clindamycin
