      general anesthesia.

      The LMA-Fastrach is designed to provide a conduit for blind or fiberoptically guided tracheal
      intubations. However, the success rate of tracheal intubation on the first attempt through
      this device varies between 50 and 87%.

      The I-gel is a newer device for airway management which, with its wide bore, allows direct
      passage of a tracheal tube. Recent studies suggest that the I-gel is easy to insert and that
      limited experience is needed before a high success insertion rate is obtained.

      In this prospective and randomized study, we will evaluate the performance of both devices
      for tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia.
