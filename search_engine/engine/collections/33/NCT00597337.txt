      evaluated as a way to improve the quality of life in schools by altering children's attitudes
      and behavior towards bullying.

      Participants will be assigned to either the intervention or the control group. The intention
      was to assign randomly, however, only a minority of primary schools have the computer
      facilities to run the software with all pupils participating. Thus, assignment is based on
      the school computer compatibility with the FearNot!v.2.0 software for intervention versus
      control group controlling for social variables. Participants in the intervention group will
      interact with the software during 30-minute sessions once a week for a total of 3 weeks while
      participants in the control group will follow the normal curriculum.

      The FearNot! narrative comprises a number of emergent episodes, which play out like an
      improvisational drama. During each of these emergent episodes, the characters will act out
      their roles resulting in a dramatic movie-like display on the computer's monitor. In between
      each of these episodes, the child can interact with the victim character. He/she can learn
      how the character feels, and offer them coping strategy advice as to how to behave in the
      following episode.

      Outcomes will be assessed through student questionnaires at baseline, one week, and four
      weeks after treatment. In addition, classroom teachers will be asked to complete the Teacher
      Incidence of Bullying Scale at baseline and 4 weeks after the treatment.
