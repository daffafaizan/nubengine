    
      Myeloma patients in first relapse after sibling or unrelated donor allogeneic transplant
      willing to participate in this study will be screened for eligibility.

        1. After baseline evaluation including BM aspirate for plasma cell count, minimal residual
           disease using 8-color multiparameter flow cytometry, transcriptome sequencing and a
           positron emission tomography (PET scan), patients will receive Len- Dex daily x 21 days
           with Dex 40 mg once weekly for a total of 6 cycles of 28 days each

        2. Patients will then be evaluated clinically for acute and chronic GVHD before each cycle
           and a PET scan will be performed at the end of Len/Dex treatment

        3. Sibling and unrelated donor transplant recipients will receive 3 DLIs

        4. Disease and immune evaluation using serum and urine electrophoresis/immunofixation in
           addition to measurement of serum-free light chains, BM aspirate for plasma cell count
           and minimal residual disease using 8-color multiparameter flow cytometry, transcriptome
           sequencing and a PET scan will be performed

             1. A BM aspirate will be performed before each DLI for plasma cell count, MRD
                evaluation by flow cytometry and transcriptome sequencing

             2. Patients will be followed with a BM aspirate every 3 months x 1 year, then yearly
                and at progression for plasma cell count and evaluation

             3. Transcriptome sequencing will be done on BM aspirates at time of relapse, after
                Len/Dex cycles, 6m, 12m, 18m and 24m after the last-DLI.

             4. A PET scan will be performed after the last DLI and at progression.
