      past decade. Yet, this population continues to present with an increased risk of a number of
      secondary health conditions, many of which occur sooner and at a higher rate than the
      normative population. As a program established to address this post-rehabilitative exercise
      participation necessity, it is determined that the Spinal Mobility fitness program, if found
      effective, can have vast positive effects in addressing aspects of health, function fitness,
      and overall quality of life for individuals with SCI. In addition to the need for exercise
      respiratory training is an important component of prevention of illness in individuals with a
      spinal cord injury. Genitourinary, skin disease and respiratory disorders are the top 3
      reasons. Developing effective respiratory training programs in addition to exercise programs
      are critical for the prevention of illness and enabling a high quality of life. Pneumonia and
      septicemia are the two leading causes of decreased life expectancy in this population. Adding
      respiratory training to the spinal mobility program would be an appropriate intervention to
      further prevent health decline in these individuals.The spinal mobility course runs for eight
      weeks two times each year for 8 sessions for 4 to 5 hours each on Saturdays. Additionally
      individuals can participate in spinal mobility fitness training up to 3 times a week for one
      to three hours.
