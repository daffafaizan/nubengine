      further strengthen and standardize the management of participants with prediabetes in the
      communities, the investigators start this project of standardized management of participants
      with prediabetes in communities of Shanghai. Explore the standardized management model for
      prediabetes participants within primary healthcare settings in Shanghai, to reduce the risk
      factors of diabetes, improve the blood glucose control, and the quality of life of
      participants with prediabetes.

      Through the collaboration the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control & Prevention
      network, this investigators will implement prediabetes screening and lifestyle intervention
      in around 50 community health service centers in Shanghai. Life-style interventions including
      exercise and diet, and diabetes prevention knowledge will be integrated into
      "train-the-trainers" workshops. Trainings will be provided to community health service staff
      and peer supporters or social workers.
