    
      Participants will be randomly allocated to a group: one tart cherry capsule daily, two tart
      cherry capsules daily, one 8oz. bottle of tart cherry juice daily, two 8oz. bottles of tart
      cherry juice taken 8 hours apart, one placebo pill, and one 8oz. bottle of placebo.
      Participants will arrive to the lab at 8 am after an overnight fast of 10 hours. They will
      provide a blood sample and then ingest their study treatment. Participants will stay in the
      lab for a further 2 hours for additional blood draws then return to the lab in 6 hours for
      another blood draw. At this time if they are in a twice daily group they will receive their
      second treatment for the day. All participants will come back to the lab 24 hours later where
      they will give a blood sample and receive their next treatment. If they are in the twice
      daily group they will be provided with their next dose and given instructions to consume it
      in 8 hours. Participants will arrive 24 hours later for a final blood draw with no
      supplementation.

      Blood samples will be measured pre-ingestion, 1 hour, 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours
      post-ingestion. Samples will be analyzed for plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity
      (ORAC), uric acid (UA), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
