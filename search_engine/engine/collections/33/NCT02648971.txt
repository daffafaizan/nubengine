      Knee arthroscopy procedures provide a minimally invasive method to assess the status of the
      knee joint in order to repair injuries of the meniscus and articular cartilage. In the past,
      two or more small openings in the skin (portals) were required in order to allow the passage
      of both an arthroscope to provide visualization of the knee joint and the instrument used to
      complete the surgical repair process. However, recent innovations in arthroscopy
      instrumentation have resulted in the ability to use one portal for knee arthroscopy
      procedures with both the arthroscope and the instruments passed into the knee joint through
      the same portal. Both uniportal and two portal arthroscopic techniques are used currently for
      knee arthroscopy procedures in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Wake Forest Baptist
      Health.

      Objectives

      This randomized, controlled clinical trial will compare the outcomes of single portal versus
      two portal techniques in patients who have meniscus or articular cartilage pathology. The
      study hypothesis is that patients who undergo single portal arthroscopy will have less pain
      post-operatively, use less pain medication, and have a higher International Knee
      Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six months and one year compared to patients who
      undergo traditional two portal knee arthroscopy.
