      place in 3 centers located around Johannesburg, in the areas of Orange Farm, Sebokeng and
      Evaton. The intervention group patients (circumcised at the beginning of the trial) and the
      control group (uncircumcised men) will be followed during 21 months (from M.0 to M. 21).
      Randomization and medicalized circumcision will be performed at M.0 in the intervention group
      and might be optional in the control group at end of study. The medicalized circumcision
      effectiveness will be evaluated on and after M.3 (3 months after medicalized circumcision).
      Incidences (of HIV, HSV-2 infections and genital ulcer disease) will be compared from M.3 to
      M.21 between the intervention group and the control group. An intermediate analysis will take
      place at M. 12.
