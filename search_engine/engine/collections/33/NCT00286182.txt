      affected subjects are predominantly elderly women with several co-morbid conditions. Despite
      the diversity of underlying clinical pathologies and co-morbid conditions present in these
      patients, a common pathophysiologic explanation is generally applied to explain their
      clinical symptoms. Our preliminary data show that a significant subgroup with HFPEF has
      increases in ventricular volumes and expanded plasma volumes, consistent with a volume
      overloaded state. In the setting of a preserved EF with end diastolic volume increased,
      stroke volume must increase, indicating a high output state. Anemia may be an important,
      modifiable contributor to the observed high output and volume overload as well as exercise
      intolerance in elderly HFPEF patients, abnormal ventricular remodeling and impaired overall
      health status and quality of life. This protocol evaluates the impact of treating anemia in
      subjects with HFPEF. The specific aims of the current study are to provide a comprehensive
      and mechanistically based assessment of how correcting anemia in subjects with HFPEF can
      impact on functional capacity, ventricular structure and function and overall health status.
      We propose to perform a randomized, prospective, double blind study in 80 subjects with HFPEF
      to test the hypothesis that the administration of subcutaneous erythropoietin will be
      associated with reverse ventricular remodeling, significant improvements in exercise capacity
      and improved health status.
