      COVID 19 global pandemic has forced a paradigm shift with many centers rapidly adopting
      virtual visits to conduct care resulting in rapid expansion of the use of telemedicine
      amongst practices. Mayoclinic has published The Telemedicine Musculoskeletal Examination for
      adults. 'Paediatric Musculoskeletal Matters' (PMM- www.pmmonline.org, is a free,
      evidence-based, and peer-reviewed open e-resource for pediatric musculoskeletal (MSK)
      medicine targeting non-MSK specialists. They have also published video Pediatric Gait, Arms,
      Legs and Spine (V-pGALS), an assessment sheet for telemedicine visits on their webpage.
      However, there is a lack of the acceptability and reliability of these tools. The aim of this
      study is to investigate acceptability and reliability of real-time virtual video Pediatric
      Gait, Arms, Legs and Spine (V-pGALS) assessment for musculoskeletal assessment of children
      for telemedicine visits. For this purpose, children at between the ages of 7-18 who admitted
      the Pediatric Rehabilitation outpatient clinic of Department of Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation of Marmara University School of Medicine will be recruited to the study. They
      will be evaluated via V-pGALS face to face on the day of admission and the physiatrist will
      record the diagnosis if there is. Within 24 hours the child will be reevaluated via V-pGALS
      by using Zoom application virtually. The acceptability of V-pGALS examination to the child
      and parents in terms of the duration and additional discomfort caused was evaluated using
      visual analog scale with smiley faces (0-10, 0 for full acceptability).
