      disease, ultrasound to direct removal of the tumor, touch preparation cytology for diagnosis,
      and ablation of margins using radiofrequency ablation (RFA), we propose to develop a
      comprehensive system for same-day diagnosis and treatment of patients with small breast
      lesions.
