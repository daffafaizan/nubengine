      classroom. Each subject will complete the a 10-minute math test twice a day for three weeks
      on optimal dose or placebo, and then be crossed over to the other condition. Within-subject
      drug/placebo differences will be compared over the three weeks of exposure to assess
      tolerance in the analog setting.

      When school commences, 50% of the sample will be randomized to 7-day-a-week (continuous)
      dosing and 50% to 5-day-a- week (weekend holidays) dosing to examine the efficacy of
      prescribed weekend drug holidays for combatting need for dose escalations (tolerance) during
      the school year.

      Participants will be assessed monthly to detect deteriorating functioning. Using a
      standardized protocol, study physicians will increase dose for subjects in either arm who
      meet defined impairment thresholds. The difference between the two dosing conditions will
      inform regarding how best to deal with tolerance in clinical application.
