      24 hours in 1H-MRS. Few studies, with small samples (< 10 subjects), have investigated this
      point. Their conclusions remain inconsistent. Without an available study with sufficient
      statistical power, it is not currently possible to state that concentrations of brain
      metabolites are stable over 24 hours. Therefore, it is not possible to formally conclude on
      differences in concentrations of metabolites between a healthy subject and a patient.

      It is known that the human circadian rhythm leads to changes on many parameters such as
      hormonal secretions (TSH, cortisol, melatonin, growth hormone, and carbohydrate metabolism)
      and body temperature. It therefore seemed relevant to choose 3 of the most critical periods
      of the human circadian rhythm (7:30, 13:30 and 18:00) to assess the diurnal variations of
      cerebral metabolite in 1H-MRS. The DTI sequence will only be performed once.

      The study will take place at the University Hospital of Poitiers, in the department of
      Medical Imaging. 3 appointments are planned: the pre-inclusion one D0, the inclusion one D1
      including the signature of the consent, and the D3 one for the realization of the 3 MRIs at
      7:30 am, 1:30 pm and 6 pm. Each MRI scan lasts an average of 20 minutes.
