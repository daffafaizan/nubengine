        -  Design: Following lung function and exercise testing (incremental treadmill test to
           exhaustion, 5000m run time trial) participants will be randomly assigned to a verum or a
           control group. The verum group will train with a hand-held, commercially available
           pressure threshold loading device (POWERbreathe,UK). The control group will perform a
           sham-training with the same device. After six to eight weeks the the initial tests will
           be repeated.

        -  Hypothesis: Inspiratory muscle training enhances performance on submaximal work loads
           and in the 5000m run time trial by changes in breathing pattern. Maximum oxygen uptake
           remains unchanged.
