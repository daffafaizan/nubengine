      immunological diseases in which the development of these diseases coincide with temporal or
      permanent dysbiosis. Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy has the potential to improve
      symptoms of functional dyspepsia. The aims of our study are to investigate the effect of
      H.pylori eradication on the human gut microbiome and symptoms of functional dyspepsia.
