    
      Phase I of the study will be an open-label dose escalation study to determine the MTD of the
      combination of sorafenib and RAD001. There will be a 7-day sorafenib run-in period prior to
      starting of RAD001 during cycle 1 to determine the pharmacokinetic effect of adding RAD001 on
      sorafenib drug levels. Starting doses will be set at RAD001 2.5 mg PO QD and sorafenib 400mg
      PO BID, continuously. Cycle length will be 4 weeks. Between 3 and 18 patients will be treated
      in the phase I portion of this study.
