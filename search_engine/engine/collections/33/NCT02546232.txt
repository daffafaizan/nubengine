      breast cancer genome, transcriptome and proteome with extensive heterogeneity between tumors,
      potentially explaining the large variation in response to treatment. Classification of breast
      cancer can be based on such molecular alterations, and have shown to be of clinical
      relevance. Studies on how genome-wide mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) /miRNA (microRNA)
      expression, copy number alterations (CNAs) and DNA methylation, in addition to the detection
      of circulating tumor DNA could be used to improve prognostication and aid in therapy decision
      are highly needed. This project includes a phase II clinical trial where patients will be
      randomized to treatment with standard anthracycline- and taxane containing chemotherapy with
      or without the addition of carboplatin. The study aims to include patients in two cohorts as
      described, with large primary breast cancer (cohort I - 150 patients) and patients with
      metastatic disease (cohort II - 60 patients). Essential for the study is the mandatory tissue
      samples for comprehensive molecular analyses to identify markers of response.
