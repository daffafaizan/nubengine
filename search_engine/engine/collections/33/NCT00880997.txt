      cocaine addiction in humans. The results of this study will provide medical safety data on
      the duration of the induction schedule that will be optimal for attaining our target dose of
      8 mg doxazosin daily and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related
      alpha 1 receptor antagonists for cocaine addiction.

      This 17-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial includes a 13 week medication
      trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 4 week washout period(weeks 14-17). Qualifying subjects will be
      randomized to receive Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Medication induction will occur at a rate of 2mg/week until 8mg/day target dose is achieved
      as follows:

        1. Dox-Fast Group: Defined as participants reaching the target dose after a 4-week
           titration period. Participants will be stabilized on doxazosin or placebo over weeks
           4-13 (for Dox-Fast group)

        2. Dox-Slow Group: Defined as participants reaching the target dose after an 8-week
           titration period. Participants will be stabilized on doxazosin or placebo over weeks
           8-13 (for Dox-Slow group)

      Both groups will be tapered off doxazosin or placebo over study weeks 14-17.
