      visualize their data, but also to explore changes to their meals and insulin parameters, and
      easily estimate their potential clinical impact. WST is an educational tool, and as such, it
      does not have prescriptive power. This platform collects glucose, insulin and meal data from
      the participants' insulin pump, and generates personalized models of their glucose
      metabolism. Both data collection and model personalization are backend processes, that is,
      without user intervention.

      Participants can interact with WST through a user interface (UI) that is equipped with a
      dashboard page, where they can:

      (i) select a particular date range using a calendar to visualize their historical glucose
      control, such as glucose traces, and time in range;

      (ii) control the amount of information on the screen - users can show/hide more details, such
      as glucose variability;

      (iii) select different insulin therapy parameters: basal rate, insulin sensitivity factor,
      and carbohydrate ratio;

      (iv) change their values by moving a slider;

      (v) select informed meals within the selected date range, and modify their time and size by
      moving a slider;

      (vi) run a simulation with the modified insulin therapy parameters and meals by tapping a
      button;

      (vii) save the insulin and meal settings of the simulations to compare multiple
      configurations; and

      (viii) generate a report from the selected simulation, comparing both original and simulated
      or replay data.
