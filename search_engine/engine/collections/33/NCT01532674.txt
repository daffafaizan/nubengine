      periodontitis and gingivitis with no problems of resistance, as it happens when we use
      antibiotics. The efficacy of this low power laser has been demonstrated in numerous fields in
      medicine and have been use it for years. The application of the photodynamic therapy is easy
      since we only have to fill the periodontal pocket with the photosensitive agent and apply the
      low power laser in that area. The photosensitive agent stain the bacteria immediately and the
      laser disrupts its membrane by a free-radical reaction. Improving the health status of the
      patients in a few weeks after treatment.
