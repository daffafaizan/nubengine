      comparing the rates of medically attended events (MAEs) (including serious adverse events
      [SAEs], anaphylaxis, urticaria, asthma, wheezing, pre-specified grouped diagnoses, and rare
      events potentially related to wild-type influenza) in FluMist recipients to rates in multiple
      non-randomized control groups.
