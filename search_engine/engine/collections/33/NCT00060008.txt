        -  Determine whether fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and MR
           perfusion studies can predict plexiform neurofibroma growth rates in patients with
           neurofibromatosis 1.

        -  Determine whether FDG-PET and MR perfusion studies can predict the likelihood of
           response in patients who are undergoing investigational treatment for plexiform
           neurofibromas.

        -  Identify neuroimaging characteristics that distinguish patients who have responded to
           therapy from those who have not after completion of treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Stratum 1: Patients undergo MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate dimeglumine and
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) at baseline and quantitative
           MRI evaluation at baseline and 1 year.

        -  Stratum 2: Patients undergo quantitative MRI, MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate
           dimeglumine, and FDG-PET at baseline and 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (32 for stratum 1 and 16 for stratum 2) will be
      accrued for this study.
