      is no therapist involvement and the intervention is delivered to families on the waitlist of
      Eating Disorder program at McMaster Children's Hospital. The intervention would involve a
      series of prerecorded videos and reading material. This, in combination with the development
      of a clinical care pathway, would help to manage the extraordinary volumes of referrals
      recently been received. The need to social distance brought on by the pandemic presents the
      opportunity to consider the value of this waitlist intervention as a structured program for
      parents who have a child waiting for service. A model such as this could dramatically improve
      parental abilities to begin to re-feed their children, thereby reducing acuity and time spent
      in treatment. Similarly, some parents on the waitlist may decide that the proposed treatment
      model is not suitable after they have received the proposed waitlist intervention, and may
      wish to seek treatment elsewhere. Alternatively, parents may be able to shift the pattern of
      weight loss and/or binge purge behavior in children so that the severity of illness is
      decreased by the time of assessment. If successful, this intervention and clinical care
      pathway for waitlisted patients and their families could be disseminated to other tertiary
      care centers, thereby reducing mounting pressures on these centers.
