    
      Pollen allergic rhinitis is a very common condition whose symptomatic treatment is not always
      sufficient or satisfactory. The indication for allergic immunotherapy (IT) therefore often
      arises. The indication is based on the interrogation of the patient (chronology and severity
      of symptoms) and skin tests. But the interrogation, necessarily retrospective, brings often
      vague information and skin tests can be positive for allergens that have no clinical role
      (cross allergies).

      The objective of the project is to help the clinician in the indication of the IT, on the one
      hand by setting up a prospective and computerized collection of symptoms by a computer
      logbook accessible by the mobile phone of the patient. on the other hand by performing on the
      patient's serum a molecular diagnosis allow the identification of the major allergens to
      which the patient is sensitized.

      The same study will be conducted in 7 centers in southern European countries (where the
      diagnosis of pollen allergies is the most complex) in patients aged 10 to 60 years with
      pollinosis. The examinations added by the research will take place during two routine visits:
      during a first visit, these patients will answer a standardized questionnaire, have a battery
      of allergological skin tests and a blood sample for molecular diagnosis. An application will
      then be loaded on their mobile phone and they will record their symptoms and medication
      during the pollen season. During a second visit, at the end of the pollen season, the
      allergist, in view of the data collected in the electronic notebook and the results of the
      molecular diagnosis will be able to prescribe a possible IT.
