    
      ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the
      treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia.
      Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI
      apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study -
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months.

      ADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically
      significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs,
      electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms. Safety will also be
      measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory (NPI).

      Changes from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using
      the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed.

      Cost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and
      cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)
      and other scales.

      A biomarker sub-study initiated part-way through the main trial will collect information on
      blood-based biomarkers, including microRNA, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation,
      neuronal loss and lipidomics.
