      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib,
      and dexamethasone (PVD) to take forward in a subsequent phase 2 study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy of PVD regimen as initial treatment of amyloid
      light-chain (AL) or light chain deposition disease (LCDD).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and bortezomib.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21; bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days
      1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 3 months.
