      exacerbated by a dilutional coagulopathy. Multimodal blood conservation strategies may limit
      allogeneic transfusions, although RCTs are few and limited. It is essential to investigate
      these techniques to determine their potential to reduce allogeneic blood transfusions and
      their associated cost and morbidity.

      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic drug that competitively inhibits the
      lysine binding sites of plasminogen, plasmin, and tissue plasminogen activator. The result is
      inhibition of fibrinolysis and clot degradation.

      Recent studies in adults undergoing cardiac surgery demonstrated that people with different
      genotypes for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene may have varying degrees of
      bleeding. PAI-1 inhibits the transformation of plasminogen to plasmin thereby decreasing
      plasmin-induced fibrinolysis. Thus, PAI-1 promotes clot stability and the PAI-1 polymorphism
      will affect the degree of bleeding and response to TXA during craniosynostosis surgery.
