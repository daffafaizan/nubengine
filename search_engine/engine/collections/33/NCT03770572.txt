    
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study of AT-GTX-502
      administered intrathecally into the lumbar spinal cord region of pediatric patients with CLN3
      Batten disease.

      This study consists of a one-time injection of AT-GTX-502 with follow-up visits on Day 7, 14,
      21, and 30, followed by every 3 months through 1 year post-dose, and then every 6 months
      through the second and third years. There are two Cohorts with a low dose and a high dose.

      The primary outcome for this clinical study is to evaluate safety. The co-primary objective
      is to determine the efficacy of AT-GTX-502 as measured by United Batten Disease Rating Scale
      (UBDRS) physical subscale.

      The secondary outcome measures include Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) inventory, seizure
      subscale of the UBDRS and global impression subscale of the UBDRS.

      The exploratory outcome measures include visual impairment assessment, cognitive evaluations,
      Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG)
      and echocardiogram (ECHO).
