      Collabri. It is changed according to gathered information under the first study of the
      Collabri model in order to achieve a Danish Collaborative Care model easier to implement.

      The aims of Project Collabri Flex are to:

        -  Develop a flexible model for collaborative care (the Collabri Flex model) for patients
           with depression.

        -  Study the effects of this Collabri Flex model against consultation liaison in a
           randomized design on selected outcomes.

      In Collabri the treatment is in line with a set of general treatment principles relevant for
      collaborative care interventions. The patients in the intervention group are offered
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation and medication according to a stepped
      care model by a care manager refering to the general practitioner.

      The Collabri Flex study is set up as a researcher-blinded individually randomized controlled
      trial with participation of an intervention group (treatment according to the Collabri Flex
      model) and a consultation liaison group.

      This study will contribute with new knowledge on collaborative care interventions in a
      Scandinavian context.
