      relapse ("high risk" stage II and all stage III) is represented by the regimen FOLFOX
      (leucovorin, bolus and infusional 5fluorouracil and oxaliplatin), which is able to increase
      significantly the disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 4 years, whereas the advantage for
      5-year overall survival (OS) (which is predicted by the previous parameter) could be observed
      only with a further increase of follow-up. The conventional duration of chemotherapy is today
      of 6 months (12 courses every 2 weeks), but this long drug exposure increases the risk of
      long-term neurotoxicity. A reduction of adjuvant chemotherapy under 6 months was proven
      effective in other cancers (breast, testisâ€¦) and is better tolerated by patients in clinical
      practice. On the other hand, bevacizumab significantly increases OS and all other parameters
      when combined with standard chemotherapy in advanced disease.
