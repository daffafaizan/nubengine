      procedures have been investigated. N-acetylcysteine and hydration with sodium bicarbonate are
      proved to be protective against contrast acute kidney injury. The adenosine-mediated afferent
      arteriolar vasoconstriction is a possible pathomechanism of renal impairment by contrast
      agent. It has been observed that aminophylline/theophylline, competitive adenosine
      antagonists, improves oxygen delivery to ischemic tissue, diminishes oxidative damage to
      renal tissue and may also scavenge free radicals.

      The purpose of this study was to investigated whether the additional therapy with adenosine
      antagonist aminophylline reduces the incidence of contrast renal damage in high risk patients
      who have acute myocardial infarction.
