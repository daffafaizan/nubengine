      be randomised to a dietary weight loss intervention (ADF or CR) to achieve â‰¥5% WL.
      Behavioural measures of appetite control including ad libitum intake after a fixed meal, body
      composition, resting metabolic rate, measured physical activity and daily energy expenditure,
      sleep quality, hedonic food reward and eating behaviour traits will be assessed before,
      during and after the WL intervention in those who reach the target weight loss within 12
      weeks. After weight loss phase, participants will be given standard healthy eating and
      physical activity advice for weight maintenance and body weight will be followed up after
      weight loss at 12 months.
