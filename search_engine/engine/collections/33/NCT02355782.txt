      compassionate use to patients who have participated in clinical trial OMS721-TMA-001.
      Patients will be eligible if markers of disease activity, such as platelet count, LDH, and
      haptoglobin, were observed to improve during the study or if the patients disease activity
      remained stable, but they could be treated with a higher dose that may be beneficial. Safety
      measures of adverse events and laboratory measures will be monitored. Markers of disease
      activity, pharmacokinetics and ex vivo pharmacodynamics will also be monitored.
