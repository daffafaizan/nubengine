      I. Determine the antitumor activity of perifosine in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      squamous cell head and neck cancer.

      II. Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
      drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the
      pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. V. Assess the usefulness of biomarkers in
      predicting response and other outcome parameters in patients treated with this drug.

      VI. Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral perifosine 4 times daily on days 1 and 2 and once daily on days 3-28
      during course 1. Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28 for all subsequent
      courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during the first month, every 28 days after
      the first month, and then at study withdrawal.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
