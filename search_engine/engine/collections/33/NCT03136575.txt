      the 5th leading cause of cancer death, causing approximately 2000 death in 2010. Head and
      neck cancers patients usually require multimodality treatments, including surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These treatments can cause functional deterioration and
      worsened quality of life during or after the treatment, and bring tremendous effects on
      patient's life. When radiotherapy is indicated, it requires 6 to 7 weeks treatment, and most
      patients suffered from different degrees of mucositis, dermatitis, xerostomia and neck and
      shoulder tightness during radiotherapy. How to improve quality of life for these patients
      during radiotherapy is an important task.

      Qigong is a mind-body exercise or therapy; it can improve quality of life, such as fatigue,
      sleep dysfunction and depression through regulation of breath and simple physical exercise.
      Some found that the qigong can decrease inflammation and show some impact on accommodation of
      ANS in cancer patients. Most studies focus on how qigong effect on cancer survivors, however,
      this study is aimed to observe how a six week qigong program influence patients with head and
      neck cancer during active radiotherapy treatment course. The quality of life, sleep
      dysfunction or depression and shoulder and neck function will be accessed by questionnaire,
      and ANS function will be objectively investigated using heart rate variability measurement.
