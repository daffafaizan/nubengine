      undergoing outpatient surgery will be recruited . Before surgery patients will be tested for
      pain sensitivity and threshold using a Pathway Pain & sensory evaluation system (Medoc,
      Dunham, NC).Subjects will randomized using a computer generated table of random numbers to
      two groups: Active (Esmolol 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 5-15 mcg/kg/min titrated to
      keep heart rate between 50 and 70 BPM) or control (same volume of normal saline).The infusion
      will be discontinued at the end of the surgical procedure. Subjects will receive a standard
      anesthetic regimen: Induction (2 mg versed, 1-2mg /kg propofol and 0.6mg/kg of rocuronium),
      maintenance (Sevoflurane titrated to a Bispectral index between 40-60 and fentanyl 50 mcg q
      10 minutes to maintain blood pressure within 20% of baseline value. Patients will receive at
      the end of surgery ondansetron 4 mg IV to prevent nausea and/or vomiting. The postoperative
      analgesic regimen will also be standardized with hydromorphone 0.4 mg every 15 minutes to
      treat pain greater than 4/10 (scale where 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst possible
      pain) and hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 325 for pain control after discharge. Patients will
      receive ephedrine 5 mg q5minutes if blood pressure is lower than 40% baseline or if the heart
      rate is less than 40 beats per minute. Before hospital discharge patients will again be
      tested for pain sensitivity and threshold using a Pathway Pain & sensory evaluation system
      (Medoc, Dunham, NC).

      The primary outcome will be a validated instrument to measure postoperative quality of
      recovery (QoR-40) that will be administered to patients by an investigator unaware of group
      allocation at 24 hours after the surgery.Other outcomes to be evaluated include;
      postoperative pain sensitivity and threshold, postoperative opioid consumption, postoperative
      pain, time to meet discharge criteria using a validated instrument (PADDS).
