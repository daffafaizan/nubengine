      Jutland, Denmark.

      Data was gathered from 55 patients who completed the Cool Kids programme as a treatment for
      anxiety disorder(s) from autumn 2013 to spring 2016. During the course of treatment both
      children and parents completed the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS) at baseline,
      post-treatment and at a 3-months follow-up booster-session. This data was originally gathered
      for internal quality assessment at the clinics. As the data was utilized for the present
      study in 2017, it has not been possible to control for confounding factors or influence the
      data-collection process.

      All questionnaires were anonymised previous to being manually scored and keyed for secured
      electronic storage. Participants were excluded from the data analysis if they had one or more
      incomplete or missing CALIS. All statistical analysis was carried out in IBM SPSS 24
      Statistical Software and consists of linear mixed effect models and one-way repeated measures
      ANOVAs.
