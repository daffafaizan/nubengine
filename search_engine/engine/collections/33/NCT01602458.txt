    
      The goals of this study are to:

        1. Examine the difference between patient scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized to
           silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the
           prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin
           injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        2. Examine the difference between observer scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized to
           silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the
           prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin
           injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        3. Examine the difference between Vancouver scale in those randomized to silicone pressure
           garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of
           hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury at
           baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        4. Examine the need for surgical intervention in those randomized to silicone pressure
           garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of
           hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury.
