    
      The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      JOURNEY UNI Unicompartmental Knee System (UKS) in patients with non-inflammatory degenerative
      joint disease (NIDJD) of the knee who previously had the Journey UNI UKS implanted. This
      clinical study will prospectively evaluate the 36 and 60-month safety and performance of the
      JOURNEY UNI UKS in patients with NIDJD of the knee who required lateral or medial knee
      compartment replacement.
