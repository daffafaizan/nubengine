      insufflation in comparison with atmospheric air insufflation during colonoscopy. CO2
      insufflation was associated with decreased post-procedural abdominal pain, which likely stems
      from the fact that, in comparison to air, absorption of CO2 from the colon is much faster due
      to a much greater water solubility. Animal studies have also shown that CO2 insufflation
      results in less disturbance of parietal blood flow due to its potential vasodilating effect.
      Insufflation of colon with CO2 did not prolong the procedure or lengthen the time to reach
      the terminal ileum and was proven to be safe in both sedated and non-sedated patients . The
      use of CO2 for colon insufflation could possibly lead to CO2 retention and increased levels
      in the blood thus interfering with acid-base balance . However, previous studies reported
      that carbon dioxide insufflation did not cause increased CO2 levels in the blood or end-tidal
      CO2 (ETCO2) and complication rates were not increased when using CO2. Because of its
      advantages CO2 insufflation has become a standard of care in adult colonoscopy.

      To the best of our knowledge there are so far no published reports comparing CO2 and air
      insufflation during colonoscopy in children.
