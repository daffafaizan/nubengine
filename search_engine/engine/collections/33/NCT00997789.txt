      conducted in 30 healthy Korean male volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a
      single 100-mg dose of the test or reference preparation of rebamipide, administered with 240
      mL of water after a 12-hour overnight fast. All subjects were selected after passing a
      clinical screening procedure that included a physical examination and laboratory tests. Serum
      concentrations of rebamipide up to 12 hours after administration were determined using a
      validated HPLC method with fluorescence detection. Adverse events (AEs) were continuously
      monitored by clinical staff via observation, personal interview, and vital signs
      (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate) during the study period. All adverse events were
      recorded on the clinical record form per subject up to 1 week after the study.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a noncompartmental method. The preparations
      were considered bioequivalent if the log-transformed ratios of AUC0-t, AUC0-âˆž, and Cmax were
      within the predetermined bioequivalence range (ie, 80-125%), as set by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and Korean legislation. In vitro dissolution profiles of both
      preparations were examined and the influence of genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 gene
      (P-glycoprotein) on the pharmacokinetics of rebamipide was also investigated.
