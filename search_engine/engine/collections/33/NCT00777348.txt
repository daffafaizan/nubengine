           combination of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) plus reproterol in comparison to the single
           component reproterol in adults suffering from exercise induced asthma (EIA).

        -  Secondary objectives: to demonstrate superiority of the protective effect of DSCG plus
           reproterol in comparison to the single component DSCG; to demonstrate superiority of the
           protective effect of each single component in comparison to placebo. In addition, the
           tolerability of medications will be documented.
