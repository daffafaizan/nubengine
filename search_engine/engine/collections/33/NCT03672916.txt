    
      The objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcome data on the Allofit IT Shell
      in combination with the BIOLOXÂ® delta Taper Liner when used in primary total hip
      arthroplasty.

      This will be done by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event
      records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility and survivorship, and to confirm the
      safety and performance of the Allofit IT Ceramic Bearing System.

      A total of 200 patients will be enrolled in this study that will last 12 years (2 year
      enrollment plus 10 years follow-up) with the following visits at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and
      10 years post-operatively.
