      The investigators aim to determine the feasibility of performing a study that can assess the
      impact of ascorbic acid administration on the development and severity of cardiac vasoplegia
      in cardiac surgical patients undergoing procedures at high risk for vasoplegia.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of administration of high dose intravenous ascorbic
      acid in the operative and post-operative environments as well as sample size for a
      prospective, randomized, placebo controlled study.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine baseline ascorbic acid plasma levels in a small cohort of cardiac
      surgical patients.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of ascorbic acid administration on microvasculature as
      measured by dark field microscopy.
