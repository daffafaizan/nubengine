      the second cause of dementia and the third leading cause of disability. For a middle-aged
      person, the risk of developing a stroke is 1/5 in women and 1/6 in men over a lifetime.
      Moreover, stroke is a disease that can be considered chronic. Indeed, in France, the survival
      rate one month after a stroke is 80-90%. However, at least 50% of survivors retain a severe
      disability and almost all require long-term care. The medico-economic impact of stroke is
      therefore important in both the initial and chronic phases. Nevertheless, none of the French
      stroke registries consider the burden of post-stroke disability. In addition, there is
      limited data available on the impact of geographic disparities on the prognosis of stroke.
      Population studies are essential to accurately identify the incidence and burden of stroke,
      thereby supporting public health policy, guiding the allocation of resources, and evaluating
      the effectiveness of preventive strategies for a population. This is why we propose to create
      a Norman Observatory of Stroke. It will include an urban and rural population and will aim to
      become a population register.
