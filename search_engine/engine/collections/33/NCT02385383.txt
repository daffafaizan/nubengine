      risk of receiving allogeneic blood transfusion and anaemia has been associated with increased
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. While IV-iron administration may raise Hb prior to
      surgery, existing guidelines for addressing and treating preoperative anaemia is not widely
      implemented for patients scheduled for elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in Denmark. In
      addition, causes of preoperative anaemia and the efficacy of preoperative IV-iron
      administration has not been sufficiently evaluated in elective TJA.

      This is a observational follow-up study among 6 Danish high volume surgical centres that has
      recently introduced a standardized anaemia screening and treatment protocol for patients with
      preoperative anaemia scheduled for total hip- or knee arthroplasty.

      Patients with iron deficiency anaemia or anaemia of chronic inflammation receive infusion of
      IV-iron (Monofer) 4 weeks prior to surgery as a part of the standard operating procedure on
      the department.

      The aim of this follow up study is to evaluate changes in Haemoglobin concentration,
      transfusion rate and postoperative morbidity in this cohort.
