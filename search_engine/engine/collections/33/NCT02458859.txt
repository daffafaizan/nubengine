      managing patients with a chronic or sub-acute wound in a community setting with PICO and to
      explore the patient experience and issues of concordance that affect patients treated with
      PICO. The study will provide information on the level of clinical benefit that PICO can
      deliver in the population studied in order to justify a sample size for a definitive
      evaluation of PICO and the study will further assess wound types that may benefit from
      treatment with PICO.
