      with advanced solid tumors. Patients will receive IHL-305 as an intravenous infusion over 60
      minutes on Day 1 followed by a 27-day observation period for a total of 28 days (4 weeks) per
      cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately; patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype
      homozygous wild-type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one group, and patients
      with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group.
