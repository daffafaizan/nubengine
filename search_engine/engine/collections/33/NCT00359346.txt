      without central neurodegeneration (pure autonomic failure, PAF) reflected diffuse loss of
      catecholamine-producing cells (sympathetic noradrenergic nerves and adrenomedullary
      chromaffin cells) outside the brain. Rarely, however, PAF patients have clinical laboratory
      findings suggesting decreased post-ganglionic nerve traffic in intact autonomic nerves,
      rather than denervation. To date, all of four such patients have also had a high titer of a
      circulating antibody to the nicotinic receptor mediating ganglionic neurotransmission. In one
      case, studied by another group, plasma exchange reversed signs and symptoms of autonomic
      failure, consistent with the antibody being pathogenic.

      Purpose: In this Protocol, we will carry out plasma exchange in patients we identify as
      having PAF, intact cardiac noradrenergic innervation, and a circulating antibody to the
      neuronal nicotinic receptor, to determine whether antibody pathogenicity is a consistent
      finding in this condition. We will assess the extent of relationship between symptoms, signs,
      and clinical laboratory indices of autonomic function with the titer of the antibody and
      obtain abundant plasma for antibody characterization and target protein identification.

      Methods: Autonomic function testing will be done before plasma exchange, 1-2 weeks after
      plasma exchange, and monthly or bi-monthly thereafter for up to one year. Plasma exchange may
      be repeated once, when symptoms of autonomic failure return as the antibody level builds up,
      to verify in individual patients whether repetition of plasma exchange produces reproducible
      amelioration of clinical and laboratory measures of autonomic failure.
