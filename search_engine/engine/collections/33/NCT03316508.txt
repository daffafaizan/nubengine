      Vasopressin is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. Its main functions are
      constriction of blood vessels and reabsorption of water and thereby regulating water balance
      and hemodynamics of the body. Copeptin is a cleavage product in the synthesis of vasopressin
      and is released in equimolar amounts. Its stability makes it easier to determine the amount
      of vasopressin. It is known, that the use of a heart-lung machine in cardiac procedures has
      effects on the water balance of the body and may affect the vasopressin secretion.

      The aim of this prospective clinical trial is, to figure out if copeptin would be suitable
      for perioperative risk evaluation in neonates and children with congenital heart disease
      after surgery with the use of a heart-lung machine.

      Hypotheses:

      The primary outcome endpoint of this study is the change in copeptin concentration
      perioperatively in patients with congenital heart disease, with the use of heart-lung
      machine.

      Secondary outcome endpoints are correlations between copeptin concentration and complexity of
      the procedure (based on the aristotle basic score), clinical status and the perfusion times
      of the heart-lung machine.
