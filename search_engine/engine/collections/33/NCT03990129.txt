      1, they ingested a capsule containing the Basel Cocktail (1A2: caffeine, 2B6: efavirenz, 2C9:
      flurbiprofen, 2C19: omeprazole, 2D6: metoprolol, 3A4: midazolam) in fastened state. Blood
      samples were withdrawn over 24 hours and the AUC ratios between metabolite and parent were
      calculated to determine the phenotype.

      Probands began metamizole treatment (3000 mg/day) at the day of the 24h measurement. After
      3-4 day, probands were returning to the facility to ensure safety during the metamizole
      treatment, blood cell count and metamizole metabolites were measured. After the 7 days of
      treatment, probands were exposed again to the Basel Cocktail in a fastened state. Probands
      were still exposed to metamizole to ensure potential inhibition. 24 hours plasma samples were
      withdrawn, area under the curve (AUC) ratios were calculated and compared to the basal state.
      After an end of study visit on the day of the 24h blood sample (following the second study
      day), probands were discharged.
