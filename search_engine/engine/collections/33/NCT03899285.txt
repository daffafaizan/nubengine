      controlled double-blind feasibility study with a 2 week run-in period and 3 parallel groups
      randomized controlled study using citalopram. Citalopram has physicochemical properties
      compatible with over-encapsulation and a has a simple titration that allows the study of
      early dose increase.. It is among the most prescribed antidepressant in the province of
      Quebec and at the Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont - University family medicine group (U-FMG).

      Since establishment of a randomized controlled trial is complex and expensive, a feasibility
      design is appropriate to identify all the obstacles and to minimize sources of possible bias
      (recruitment, follow up, resources).
