    
      In order to reach this objective, a non-interventional prospective data collection aiming at
      reaching a consensus on a core set of PROMs which reliably predict and/or measure success in
      acute and chronic pain treatments in real life conditions and identifying predictors for
      chronification of postoperative pain will be conducted (PROMPT NIT-1). Aim of the data
      collection is to evaluate the abilities of certain PROMs in assessing acute post-surgical
      pain outcomes in daily routine care of patients after four different surgical procedures:
      (total knee replacement, breast surgery, sternotomy and surgery related to endometriosis),
      and to validate selected risk factors for chronification prospectively.
