    
      Undertake a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to intensive care
      units between 2006 and 2023.

      Study Participants: Adult patients admitted to a general adult intensive care unit at one or
      more of the study sites between 2006 and 1st of August 2023.

      Objectives:

      To determine the short and long-term cardiovascular consequences of critical illness and
      identify in-ICU factors that affect them.

      To identify the risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter occurring during
      critical illness.

      To study the association between poor cardiovascular function during critical illness and
      long-term cardiovascular disease.

      This study will provide new knowledge about the associations between baseline cardiovascular
      risk, the disease resulting in ICU admission and therapies / events on ICU with subsequent
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE), to allow the ongoing risk of these events to be
      determined. If clinicans can idetnify who is at risk, then risk factors can potentially be
      modified .
