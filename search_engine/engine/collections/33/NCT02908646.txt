      preoperative CT-guided techniques to guide VATS resection for the diagnosis of small
      peripheral pulmonary nodules technique to guide VATS(video assisted thoracoscopic surgery)
      resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules. Compared with the commonly
      used hook wire, the platinum microcoil can be retained in the patients'body and the
      configuration of which had an effect in reducing the severity of complications. The fibered
      microcoil may promote blood coagulation of the surrounding lung tissues, block the needle
      pathway, and decrease the severity of pneumothorax and bleeding caused by the puncture
      needle, which has been proven in animal experiments. The objective of this study is to
      determine if microcoil localization for pulmonary nodules can be safer than hookwire
      localization
