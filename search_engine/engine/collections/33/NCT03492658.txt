      arthritis (RA) display an activated, proliferative phenotype. Experimental data indicate that
      ACPA and ACPA-expressing B cells are actively involved in driving the disease process in RA.
      The present study is based on the hypothesis that targeted intervention with CTLA4-Ig
      (abatacept) as a means to interfere with T cell help for B cells in early, active,
      ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis can reverse the activated, proliferative phenotype of
      citrullinated antigen-specific B cells.
