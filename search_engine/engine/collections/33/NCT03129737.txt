    
      The present study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, multinational, randomized, 2-arm
      parallel group trial. Participating centres are selected based on previous experience with
      the surgical technique and standardised echo imaging. Each center is expected to contribute
      20 to 40 patients over a 12-month enrolment period.

      Patients elected to undergo mitral valve surgery (either repair or replacement) with less
      equal than moderate (â‰¤+2) tricuspid regurgitation and dilated tricuspid annulus (>21mm/m2) at
      preoperative echocardiography will be screened. Consenting patients fulfilling all inclusion
      and exclusion criteria will be included in the study and assigned to elective mitral valve
      replacement or repair with or without concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty in a 1:1 fashion,
      using a blocked randomization scheme balanced within center.

      After discharge patients will be assessed at 1 month (phone contact), 6 month and 1-year
      after surgery.
