      characterize patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs), organoids and in vitro models
      derived from medulloblastomas, High Grade Neuroepithelial Tumors (HGNET), CNS embryonal
      tumors, Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRTs), Choroid Plexus Carcinomas (CPCs),
      ependymomas, and gliomas. The investigators will characterize the genome-wide mutation,
      expression and epigenetic signatures of these models and compare them with the primary tumors
      from which they were derived, thus creating a well-characterized and invaluable resource for
      research on these rare and deadly pediatric brain tumors. This will also provide important
      insights into intratumoral heterogeneity, and molecular abnormalities that may influence the
      selective pressures driving evolution, and tumor growth as in PDOXs, organoids or in vitro
      cultures and define the relationship between these abnormalities and tumor histologic and
      clinical characteristics. This objective will be achieved by applying state-of-the-art DNA,
      RNA and epigenome analysis tools to the study of fresh frozen and/or cryopreserved, fixed and
      cultured tumor cells, PDOXs and organoids. The establishment of patient-derived orthotopic
      xenografts, organoids and cell cultures from each tumor sample will also allow for in vitro
      and in vivo analysis of tumor cell growth, signaling and therapeutic response.
