    
      This is a single-center, non-randomized, prospective interventional pilot study. Feasibility
      of intraoperatively visualizing tumour (margins) in penile and tongue tumours using EMI-137
      will be investigated. Patients, ≥ 18 years of age, with ≥T1 penile or tongue cancer
      undergoing primary tumour surgery will be included. All patients will receive an intravenous
      bolus injection of EMI-137 prior to surgery. Main study parameters/endpoints are:
      Intraoperative visualization of primary penile or tongue tumours using a dedicated clinical
      fluorescence camera. The in vivo detected fluorescence signal will be correlated to ex vivo
      measurements and pathological assessment of the ex-cised tissue.
