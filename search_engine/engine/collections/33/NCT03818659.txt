    
      BP-MAP is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare the effectiveness
      of BP lowering from a clinic-based quality improvement program with Full Support (dedicated
      practice facilitation) vs. a Self-Guided version of the program. The American Medical
      Association (AMA) developed the framework for the interventions. The trial will be conducted
      within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) that enables
      distributed querying of electronic health record data in a common data model. The primary
      outcome will be change in clinic-level blood pressure (BP) control at 6 months. Secondary
      outcomes will include other blood pressure (BP) control metrics, other time points (12 and 18
      months), and process measures such as BP measurement accuracy, medication intensification,
      and average systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction after a medication intensification, and
      repeat visit within 4 weeks after a visit with elevated BP. The investigators hypothesize
      clinics randomized to the Full Support version will achieve a larger increase from baseline
      in the proportion of their hypertensive patients with controlled BP at 6 months as compared
      to clinics randomized to the Self-Guided version, and also as compared with usual care. The
      investigators will also conduct non-randomized comparisons of BP control in the Full Support
      and Self-Guided intervention arms to BP control in non-participating "Usual Care"
      institutions in PCORnet. This study was submitted to the IRB at UCSF, determined to be
      quality improvement and exempt from further review.
