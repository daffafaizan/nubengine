    
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties
      in verbal and non-verbal communication and social interactions. People with ASD often exhibit
      difficult behaviors, including aggressiveness, temper tantrums, irritability, hyperactivity,
      inattention, impulsivity, self-harm ..

      The increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (approximately 1%) has increased the
      need for evidence-based treatment to lessen the impact of symptoms.

      The ethiopathogenesis of ASD has so far been unclear. Current pathophysiological theories
      have demonstrated the presence of cerebral hypo-perfusion, neuro-inflammation, immune
      dysregulation and oxidative stress involved in the genesis of this disorder. Based on its
      anti-inflammatory effects and increased amount of dissolved oxygen, hyperbaric oxygen therapy
      has been tried as one of the therapeutic arsenals of adjuvant therapy for autism.

      This is a randomized controlled study including nearly 80 patients with ASD who underwent
      clinical and neuropsychological evaluation before and after HBOT treatment as well as the
      dosage of the various biochemical and immunological markers. These markers will be assessed
      before and after the HBOT. Perfusion MRI would also be performed before and after HBO.
