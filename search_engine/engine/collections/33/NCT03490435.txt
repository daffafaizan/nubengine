      parasitic diseases are mostly observed in the poor tropical and subtropical countries, there
      are also many diseases caused by parasites in Poland. In Poland, particular attention is paid
      to the following parasitic diseases closely related to the digestive system: giardiasis,
      taeniasis (including cysticercosis), ascariasis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis,
      trichinosis, echinococcosis.

      Symptoms of such invasions may include: allergic rhinitis of unknown origin, chronic fatigue
      or food intolerance. Moreover, many of them are asymptotic, therefore the study group will
      consist of both healthy people and individuals with undiagnosed diseases or/and chronic
      symptoms.
