      partner sleep quality as well as daytime function. Snoring treatment is limited by device
      compliance (mouth appliance, positive airway pressure) and insurance does not regularly pay
      for these devices. Surgical treatment for snoring has mixed results. As a result, there is an
      important need to develop new treatments for snoring.

      The study team is seeking a novel treatment for snoring involving local application of a
      nerve stimulant medication, neostigmine. In this study, neostigmine will be injected into 5
      sites of the soft palate during a standard procedure, drug-induced sleep endoscopy, to
      evaluate the effect on snoring. If successful, development of a topical (non-injectable)
      version of this drug will be considered, so that the patient can apply him/herself before
      bedtime.
