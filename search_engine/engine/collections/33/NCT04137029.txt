      obstructive pulmonary disease . Beta-agonists exert their bronchodilatory effects via Î²2
      adrenoceptors located on airway smooth muscle cells. Anticholinergics block mainly
      M3-cholinoreceptors located in the airways, thus inhibiting bronchoconstriction. Metacholine
      blocks M2-cholinoreceptors thus inducing bronchoconstriction. It is known, that muscarine and
      beta-receptors interact with each other, but the detailed mechanism is unknown. For
      evaluating the binding activity of beta-receptors after inhalation of these drugs the
      modified radioligand method was used.
