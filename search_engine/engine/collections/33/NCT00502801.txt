      The incidence of NP rises in patients who are on breathing machines. The death rate for NP
      can be as high as 30%. NP caused by bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been
      associated with an increased death rate compared to other pathogens. Prompt use of
      appropriate antibiotics is essential. Compounding the issue of nosocomial infections is the
      increasing rate to which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. This hospital based
      trial is studying doripenem in patients who have nosocomial pneumonia to see if it is
      effective against bacteria associated with this serious bacterial infection. The duration of
      treatment can be anywhere from 8 to 14 days. Safety evaluations, such as vital signs and
      laboratory tests will be performed upon enrollment, after 4 days on therapy, after 9 days on
      therapy for those on greater than 8 days, at the end of therapy, 7 to 14 days after the end
      of therapy, and 28 to 35 days after the end of therapy. Adverse events will be collected
      throughout the study. Clinical response to doripenem therapy will be assessed 7 to 14 days
      after the end of therapy and the long-term clinical response to doripenem therapy will be
      assessed 28 to 35 days after the end of therapy. Doripenem IV will be administered for a
      duration of treatment from 8 to 14 days.
