      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) of pemigatinib in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable colorectal cancer harboring activating FGFR alterations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable
      disease) with pemigatinib.

      II. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with pemigatinib.

      III. Assess changes in patient quality of life (QOL) as measured by the linear analogue
      self-assessment (LASA) questionnaire.

      IV. Assess the frequency and severity of adverse events.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess plasma pharmacodynamic biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.

      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years
      after registration.
