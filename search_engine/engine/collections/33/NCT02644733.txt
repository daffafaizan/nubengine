      pressure in the supine position followed by the semi-recumbent position at head of bed 30.
      All four measurements were taken over a period of 5 to 10 min or less to reduce the
      possibility of changes in intraabdominal pressure over time. Three sets of readings were
      taken at least 4 h apart over a 24-h period.
