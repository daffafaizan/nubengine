      study drug is assigned by chance), 4-way crossover (participants will receive different
      interventions sequentially during the trial) study. The study will assess the
      pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how
      it is removed from the body over time) and relative bioavailability (the extent to which a
      drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of 4 new formulations of fentanyl
      transdermal patch, TDS-Concept 1 50 µg/h, TDS-Concept 2 50 µg/h, TDS-Concept 3 50 µg/h and
      TDS-Concept 4 100 µg/h compared with DUROGESIC fentanyl 50 µg/h in healthy participants after
      a single application. All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 8 possible treatment
      sequences. During the 4 single-application treatment periods, each transdermal patch will be
      worn, on a different application site on the lateral side of the upper arm, continuously for
      72 hours. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout period (period when receiving
      no treatment) of at least 8 and no more than 14 days. The total study length is from 64 days
      to a maximum of 82 days.
