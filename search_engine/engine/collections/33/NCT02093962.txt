      distant from tumor vessels. Pemetrexed has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions of
      tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in solid
      tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy. The
      hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic
      microenvironment. There is evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia in NSCLC lesions based
      on a hypoxia PET study. Combining pemetrexed with TH-302 may enable the targeting of both the
      normoxic and hypoxic regions of NSCLC lesions.
