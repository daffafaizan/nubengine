      patients who have recently undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or other open heart
      surgeries. NOPAF can put patients at clinical risk for stroke and other arrhythmias. NOPAF
      commonly prolongs hospitalization leading to increased use of hospital resources, higher cost
      and decreased patient satisfaction. A number of risk factors have been associated with the
      development of NOPAF including age, prior history of atrial fibrillation, Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), chronic renal failure, diabetes and obesity. It is not entirely
      clear what causes NOPAF; the prevailing theory is that it is a multi-factorial process,
      possibly due in part to inflammation from the surgery. The usual treatments for NOPAF are
      associated with various side effects and risks. We propose to test the hypothesis that an
      amniotic membrane patch, with minimal known risk and side effects, placed on the heart's
      surface during surgery will reduce the incidence of NOPAF.

      This phase I/II prospective, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial is being
      undertaken to assess the safety of the amniotic membrane patch when used in the setting of
      CABG surgery and whether utilization of the amniotic membrane patch to aid repair of the
      normal epicardium following isolated, first-time CABG procedures might result in a lower rate
      of NOPAF compared to subjects who did not undergo treatment with the amniotic membrane patch.
