      patients. Part of this relationship is explained by a poor profile of behavioral risk factors
      (i.e., smoking,physical activity, medication adherence, diet). An integrated treatment
      targeting both depressed mood and multiple behavioral risk factors could be highly effective
      in reducing post-ACS mortality. Behavioral Activation for depression may be an ideal
      counseling treatment for this since it has recently shown promise for facilitating behavioral
      risk factor changes in ACS patients with depression (K23HL107391). The current study adapts
      this manual targeting post-ACS depressed mood and smoking cessation to target depression and
      multiple behavioral risk factors post-ACS. This study will be an open trial (N=20) to test
      the feasibility and acceptability of our procedures and obtain initial indications of
      efficacy. This study hypothesizes that 1) the BA-HD manual and study procedures will be
      feasible and acceptable to post-ACS patients with depressed mood as measured by self-report,
      recruitment/retention rate, and post- treatment qualitative interviews and 2) that
      participants will experience clinically significant improvements in depressed mood and
      behavioral risk factor profile. The long-term goal of this research is to improve long-term
      survival rates following ACS.
