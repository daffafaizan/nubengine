      20 million people in the US being affected with mild dry eye, and the literature reports that
      as many as 3.2 million American women suffer from clinically significant dry eye.(Schaumberg
      et al, 2003). Dry eye can be related to external factors, such as the low humidity of air
      conditioned offices, winter heating, a dusty or windy outdoor environment, prolonged use of
      computers, or wearing of contact lenses, as well as to internal factors, such as hormonal
      imbalance, autoimmune disease, the presence of many widely prescribed systemic medications,
      anatomical changes or trauma, and aging. Chronic dry eye disease is associated with an
      immune-based inflammation of the lacrimal glands and the ocular surface. Symptoms result in
      mildly decreased quality of life at a minimum, and with increasing severity, loss of function
      and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and the misery that accompanies significantly
      impaired vision and decreased quality of life. With the aging population in the United States
      and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing computer use, dry eye will
      become more prevalent.

      Doxycycline is a well established anti-infective drug, and has been used systemically by
      ophthalmologists to treat moderate to severe case of blepharitis for years. Recently it has
      been demonstrated that doxycycline in low, non-antimicrobial concentrations also has powerful
      anti-proteolytic and anti-inflammatory properties. Anecdotal reports on the use of 0.025%
      doxycyline eyedrops in human patients with dry eye and/or meibomian gland disease indicate a
      significant improvement in ocular surface staining and a significant decrease in patient
      symptoms.
