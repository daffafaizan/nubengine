      pharmacodynamics of extended-infusion cefepime in CRRT. Patients on CRRT who are being
      initiated on cefepime 2000 mg IV every eight hours with a four-hour infusion will be
      considered for enrollment. Pre- and post-membrane serum levels will be drawn at scheduled
      intervals for both the first dose and again during another dose at steady state. Concomitant
      effluent and urine levels will also be obtained. A pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed
      and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to determine the probability of target attainment
      for various pharmacodynamic endpoints. Documented organism MICs will be used to determine the
      cumulative fraction of response.
