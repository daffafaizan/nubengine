      and metabolic risk. More effective treatments are needed to induce changes in cardiac fat
      content, body composition, and cardiac fat metabolic activity that result in a reduction in
      cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese population. Despite this need, little is known
      about which mode, frequency, and duration of exercise will allow for greater reductions in
      cardiac fat, improvements in body composition, restoration of a healthy cardiac fat metabolic
      activity, and improvement on cardiovascular risk markers. The aim of this study the effects
      of exercise in cardiac fat content, cardiac function, physical fitness, and metabolic
      activity in obesity.
