    
      Infants with prior clinical treatment with caffeine in the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) will be enrolled and continuous physiologic data recording of oxygen hemoglobin
      saturation (HbO2 SAT) and heart rate will begin as early as 33 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).
      Randomization will occur when enrolled infants reach a corrected gestational age of at least
      34 weeks PMA AND clinical caffeine has been discontinued for at least 5 days. Infants will be
      randomized to receive caffeine or to continue with usual care. The group randomized to start
      caffeine will receive an oral loading dose of caffeine citrate of 20 mg/kg on Day #1,
      followed by a single daily oral maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg starting on Day #2 and continued
      daily thereafter until 40 weeks PMA. The continuous oximeter recordings will be stopped at
      the same time. The number of intermittent hypoxia events/hour per week will be compared
      between the caffeine group and the usual care (no-caffeine) group for each week of
      physiologic data recordings.
