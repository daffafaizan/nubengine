    
      -  Participants will be given a monthly intramuscular injection of leuprolide. Six to eight
           weeks after the first leuprolide injection, participants will be instructed to begin
           taking letrozole pills by mouth at home each day.

        -  During this research study, participants will also be offered injections of zoledronic
           acid to preserve bone mineral density. If desire, these injections will be given every 6
           months for a total of 4 injections during the course of the research study.

        -  The treatments in this research study may increase the risk of bone density loss, so
           vitamin D and calcium supplements will be recommended to participants.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed during the research study: Physical
           Exam (every visit); Blood tests; Urine test (beginning and end of treatment); Imaging
           (annual mammograms); Bone Density (DXA) Scan (beginning and end of treatment);
           Questionnaires (throughout the study).

        -  Participants will be on this study for about two years.
