      population worldwide. Periodontitis is multifactorial disease individually accelerated or
      decelerated by different factors. One of them, a bacterial biofilm, leads to dysbiosis and
      raise of Gram-negative bacteria.This results in the activations of immune response and
      clinical signs of periodontal tissue inflammation. Host modulation therapy seems to be an
      adequate concept for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The main assumption of this
      therapy is to reduce by-stander tissue destruction, to ensure rapid resolution of
      inflammation or even to promote regeneration of the periodontal tissues by modifying or
      down-regulating the destructive aspects of the host response and by up-regulating the
      protective or regenerative responses The goal of the present study was to assess the effect
      of high-dose omega-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA on the clinical outcome of non-surgical treatment of
      the patients with generalized periodontitis stage III and IV. It was presumed that dietary
      supplementation with high-dose EPA and DHA would have the potential to induce a measurable
      clinical outcome as a result of reduction of inflammation and minimizing tissue damage
      mediated by anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 PUFAs. To address this issue, a randomized
      clinical trial was designed in which EPA and DHA were supplemented in adjunction to the
      standard periodontal therapy, scaling and root planning (SRP). Clinical outcomes of active
      versus control therapies were measured in addition to the quantifications of saliva cytokines
      and chemokines.
