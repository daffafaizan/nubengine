      cause of pneumothorax is rupture of blebs at the apex of the lung. Traditionally, bullectomy
      with mechanical pleurodesis through thoracotomy is indicated in patients with recurrence or
      persisted air leakage. The possible causes of recurrent pneumothorax and prolonged air
      leakage are missed bleb surrounding the endoscopic suture line or suboptimal suturing or
      healing of the thoracoscopic suture. To prevent these complications, a novel method using
      coverage of the endoscopic suture line by a large absorbable vicryl mesh during thoracoscopic
      surgery was proved to be safe and feasible. Theoretically, the mesh can strengthen the suture
      line and induce local fibrosis surrounding the suture line, and reduce the rate of recurrent
      pneumothorax and prolonged air leakage. To prove this hypothesis, we will conduct a
      prospective randomized trial in National Taiwan University Hospital. We will enroll 10
      patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who will be assigned to PCL mesh pleurodesis
      after thoracoscopic bullectomy and pleural abrasion. The primary endpoint is to check the
      biocompatibility of PCL mesh. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the safety after
      thoracoscopic bullectomy and pleural abrasion.
