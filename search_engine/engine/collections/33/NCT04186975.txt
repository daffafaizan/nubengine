      recommended and feasible will be enrolled to this cohort study. Each patient will be
      monitored via conventional fetal heart rate monitoring in addition to the NI-FECG method and
      both methods will be directly compared. Each patient will be her own control. NI-FECG is a
      non-invasive method of fetal monitoring' thus no ethical issues are relevant. Nevertheless,
      each patient will sign informed consent before participating in the study.
