      through annotation tags using 3D system to recognize energy delivery is done at the area.
      However this annotation method was unable to identify how effectively the ablation is done.
      To remedy this disadvantage, automated annotation system (VisiTagâ„¢ module, Biosense Webster,
      Inc., Diamond Bar, CA) was recently developed to make an automatic annotation when all
      pre-defined criteria are satisfied. But study on the clinical effects of this system is
      insufficient.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of catheter ablation for atrial
      fibrillation between contact force-guided and impedance-guided annotation using automated
      annotation system.
