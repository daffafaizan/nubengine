      hospital complications and even death. Studies suggest that heart failure patients who have
      high glucose or diabetes do not live as long as patients with normal glucose. In this study,
      we will determine whether normalizing blood sugars using intravenous insulin short-term will
      improve outcomes in patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure. We enrolled patients
      with severe heart failure and randomly assigned them into 2 groups. We used intravenous
      (given through the vein) insulin to lower blood sugar levels in group 1, and insulin
      injections in group 2. We determined whether intravenous insulin improved hospital length of
      stay, rates of readmission, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular tests that predict
      mortality in patients with heart failure.
