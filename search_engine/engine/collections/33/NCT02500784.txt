      formoterol, on a) cerebrospinal fluid CSF tau levels, and A-beta amyloid protein 40/42
      levels, and b) cognitive function: NE-ergic neurons undergo significant degeneration in AD.
      This system plays a significant role in cognition. Recent studies have indicated that
      increasing NE levels in the brain would significantly improve microglia migration and
      clearance of A-beta amyloid protein 40/42 levels in mouse models of AD. The investigators
      plan to test whether long- term daily treatment with inhaled formoterol solution would
      improve the structure and function of hippocampal neurons in AD. Study Design: Randomization
      and initiation of experimental treatment: All participants will be given formoterol daily for
      52 weeks. The active regimen will be initiated as (20 micro gram, BID). The dose will be
      decreased if there is evidence of side effects, including cardiac or respiratory alteration
      changes, gastro-intestinal disturbances or neurological issues.
