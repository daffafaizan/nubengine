      fructosamine, and fasting plasma glucose. Mean HbA1c was 8.7+ 0.7%, mean fructosamine was
      421+29 mg/dl (normal range 174-286 mg/dl), and mean fasting blood glucose was 198+44 mg/dl.

      At day 0, subjects levels of markers of two benfotiamine-sensitive pathways were determined:
      intracellular advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) formation, as reflected by a marker of
      increased intracellular methylglyoxal adducts in endothelial cells, angiopoietin 2 and
      hexosamine pathway activity, measured by determination of N-acetylglucosamine-modified
      protein in circulating monocytes. PKC activity in circulating monocytes could not be measured
      because the amount of blood required exceeded that approved by the Committee on Clinical
      Investigations. Serum levels of 6-keto-PGF-1 , a stable product produced by the nonenzymatic
      hydration of the antiatherogenic mediator prostacyclin were also determined. Subjects then
      took benfotiamine 300 mg twice a day, (Advanced Orthomolecular Research, Calgary, AB,CANADA)
      and slow-release Î±-lipoic acid (600 mg twice a day) (MRI, San Francisco, CA) for 28 days.
      Blood was obtained at day 0, day 15, and day 28.

      Data were analyzed using 1-factor analysis of variance to compare the means of all the
      groups. The Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons procedure was used to determine which pairs of
      means were different.
