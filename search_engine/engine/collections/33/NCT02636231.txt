      modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT), but severe late toxicities become the most common reason of
      death in IMRT salvaged NPC patients.

      The aim of this phase II randomized controlled study is to address the efficacy of concurrent
      Endostar (Endostatins) with IMRT to reduce the occurrence of severe late toxicities compared
      with IMRT alone for locally recurrent NPC patients.
