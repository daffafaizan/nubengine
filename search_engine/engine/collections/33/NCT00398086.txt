      of paclitaxel designed to avoid the problems associated with solvents used in Taxol(Abraxane
      prescribing information 2005). Albumin has a number of properties that make it an attractive
      molecule to combine with paclitaxel. Albumin is a natural transporter of endogenous
      hydrophobic molecules such as water-insoluble vitamins and hormones (Vorum 1999)and albumin
      binding to the gp-60 receptor (albondin) initiates the caveolae-mediated endothelial
      transport of protein-bound and unbound plasma constituents (John et al 2003, Minshall et al
      2003, Tiruppathi et al 1997).

      This study consisted of a Phase 1 dose escalation phase, a Phase 2 treatment phase and a
      24-month follow-up phase.
