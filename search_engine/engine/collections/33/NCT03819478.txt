      (BMI 30-45 kg/m2 or 27-<30 kg/m2 with an obesity-related risk factor), older (65-85 years)
      men and women at risk for disability (SPPB â‰¤10) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss
      intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test the overall hypothesis that a
      higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight
      loss intervention improves bone phenotypes compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the
      current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), 0.8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet, and
      whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months following weight loss will
      result in better maintenance of bone. All participants will undergo a 6-month weight loss
      intervention involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise followed by 12 months of
      follow-up with randomization to one of three groups (n=75/group): 1) Lower protein / higher
      CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (RecProt); 2) Higher protein / lower CHO diet
      for the 6-month weight loss phase only (6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher protein / lower CHO diet
      for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases (18-mo HiProt). Vertebral and
      femoral volumetric bone mineral density and cortical thickness (Primary Aim) and bone marrow
      adipose tissue (Secondary Aim 1) will be assessed with computed tomography at baseline, 6-,
      and 18-months. Bone strength and fracture risk (Secondary Aim 2) will be assessed by finite
      element modeling at baseline, 6-, and 18-months.
