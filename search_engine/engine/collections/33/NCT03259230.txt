    
      This is a non-interventional observational study designed to determine the levels of
      inflammatory markers in patients diagnosed with M-HLH and to assess the relationship between
      the biomarkers and disease activity in these patients during the M-HLH course. Inflammatory
      markers will also be measured in a group of control patients diagnosed with hematological
      malignancy but without HLH. Inflammatory markers include IFNγ and IFNγ-induced chemokines
      CXCL9 and CXCL10.

      In addition to the blood samples for the biomarker analysis, relevant information gathered by
      the treating physician will be collected in a data collection form. Whenever possible,
      collection of serum samples for biomarker analysis and relevant information should occur at
      M-HLH diagnosis, at regular time intervals during the treatment course as well as at
      resolution or reactivation of the disease.

      Blood samples will also be sent to the study sponsor (NovImmune S.A.) for cytokine testing.
      Before participant's samples are sent to the sponsor for testing, participant's name and any
      personal identifying information will be coded to protect participant's privacy.
