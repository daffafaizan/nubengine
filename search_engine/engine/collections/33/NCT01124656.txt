    
      AD-4833-536 is a combination of AD-4833 (pioglitazone) and TAK-536 (azilsartan). Pioglitazone
      is an oral antidiabetic agent that acts by reducing insulin resistance and approved for
      treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Azilsartan is a angiotensin II
      receptor blocker that modulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood
      pressure. In a recent clinical trial conducted in subjects with moderately poor to poor
      control of their type 2 diabetes mellitus, azilsartan coadministered with pioglitazone showed
      a reduction in hemoglobin A1C and fasting plasma glucose levels.

      After a one week screening period, subjects will be stratified to receive a starting dose of
      pioglitazone-azilsartan (30 mg + 20 mg or 45 mg + 20 mg).

      The planned open-label treatment period was 52 weeks; however due to formulation issues, the
      study was prematurely discontinued and efficacy data were not analyzed.
