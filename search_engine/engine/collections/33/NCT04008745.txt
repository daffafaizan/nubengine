    
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 48 patients with diabetic neuropathy.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot care
      by international consensus with no foot exercises) or an intervention group that will perform
      exercises at home, three times a week, through the booklet for 8-weeks.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 3 different times to access the effect of the intervention:
      baseline and 8weeks, for all outcomes; and 16 weeks, for follow-up reasons for all outcomes.

      The following outcomes will be assessed in all times: (1) diabetic neuropathy symptoms by
      Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, (2) fuzzy score of the neuropathy severity, (3)
      tactile and vibration sensititivity (10-g monofilament and tuning fork), (4) foot-ankle
      kinematics and ankle kinetics during gait (infrared cameras and inverse dynamics,
      respectively), (5) foot isometric strength (by a pressure plate measurement), (6) functional
      balance reach test, (7) foot health and functionality by the Foot Health Status
      Questionnaire, (8) plantar pressure distribution during gait.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention will increase the perception of the
      tactile and vibratory sensitivity of the foot, reduce the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy,
      increase the strength of the foot muscles, increase the functional balance score, decrease
      the severity of the diabetic neuropathy (fuzzy score), decrease the number of neuropathy
      symptoms, promote a more physiological foot rollover with a redistribution of plantar
      pressure during gait, as well as increase foot-ankle mobility after 08-weeks of intervention.
      There will be also beneficial biomechanical changes during gait, such as: (1) increase in the
      ankle extensor moment and ankle concentric power in the propulsion phase and (3) increase in
      the ankle flexor moment and ankle eccentric power in the load phase.
