      death of one in 10 adults (about 5 million deaths per year) and it is the fourth disease risk
      factor in the world. Many methods to quit smoking are available but in all cases, relapse is
      a common phenomena. The main risk factor for relapse is craving. So, acting on the craving
      seems essential to modulate tobacco consumption. Many functional neuroimaging studies have
      established a neuroanatomical substrate for craving process, in particularly dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), accessible par neuromodulation.
