      they agree to participate they will sign an informed consent and will be scheduled to come to
      the University of Florida Clinical Research Center for the testing.

      The test will consist of the following: pulmonary function test, collecting a sputum culture
      if possible, coughing for 5 minutes into a tube connected to a canister, hypertonic saline
      and albuterol will be given after the 5 minutes of coughing and then they would repeat with
      another 5 minutes of coughing. There can be a break inbetween the coughing if needed.

      Patients maybe asked to come back a second time if they develop a different type of NTM or
      start treatment for NTM.
