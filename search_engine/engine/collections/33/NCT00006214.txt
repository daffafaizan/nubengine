      in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Determine the effect of
      this regimen on a series of endpoint biomarkers in these patients. III. Assess the quality of
      life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to age (under 65 versus 65 and over), PSA (0-2.5 versus 2.6-4.0
      versus 4.1-10 versus greater than 10 ng/mL), PIN (on one biopsy versus on two biopsies), and
      family history (prostate cancer in brother, father, or uncle versus no prostate cancer in
      these relatives). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
