      study. The study is planned to be conducted in US, Europe, and Asia. The study is expected to
      be conducted at approximately 15-20 centers in up to 100 subjects to obtain at least 70
      usable Holter datasets to meet the objectives of the study. The expected total study duration
      (from first subject enrollment to the exit of the last subject) is approximately 6-months;
      this represents the time necessary to enroll the target sample size of at least 70 subjects
      with usable Holter datasets. Software will be downloaded into patients implanted with a Micra
      device to allow the new algorithm performance to be measured in patients where a Micra device
      has already been chosen as most appropriate for the patient.

      Most enrolled subjects will complete the study procedures during a single study visit.
      However, subjects enrolling in the study at the time of their Micra implant (anticipated to
      be approximately 10 subjects) will have the investigational algorithm downloaded following
      Micra implant, prior to hospital discharge, and approximately 1-month post-implant. This
      subset of subjects with de novo Micra implants will allow the MARVEL 2 features to be tested
      at multiple points in the device life cycle.

      Since the download algorithm running in a Micra device significantly increases current drain,
      a 2-4 hour acute study is used to limit the reduction in device longevity.
