      failure and cardiomyopathy affect prognosis. Little is known about morbidity and mortality of
      patients with muscular dystrophies admitted in intensive care unit (ICU).The investigators
      aim to describe the spectrum of patients with muscular dystrophies admitted in ICU , to
      establish predictive factors for ICU mortality and morbidity and to describe the long term
      follow up after ICU discharge.
