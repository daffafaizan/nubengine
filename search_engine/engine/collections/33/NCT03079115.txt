      two groups. The High-dose Atorvastatin group will receive Atorvastatin 80 mg QD from 3 days
      before to 3 days after CAS, then 20 mg QD until 30 days after CAS, while the
      Conventional-dose Atorvastatin group will receive Atorvastatin 20 mg QD from 3 days before to
      30 days after CAS. All patients will receive cerebral diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI within 7
      days before CAS. Then, they will also receive repeated DW-MRI within 5 days after CAS.
      Efficacy for prevention of periprocedural ischemic brain damage of the two different
      Atorvastatin treatments will be compared, in terms of periprocedural incidence of transient
      ischemic attack (TIA)/ ischaemic stroke or new ischemic lesions on cerebral DW-MRI.
