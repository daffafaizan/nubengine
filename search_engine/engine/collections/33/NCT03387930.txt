      the cases have no identifiable cause. While most people with LBP recover shortly after onset,
      approximately 44% of them experience recurrent LBP within one year and 10% of them develop
      chronic LBP that lasts for three months or more.

      Mechanically, the lumbar spine is unstable and requires spinal muscle to maintain spinal
      stability and to prevent injuries. Lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle is thought to be the major
      spinal stabilizer responsible for spinal stability and spinal proprioception. Different
      cross-sectional studies have revealed that increased fat infiltration, atrophy or activation
      deficits of LM in patients with LBP as compared to asymptomatic individuals. Research has
      shown that abnormal morphology or activation of LM is associated with LBP intensity/location,
      or LBP-related disability. Unfortunately, inconsistent findings have also been reported.

      Although prior research attempted to determine if abnormal LM characteristics can inform
      clinical decision-making, their results are limited because they only investigated a single
      LM characteristic at a time, which might not reflect the actual LM condition. Further, many
      studies adopted cross-sectional design that could not reveal the casual relations between
      abnormal LM characteristics and LBP.

      Given the above, the current study aims to identify specific LM characteristics that can
      predict new episode of LBP in asymptomatic individuals, and recurrent/chronic LBP in
      individuals with LBP at baseline.
