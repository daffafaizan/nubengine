      implanted in patients requiring aortic valve replacement. The study will be conducted in a
      maximum of 25 centers in the United States. Patients will be evaluated at each of the
      following time intervals:preoperative, at implant, in the early postoperative period, in the
      late postoperative period (between 3 and 6 months postoperatively), at 1 year (between 11 and
      13 months postoperatively), and annually until study completion. The duration of the study is
      anticipated to be 5 years.
