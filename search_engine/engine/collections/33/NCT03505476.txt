      condition known as ileus. When ileus occurs, the bowels shut down and patients often develop
      abdominal dissension, nausea, vomiting, and even more serious complications. Because this
      condition does not develop until many days after surgery has been completed, clinicians do
      not know if they should begin allowing patients to eat or withhold nutrition until they show
      signs of bowel function such as passing gas or having bowel movements. Clinicians have
      different approaches but none are ideal: 1) feed all patients early and the ones that develop
      an ileus will have their diets reverse, suction tube placed in their stomach, and hopefully
      don't get develop more serious complications, or 2) don't feed patients until they pass gas
      or have a bowel movement, which delays nutrition and prolongs hospital stays for the 70% of
      patients who will not develop an ileus

      Participants in this study will be asked to wear a 3-ounce device that adheres to the skin of
      the abdominal wall for 10 days. They will also be asked to answer questions each day of their
      hospital stay regarding how they have tolerated eating.
