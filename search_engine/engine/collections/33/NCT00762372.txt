      without nitrous oxide) in maintenance of general anesthesia in adult patients undergoing
      surgical procedures typically performed under general anesthesia in Japan (thoracic,
      abdominal, joints, back, and neck), where analgesics and muscle relaxants are concomitantly
      used. The study is also intended to demonstrate the non-inferiority of desflurane with
      nitrous oxide to sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in time to awakening/recovery.
