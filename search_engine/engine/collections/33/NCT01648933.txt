      is challenging since it relies on an array of clinical, biological and imaging abnormalities.
      Myocardial perfusion imaging with sestamibi is currently a major feature of the diagnosis,
      since it allows to evidence both microcirculatory impairments and scar. However, some
      technical limitations are inherent to SPECT, mainly poor spatial resolution and lack of
      attenuation correction, resulting in the absence of flow quantification. Rubidium-82 (Rb) PET
      proved to be more sensitive and specific than sestamibi SPECT in the diagnosis of coronary
      artery disease. Furthermore, it allows noninvasive measurement of coronary flow reserve.
      Finally, it exposes patients to lower radiation dose than SPECT. Therefore, Rb PET may help
      to better identify cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis, and hence to better select those
      patients who require high-dose steroids.
