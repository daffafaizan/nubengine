      comparative bioavailability of ZN-d5 under fasting and fed conditions, following single-dose
      oral administration of ZN-d5. The study will be comprised of a pre-study screening, followed
      by administration of a single dose of ZN-d5 under fasted conditions, a washout period,
      administration of a single dose of ZN-d5 under fed conditions, and a follow-up period.
