      after unilateral exercise training, is studied in various orthopedical and neurological
      conditions affecting the body unilaterally. For those with asymmetrical weakness and
      immobility after stroke, training the non-paretic side can be utilized to increase the
      strength of the paretic side and improve functional symmetry. In this study, investigators
      aim was to examine whether training non-paretic upper extremity wrist flexor muscles by EMS
      in adjunct to conventional training program, has additional benefits upon the muscle powers
      of the homologous agonist and antagonist muscles. Investigators will use low frequency
      antalgic TENS stimulation at barely sensible level, which is considered not to cause muscle
      strengthening, as a control intervention.
