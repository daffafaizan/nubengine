      III trial. Approximately 202 subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive treatment with HDM
      SLIT-tablet or placebo. The trial will be conducted in China, with subjects recruited and
      treated in China. Two EEC assessments (baseline and end of treatment) will take place at a
      validated EEC facility in Austria.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of the HDM SLIT-tablet (12 SQ-HDM) once
      daily compared to placebo in the treatment of HDM AR nasal symptom determined during the EEC
      session at week 24.
