      transient, the condition is often chronic, causing self-consciousness and social
      stigmatization over the short term and physical scars and damaged self-esteem over the long
      term. Patients and clinicians have frequently attributed acnegenesis to diet; studies of
      varying quality have been published on the topic since the 1830s. Recently, well-designed,
      controlled, prospective studies suggest an acnegenic effect of specific dietary factors,
      including high-glycemic-index foods and dairy products. Limited evidence also suggests an
      acnegenic effect of foods containing saturated fats. More well-designed, randomized,
      controlled trials are needed to further establish dietary effects on acne. Based on
      epidemiologic observations and results of prior clinical trials, we are conducting a pilot
      study to determine if a low-fat, low-glycemic-index vegan diet affects the number of acne
      lesions and acne severity.
