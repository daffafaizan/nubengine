      position, peak inspiratory pressure between two lungs is similar or equal when each lumen is
      sequentially clamped while ventilating each lung with the same tidal volume. We are going to
      investigate a performance of this method by fiberoptic bronchoscopy view and depth of double
      lumen tube, and compare with an conventional auscultation method.
