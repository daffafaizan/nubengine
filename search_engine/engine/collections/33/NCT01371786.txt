    
      This study is an open label, single dose, single site, randomized, cross over study that will
      assess nasal deposition of radioactivity following nasal inhalation of a ciclesonide
      radiolabeled solution via a novel nasal MDI and of a mometasone furoate monohydrate
      radiolabeled suspension via an aqueous nasal spray in approximately 10 14 patients with
      symptomatic allergic rhinitis, aged 18 65 years. In order to ensure that patients will be
      symptomatic at the time of dosing, participants will be asked to withhold their usual
      treatments for perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, beginning at the Screening Visit
      until after Study Visit 3.

      Each patient will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences. The two treatments
      in this study are a single dose (one 37 mcg actuation per nostril) of radiolabeled solution
      of ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 µg (Regimen A) and a single dose (two 50 mcg actuations per
      nostril) of a radiolabeled suspension of mometasone aqueous nasal spray 200 µg (Regimen B).
