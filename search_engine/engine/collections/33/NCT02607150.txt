      change in the anesthetic or perioperative care of these patients. Per our usual clinical
      routine, cell saver will be used intraoperatively to limit the need for allogeneic blood.
      Tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be monitored using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
      The device is applied non-invasively like pulse oximetry to a muscle bed (usually the
      deltoid) and the forehead to measure tissue oxygenation. These devices are used routinely in
      the operating room and the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Although not used on every
      major orthopedic procedure, these devices are routinely used in various high risk clinical
      scenarios. As clinically indicated, cell saver blood (autologous) or allogeneic blood will be
      administered. During this time, tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be recorded every 5
      minutes starting 10 minutes before the transfusion and continued for 30 minutes following the
      transfusion.
