      therapeutic role in the management of adult hip pain. This procedure is frequently associated
      with severe post-operative pain despite the practice of injecting the hip joint with local
      anesthetics at the end of the procedure and the use of intraoperative opioids. The ideal
      analgesic technique that provides adequate pain relief following this procedure has not been
      established yet.

      There is evidence to suggest that a femoral nerve block (FNB) may provide clinically
      meaningful analgesia. The investigators have examined the benefits of FNB both
      retrospectively and prospectively in hip arthroscopy patients at Women's College Hospital
      (WCH). Both of our studies suggested modest benefits of the FNB in terms of controlling
      post-operative pain and reducing opioid consumption. However the majority of patients
      continued to experience moderate to severe post-operative pain and required significant
      amounts of opioid analgesics in the Peri-Anesthesia Unit (PAU), despite receiving the FNB.

      Another regional anesthesia technique, the femoral articular branch block (FAB) has recently
      been proposed to collectively block the terminal femoral and accessory obturator nerve
      branches to the hip joint with a single injection, theoretically blocking most of the
      innervation relevant to hip arthroscopy while sparing the main femoral nerve branches to the
      quadriceps muscle. The investigators aim to demonstrate the analgesic benefits of FAB.
