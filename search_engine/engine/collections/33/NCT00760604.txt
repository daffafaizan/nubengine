      time to progression comparing (Arm A) transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy and (Arm B)
      transhiatal or transthoracic non-en bloc esophagectomy. Randomization to the two surgical
      arms will take place after the patient has given written informed consent and eligibility has
      been established. Patients will be informed of their randomized arm prior to the day of
      surgery. Preoperative chemotherapy may be administered at the discretion of the treating
      physician. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy will be prescribed at the discretion of
      the treating physician. All patients will be followed for recurrence and survival for 5
      years.
