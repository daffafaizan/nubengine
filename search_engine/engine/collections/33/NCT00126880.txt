      treatment of HIV infection. Although effective initially, many people later on develop
      resistance to some or all of the drugs (including lamivudine) leading to virological failure.
      Resistance is associated with characteristic mutations, which for lamivudine is the M184V
      mutation. A change to new, active drugs must take place when patients fail their current
      regime, to regain control of the virus. Although there are other types of drugs available for
      second line treatment, there is currently no fully active, well tolerated cytidine analogue
      that can replace lamivudine in a second-line regimen when patients fail first line treatment.
      This study will measure the efficacy and safety of AVX754 (a novel cytidine analogue with
      activity against HIV resistant to other nucleosides) as part of a new regimen to treat
      patients who have failed treatment containing lamivudine, compared to the best alternative
      new regimen which continues to include lamivudine.
