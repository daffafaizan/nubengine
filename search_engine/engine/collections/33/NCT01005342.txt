      of how fiber-rich meals regulate molecular events at a gene level is limited. Also, few
      studies have compared the effects of different fiber sources on postprandial responses and
      hardly any study the effects of fiber mixtures in the same meal, even though this is more
      similar to regular eating habits.

      Healthy subjects will come to the study center after an overnight fast, to ingest breakfasts
      randomly enriched with different fiber. The meals contains either spray-dried oat drink, rye
      bran, sugar beet fiber a mixture of these three fibers, oat bran or no added fiber (control).
      All meals are adjusted to contain the same total amount of available carbohydrates and fat.
      Blood leukocytes for gene expression profiling were taken before and 2 h after consumption
      while blood samples for analysis of postprandial glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels
      were taken every 30 min during 3 h.

      NuGO Affymetrix Human Genechip NuGO_Hs1a520180 are used for the microarray analysis and
      analysis is performed with linear mixed models and enrichment analysis to identify functional
      gene sets that responded to the specific oat bran effect.
