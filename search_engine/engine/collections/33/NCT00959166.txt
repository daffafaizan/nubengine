      examination, may occur in patients with HIV and/or hepatitis C infection. It is not currently
      known whether the brain is affected in early (or acute) hepatitis C.

      Individuals wishing to take part will complete a series of tests assessing different aspects
      of their brain including:

        -  2 brain scans using different technology:

             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan with spectroscopy

             -  CT PET brain scan

        -  A computer game test which measures brain function

        -  2 short questionnaires

      Results of these tests will be analyzed and compared between 3 groups.
