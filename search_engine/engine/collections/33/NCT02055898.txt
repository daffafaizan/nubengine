      and other symptoms, is associated with neither a currently identifiable disease process nor
      major psychiatric illness, and has an estimated prevalence in primary care of 1-2%. Sleep
      impairment is common in nearly everyone with CFS, with both daytime sleepiness and
      unrefreshing nighttime sleep reported, and consequent impact on daytime function. It may be
      that fundamental regulatory processes that control sleep are disturbed in CFS, leading to
      different effects on sleep and daytime symptoms depending on the subject's prior sleep,
      daytime routine, medication and other factors. The investigators contacts with patient groups
      have indicated that patients are generally confident that on days when their sleep is better
      they perform better in the day. There is growing evidence that deep, slow wave sleep (SWS) is
      altered in CFS, and this may suggest impairment of build up of sleep pressure during the day.
