    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of escalating multiple doses of ToleroMune HDM in subjects with a
      documented history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to house dust mite. The
      efficacy of ToleroMune HDM will also be explored in these subjects using the LPSR, EPSR, CPT
      and levels of HDM specific IgE. A single centre will be initiated first, with a second centre
      included as a backup, if needed, to enable recruitment numbers to be met.

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 8 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,
      at the Investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of a single visit 1 to 4
      weeks before randomisation.

      Period 2 (Treatment Period) will consist of 4 visits (Visits 3A-3D) four weeks apart (28Â±2
      days). Subjects who comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to one of 5
      dose groups. The first dose group will receive 4 administrations of ToleroMune HDM.
      Successive dose groups will increasing doses given as 4 administrations of ToleroMune HDM,
      provided the first administration of the previous dose was safe and well tolerated.

      In Period 3, Post-treatment Challenge will take place 18-22 weeks after the first
      administration in the Treatment Period. Assessments performed will be identical to those at
      the Baseline Challenge. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after PTC.
