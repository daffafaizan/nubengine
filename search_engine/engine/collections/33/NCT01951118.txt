      of adult patients at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center.
      Study 1 will include 70 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Study 2 will
      include 100 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recruitment will be from clinics
      and/or advertisements. In the protocol, all 170 patients will receive baseline memory and
      olfactory assessments and are treated with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total
      of 1 year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and
      will receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 0, 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an
      olfactory challenge test will be done at baseline.

      This project will be of value in the selection of patients with MCI and AD for treatment
      based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil. Since mild
      cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health
      problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.
