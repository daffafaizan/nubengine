      disease has not been defined. The present study aims to address this question by comparing
      the drug combination that is currently considered the gold-standard (R-CVP) with a newer
      combination (R-FC) that might be more effective without being significantly more toxic. In
      order to take into account the balance between efficacy and toxicity, a dual primary endpoint
      has been employed: progression-free survival and toxicity in the form of grade 3-4 infection.
