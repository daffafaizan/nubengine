      during the in-person examination 10/5 at the FHS Research Center in Framingham, Massachusetts
      (MA), USA or remotely from home after the in-person examination. All eFHS participants have
      the eFHS myDataHelps mobile app (developed by FHS investigators with CareEvolution our
      industry partner) installed on their smartphone. The eFHS app allows communication with
      participants through notifications and data collection. Participants are asked to answer
      health surveys administered through the app.

      Survey assessments will include 6 modules: cognition, pain, mood, physical function and
      performance, physical activity, and events. The interventions are defined by the patterns of
      administration of survey modules to the experimental and control groups. The administration
      of the cognition, pain, mood, and psychosocial modules follow the same pattern for both
      groups. However, the administration of the physical function, physical activity, and events
      modules is delayed by 2 weeks in the experimental group as compared to the control group.
