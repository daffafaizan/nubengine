    
      -  to form study groups of patients (at least 60 patients in total) who have recovered from
           pneumonia of varying severity caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (at least 30 patients in
           each of the groups of patients who have had pneumonia in moderate and severe forms);

        -  to investigate the parameters of cellular immunity (the content of antigen-specific
           T-cells to the main viral antigens - proteins S, N, M) in patients of different groups
           included in the trials, in dynamics 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the COVID-19-associated
           pneumonia;

        -  to investigate the indicators of humoral immunity (the content of IgG to the main viral
           antigens - proteins S, N, M) in patients of different groups included in the trials, in
           dynamics 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
