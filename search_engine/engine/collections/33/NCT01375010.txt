      loss and indices of immune function in HIV+ postmenopausal women. Lower baseline serum
      Vitamin D levels, as assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) were associated
      with a trend toward more bone loss. In addition, the investigators found that despite
      providing supplements that contained approximately 600 IU vitamin D, serum 25-OHD did not
      increase during the first year. Provision of adequate calcium and vitamin D is the
      cornerstone of effective prevention and therapy of osteoporosis. HIV-infected patients may be
      at increased risk of having vitamin D deficiency because they take several medications that
      may interfere with vitamin D action. Therefore, the investigators will recruit 100 HIV
      infected postmenopausal women for this study who are on a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      regimen and randomize them to receive 1000 or 3000 IU of vitamin D daily. The subjects will
      be followed closely for one year to monitor compliance and changes in bone health and immune
      function.
