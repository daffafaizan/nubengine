      two motor cortices. It has been proposed that abnormal interactions could contribute to the
      motor deficit that results from chronic hemispheric lesions after stroke. The purpose of this
      protocol is to identify changes in interhemispheric inhibitory interactions associated with
      performance of a motor task in patients with chronic hemispheric stroke. The overall
      hypothesis is that the cortical representation of the paretic hand receives abnormally high
      task-related interhemispheric inhibitory influence originated in the intact motor cortex in
      stroke patients relative to healthy volunteers. It is important to test this hypothesis,
      because if proven correct, it could lead to the development of novel neurorehabilitative
      strategies.
