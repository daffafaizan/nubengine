      specifically patients for which no approved therapy or standard of care is available or have
      solid tumors and have failed standard of care therapy. JI-101 is an inhibitor of vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta
      (PDGFRÎ²), and EphB4 receptor, each of which plays an important role in driving
      vascularization (angiogenesis and vasculogenesis) during normal development and
      tumorigenesis. JI-101 inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, which in turn, may slow or
      prevent the growth of tumors. The purpose of this open label study is to treat patients with
      advanced solid tumors, with increasing doses of JI-101, thereby providing information about
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study will also examine safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and may evaluate the effects of the drug on tumor
      metabolism. During this dose-escalation study, at least two patients will be dosed at each
      dose level (cohort). The patients must complete 21 days of dosing and safety results will be
      reviewed prior to any patients being assigned the next higher dose level. A continuous
      reassessment method will be utilized to escalate JI-101 doses between cohorts. Doses will be
      increased, with an anticipated high dose of 800mg per day. If the MTD is not reached, an
      optimal biologic dose (OBD) will be determined based on the highest doses that are tolerable
      with acceptable efficacy. The cohort at MTD or OBD will be expanded to include up to 30
      patients with solid tumors to further explore the safety and tolerability of
      orally-administered JI-101.
