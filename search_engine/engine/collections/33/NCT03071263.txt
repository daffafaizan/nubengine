    
      Approximately 290 eligible participants with [chronic kidney disease (CKD) on stable doses of
      medication] will be randomly assigned to receive a patiromer or placebo starting dose of two
      packets a day, once a day.

      All eligible participants will undergo a screening/run-in period (up to 4 weeks) to determine
      eligibility for study entry. Eligible participants will be randomized and treated for 12
      weeks (Treatment Period) and followed for 2 weeks after completing the patiromer or placebo
      treatment. There are 8 planned clinic visits during the Treatment Period and one planned
      visit two weeks after the last dose of patiromer or placebo (Follow-up Period).

      The dose of patiromer or placebo may be increased or decreased (titrated) based on
      participants' individual potassium response.
