      with bipolar disorder. At baseline and at multiple time points following the initiation of
      lithium treatment over 4 or more weeks, measures of signal transduction pathways, gene
      expression and brain neurochemistry and structure were obtained. It is hypothesized that
      modulation of these measures will be predictive of lithium treatment responsiveness.
