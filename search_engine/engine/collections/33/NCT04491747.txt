      capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, peak cough flow was assessed and
      recorded.

      Pulmonary function test was assessed with spirometry, functional capacity was evaluated with
      3-minute step test and six minute walk test (MWT). Respiratory muscle strength was evaluated
      mouth pressure measurement (MIP- maximal inspiratory pressure and MEP- maximal expiratory
      pressure) and Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP). Respiratory muscle endurance was
      assessed Powerbreathe. And cough effectiveness was evaluated peak cough flow.
