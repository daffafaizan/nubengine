             1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of donor-derived HSCT following
                donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells in
                patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia.

             2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CAR-T
                cells, and the phenotype of persisting T cells. Real Time polymerase chain receptor
                (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM will be used to detect and
                quantify survival of infused allo-CAR-T cells over time.

             3. To evaluate the donor chimerism after co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22
                bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to
                co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T
                cells and donor-derived-HSCT.

      The allo-CAR-T cells will be infused in a fractionated manner, 1/3 on day 0, 2/3 on day 1.The
      allo-HSCT will be infused on day 2.
