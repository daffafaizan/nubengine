    
      This will be a prospective, randomized-controlled, longitudinal study in which qualified
      patients with partial edentulism and thin maxillary ridges will have as part of their
      treatment at least one sinus ridge augmentation procedure and have their edentulism restored
      with an implant-supported short-span or long-span fixed bridge. Each patient may have up to
      two cases included in the study should they need bilateral sinus augmentation using
      unilateral bridge restorations on either side.

      Each patient (or side if a bilateral case) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      Treatment Group 1 (test) cases will have implants placed into the sinus cavity during the
      graft augmentation procedure. Treatment Group 2 (control) will have a sinus lift augmentation
      and implant placement into this area will take place after four months of graft healing. For
      both groups the implants will be submerged and allowed four months of healing before second
      stage surgery.
