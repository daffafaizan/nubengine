      anticancer medication such as vinca alkaloids (including vincristine), taxanes (including
      paclitaxel), and platinum preparations (including cisplatin and oxaliplatin) . CIPN is one of
      several long term side effects of anticancer medications that can appear during and after
      treatment. CIPN symptoms include pain, dysesthesia, motor and sensory disorders. CIPN can
      also be insufficiently responsive to pharmaceutical therapy similar to other types of
      refractory neuropathic pain This study is designed to evaluate the effect of two concentric
      electrode transcranial direct current stimulation (CE-tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M)
      in management of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.
