      prevalence worldwide. There is a need of effective tools to treat those patients since the
      natural course with conservative treatment is very pessimistic. I. e. most of the subjects
      having a BMI >40kg/m2 in the adolescence will remain morbidly obese also in their adult life.

      The three largest centres in Sweden treating obese children (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂)
      will offer patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria to be operated with laparoscopic
      gastric bypass. If not willing to be operated they could join the study as a control case.

      Subjects will be investigated at the baseline concerning physical health status and existence
      of medical risk factors but also regarding their quality of life, eating habits and physical
      activity. They will subsequently be follow over a ten year period regarding these variables.
