      general health benefits. Research has demonstrated that many people with arthritis can safely
      exercise to improve fitness and health. The People with Arthritis Can Exercise (PACE)
      program, developed by the Arthritis Foundation, is a land-based recreational physical
      activity and exercise program. PACE has been offered as a community-based program for over 10
      years and small studies have reported benefits for people with arthritis. However, there has
      been no randomized controlled community trials that evaluate the effectiveness of PACE in the
      community. The goals of the Evaluation of PACE project are to: (1) appropriately evaluate the
      AF PACE exercise program, and (2) provide information to support effective content,
      recruitment and programming. Specific objectives for meeting these goals include:

        1. Identify the theoretical foundations and constructs for evaluating the program and
           select and use appropriate outcome measures;

        2. Plan and conduct a randomized controlled trial of 8 and 16 week PACE programs;

        3. Perform a qualitative evaluation using focus groups of PACE instructors and
           participants;

        4. Disseminate findings and make recommendations.
