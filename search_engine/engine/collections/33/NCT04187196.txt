      shorter time to effective sedation and time to full recovery when compared to the use of
      propofol. This will change how sedation is approached for elective cardioversions.

      Primary Hypothesis:

        1. The mean time to recovery from sedation during a cardioversion using methohexital for
           sedation will be significantly shorter than the recovery time using propofol for
           sedation, as evidenced by a short time from initiation of induction to a score of 2 on
           the Ramsay Sedation Scale.

        2. The mean time to a Ramsay score of 5-6 will be significantly shorter using methohexital
           than the time to the same sedation level using propofol

      Secondary Hypothesis:

      1. There will be no significant increase in adverse events associated with the use of
      methohexital when compared with propofol.
