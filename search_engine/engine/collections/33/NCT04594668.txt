      with intermediate conductance (KCa3.1), the knockout protected against lung damage and
      accumulation of liquid in the lung. In subsequent studies, the investigators have developed a
      mouse model showing that genetic deletion of the KCa3.1 channels and senicapoc, a blocker of
      KCa3.1 channels, protects against the accumulation of liquid in the lung. Moreover, senicapoc
      treatment possesses anti-inflammatory effects illustrated as lower leukocyte accumulation
      inside the lungs after injury. Importantly, it also increases the FiO2/PaO2 ratio (ratio of
      inhaled to blood oxygen), hence preserving lung function in mice with an ARDS-like disease.
      In addition, there is evidence that senicapoc has antiviral properties. Aarhus University has
      patented senicapoc for use in the treatment of acute respiratory disease. In this case,
      respiratory disease is caused by an infection with a coronavirus. Senicapoc has been
      developed for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has been administered to 500 patients
      without observation of major treatment-related adverse effects.
