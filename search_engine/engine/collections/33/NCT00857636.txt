      minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Recent immigrants
      including Korean Americans (KA), face an unequal cancer burden related to the significant
      language and cultural barriers they face in attempting to navigate the U.S. healthcare
      system. KA women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are
      experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Not only are their breast and
      cervical cancers diagnosed at significantly later stages than those of whites, but they are
      also the least likely racial/ethnic group to receive early breast and cervical cancer
      screening.

      This community-based behavioral intervention is designed 1) to evaluate, in a randomized
      controlled trial, the effects of our health literacy-focused cancer control intervention,
      delivered by trained CHWs, on the primary outcomes: mammography and Papanicolaou(Pap)test
      screening adherence, in a sample of 360 KA women, 2)to test the effects of the proposed
      intervention on the secondary outcomes: level of health literacy, breast and cervical
      knowledge, and decisional balance, in the KA sample.
