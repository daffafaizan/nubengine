      CT, MRI, PET scan, of serological markers and molecular markers assessed before liver
      transplantation at listing.

      The investigators also evaluated the predictive value of tumor growing during the waiting
      time (imaging and serological).

      Finally, the investigators compared pre-LT data and explanted liver analysis to evaluate
      accuracy of liver biopsy and of imaging.
