      protrude into the lining of the bowel. Because a polyp cannot always be removed by a snare,
      the usual and simplest method, (for example, it may be too flat), a doctor (colorectal
      surgeon) may perform a polypectomy using a technique called Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
      (EMR). Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)is based on the concept that endoscopy (looking at
      the inside of your colon with an instrument called a colonoscope) provides visualization and
      access to the innermost lining of the gastrointestinal tract, where a polyp originates. The
      Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)performed during this study will be standard of care
      according to the current practice at University Hospitals of Cleveland.

      Following polyp removal, the study procedure will be performed. A medical device is being
      evaluated to help with this procedure by closing the wound that remains after the polyp is
      removed without performing an open surgical operation. This involves suturing (sewing) the
      tissue back together with a Tissue Apposition System (TAS). This is also called tissue
      approximation. The sewing device being evaluated has been cleared by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      Up to 20 men and women, at least 21 years of age, requiring removal of a colonic or rectal
      polyp that cannot be removed by traditional colonic polypectomy, will be asked to enroll in
      the study. Following polyp removal, these patients will have the remaining tissue area closed
      using the study sewing device. Participation in this study will last approximately three
      months.
