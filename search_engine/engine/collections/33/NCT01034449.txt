    
      This is a multicenter prospective non randomized phase 2 clinical trial.

      The primary objective is defined by getting a neutrophil count above 500/ml for 3 consecutive
      days at day 42 after transplantation, in association with complete or partial chimerism on T
      cells (10 % to 90%).

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  the feasibility of expansion,

        -  tolerance immediate injection of a graft amplified,

        -  the payback of a platelet count> 20 000/microlitre without transfusion,

        -  Incidence of graft loss or rejection within 6 months following transplantation,

        -  the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD,

        -  the mortality rate associated with transplantation,

        -  the incidence of relapse of hematologic malignancies,

        -  Overall survival,

        -  Disease-free survival at 1 year post transplant.
