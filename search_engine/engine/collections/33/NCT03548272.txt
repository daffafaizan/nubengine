    
      Single stent implantation in the main vessel-main branch across a side branch is the default
      strategy (provisional T-stenting, PTS) in all patients enrolled. Bifurcation lesions are
      assessed according to Medina classification using an index of 1 for stenosis greater than 50%
      and 0 for no stenosis (visual estimation). There is no restriction regarding lesion length in
      patient selection. If required, additional stent can be implanted (Alex Plus in the BiOSS Lim
      C Group). A stent in a side branch (Alex Plus in the BiOSS Lim C Group) should be implanted
      only if there is proximal residual stenosis greater than 70% after balloon dilatation and/or
      significant flow impairment after main vessel - main branch stenting and/or a flow limiting
      dissection.

      The implantation protocol for bifurcation is as follows:

        1. wiring of both branches;

        2. main vessel predilatation and/or side branch predilatation according to the operator's
           decision;

        3. stent implantation (inflation for at least 20 s);

        4. proximal optimization technique (POT)

        5. side branch postdilatation/side branch stent implantation if necessary

        6. final kissing balloon inflation at operator's discretion.

        7. Second proximal optimization technique (re-POT)
