      with psychiatric comorbidity. Antipsychotic medications are usually the first choices, but
      may associate with adverse effects. Behavioral intervention for TS has been shown to be an
      effective treatment for children and adolescents, yet have not been performed and evaluated
      using control trails in Taiwan. This study therefore was to evaluate the efficacy of a
      comprehensive behavioral intervention therapy on improving tics and tic-related impairment
      for children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome.
