    
      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, Phase II trial. Selected patients with advanced-stage
      epithelial ovarian cancers who have no reasonable chance of cure using standard regimens, or
      who will not receive such regimens (due to contraindication or intolerance) are eligible.
      Patients will be treated with Ontak at 12 Âµg/kg monthly as long as they meet response
      criteria.
