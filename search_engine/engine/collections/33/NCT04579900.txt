      via endocrine actors and the gut-brain-peripheral axis. It is unclear how T2D alters microbes
      in upper and lower intestine of humans. Studies in animals show that T2D promotes
      translocation of microbes to the blood and tissues to promote metabolic dysfunction. It is
      crucial to determine whether bacteria or their components subvert the gut barrier in human
      T2D, and then to identity the relevant bacterial strains in tissues that control blood
      glucose. The overall objective of our research program is to demonstrate that specific
      microbes in the gut, circulation, and key metabolic tissues are involved in the progression
      of T2D. We will define the microbial signatures of T2D in duodenal biopsies and stool samples
      by comparing T2D and non-T2D subjects.
