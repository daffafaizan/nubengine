      term absence from school or work. There is some evidence that acupuncture and acupressure
      might be successful in treating of menstrual pain. Compared with acupuncture, acupressure
      offers the possibility for women with menstrual pain to do self-care treatment at home.
      However, studies have been small and self-care acupressure had been only investigated in one
      study from Taiwan.
