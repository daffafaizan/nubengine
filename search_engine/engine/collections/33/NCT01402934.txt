      responsiveness in mechanically ventilating patients. PPV is generated by cardiopulmonary
      interaction with respiratory cycles. In spontaneous breathing, the cardiopulmonary
      interaction may lead to PPV by inverted manner. In this study, the investigators will
      evaluate the ability of PPV to predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing
      patients. Before induction of anesthesia, radial artery cannulation is performed, and
      FloTrac/Vigileo (Edwards Lifesciences Corp., Irvine, USA) system is connected. And then, the
      investigators will measure baseline data including invasive blood pressure, pulse pressure,
      cardiac index, stroke volume variation in two different conditions: during tidal spontaneous
      breathing and during forced spontaneous breathing. All hemodynamic measurement will be
      repeated after infusion of fluid using 6mL/kg of hydroxyethyl starch solution (Voluven), and
      will be averaged over 3 minutes. Patients whose cardiac index increased by >15% to fluid
      infusion is defined as responders. The investigators will compare the hemodynamic parameters
      between responders and non-responders. To evaluate the ability to predict volume
      responsiveness, receiver operating characteristics curves of the PPV will be calculated.
