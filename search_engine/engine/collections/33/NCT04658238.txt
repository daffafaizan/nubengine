      worldwide, treatment options are only very limited and severe side effects are common.
      However, recent studies showed that the ocular microbiome may be crucial for maintaining
      ocular surface homeostasis. Disruption of this homeostasis, called dysbiosis, may lead to
      inflammation that is a key component in the pathogenesis of dry eye disease. It has been
      suggested that bacteria are invasive in ocular mucosal tissue, thereby effectively hidden
      from clearance by the local immune system and rendering the inflammation chronic. Therefore,
      the investigators hypothesize that the ocular microbiome may induce changes in the mucosal
      immune system of the eye, which in turn may accelerate the development of dry eyes. Since
      there is a crucial role of both, the ocular microbiome and the local mucosal immune system,
      on several diseases, the overall aim of this project is to assess the associations of the
      mucosal immune system and the ocular microbiome in dry eye disease.
