      antiplatelet therapy and double dose plavix maintenance dose in aspirin resistant patients
      undergoing elective PCI through femoral access. The primary outcome of this study is an
      elevation of cardiac enzymes within 24 hours after the PCI with a secondary outcome of a
      composite of major adverse cardiac events of death, MI, stent thrombosis and urgent
      revascularization and bleeding up to 30 days.
