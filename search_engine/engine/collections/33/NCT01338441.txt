      identify about 20 extreme responders (10 high responders and 10 non responders) assessed as
      Delta QTcf compare to baseline. The ECG will be measured and the delta QTcf will be
      calculated on the 20 selected subjects in a second part of the clinical trial, cross over
      erythromycin/placebo.
