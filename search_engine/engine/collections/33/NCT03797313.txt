      admission and discharged from the ICU alive. All participants will receive usual clinical
      care. Participant expectations for functional recovery will be assessed before hospital
      discharge via a standardized questionnaire containing a visual analogue scale and questions
      about expected ability and importance of being able to perform activities of daily living and
      instrumental activities of daily living in 6 months. At 6 months, participants will be
      re-contacted by phone. Study staff will administer questionnaires to assess whether patient
      expectations have been met. Quality of life will be assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF and the
      EQ-5D-VAS.
