      have been the result of explosive blasts, and many of these critical injuries involve trauma
      to the head. As a result, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been deemed a "signature wound" of
      OIF and OEF. The symptoms of head injuries, particularly of concussion/mild TBI (mTBI), can
      be sever but subtle, suggesting that early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to a wounded
      warrior's appropriate medical care. Most first providers in the war theater are medics who
      could benefit from an improved diagnostic test to better identify service members with
      concussion/mTBI. The MACE cognitive test is heavily weighted towards memory, is not 100%
      specific, and does not preclude a diagnosis of concussion being rendered despite a score in
      the normal range. Thus, an objective test of neurocognitive function, such as the DANA Rapid,
      that can be rapidly administered in theater by a combat medic would be highly beneficial to
      accurate clinical diagnosis and timely treatment. The results of the present study will
      provide information on the predictive value of the newly developed DANA handheld computer in
      assisting in the diagnosis of concussion in service members who have been blast exposed. If
      the DANA Rapid exam proves to be equally or more accurate than the MACE in detecting
      cognitive deficits, these tests and the handheld computer will also contribute to improved
      health care for service members by minimizing the time between injury and diagnosis.
