      eligibility and to assess baseline parameters (Day -28 to Day -1). For enrolled subjects
      there will be three intradermal (i.d.) treatment sessions of ELAPR002f or ELAPR002g and
      placebo, given at one-monthly intervals (approximately Day 0, Day 28 and Day 56). There will
      be a safety assessment visit 7 days after the first treatment session (Day 7) to review any
      adverse events and assess the implant sites. ELAPR002f or ELAPR002g will be administered
      alone vs. placebo. Subjects will be followed for a total of 12 weeks (to Day 84) following
      the first treatment, with efficacy and safety assessments undertaken at each study visit. At
      the final follow-up visit (Day 84) a biopsy sample will be taken from each of the treated SDs
      (active and placebo treated), together with a control biopsy of normal skin collected from an
      area of the lateral aspect of the abdomen, hip or thigh without an SD alba. Each study
      subject will act as their own control with active and placebo treatments given single-blind
      to contralateral sides of the abdomen, hip or thigh, into matched and paired SD. Prior to
      administration the selected injection sites along the length of SD alba to be treated will be
      identified and marked with a semi-permanent mark to ensure consistency of anatomic sites for
      treatment and biopsy. Follow-up period extended to D168, D336 and D504.
