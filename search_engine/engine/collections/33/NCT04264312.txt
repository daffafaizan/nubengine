      world's largest burden of HBV infection and will be a major contributor towards the global
      elimination of hepatitis B disease by 2030. While, the antiviral treatment rate and the main
      factors affecting the antiviral treatment in community chronic HBV infections is still
      unknown. In response to the above situation, Sampling applied a two-stage stratified cluster
      sampling design in 16 Districts and 331 Townships. Investigators wanted to know the one who
