      complete upper airway (UA) obstruction, is highly prevalent in the general population (2% in
      women, 4% in men). OSAS is associated with hypersomnolence and it increases the risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Its pathogenesis is largely multifactorial. In
      patients with chronic venous insufficiency, fluid retention contributes to this pathogenesis:
      during the day, fluid accumulates in the legs due to gravity ; during sleep in recumbent
      position, this accumulated fluid redistributes rostrally in the neck and causes upper airway
      narrowing and predisposes to OSAS.

      The hypothesis is that a comprehensive treatment program for chronic venous insufficiency
      (SPA therapy) would reduce sleep apnea in patients with chronic venous insufficiency and
      concomitant sleep apnea Syndrome.

      The objective is to assess the efficacy of a 3-week SPA therapy on attenuation of sleep apnea
      in this population of patients.
