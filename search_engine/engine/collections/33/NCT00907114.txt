      to 4 sessions within 2 weeks. This treatment reduces the incidence of severe visual loss in
      the long term. Nonetheless, it induces macular thickness that delays the conclusion of the
      treatment. This delay could coincide with vitreous hemorrhage which, in turn, may limit
      additional photocoagulation.

      Topic ketorolac could limit the inflammatory reaction cause by panphotocoagulation and
      produce early benefits in the patient.
