    
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of two regional locoregional
      analgesia strategies in total hip replacement surgery: the ultrasound-guided Quadratus
      Lumborum Block and the ultrasound-guided femoral block.

      This is a double-blind, randomized study in prospective inclusion with a superiority test.
      Two groups of patients will be compared: a group of patients with a quadratus lumborum block
      and a group of patients with a femoral block.

      Management (quadratus lumborum block or femoral block) will be randomized. The randomization
      will be stratified on the type of anesthesia (spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia).
      Randomization will be done on the day of surgery to determine the patient's treatment group.
      The surgical procedure will not be modified by the participation of the patent in the study.

      Patients who would benefit from total hip replacement surgery in the Reims University
      Hospital and who agreed to participate in the study were included.
