      schistosomiasis morbidity assessment of children aged 1-5 years will take place. The
      Kato-Katz technique will be used to detect and enumerate S. mansoni eggs in faecal samples
      from each participating child. Communities with the highest S. mansoni prevalence and
      intensity will be chosen and included in the study. In the second phase (Phase II) the S.
      mansoni positive children will be divided randomly into two intervention groups, single and
      double dose praziquantel treatment arms. Abdominal ultrasound will be combined with clinical
      examination to accurately identify hepatosplenomegaly. The sizes of both the liver and spleen
      will be examined. Anthropometric measurements and Hb for each child will also be recorded. In
      the last phase (Phase III), the effect of praziquantel on S. mansoni morbidity will be
      evaluated in all the treated children aged 1-5 years.
