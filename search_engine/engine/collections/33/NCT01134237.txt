      randomly divided into the urokinase group and the placebo group. In the urokinase group,
      urokinase 100,000 IU in 100 mL NaCl will be injected into the intrapleural space. We will
      record the daily drainage amount and evaluate the therapeutic effect by the chest X-ray. The
      therapeutic effect, safety, hospital stay, and medical cost between the two groups will be
      compared. This study will be done in four medical centers in northern Taiwan.
