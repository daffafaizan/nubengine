      pain, spasticity and upper extremity functionality in stroke patients.

      Patients and Methods: For this prospective, randomized, controlled and single-blind trial, 30
      stroke patients aged 40-65 years with hemiplegic shoulder pain were included. Patients were
      divided into two groups and randomized into these groups. Only conventional physiotherapy was
      applied to the control group, whereas both conventional physiotherapy and Bobath exercises
      were also applied to the experimental group. Visual analog scale (horizontal) for shoulder
      pain, modified Ashworth scale for spasticity and Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity
      for functionality were used for both pre-test and post-test.
