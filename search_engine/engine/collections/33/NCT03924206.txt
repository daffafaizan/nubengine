      spectrometer in real time. Concerning the smoke evacuation device, the investigators will use
      the model IES 2 (Intelligent Evacuation System) from Erbe Swiss medical for this study.

      Since this is only an observational study in which the investigators are only recording the
      type of surgery (i.e. open oder minimally invasive) and not recording sensitive patient data,
      the local ethics committee waived the need for an ethics committee approval of the study. In
      the end the smoke evacuation system does not have an effect on the patient or the procedure
      itself, but may rather influence the concentration of hazardous surgical fumes in the
      operating theatre.
