      receptor antagonist, in reducing early attrition and improving outcome in opioid-dependent
      individuals maintained on naltrexone.

      This double-blind, 12-week trial will include heroin-dependent patients who completed
      detoxification. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: naltrexone
      and placebo, naltrexone and memantine (15 mg bid), or naltrexone and memantine (30 mg bid).
      Naltrexone will be taken 3 times each week at the clinic, while memantine or placebo will be
      taken at home. In addition, twice each week patients will receive a psychosocial intervention
      that will include motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention. The
      goal of the psychosocial intervention is to improve compliance with medication and maintain
      abstinence. Baseline assessments will be taken and compared to those completed at study
      visits, which will occur 3 times each week.
