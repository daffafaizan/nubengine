    
      This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to take place in the Vidant Medical
      Center (VMC) Emergency Department (ED). A convenience sample of 96 participants will be drawn
      from patients presenting to the ED presentation with pain associated with suspected renal
      colic who do not experience pain relief after initial treatment with nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatories.

      Written informed consent will be sought by a study team member after screening to ensure all
      inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. Once a patient has consented, they will
      be randomized into 1 of 2 study arms: Arm 1 (Control arm) = 0.1mg/kg of intravenous morphine
      + placebo pill, single dose Arm 2 (Study arm) = 0.05mg/kg intravenous morphine + 0.25mg
      pramipexole, single dose. Both arms include a maximum dose of 10mg/kg for the IV morphine.
      Pain scores will be obtained prior to administration of study drugs, and at 15-minute
      intervals (+/- 2 mins) after treatment for up to 2 hours, or discharge from the ED.
      Subjective response to each drug treatment will also be assessed every 15 minutes (+/- 2
      mins) after treatment for up to 2 hours, or discharge from ED. Morphine will have a max dose
      of 10mg IV.
