      (HRV-BF) in asthma management as either a controller (alternative) or bronchodilator
      (complementary) treatment, with respect to the current treatment of choice, inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, using different methods from participants that demonstrated
      clinically significant improvement in asthma outcomes in the investigator's previous research
      (1), and adding a second site not involved in the investigator's previous work.

      Inflammation of airways is viewed as the core pathophysiologic process in asthma. It is
      thought to render airways more reactive, and therefore, more susceptible to
      bronchoconstriction, leading to asthma exacerbations. Asthma is an episodic disease, where
      the goal of therapy is to reduce susceptibility to exacerbations, which may cause severe,
      even life-threatening illness. Anti-inflammatory medications reduce airways reactivity, while
      bronchodilator medications primarily relieve symptoms once an asthma exacerbation is in
      process, and may stop progressive constriction of airway smooth muscles (ASM). An
      anti-inflammatory effect of HRV-BF would have important implications for asthma management
      because adherence to ICS regimens is low due to a significant degree to feared side effects
      of prolonged steroid medication. Even if HRV-BF is found to only allow partial reduction in
      ICS requirements, this still would likely represent a major advance in asthma care.
