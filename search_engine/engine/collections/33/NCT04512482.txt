      and medical industries and listed on the FDA's "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) list. In
      vitro bromelain study demonstrated antibacterial effect on oral pathogens. Bromelain was
      found to prevent biofilm formation by interfering with bacteria-bacteria adhesion and/or
      adhesion to enamel surface. Clinical trials with toothpaste containing bromelain demonstrated
      improved plaque and gingivitis scores and extrinsic enamel stain removal capabilities. The
      impact of bromelain application prior to traditional mechanisms of plaque removal have not
      been clearly evaluated.
