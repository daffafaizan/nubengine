      Analysis

      Analysis of the information will be exhaustive. We will calculate prevalence of HPV genotypes
      in the GW in both sexes separately. Analyses of the survey will include simple frequencies,
      percentages, and comparison of results related to HPV knowledge with sociodemographic and
      clinical information. Explorative analysis using parametric or non parametric statistics of
      the items included in the questionnaire and clinical forms will be done as appropriate. We
      will calculate the medical cost of patients enrolled in the study. The treatment protocols
      used for this protocol will reflect the current clinical practice accepted for the treatment
      of genital warts. We will use national reference cost list (SOAT) to determine the cost of
      procedures included.
