    
      Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a ventilation mode where the diaphragm is
      controlling the amount of ventilatory assistance proportionally through a nasogastric tube
      containing electrodes which are sending the electrical activities of the diaphragm (Eadi) to
      the ventilator.

      Whereas Conventional ventilation modes like Pressure support or Pressure Control are
      dependent on the pressure drop or flow reversal to initiate assist delivered to the patient.
      This is last step of the signal chain leading to inhalation and is subject to disturbances
      such as intrinsic positive expiratory end pressure (PEEP), hyperinflation and leakage.
