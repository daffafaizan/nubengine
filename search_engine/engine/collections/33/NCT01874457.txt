      entirely in Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz from technology transfer from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), (2)
      the importance to the National Immunization Program (NIP) to provide the population a MMR
      vaccine to ensure high protection against mumps, similar to what occurs with measles and
      rubella components, it was considered essential to conduct a preliminary immunogenicity
      assessment of the MMR vaccine produced by BioManguinhos.
