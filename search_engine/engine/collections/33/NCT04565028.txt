      of U.S. Veterans. PTSD is strongly associated with increased risk for substance abuse
      comorbidity, including cannabis use disorder; however, multiple states now include PTSD as a
      condition for which patients can be legally prescribed medical marijuana, despite the fact
      that there has not been a single large-scale randomized clinical trial demonstrating the
      efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD to date. The overall objective of the current proposal is
      to prospectively study the impact of reduced cannabis use on psychosocial functioning among
      Veterans with PTSD. To do so, the investigators will first use ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA) methods to evaluate the relationship between cannabis use and daily
      functioning among Veterans with PTSD. Next, the investigators will use mobile contingency
      management (CM) and EMA to assess the impact of reduced cannabis use on daily functioning
      among Veterans with PTSD who are heavy cannabis users. The central hypothesis is that
      reductions in cannabis use will lead to positive changes in the functional outcomes of
      Veterans. The rationale for this research is that it will provide the first and only
      real-time data concerning the impact of reduced cannabis use on daily functioning among
      Veterans with PTSD. As a result, this innovative and timely project has the potential to
      significantly advance VHA healthcare and will directly inform the ongoing national debate
      concerning the impact of cannabis use on the long-term functional recovery of Veterans with
      PTSD.
