      radiochemotherapy with Cisplatin (in the dose of intravenous 100 mg / m2 IV) every 3 weeks).

      The Receptor of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor) or REGF is a membrane receptor; it's
      activation leads the cellular growth and inhibits apoptotic capacities. This receptor is
      overexpressed in numerous solid tumors, including ENT tumors. Several clinical studies showed
      that an over expression of the REGF in ENT tumors was a dominant factor of poor prognostic.

      Afatinib (BIBW2992) is a strong and irreversible inhibitor of the EGFR ( type 1 human
      epidermic growth factor receptor, also known as HER1) and of the HER2 (human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2).

      Currently, 3 phase III clinical studies in postoperative situation and using an anti-REGF are
      in progress: 2 in concomitant situation with the radiotherapy and 1 both in concomitance and
      in adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy.

      The preliminary results of a phase II study show that Afatinib is efficient in patients with
      local or metastatic relapse of a squamous cell carcinoma of the sphere ENT after a first line
      with Cisplatin and its tolerance is correct.

      These data lead us to propose in post-operative situation, in patients with a squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck, a radiochemotherapy with Cisplatin followed by a treatment of
      maintenance by Afatinib or by placebo.
