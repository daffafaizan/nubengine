      medicine. Indeed, recent clinical validation studies of CZT technology have documented a scan
      time reduction and low radiation dose without degradation of myocardial perfusion imaging in
      comparison with standard dual detector cameras. The increased photon counting sensitivity of
      camera can be used to explore novel protocols that may offer advantages over standard
      protocols used for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging. Berman et al. showed that rapid stress
      Tl-201/rest Tc-99m protocol for use with high-speed SPECT MPI has offered the superior
      qualities of Tl-201 for stress imaging and of the Tc-99m agents for rest imaging can be
      preserved. Nuclear medicine presents the most level of scientific validation for diagnosis
      and prognosis of coronary artery disease. A lot of studies have compared performance of
      standard dual detector cameras vs. Invasive Coronary Angiography. Fiechter et al. reported
      the first validation of ultrafast dedicated cardiac gamma camera with CZT versus invasive
      coronary angiography. But he used a novel hybrid SPECT /CT device and 99m-Tc-tetrofosmin
      pharmacological stress/rest examination. However, no study compares stress thallium-201/rest
      technetium-99m sequential dual isotope high-speed myocardial perfusion imaging versus
      invasive coronary angiography. Moreover, diagnosis performance of this high-speed protocol
      versus fractional flow reserve for stenosis evaluation is unknown.

      The investigators report here the first validation of high-speed protocol with dual isotope
      for myocardial perfusion imaging using invasive procedures (coronary angiography and
      fractional flow reserve) as the standard of reference.
