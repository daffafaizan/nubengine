      effective treatment of the patient as an individual. The promise of molecular targeted
      therapeutics and personalized cancer care has been demonstrated in breast and lung cancer and
      chronic myeloid leukemia. However, similar examples of success in multiple myeloma have not
      been achieved despite extensive basic research as well as clinical advances. What is well
      understood is that myeloma is a heterogeneous disease with great genetic and epigenetic
      complexity.22, 23 Therefore, there remains a critical need to understand myeloma patient
      biology in the context of current patient care.24 The objective of this longitudinal study is
      to identify patient subgroups and phenotypes defined by molecular profiling and clinical
      features. These profiles will enable a better understanding of mechanisms of disease, drug
      response and patient relapse. Ultimately the study is intended to drive successful drug
      development and patient care in multiple myeloma.
