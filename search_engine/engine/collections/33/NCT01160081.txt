      simplex virus (1 and 2), Varicella-Zoster virus and Cytomegalovirus infections, we propose to
      conduct a population based, seroprevalence, cross-sectional study, in Mexico. This will allow
      the identification of susceptible populations, which in turn, will serve as evidence for the
      elaboration of recommendations for the prevention of Hepatitis A, Human simplex virus,
      Varicella-Zoster virus and Cytomegalovirus infection in the region.

      This study was conducted using data and serum samples from a random sample of subjects that
      participated in the 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey.
