      evolved rapidly since 2011. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieve great
      effectiveness with minimum SAEs and short treatment duration. However, studies evaluating
      efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir during 8 weeks are
      limited in real clinical practice. The aim of the study is to evaluate in clinical practice
      the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and dasabuvir administered for
      8 weeks in treatment-na√Øve participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV).
