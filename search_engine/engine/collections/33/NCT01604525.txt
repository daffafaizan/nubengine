      Aim 1. To determine the efficacy of providing individually tailored smoking cessation
      messages as part of a general interest website for young adults.

      Aim 2. To determine the efficacy of providing individually tailored smoking cessation
      messages plus peer email, phone and online support as part of a general interest website for
      young adults.

      Participants were recruited via direct emails sent to undergraduate and graduate students at
      the University of MI as well as direct emails sent to participants from Survey Sampling
      International and National Data Group. Individuals were invited to complete an online survey
      about health and hope in young adults. Participants eligible for the full intervention were
      invited to join the RealU Study.

      Participants were asked to complete an online enrollment survey and consent form. Eligible,
      enrolled participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three study arms:

        -  an untailored general interest/lifestyle website

        -  an individually tailored web intervention about health and lifestyle

        -  an individually tailored web intervention about health and lifestyle with coaching from
           peers, including video, phone, and email

      Assessments were conducted at 7 weeks and 12 weeks post-enrollment. The primary outcome
      measure is self-reported 30-day abstinence at 12 weeks.
