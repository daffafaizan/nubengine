      will be announced in the social network by members of the study. Interested physical
      therapists will send an email to one of the study authors with their information regarding
      the inclusion criteria. After two months of notice, interested and eligible physiotherapists
      will be randomized into two groups of 15 participants each.

      The study arms are: 1) control group (physical therapist who will not receive training) and
      2) experimental group (physical therapist who will receive training). Before and after
      training, attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about low back pain guidelines will be evaluated.

      Each physical therapist will recruit for the study a total of fifteen consecutive patients
      with chronic nonspecific low back pain (total sample=150 patients). All the patients will be
      assessed before the first session by a blinded examiner who will be unaware about the group
      allocation.

      Clinical outcomes (pain, disability, fear avoidance beliefs and pain catastrophizing) will be
      collected at baseline and at 5 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization. All statistical
      analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to treat analysis and the
      between-group differences will be performed using Mixed Linear Models.
