      infections in HIV patients. Historically, amphotericin B (AMB) has been considered the "gold
      standard" in antifungal treatments due to its broad spectrum of activity and lack of
      emergence of resistance. However, the use of AMB is limited by side effects, including
      nephrotoxicity, anemia, and infusion-related reactions. MAT2203 or encochleated oral
      amphotericin B (cAMB) is a lipid nano-crystal formulation designed for targeted oral delivery
      of the antifungal drug AMB for treatment of fungal and parasitic infections.
