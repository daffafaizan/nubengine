      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients refractory to TNF alpha antagonists. According to previous
      studies, (Edwards, Szczepanski et al. 2004; Cohen, Emery et al. 2006; Emery, Fleischmann et
      al. 2006) 25 to 50% of patients have an insufficient or absence of response to rituximab at
      week 24. In the pathogenesis of RA, B and T lymphocytes are tightly linked through the APC
      fonction and cytokines production of B lymphocytes. At present, a white blood cells count is
      recommended in routine every 3 months in patients receiving rituximab, since cases of
      neutropenia have been observed in approximately 8% of patients with lymphoma after treatment.
      In RA patients, B lymphocytes count before each rituximab course should be done to prevent
      opportunistic infections (Pham, Fautrel et al. 2008).

      In a recent retrospective study, a CD4+ T-lymphocytes depletion was observed after a first
      course of rituximab in RA patients. The absolute CD4+ number at week 12 was 37% (±33) of the
      baseline value, leading to < 200 cells/µL in 5% of patients. Interestingly the absence of
      CD4+ T-lymphocytes depletion was observed in clinical non-responders, suggesting the
      involvement of T-lymphocytes in the mechanism of action of rituximab (Mélet, Mulleman et al.
      2013). Moreover, few case reports of RA patients developing opportunist infections in
      conjunction with CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion have been published (Teichmann, Woenckhaus et
      al. 2008; Clifford, Ances et al. 2011). So far no prospective study have supported the
      usefulness of lymphocyte phenotyping, in particular T-lymphocytes, to monitor
      rituximab-treated RA patients.
