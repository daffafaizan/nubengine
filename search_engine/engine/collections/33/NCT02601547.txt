      documented in breast carcinoma patients. These modifications consist in the decrease of
      memory, intellectual capacity, speed analysis, and represent a real limitation for patients,
      sometimes durable. Aggressive lymphomas (diffuse large B cell lymphomas/DLBCL) represent a
      common disease, the standard being
      Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicine-Vincristine-Prednisone (RCHOP) regiment which
      contains, as for breast cancer patients, anthracyclines. However, very little is known about
      the incidence and severity of cognitive function alteration in these patients. The occurrence
      of such complications should also be facilitated because of frail cognitive states due to age
      and co-morbidity. Cognitive function alteration is usually measured by neuropsychological
      tests (NPT) which are easy to handle and sensitive, but could lack specificity, in the
      context of general degradation which is often observed in hematological patients.

      Positron emission tomography with 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (PET-FDG) is emerging as a
      promising approach for detecting brain lesions in dementia, among which Alzheimer's disease
      has been the most widely studied. In our center, the investigators have already described
      glucidic hypometabolism in several brain territories associated with Alzheimer's disease and
      other dementia. Moreover, uptake quantification and topography are useful markers for
      determining the type of the disease and progression. PET-FDG received very little attention
      for the detection of chemotherapy-induced brain damages.
