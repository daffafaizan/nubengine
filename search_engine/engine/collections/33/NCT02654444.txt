      Human Epithelial growth factor receptor (Her2/neu) expression in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens. Results from the Her-2 test is
      indicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom HERCEPTINÂ® (Trastuzumab) treatment
      is being considered. While the Her-2 kit provides the antibodies that offer direct
      visualization and semi-quantification of the HER2 protein expression through a brightfield
      microscope, the GenASIs GoPath system is designed to complement the routine workflow of the
      pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides.
