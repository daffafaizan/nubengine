    
      Pseudomonas is a gram-negative bacillus which commonly colonises lower limb venous ulcers. It
      produces exotoxins and elastase as well as forming biofilms within chronic wounds.

      Its effects on venous ulcer healing are debated. The objective of this study is to examine
      the effects on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa colonisation on the pain expereinces and healing rates
      of venous leg ulcers.
