      laparoscopic surgery over conventional open surgery are less pain, shorter recovery time,
      shorter hospital stay, and consequently faster return to normal activity as well as better
      cosmetic effects. However, laparoscopic surgery is more demanding compared with open surgery
      because operators should project three-dimensional (3D) field through a two-dimensional (2D)
      monitor.

      However, to date, studies examining the possible benefits and drawbacks of 3D imaging system
      versus 2D in laparoscopic surgery have brought about conflicting results. Moreover, there
      have been few studies comparing the surgical outcomes of 3D and 2D laparoscopic laparoscopic
      myomectomy. The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes and efficacy of
      3-dimensional (3D) versus 2-dimensional (2D) imaging systems in laparoscopic myomectomy..
