      The inflammatory reaction, evident in the later stages of the disease, is linked with high
      mortality rates. Pharmaceutical interventions at this stage often do not achieve the desired
      effects. Low Dose Radiation Therapy (LD-RT) has been utilized for treatment of inflammatory
      conditions because of its immunomodulatory effects. Thus, LD-RT may be an option in
      SARS-CoV-2 based on pre-clinical models and early clinical data. This study is to analyse the
      efficacy of LD-RT for treatment of Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrome-Coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2).
