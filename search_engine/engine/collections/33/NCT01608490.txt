      comparing outcomes between the LVRC and Control Groups. Subjects will be block randomized in
      an LVRC (Treatment) to Control ratio of 1:1. The randomization will be stratified by
      homogeneous versus heterogeneous emphysema, to support a balance of patients with differing
      heterogeneity in both the LVRC and Control Groups.
