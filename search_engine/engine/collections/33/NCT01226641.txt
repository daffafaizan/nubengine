      incomplete pharynx collapses occurring during sleep. The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      is the gold standard treatment for OSAS. It consists of air insufflation in upper airways
      with a pressure of about 5 to 15 cm of water with a facial or nasal mask. CPAP treatment
      reduces cardiovascular morbi-mortality.

      OSAS is associated with cardiovascular mortality. A dose response effect exists between
      severity and arterial blood pressure. A recent meta-analysis has shown in unselected OSAS
      patients with or without hypertension, treated or non-treated for hypertension, CPAP reduces
      24 h ambulatory blood pressure of approximately 2 mmHg. This decrease corresponds to a
      significant reduction in cardiovascular risk.

      The aim of the present study is to include OSAS patients with a high cardiovascular risk and
      to measure the effect of CPAP on home measurements of arterial blood pressure. This
      controlled randomized trial will compare the effect CPAP on arterial blood pressure in a
      group with a telemedicine system versus a group with standard home care CPAP treatment.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 100 patients have been included in the study.
