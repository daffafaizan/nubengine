      compared to placebo, in cognitively intact adults 55 years old with Metabolic Syndrome
      (Mets), will (i) increase peripheral and brain ketone levels [primarily f3-hydroxybutyrate
      (BHB) and secondarily acetoacetate (AcAc)], (ii) improve neuronal/astrocytic insulin
      resistance (IR) and induce a change in neuronal/astrocytic metabolism as reflected on blood
      Extracellular Vesicle (EV) biomarkers, (iii) improve cognitive performance, (iv) boost
      mitochondrial function in muscle, and (v) change gut microbiome. These effects will be
      examined acutely, after single (NotEqual) dose administration, and chronically, after 28 days
      on the supplement x 3 times per day. The changes in EV biomarkers and cognition will be
      associated with the elevation of ketones in brain. The study will involve a Screening Visit
      and three additional Visits to assess acute effects, compliance and chronic effects,
      respectively.
