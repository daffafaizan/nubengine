      via nasal cannula provides respiratory support to patients with COPD as a primary diagnosis,
      who present with respiratory insufficiency in the Emergency Department. We intend to
      demonstrate that Vapotherm HFT via nasal cannula will result in at least equivalent patient
      outcomes as the current standard of care, while eliminating the need for other non-invasive
      respiratory support devices cleared for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency. The
      current standard of care will include the use of other devices cleared by the FDA as
      respiratory assist devices for the treatment of adult respiratory insufficiency.
