      including physiotherapists, must have the skills to create professional interaction plans
      that permit a better quality of life for consultants. Clinical simulation can be a pedagogic
      setting that facilitates students with adequate training to acquire skills that improve
      professional reasoning in this clinical situation. The objective of this study was to compare
      the effects of clinical simulation with a simulated patient (SP) versus simulation with
      role-playing (RP) in physiotherapy students for decision-making in clinical skills while
      caring for a person with LBP. Methods. An experimental study, with 42 participants from two
      Colombian universities, randomized into two groups (SP n = 21, RP n = 21). The clinical skill
      was evaluated during the interaction with a person with LBP for which the Objective
      Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE-ML) was validated for individuals with low back pain;
      thereafter, a pedagogical method was conducted that included clinical simulation and,
      finally, the OSCE-ML was applied again to compare both groups.
