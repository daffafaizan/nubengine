      are affected by the block. Aside being a motor nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis of the
      quadriceps femoris muscle, contains the second largest sensory contribution from the femoral
      nerve. It is probable that some of the analgesic effect of the ACB arises from blocking this
      nerve.

      Even though the ACB is mainly a sensory nerve block, a study in healthy volunteers showed a
      small decline by 8% in quadriceps muscle strength(10). It is speculated that the decline in
      muscle strength was caused by the spread of local anesthetic to the nerve supplying the
      vastus medialis of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Three out of eleven of the volunteers
      experienced an even larger decline of 25 % in quadriceps muscle strength. It has been argued
      that this decline likely was caused by a proximal spread of the local anesthetic to the
      femoral triangle thereby resulting in an affection of the femoral nerve. In this study, a
      volume of 30 ml of local anesthetic was used.

      We do not know the optimal volume for the ACB and we find it relevant to investigate to what
      extent and which parts of the quadriceps muscle gets affected when different volumes of a
      local anesthetic are injected into the adductor canal. Selective affection of the different
      components of the femoral quadriceps muscle can be assessed by non-invasive EMG recordings.
      Further, the quadriceps femoris muscle strength will be evaluated by measuring the MVIC
      following the different volumes. The EMG recordings will be voluntary (vEMG) measured during
      MVIC and stimulated (sEMG). sEMG is measured during transcutaneous electrical stimulation of
      the femoral nerve.
