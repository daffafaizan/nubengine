    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To analyze the expression of ROR1 on the surface of primary neuroblastoma cells.

        -  To investigate the therapeutic potential of anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
           bispecific antibodies, and immunotoxins in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroblastoma.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ROR1 expression by
      flow cytometry, western blotting, qPCR, and IHC.
