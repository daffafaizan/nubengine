      I/II disorder) to the Mayo Clinic Depression Center will be invited to participate in this
      study evaluating the Assurex GeneSight® platform; this new technology can rapidly assess PK
      and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant, antipsychotic, and
      stimulant associated treatment outcomes for depression. This study will recruit treatment
      seeking patients with major depression with an index episode of moderate symptom severity
      that has been unresponsive or poorly tolerated to at least one prior antidepressant
      treatment. This will be an 8-week, double-blind trial where depressed patients are randomized
      to testing results of GeneSight® (tricolored clinical report) prior to treatment selection
      (n=138) vs. treatment as usual (tricolored dummy report) (n=138). All testing results will be
      made available after the 8-week trial.
