      failure after myocardial infarction. In addition, previous studies have found that the method
      of warming Yang and activating blood circulation is effective in treating coronary heart
      disease, and the core pathogenesis of heart failure after myocardial infarction is also Yang
      deficiency and blood stasis. Therefore, this project aims to evaluate the clinical value of
      warming Yang and activating blood circulation in the treatment of heart failure after
      myocardial infarction. Through pharmacological research and detection, the efficacy of
      Wenyang huoxue prescription in heart failure rats after intervention of myocardial infarction
      was evaluated, mir-233-ISO signaling pathway was detected before and after treatment, and its
      mechanism of action was further clarified from the perspective of epigenetics and classical
      pathway of heart failure.

      Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of Wenyang Huoxue fang in the treatment of
      heart failure after myocardial infarction.
