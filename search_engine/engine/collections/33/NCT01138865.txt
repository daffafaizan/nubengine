      during sleep, as a result of which there is a decrease or complete cessation of airflow. This
      leads to repeated episodes of hypoxia during sleep and sleep fragmentation. It is a highly
      prevalent though under-recognized clinical problem.There is increasing evidence that
      inflammation plays important role in development of cardiovascular complications in patients
      with OSA.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for OSA with significant
      symptoms.However, it is a costly treatment option and poor compliance is an important
      limiting factor. CPAP treatment has been shown to improve the daytime somnolence and
      neurocognitive function in people with OSAS. However, its effect on cardiovascular biomarkers
      in people with OSAS has not been satisfactorily assessed.

      This study aims to assess the effect of CPAP treatment on cardiovascular biomarkers in OSA.
