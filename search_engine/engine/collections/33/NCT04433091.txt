    
      The proposed double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 2-HOBA in patients
      undergoing AF ablation is designed to address the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that treatment with 2-HOBA reduces early recurrence of
      AF (clinical endpoint)

      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that treatment with 2-HOBA reduces circulating levels
      of IsoLG-adducts (biochemical endpoint)

      Specific Aim 3: To explore the idea that genetic variation at the 4q25 (PITX2) AF
      susceptibility locus modulates the clinical and biochemical response to 2-HOBA
