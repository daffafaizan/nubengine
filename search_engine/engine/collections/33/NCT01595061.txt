      I. To determine the efficacy of cisplatin, gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride), and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in achieving a complete pathologic response when
      used for the primary treatment of locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and IMRT in achieving a complete
      clinical response when used for the primary treatment of locally-advanced squamous cell
      carcinoma of the vulva.

      II. To determine the vulvar progression-free survival and groin progression-free survival in
      women treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine and IMRT for locally advanced vulvar carcinoma.

      III. To determine the toxicity and surgical morbidity of the combined modality approach of
      cisplatin, gemcitabine and IMRT followed by reduced-scope surgery for the treatment of
      locally-advanced vulvar carcinoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo IMRT 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients also receive gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes weekly for
      6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 6-8 weeks
      after completion of chemoradiation patients undergo local core biopsy to confirm response or
      surgical excision of gross residual disease in the vulva and/or inguinal-femoral lymph nodes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
