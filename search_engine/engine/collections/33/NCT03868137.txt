      cramps. Intrauterine (IUD) insertion can cause pain during and after the insertion.
      Currently, studies have found that single dose of Ibuprofen take prior to IUD insertion does
      decrease pain at time of IUD insertion. This study will examine whether 3 doses of Ibuprofen
      can decrease pain at time of and 1 day after IUD insertion.
