        -  Evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment alone for stage II neuroblastoma
           without N-myc amplification (NMA).

        -  Describe predictive factors of relapse and survival for stages I and II neuroblastoma
           without NMA treated by surgery alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients with localized resectable tumors undergo surgery. Postoperative evaluations
      are performed 30 days following surgery. Study patients with stage I (without N-myc
      amplification) tumors and trial patients with stage II tumors receive no further therapy.

      Study patients (except stage I patients) receive surgery and/or chemotherapy according to
      other protocols as necessary for disease progression or relapse.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, then every 4 and 6 months for the
      second and third year respectively, then yearly for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 140 stage II patients for the trial portion at a
      rate of 40 per year over 3.5 years. At least 70 more patients will be accrued for the study
      portion.
