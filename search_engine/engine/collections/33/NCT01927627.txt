    
      This is a pilot phase II study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of Enzalutamide
      (formerly known as MDV3100) a novel androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor in men with high-risk
      prostate cancer who have undergone local definitive therapy with radical prostatectomy.

      Primary Objectives:

      -To evaluate the clinical efficacy of enzalutamide in patients with high-risk prostate cancer
      with regards to: Time to disease progression defined by biochemical recurrence (BCR)

      Secondary Objectives:

      -To further evaluate the safety of enzalutamide in patients with high-risk prostate cancer

      Patients will receive daily oral therapy with enzalutamide at 160mg (4 capsules) orally once
      daily (QD). Patients will continue on study until progressive disease, drug intolerability,
      consent withdrawal or completion of study at 24 months.
