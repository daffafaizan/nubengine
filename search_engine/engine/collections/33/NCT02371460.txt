      disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD causes major health problems in these
      infants, especially in their early childhood. In most situations, breast-milk is the ideal
      source of nutrition for growth and development of premature babies. However, diets of
      Canadian mothers are generally deficient in omega-3 lipids (essential fats), resulting in
      lower protection from these omega-3 lipids in mother's milk-fed infants. Previous research
      has shown that giving DHA to mothers of premature babies is safe both for the mother and for
      their baby, and is an efficient way of helping babies meet their dietary requirements from
      breast-milk. Furthermore, this previous research also suggests that this intervention may
      reduce the risk of BPD in premature babies receiving breast-milk.
