        -  Determine whether dalteparin, initiated at the time of conventional radiotherapy,
           improves the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of dalteparin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Beginning concurrently with
      initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously once daily for up to 2
      years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue receiving dalteparin
      after year 2 at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years
      after study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
