      (kidney disease), retinopathy (eye damage) and neuropathy (nervous system damage). Diabetes
      is also associated with macrovascular complications including cardiovascular disease (heart
      disease), stroke and peripheral vascular disease (narrowing or blockage of blood vessels).
      These complications are associated with reduced quality of life and increased morbidity and
      mortality.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Evaluations of alogliptin and its clinical efficacy have been conducted in multiple countries
      including the United States and Japan. This study will be conducted as a multi-center
      clinical trial in order to validate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin on type 2 diabetes
      population within Asia.

      Participants who qualified for the study were stratified into 1 of the 3 therapy groups based
      upon their background antidiabetic therapy before being randomized 1:1 to receive either
      alogliptin 25 mg once daily or matching placebo once daily.

        -  Monotherapy group - patients who had been treated with diet and exercise for at least 2
           months prior to screening.

        -  Add-on to metformin therapy group - patients who had been treated with metformin for at
           least 3 months and at a stable dose (â‰¥1000 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to
           screening.

        -  Add-on to pioglitazone therapy group - patients who had been treated with a stable dose
           of pioglitazone alone or in combination with metformin at a stable dose for at least 8
           weeks prior to screening.
