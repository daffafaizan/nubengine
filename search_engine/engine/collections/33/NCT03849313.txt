    
      AVT02 is being developed as a biosimilar to Humira. EU-Humira and US-Humira have therefore
      been selected as the active control groups in this study.

      This study is designed as a multi-center, randomised, double-blind, 3-arm parallel study of
      AVT02 compared to EU-Humira and US-Humira in healthy adult subjects. The study is designed to
      evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of AVT02 compared to EU-Humira and US-Humira when
      administered as a single dose (40 mg) SC injection.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned with a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either AVT02 or EU-Humira
      or US-Humira on a single occasion on study Day 1. Both the site staff assessing the subjects
      and the subjects themselves will be blinded to the treatments being administered.

      The study consists of a screening period, admission and treatment period, assessment period
      and end of study visit. Subjects will undertake a screening visit between Day -28 and Day -1
      to determine eligibility in the study. Those subjects that meet the eligibility criteria will
      be admitted to the study site on the evening prior to dosing (Day -1) when continued
      eligibility will be assessed.

      On Day 1 prior to dosing, baseline assessments will be performed. Subjects will then be dosed
      according to the randomization schedule. Following dosing, PK, safety and tolerability
      assessments will be performed according to the study schedule (Table 6Table 6). Subjects will
      remain confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 3 (48 hours post-dose). Subjects will
      return to the study site on Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, Day 7, Day 8, Day 9, Day 12, Day 15, Day 22,
      Day 29, Day 36, Day 43, Day 50 and Day 57.

      An end of study visit will occur at study Day 64 for final study assessments
