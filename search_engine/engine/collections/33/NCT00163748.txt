      lymphocytes) have less chance of cure if they are refractory to initial chemotherapy or
      relapse after receiving initial chemotherapy when compared to patients who are responsive to
      and do not relapse following initial chemotherapy. The standard of care, therefore, for these
      patients is to undergo some form of bone marrow transplant procedure. However, before this
      can be considered most patients require chemotherapy to control the lymphoma and to determine
      whether the lymphoma is still sensitive to alternative types of chemotherapy (salvage
      chemotherapy). Currently used types of salvage chemotherapy require significant periods of
      inpatient hospitalisation and are associated with significant haematological toxicities (low
      blood counts with the associated risks of infection and bleeding and the need for blood and
      platelet transfusions). Two new chemotherapy drugs, vinorelbine and gemcitabine, have both
      shown encouraging efficacy against lymphoma when used alone for patients with heavily
      pretreated lymphoma. Furthermore, they can be given in an outpatient setting and are usually
      not associated with significant haematological toxicity. All the patients participating in
      this study have been diagnosed with relapsed or refractory lymphoma and have been offered
      treatment with vinorelbine and gemcitabine as an alternative to inpatient salvage
      chemotherapy.
