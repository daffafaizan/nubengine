      Specific Aim 1. To demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnostic capabilities
      of a neuroretinal examination which includes slit lamp and fundoscopy, and NRFA for the
      diagnosis of Fabry disease on a subject population of identified FD patients.

      Specific Aim 2. To show capillary perfusion abnormalities in optic nerve and retina using
      neuroretinal fluorescein angiography in patients with Fabry disease and compare these to
      renal (measured by GFR).

      Specific Aim 3. To show that the change in capillary perfusion studies when compared to
      baseline in response to enzyme replacement therapy treatment over time, as a manifestation of
      tissue burden and prognosis is a more sensitive biomarker of the extent of patient disease
      than corneal keratopathy.
