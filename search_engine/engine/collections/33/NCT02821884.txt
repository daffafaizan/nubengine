      (NMES) is non-invasive electrical stimulation, and some studies have proved efficacy of the
      tDCS and NMES on healthy subjects and stroke patients. However, the effects of combination
      tDCS and NMES on upper extremity motor recovery and neural plasticity in healthy subjects and
      patients with stroke have not yet been investigated. Moreover in order to discover the tDCS
      combine NMES of the safety and feasibility and influences on neural plasticity and motor
      function, the cortical excitability and functional recovery measurements (clinical scales)
      are taken in the healthy subjects and stroke.

      The right-handed subjects will be received the combination of tDCS and NMES for 30 minutes.
      The changes in the hand function and cortical excitability were probed by recording movement
      performance scales in upper extremity and mapping of brain cortex before and after the
      intervention.

      The patients will be assigned into one of three groups (A, B,C) by block randomization. All
      participants will receive regular traditional rehabilitation. In addition, three groups will
      receive an additional 3 weeks, 5 times per week, 30 minutes once daily, total 15 session.
      Group A: both tDCS and NMES conduct simultaneously for 30 minutes. Group B: combination of
      tDCS and sham NMES Group C: combination of sham tDCS and sham NMES.
