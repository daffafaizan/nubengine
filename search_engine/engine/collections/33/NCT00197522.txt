      18 patients, will be treated at increasing dose levels based on a modified Fibonacci scheme.
      Peripheral blood progenitor cells will be obtained from each patient following cytokine
      mobilization (with GM-CSF and G-CSF). Selected CD34+ cells are then cultured with human
      GM-CSF, human TNFÎ±, Flt-3 ligand and human interleukin-4. The CD34+ derived dendritic cells
      are then transduced with an adenovirus expressing rat HER2/neu. These transduced DCs are then
      injected intradermally into the patient. Patients will be injected with the AdHER2/neu
      transduced DCs every 21 days for a total of three treatment cycles. The starting dose of
      dendritic cells will be 10 X 10^6 DCs. If none of the initial three patients treated at this
      dose experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) then a new cohort of three patients will be
      treated at a second dose level of 50 X 10^6 DCs. If any patient experiences DLT then up to
      six patients will be treated at the current dose level; if 2/6 or fewer patients experience
      DLT, we will escalate to the to the second dose level. If 3 or more patients experience DLT,
      the maximum tolerated dose will be deemed as exceeded and a second cohort of 3 patients will
      be treated at a 10 fold dose reduction of the initial dose level. The third dose level will
      consist of 100 x 10^6 DCs. All treatments will occur in the out-patient setting and patients
      will be seen prior to each injection and then monthly for at least three months following the
      last injection of AdHER2/neu DCs.
