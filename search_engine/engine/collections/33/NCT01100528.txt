      I. Assess disease-free survival (DFS) with sequential dacarbazine and interferon-alfa-2b as
      an adjuvant to primary therapy for patients with uveal melanoma with genetic imbalance.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate side effects and assess safety in the patient population.

      II. Examine the relationship between the levels of plasma biomarkers of immune function and
      tumor invasion and the clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 29. Beginning 4 weeks after the second
      dose of dacarbazine, patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously 3 times a
      week for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
