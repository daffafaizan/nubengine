      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is diffusely accelerated atherosclerosis of the donor
      heart, and limits long term survival after transplant. The pathophysiology of CAV is complex
      and involves smooth muscle proliferation, inflammatory infiltrates, and lipid deposition. To
      date, only statin therapy has reduced CAV-related mortality. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new lipid
      lowering therapy shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical events in patients with coronary
      artery disease. We hypothesize that PCSK9 inhibition via evolocumab will significantly lower
      LDL and be well-tolerated in transplant patients with CAV. This phase II, open label, single
      center trial with enroll up to 40 heart transplant patients with CAV for treatment with
      evolocumab for one year. The primary outcome will be percent change in LDL at 12 weeks.
      Secondary outcomes will include change in CAV progression, impact of evolocumab on
      immunosuppression regimens and transplant rejection, and change in serum lipids after 52
      weeks. Results of this study are intended to provide safety data in heart transplant patients
      with CAV and assess secondary outcomes including CAV progression and impact on
      immunosuppression and transplant rejection.
