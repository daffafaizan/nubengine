      defined as a composite of clinically driven target-lesion revascularization, cardiac death,
      any myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis) at 12-month follow-up, and of stent
      thrombosis at 1-day, and 1- and 12-month follow-up. Pre-specified analyses will be performed
      among patient subpopulations according to level of glycemic control (HbA1c level < 6.5% or >
      6.5%); reference vessel diameter by quantitative coronary angiography (< 2.5 mm and > 2.5
      mm); and stented length (8-18 mm; 23-33 mm; and >33 mm). Quantitative coronary angiographic
      (QCA) analysis will be performed at the core lab of the China Cardiovascular Research
      Foundation for all pre- and post-index procedure angiograms and during the 12-month follow-up
      period for the pre- and post-reintervention procedures in those cases of clinically-driven
      PCI revascularization. Also, multivariable analyses will be conducted to investigate
      potential predictors of 12-month MACE rate in routine clinical practice.

      The registry will be conducted at about 45 centers in China, where the CYPHER Select™+
      Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is commercially available. Data will be collected on 2,500
      diabetic patients treated with the CYPHER Select™ + Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent only.

      Primary outcome: MACE (clinically driven TLR, cardiac death, MI, ST) at 12 months Secondary
      outcome: ARC (probable + definite) ST at 1-day, and 1 and 12 months
