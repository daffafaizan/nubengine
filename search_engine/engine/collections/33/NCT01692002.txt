      diabetes are expected to top 4 million by 2025. There is an urgent need for new therapies.
      The short chain fatty acid propionate is a natural substance produced by digestion of
      fermentable carbohydrates. Preclinical and early human data demonstrate it improves
      pancreatic function and glucose control. The investigators aim to conduct proof of principle
      studies to determine if oral delivery of propionate improves glucose control in patients at
      risk of developing diabetes.
