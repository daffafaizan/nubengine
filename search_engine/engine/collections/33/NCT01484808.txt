      known as REDUCE that utilized a 5 ARI, dutasteride. It is the investigators intention to
      review whether PSA velocity (change over time) will predict the presence of prostate cancer
      and its grade and stage (severity) by two year biopsy. The investigator will review and
      compare data to a previously published study of similar design with finasteride.
