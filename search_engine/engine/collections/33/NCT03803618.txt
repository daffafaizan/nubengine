      suspicion of dengue at the study hospitals and were eligible to have received the dengue
      vaccine during the mass immunization. The outcome of interest is hospitalized and/or severe
      virologically-confirmed dengue and the exposure is receipt of the dengue vaccine. Each case
      will be matched to two controls who were also eligible to have received the dengue vaccine
      and lives in the same area as the case. Cases and controls will be matched by age and sex.
