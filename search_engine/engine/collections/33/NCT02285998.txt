      licensed (traditional approval status) quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) in
      protecting against laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza disease in the â‰¥50 year age
      population. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) will be used to confirm influenza
      infection and to type the strains involved, as molecular methodologies have been demonstrated
      to be more sensitive than other more traditional methodologies, e.g. culture. For
      rtPCR-positive clinical samples, reserved aliquots will be processed for culture, so that
      antigenic similarity to the HA present in study vaccines can be tested.

      In various clinical studies the investigators demonstrated that the immune response against
      the influenza A viruses is improved as a result of the higher hemagglutinin content.
      Furthermore, influenza virus disease and hospitalization associated with influenza-related
      illness in older adults (> 50 years) was considerably reduced (90%) following vaccination
      with TIV, even though the circulating influenza A strain was antigenically dissimilar to that
      in the vaccine. However, more recently Skowronski et al. reported that the low influenza
      vaccine effectiveness in 2012-2013 was not associated with antigenic drift but was instead
      related to mutations in the egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain. Flublok manufactured using
      recombinant technology does not contain the mutations responsible for the reported lower
      effectiveness and may thus offer improved protection when mutations such as those described
      are induced in the process of adapting the influenza virus to growth in eggs.
