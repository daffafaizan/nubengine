      the catheter-associated urinary tract infection, which prolongs the hospital stay and costs,
      and is about 3 times more likely to die during hospitalization than patients not infected.

      The measures of aseptic insertion and closed systems of collection, as well as the rational
      use of the probe reduce the risk for infection.

      A checklist that contains the agreed indications of catheter, related to obstruction,
      incontinence, skin lesions in sacral region, monitoring or surgical procedures allows the
      daily review of the indication of the probe. If the patient doesnÂ´t meet at least one of the
      criteria, should be recommended the withdrawal of the catheter.
