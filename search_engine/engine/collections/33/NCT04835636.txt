    
      This pilot study will evaluate the use of a modified (cultural and language) adaptation of
      the National Diabetes Prevention Program in a cohort in Quito Ecuador.

      Adaptations- the coaches will be physicians from PUCE and they will administer this program
      for eligible employees who have biochemical prediabetes.

      The program will be modified to be able to fit within the school curriculum. The diabetes
      prevention program will be offered in Spanish and the content modified to better fit the
      cultural norms for the Quito Ecuador population.

      Participants will be adults with prediabetes as screened by the CDC Diabetes Risk Test and
      confirmed by HbA1c.

      Outcome measures will include change in mean HbA1c, change in weight, physical activity, and
      attendance to the program.
