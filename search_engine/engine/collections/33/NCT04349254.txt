      stage dry age-related macular degeneration who received corneal treatments by a low vision
      aid device. Patient records for patients with at least 12 months follow-up will be analyzed
      to determine measures of vision improvement including best spectacle-corrected distance and
      near visual acuity. Analyses will include descriptive statistics and correlation between
      outcomes and baseline characteristics.
