      consecutive patients.

      Enrollment will be temporarily halted in case a serious adverse device effect (SADE) occurs,
      and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting will be conducted as soon as possible.
      The DSMB will then recommend whether to further continue the study as planned, or whether
      enrollment shall be stopped. In order to provide a complete overview of the study to the
      DSMB, an interim analysis will be performed after half of the study population (11-14
      subjects) is enrolled with a minimum follow-up of 1 month. A conclusion for safety will be
      made if in total no more than 2 of the total of 22 patients experience a SADE.

      The primary aim of this study is to show "safety", which will be evaluated based on the
      percentage of subjects who experience a SADE (="non-safety"), as defined in the primary
      endpoints.

      The study will be declared a success if the final non-safety event rate is less than 6% (type
      II error rate of 0.20). The calculation is based on a design optimizing the minimum expected
      sample size with parameters alpha=0.05, beta=0.20, p0=0.75, p1=0.94.
