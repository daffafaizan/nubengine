      patients, some patients with extensive metastatic disease, including visceral or bone
      involvement beyond axial skeleton, have shorter survival. Based on the recent randomized
      trials (CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15 and STAMPEDE), hormone-naïve men with metastatic, high-volume
      PC should be offered docetaxel plus ADT. However, side effects from standard 3-weekly 75
      mg/m2 docetaxel can be substantial. In addition, a prospective trial is needed to determine
      whether early docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with ADT is beneficial in Korean men.
      Considering our own experiences with docetaxel, a dose intensity of 20 mg/m2/week (equivalent
      to 60 mg/m2 3-weekly or 40 mg/m2 biweekly) should be tested in the prospective trial.
