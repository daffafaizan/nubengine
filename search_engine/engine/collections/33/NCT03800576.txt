      pharmacokinetics and gene polymorphism. However, previous studies on the correlation between
      genetic factors and clinical outcome were controversial. Furthermore, most studies focused on
      single genetic polymorphism and clinical outcome, and very limited studies took multiple
      genetic factors and clinical factors into account.

      This is a retrospective study. Eligible patients were those who had signed informed consent
      for genetic study in previous research projects ( IRB approval numberï¼š201512005RINC and
      201612023RIND ). The present study will collect laboratory data, concurrent medications, and
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data. Patient survival, graft survival, acute rejection and
      tacrolimus-associated adverse events will be assessed.
