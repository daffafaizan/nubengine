      weeks. After a one-week open-label phase during which all patients will receive CK-2017357
      125 milligrams (mg) twice daily, patients who tolerate the open-label 125 mg of CK-2017357
      will be randomized one to one (fifty-fifty) to receive double-blind CK-2017357 or matching
      placebo. The CK-2017357/placebo dose will be increased no faster than weekly to each
      patient's highest tolerated daily dose, with a maximum of 250 mg twice daily. The dose may be
      decreased based on tolerability. Patients will continue treatment at the highest tolerated
      dose to complete a total of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients may be on riluzole
      or not on riluzole at study entry. Patients not on riluzole must stay off riluzole. Patients
      on riluzole who are getting double-blind CK-2017357 will be given riluzole at half the
      labeled dosage (50 mg once a day instead of 50 mg twice a day). Blood tests for safety will
      be performed. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.
