      after hematopoietic precursor cell transplantation (HPCT). Study consisted of up to 28 days
      of screening period, 16 weeks treatment period that can be extended to 45 weeks, 36 weeks
      follow up, and end of study visit (EOS) at week 52. Duration of follow up depended on
      duration of treatment. Patients who are treated for more than 41 weeks will proceed directly
      to EOS visit.

      Approximately 40 patients was to be randomized to receive SoC or LFG316 plus SoC. Patients
      was included in the study if they have diagnosis of TAM and poor prognostic markers.

      Patients showing worsening of disease after two weeks of treatment or showing no response at
      week 4 or any time after will be considered failures and can be switched to receive the
      alternative treatment (SoC or LFG316). Patients can only switch treatment arms once.
