      infertility. Fertility services have been reported to cost Â£325M annually in the UK(4) (REF).
      Testosterone deficiency is one of the most common hormonal problems affecting men, leading to
      osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity and depression(5).

      Concerns have been raised about the potential effects of COVID-19 on male reproductive
      dysfunction (male infertility and testosterone deficiency). A recent study has suggested that
      COVID-19 may enter human cells by binding to receptors (special gates on cells that recognise
      a specific molecule) for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(6) . ACE2 receptors are found
      at very high levels in the testes. Within the testes, ACE2 is found on developing sperm, the
      'nurse cells' that help the sperm grow (Sertoli cells), and also on Leydig cells which are
      needed to make the male sex hormone testosterone. In summary, this evidence suggests that
      there is a plausible link why COVID-19 would cause male infertility and testosterone
      deficiency.

      All fertility treatment in the UK is regulated by the Human Fertility and Embryology
      Authority (HFEA). The HFEA has prohibited on all non-cancer fertility treatment in the UK
      between April 15th and May 12th 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to rapidly
      screen and report whether COVID-19 has any obvious effects in causing male infertility and
      testosterone deficiency. It must be noted that a recent study(1) reported that COVID-19 is
      not spread by human semen and therefore, semen processing should not risk staff to COVID-19
      infection.
