    
      Patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer
      and who are refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists will first
      receive a one-hour infusion of a defined dose of GLPG0187. If well tolerated, one week later
      a three-week continuous infusion is started. If according to the investigator a subject has a
      clinical benefit from treatment with GLPG0187, the treatment cycle may be repeated until
      disease progression, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), or the patient chooses to stop or
      cannot/will not comply with study procedures.

      Throughout treatment, safety and tolerability will be monitored. Within one patient, a fixed
      dose (infusion rate) will be used. If at a given dose-level sufficient patients have been
      treated without reaching DLT, the dose for the next group of patients will be increased. This
      can be repeated until DLT is established, or the scheduled maximum dosage is reached.
