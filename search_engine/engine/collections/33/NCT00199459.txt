      approximately half of these patients will have another episode within ten years. Currently,
      patients undergo metabolic testing (serum and 24 hour urine tests) to identify modifiable
      risk factors; however, no modifiable risk factors are identified in many patients, yet they
      continue to form stones. New techniques must be developed to identify stone patients at risk
      for future recurrences and ultimately to develop more specific prevention strategies.

      Urinary protein levels are not routinely measured in stone patients while there is strong
      evidence that proteins play a role in the etiology of stones. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the urinary and serum proteins of stone formers compared to healthy subjects
      utilizing the high throughput method, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization (SELDI).
      We hypothesize that there is a unique set of proteins expressed in serum and urine in stone
      patients that can be detected by SELDI. Once a protein is identified as a biomarker, a
      specific assay similar to a quick and affordable dipstick test may be developed to identify
      those stone patients at risk of future stones. Ultimately, this will better our understanding
      of stone disease and help develop new prevention strategies.

      Comparisons: protein profiles (serum/urine) of stone patients both during the presence of a
      stone and 6 weeks after they have passed it. comparison of stone profiles of stone patients
      with controls (non-forming stone patients).
