    
      Primary Objective •To assess the efficacy of grazoprevir 100mg and elbasvir 50mg by
      determining the proportion of sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of
      therapy (SVR12; HCV RNA concentration less than 10 IU/ mL at follow-up week 12) in
      peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin experienced patients with genotype 1 HCV and HIV
      co-infection, compared with treatment-naïve patients with 1 HCV and HIV co-infection.
