      intervention designed to enhance treatment use and smoking abstinence in Veterans who are
      initially unwilling to quit. Enhanced Chronic Care provides ongoing motivational
      interventions and interpersonal support designed to promote readiness to quit smoking.
      Enhanced Chronic Care will be compared with Standard Care (brief advice to quit once per
      year) on criteria that are of great clinical and public health importance: smoking treatment
      reach (use of cessation treatment) and abstinence. It is expected that Enhanced Chronic Care
      will increase treatment use and smoking abstinence relative to Standard Care.

      The investigators will evaluate these interventions using a 2-arm randomized controlled
      trial. Veterans who smoke daily, but who are not willing to enter smoking cessation
      treatment, will be eligible to participate, with no obligation to quit smoking. Participants
      (N=500) will be randomized to one of the following treatments: 1) Enhanced Chronic Care
      (n=250) or 2) Standard Care (n=250). These intervention conditions will last 2 years to
      permit analysis of their cumulative impact on abstinence and treatment use
