      discriminative in healthy subjects than in rhinitis patients as there are no interferences by
      varying rhinitis symptoms and respective differences in the status of the nasal mucosa
      regarding the 3 study periods.

      The time schedule for serum sampling (pre-dose and 8, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 1¼, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 12, and 24 h p.a., time refer to the end of the second spray into the second nostril of
      each administration) is derived from previous bioavailability studies assuming a mean tmax of
      1 h p.a. [P5] and a mean t1/2 of 3 h [L9]. Sampling times are expected to cover an AUC0-tlast
      above 80% of the total AUC of fluticasone propionate (bioanalytical detection method with a
      LLOQ of 0.5 pg/mL).
