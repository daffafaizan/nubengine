      recruited via high-volume HCM and LQTS sites, patient-groups, and websites. Information about
      exercise participation will be acquired via interview and online instruments at enrollment
      and every six months for three years. Quality of Life questionnaires will be filled out at
      enrollment and at the end of the study. Participants will receive a Fitbit (pedometer) and
      will wear it initially for two weeks and then one week every three months. The Fitbit is used
      for assessment of exercise level only. Clinical records will be obtained from treating
      physicians. Participants will also be asked to call the central site if they experience
      syncope, appropriate ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) shock, or resuscitated
      arrest. Information regarding the patient's activity at the time of event will then be
      obtained by phone interview. Follow-up clinical records will be obtained as indicated to
      corroborate endpoints.

      The Ancillary study is optional. This will include all of the baseline questionnaires,as well
      as selected questions from the Epi-Pandemic Impacts Inventory.
