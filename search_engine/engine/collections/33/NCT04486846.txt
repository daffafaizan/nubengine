      effort with shared leadership between patient and oncologist. Peer-to-peer electronic
      communications can improve the collaboration between oncologist and primary care provider
      (PCP) as patients transition back to primary care as their primary health provider. The
      investigators propose to test a patient-centered eHealth surveillance program utilizing novel
      asynchronous telehealth tools to provide patient-reported outcome symptom monitoring using
      the electronic medical record's patient portal (eVisit).
