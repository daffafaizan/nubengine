      mobile assessments (CICADAS app) that will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities
      and associated cognitive deficits. We will leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS app to
      function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS (Program for the Education and
      Enrichment of Relationship Skills); 3) an enhancer for PEERS. This study will test CICADAS
      app in adolescents with ASD in a three-arm, active-controlled randomized crossover trial to
      document the acceptability and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer
      for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS.
