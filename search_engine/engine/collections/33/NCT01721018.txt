      label. Patients with inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma will receive a single dose of
      HSV1716 by intrapleural administration. Delivery will be by direct administration via an
      indwelling catheter into the pleural cavity. PART B is a single centre, repeat dose design,
      open label. Two groups of three patients with inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma will
      receive 2 (group 1) or 4 (group 2) single doses of HSV1716 at weekly intervals.
      Administration will be via an indwelling catheter into the pleural cavity.
