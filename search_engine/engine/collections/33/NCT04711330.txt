      (throat swabs and stool) to identify patients who will relapse during durvalumab treatment
      after CRT (False negative Rate) at 6 months.

      Collection of stool and throat swipe before start of durvalumab treatment; sampling of blood
      and exhaled air for analysis of volatile organic compounds.

      Improved clinical outcomes after adjuvant treatment with durvalumab following concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced NSCLC (PACIFIC trial), led to the rapid
      adoption of this treatment strategy as standard of care. However, despite the improved
      progression free survival and overall survival, recurrence rate remains high. Approximately
      45% of patients will relapse within 1 year, despite adjuvant durvalumab therapy. To date no
      performant biomarker predicting treatment response or failure nor toxicity exists and the
      number of prospective studies addressing this issue is limited. Both PD-L1 TPS and TMB should
      be considered 'enriching' parameters improving response-chances, but they are far from an
      ideal biomarker. Non-invasive biomarkers are essential in the future for better patient
      selection and therapy allocation. One of the potential non-invasive biomarkers of interest is
      the microbiome.
