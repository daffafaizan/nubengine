      procedure to treat morbidly obese patients. The main concern of LSG lies in the long-term
      weight regain which is reported to happen in up to 75.6% of patients after 6 years. The
      investigators report the overall experience with Laparoscopic Banded Sleeve Gastrectomy
      (LBSG) using the Minimizer over a six-year period.

      Methods. The investigators performed a retrospective review of data from a prospectively
      collected database. All patients submitted to primary LBSG were examined. Patients were
      submitted to LBSG between February 2014 and January 2020. Collected data included demographic
      factors, pre-operative weight, pre-operative BMI, operative time, surgical complications, and
      clinical outcomes in terms of short and mid-term weight loss.
