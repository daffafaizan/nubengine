      tract is altered. The satiety level often increases, which is probably caused by gut
      hormones. Patients response on different bariatric procedures varies widely and it is
      difficult to predict which patient responds well. Possibly, patients who have successful
      excess weight loss (EWL) two years after surgery have different gastric emptying rates
      compared to unsuccessful patients.

      Changes in gut hormones after implantation of a duodenal-jejunal bypass liner were
      demonstrated in other studies. However, gastric emptying before and after placement of this
      liner is unknown.
