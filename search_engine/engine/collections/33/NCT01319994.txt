      parameters in patients with long-term high dose GCs.

      3 Study Design 3.1 General Design We will recruit patients (18-75y) requiring glucocorticoid
      treatment for various inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell
      arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatic, asthma, sarcoidosis) into a pilot, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. These patients will be treated with metformin to prevent or reverse
      their metabolic complications. Prevention algorithm: Patients who are about to start GC
      treatment predictably for ≥12w at a ≥10mg/d prednisolone (or equivalent) dose who consent to
      participate in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo (20
      patients/group, see power calculations) or metformin at the maximum tolerated dose with a
      minimum of 850 mg bd for 12w. Treatment algorithm: Consenting patients already on long-term
      GC treatment (≥4w, ≥20mg/d prednisolone or equivalent) who are expected to continue for at
      least 12w at ≥10mg/d prednisolone will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or
      metformin for 12w. In both algorithms, metformin treatment will be started gradually (as
      standard practice) to avoid gastrointestinal side effects and the full dose will be reached
      by day 10. Patients will have a full clinical assessment before the start of the metformin
      treatment and at the end of the 12w treatment period. Anthropometric and biochemical
      parameters and questionnaires will be repeated at 4 and 8 weeks.
