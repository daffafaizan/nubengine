      improving assessment techniques is a cornerstone of this research program.

      This research project will elucidate the regulation of specific physiological mechanisms
      related to pain in children reporting presence of chronic MSK pain. As molecular events of
      pathophysiological processes are quantifiable, the investigators will test for associations
      between the expression of pain-related molecular markers in blood and the patient's
      experience of pain assessed with semi-objective sensory testing. The identification of
      specific alterations in the nociceptive process will provide a deeper understanding of a
      patient's pain perception alongside self-report or observers' report subjective measurements.
      Pain experience variability may originate in the lack of rigor in the clinical pain
      assessment tools. A personalized mechanism-based approach may be the key to better identify a
      patient's pain outcome and how this assessment could lead to personalized pain management. By
      testing temporal summation (TS), conditioned pain modulation (CPM), electroencephalography
      (EEG) patterns and balance in relation to biomarkers, the investigators will be able to
      determine the phenotype of the patients who presents higher risk of central sensitization
      related to increased hyperactivity and decreased endogenous inhibition. The ultimate goal is
      to use this information to offer the highest quality of pain control in children with MSK
      conditions.
