      patients treated for the rectal cancer. Patients are commonly treated with surgery preceded
      or followed by chemo radiotherapy. Patients chart review and questionnaires administered
      during follow-up exam or by mailing will be use to compile data comparing the HRQOL of the
      two study groups(Preoperative versus Post operative chemotherapy).

      Our Radiation Oncologist will also informed all the new pts. under going radiotherapy
      regarding this study and will encourage them in become part of our study population. The
      prospective study will help us in increasing the number of participants and also it give us
      an opportunity following the patients as they go through their treatment.

      Through the use of department databases, a cohort or rectal cancer patients treated at
      Stanford will be identified. Patients demographics, treatment received ,disease outcomes, and
      treatment associated complications will be compiled from available data. HRQOL questionnaires
      will be answered through a mailing or during clinic visits. Treatment outcomes, toxicities
      and overall quality of life of preoperative and postoperative chemo radiotherapy treatment
      group will be compared in relation to the lesion location.
