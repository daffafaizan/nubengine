      in 24 patients with cystic fibrosis. Twenty subjects will be stratified in a 1:2 ratio based
      on baseline FEV1 into mild (> 70%) or moderate (40-70%) pulmonary disease in order to control
      for disease severity within each dose level. The subjects will be randomized in blocks of
      four to receive no drug, 40mg, 100mg, or 200mg daily for 28 days.

      Sputum samples will be obtained in all groups by induction with hypertonic saline at
      baseline, 8, 24, and 48 hours following the first dose and then weekly for 4 weeks. Sputum
      will also be collected at two follow up visits after the treatment period at weeks 5 and 6.

      In the doxycycline group, serial blood samples (5 mL) for determination of doxycycline
      concentrations will be obtained before and at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours following
      the 1-hr infusion of a single IV dose. Once daily dosing of doxycycline will resume
      immediately following the 48-hour blood sample and will continue until day 28. Additional
      levels will be obtained pre-dose, and 1, 2, and 3 hours after doses administered on days 14
      and 28. A sample of blood will be obtained at baseline, and at days 28 for inflammatory
      marker analyses.
