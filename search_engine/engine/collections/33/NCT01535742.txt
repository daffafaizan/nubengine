      children with normal airway anatomy, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of fiberoptic
      tracheal intubation through these two devices. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of
      laryngeal view, time to tracheal intubation, time for device removal after intubation, and
      peri-operative complications will also be assessed.
