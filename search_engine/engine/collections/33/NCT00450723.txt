        -  Determine the occurrence rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes in patients with
           medially or centrally located stage I or II breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety, feasibility, and success rate of thorascopic internal mammary
           sentinel lymph node biopsy in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of metastatic disease in internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes
           obtained thoracoscopically in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard axillary sentinel lymph node dissection during surgery
      (i.e., lumpectomy or mastectomy). Patients receive a radioactive tracer (i.e., technetium Tc
      99m sulfur colloid) and isosulfan blue by peritumoral injection for identification of the
      axillary and internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes (IMSLN). Identified axillary sentinel
      lymph nodes are dissected. Identified IMSLNs are removed through the lumpectomy/mastectomy
      incision, if accessible. If they are not accessible, patients undergo thorascopic IMSLN
      biopsy to remove the nodes.

      All removed sentinel lymph nodes (axillary or internal mammary) are examined for gross and
      microscopic carcinoma for future therapy planning.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
