      immune response to influenza vaccine in elderly and the effect on respiratory symptoms
      related to respiratory infections.

      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, multicenter trial was performed. The study
      was started on October 2015 and ended on April 2016. The recruitment of volunteers was
      carried out in five nursing home of Granada (Spain) at the beginning of the vaccination
      program.

      Volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in the placebo group daily
      consumed a capsule containing 300 mg of maltodextrin. Those in the probiotic group daily
      consumed a capsule containing 3x10(9) colon-forming units of the strain Lc K8 in a matrix of
      maltodextrin.

      From two weeks previous to the beginning of the intervention the consumption of any probiotic
      supplement was restricted until the end of the study. During two weeks before flu vaccination
      volunteers daily received a capsule of probiotic or placebo. Day 15 of the study all
      volunteers received intramuscular vaccination against flu (inactivated trivalent influenza:
      A/California/7/22009[H1N1]pdm09, A/HongKong/4801/2014[H3N2], B/Brisbane/60/2002) for the
      vaccine campaign of 2015/2016 (Sanofi Pasteur Europe, Lyon, France). All volunteers were
      vaccinated during the same week (second week of November 2015). After vaccination volunteer
      were followed-up until 31 of April 2016.
