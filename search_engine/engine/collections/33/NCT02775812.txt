    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination of MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) and standard, adjuvant cisplatin-radiotherapy in patients with high-risk,
      human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), based upon
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local-regional
      failure (LRF), and rate of distant metastases following treatment with adjuvant
      cisplatin-radiotherapy and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      II. To describe the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin-radiotherapy and MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version
      (v.) 4, including immune-related adverse events (AEs).

      III. To describe the relationship between baseline programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      expression 1-year disease-free survival (DFS).

      IV. To describe baseline immune-inflammatory biomarkers in both tumor and tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs), and correlate them with 1-year DFS.

      V. To describe baseline and change in expression of peripheral immune-inflammatory
      biomarkers, including a panel of candidate tumor antigen (TA)-specific memory T cells, and
      correlate with 1-year DFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours once weekly for weeks 1-6 and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in weeks 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. Patients also
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in weeks 1-6. Patients may also receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes in weeks 3, 6, 24, and 27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,
      24, 30, and 36.
