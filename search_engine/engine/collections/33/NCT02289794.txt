      prevention of E.coli-infections. Cystitis is the most common UTI, however kidney infections
      or bacteremia are possible. The E. coli bacterium is responsible for 85 % of all UTIs.

      The objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and ability to elicit an immune
      response of the candidate vaccine as well as the effectiveness of the vaccine in the
      reduction in UTIs .
