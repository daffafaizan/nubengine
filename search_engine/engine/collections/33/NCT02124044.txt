      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients, liver disease due
      to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and
      pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently
      recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV
      alone in HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high incidence of
      adverse events (AEs), discontinuations and poor cure rates in several populations. Within the
      HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated given drug interactions
      between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors, in addition to the extensive
      side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a
      combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV, without
      additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may
      additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected, a population which has historically
      been difficult to cure.

      This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two regimens
      for the treatment of HCV, asunaprevir (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily
      (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors respectively) in 10 HIV/HCV genotype 1b co-infected
      treatment-naive and treatment experienced individuals and DCV + ASV + BMS-791325 administered
      as a fixed dose combination (FDC) pill in 20 HIV/HCV GT 1a or 1b coinfected treatment-naive
      and treatment experienced individuals.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses
      and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
