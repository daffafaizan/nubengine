      and its bioactive compound astaxanthin has a causal impact on preventing inflammation by
      promoting human gut microbiome homeostasis. Findings from this study will provide new
      insights into maintenance of gut microbiome and will inform effective dietary recommendations
      and interventions, thereby reducing inflammation-associated diseases in humans.

      Aim: Evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of astaxanthin-enriched salmon via
      re-balancing of human gut microbiome in obese prediabetic human subjects.

      We will use a randomized, double-blind, crossover feeding study with 15 obese prediabetic
      males and 15 obese prediabetic females (n=30) . Participants will consume two servings (3 oz
      per serving) of wild salmon (intervention 1) and farmed salmon (intervention 2) daily in
      random orders. Each intervention is 4 weeks long and the washout duration between the two
      interventions is 5 weeks. Primary outcomes will be determined by measuring the inflammatory
      response and gut microbiota composition.
