      The management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) in Switzerland has not been
      assessed on a national level to date. The investigators united all comprehensive
      neurovascular care centres in Switzerland to create a registry for aSAH. This registry helps
      collect clinical and management data from different centres and pools it in one common
      database. It may provide referring caregivers and healthcare providers with a critical tool
      to assess the quality of care in a disease which has a high socio-economic burden. Moreover,
      it may serve as a tool to foster scientific collaboration and address a number of remaining
      questions about the management of aSAH in the future. Regarding SAH, data from the federal
      statistics bureau of Switzerland are based strictly on ICD-10 codes provided by hospitals and
      show an estimate of 13 per 100,000 in a population of roughly 8 million
      (http://bfs.admin.ch). These numbers, however, are not referring to aneurismal SAH
      exclusively and thus exceed the numbers which the investigators expect to obtain. The goal is
      to obtain complete recruitment of SAH patients throughout Switzerland, and the goal is
      therefore that assessment of incidence will be performed later on.

      Data management:

      Data is entered into a central online database created by the Secutrial platform. This
      platform is provided by the University Hospital of Geneva's Clinical Research Unit. The
      database disposes of an audit-trail capacity. Local principal investigators are responsible
      for data-cross check and quality management. Source data verification is performed by
      investigators on site who address missing data. Regular meetings are held to discuss data
      patency.

      The platform automatically provides a report on recruitment progress.
