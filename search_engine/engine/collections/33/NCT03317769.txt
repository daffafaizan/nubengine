    
      The goal of this study is to employ an innovative and evidence-based mobile intervention that
      includes a neuroscience-informed computerized social cognition training program, a Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant videoconferencing tool that we will
      use for psychoeducational group therapy, and peer-to-peer secure social networking for
      individuals with schizophrenia, in a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial to assess feasibility and initial efficacy, to investigate the intervention's
      effects on symptoms, social cognition, and quality of life, and to prepare for a large-scale
      efficacy trial in adults with schizophrenia.
