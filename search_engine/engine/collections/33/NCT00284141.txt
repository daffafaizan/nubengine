        -  A screening phase up to 21 days followed by registration

        -  Treatment initiation within 5 working days of registration

        -  A treatment phase with 14-day study treatment cycles until a study withdrawal criterion
           was met or up to the clinical database cut-off date (18 July 2008)

        -  A follow-up phase - up to 60 days after end of treatment

      Withdrawal criteria that led to treatment discontinuation were:

        -  The participant or their legally authorized representative requested to withdraw

        -  In the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be detrimental to the
           participant's well being, due to reasons such as disease progression, unacceptable
           toxicity, noncompliance, or logistical considerations.

        -  A specific request by the Sponsor

        -  Participant had intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study
           treatment

        -  Participant had more than 2 aflibercept dose reductions

        -  Participant had arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents,
           myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of
           pre-existing angina

        -  Participant had radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (e.g., dilated loops of
           bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., presence
           of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention

        -  Participant was lost to follow-up

      After discontinuing treatment, participants remained on the study until the last
      post-treatment visit or until recovery of drug related toxicities, whichever was later.
