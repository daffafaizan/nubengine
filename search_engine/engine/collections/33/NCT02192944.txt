      evaluations chloroquine and piperaquine in healthy subjects i.e. Study A and Study B.

      Study A: Phase 1, Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of
      Orally Administered Primaquine and Chloroquine in Healthy Thai Adult Subjects

      Study B: Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally
      Administered Primaquine and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine in Healthy Adult Subjects

      Four subjects were in both studies. The investigator proposes to extend the previous subject
      study to recruit 16 subjects including but not limited to those who have received either
      chloroquine from study A or piperaquine form study B in our previous studies so that 20
      subjects received both drugs for a crossover comparison.

      Subjects who were previously enrolled into study A that received a single dose of 600 mg
      chloroquine base will receive a single dose of piperaquine phosphate (in form of 120/960 mg
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) in this study. The subjects who were previously enrolled into
      study B that received a single dose of piperaquine phosphate (in form of 120/960 mg
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) will receive a single dose of 600 mg of chloroquine base in
      this study.

      The investigator team may recruit naive subject in case, the team can't reach total number of
      20 subjects.

      The total duration for each subject's participation in the study is approximately 3 weeks for
      subject who challenges only one study drug or 11 weeks for subject who challenges both drugs.
