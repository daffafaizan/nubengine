      are certain viral infections and possibly some dietary factors. Among the latter cow's milk
      proteins are of special interest. They have been shown to be involved in the pancreatic
      beta-cell lesion in animal experiments. In humans there are some indications of a role of
      early exposure to cow's milk proteins as a risk factor for later type 1 diabetes. The
      hypothesis has not been confirmed, but a randomized, controlled double-blinded intervention
      trial should provide a definite answer.

      This study aims at assessing whether one can decrease the future incidence of beta-cell
      autoimmunity and/or type 1 diabetes in children who have an increased genetic risk for the
      disease, by administering in infancy after breast feeding until the age of 6-8 months such a
      formula, in which the cow's milk proteins have been hydrolyzed to smaller peptides. The
      children in the control group, carrying a similar increased genetic risk, will receive a
      conventional cow's milk based formula .

      This project is a pilot multicenter trial comprising 15 hospitals in Finland.
