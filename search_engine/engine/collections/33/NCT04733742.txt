      to intravenous alteplase bridging with endovascular treatment in terms of achieving 90-day
      functional independence for stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion.
      The EXTEND-IA TNK part 1 and part 2 demonstrated that intravenous thrombolysis with
      tenecteplase is superior to alteplase before endovascular treatment. However, it is unclear
      whether intravenous tenecteplase bridging with endovascular treatment is superior to
      endovascular treatment alone. The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether intravenous
      tenecteplase bridging with endovascular treatment is better than endovascular treatment alone
      for stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who are
      thrombolysis-eligible within 4.5 hours of onset.
