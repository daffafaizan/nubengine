      specifically atrial fibrillation in humans. Maestro will be used to measure heart rate and
      rhythm at the same time that patients are being monitored with a standard 3, 5, or 12 lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in a clinical setting. The recorded Maestro results will be compared
      to the ECG results to assess Maestro's accuracy.

      Data will be analyzed by a pass/fail criterial. The data will be downloaded and printed for
      the investigators' interpretation who will first review and code the data from Meastro,
      blinded to the ECG findings. Then the investigators will interpret the ECG findings and the 2
      sets of data will be compared. The ECG result is the true value with which to compare the
      Maestro result.
