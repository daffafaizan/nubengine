      in Colorado that are charged with providing comprehensive care for children and adults
      insured by Medicaid. With a new RCCO-public health collaborative we will implement a
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of 1) evidence-based collaborative
      centralized method of increasing immunization delivery using reminder/recall techniques
      versus 2) traditional practice-based reminder/recall techniques that are done by individual
      practices (not centrally) or usual care from their provider. These interventions have been
      previously developed by the study team in different clinical settings. The project will
      examine the collaborative centralized approach, implemented within the new RCCO-public health
      collaborative first among preschool children, the group in which it has been previously
      studied. We will then extend the method to new populations, including adolescents and adults
      within the RCCO and Denver Health (adults only), and will evaluate the effectiveness of the
      intervention in each population.
