      otherwise healthy young women. It is the cause of significant disability and an impairment in
      quality of life of a magnitude comparable to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease or congestive heart failure. It is characterized by sympathetic activation with an
      exaggerated orthostatic tachycardia that responds to low doses of beta-blockers. The
      underlying pathophysiology of this disorder and the nature of this sympathetic activation is
      not clear and is likely heterogeneous. In many patients this sympathetic activation could be
      an appropriate compensatory response to hypovolemia, deconditioning or partial neuropathy.

      The investigators have identified a subset of patients in whom sympathetic activation appears
      to be a primary phenomenon. These patients are characterized by high central sympathetic
      outflow, as determined by muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) above the upper 95%
      confidence interval for the group. This "hyperadrenergic" phenotype is associated with a
      paradoxical increase in blood pressure on standing and exaggerated pressor response to the
      vasoconstrictive phase of the Valsalva maneuver, and clinical observations suggest they
      improve clinically when treated with central sympatholytics.

      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that there is a subset of POTS patients with
      a central sympathetic activation as the primary pathophysiology. In an acute double blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized study, the investigators propose that administration of the
      central sympatholytic moxonidine will improve orthostatic symptoms and abnormalities in
      orthostatic hemodynamics, as well as sympathetic outflow.
