        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide in children with newly diagnosed
           malignant glioma or recurrent CNS or other solid tumors.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the activity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of temozolomide.

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) or IV beginning on day -5 and
      continuing through at least day 3. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected on days
      0, 2, and 4. Patients then receive oral temozolomide daily for 5 consecutive days. PBSC
      collections are reinfused 1 day after the last dose of temozolomide. Patients also receive
      G-CSF beginning at the time of transplant and continuing until blood counts recover.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1-3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
