      the quantity and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in solid tumor patients
      as identified by a various laboratory techniques and analyses. The investigators are
      developing this resource to provide data to achieve the following objectives: 1) correlate
      CTCs with known prognostic factors, 2) correlate CTCs with burden of disease, 3) evaluate the
      ability of CTCs to be used in the surveillance of disease recurrence, and 4) evaluate CTCs
      ability to be used as a biomarker for treatment response.
