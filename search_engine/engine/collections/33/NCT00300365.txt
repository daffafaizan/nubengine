    
      This is a two-arm, parallel, double-blind randomized prospective clinical trial. The subjects
      will be asked to provide informed consent, and then undergo screening for enrollment criteria
      at the first visit (-5 weeks). The subjects who are eligible, and provide informed consent
      will return for Visit 2 baseline data (-4 weeks), and then begin the unblinded niacin-ER
      titration. Specifically, subjects will receive a starting dose of niacin-ER of 500 mg per
      day, which will be increased in 500 mg increments every week up to a dose of 2000 mg per day.
      Subjects will need to tolerate at least 1500 mg per day of niacin-ER in order to remain in
      the study and be randomized. Thus subjects who are unable to tolerate the 2000 mg daily dose
      of niacin-ER will be taken back to 1500 mg per day for one week and then randomized. Subjects
      who develop prohibitive side effects at doses less than 1500 mg per day will be discontinued
      from the study. All subjects who are able to take the target dose of niacin-ER will continue
      that dose of niacin-ER and come to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) to be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either niacin-ER plus pioglitazone or niacin-ER plus matching
      placebo for 12 weeks. Pioglitazone will be started at 30 mg and then increased to 45 mg at
      week 6. This entry design is designed to minimize the differences in mean dose of niacin-ER
      and dropout rate between study groups.
