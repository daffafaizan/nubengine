    
      This is a cross sectional study to examine the relationship between serum calcium and PTHrP
      and serum PSA in men referred for prostate biopsy at Wake Forest University. Men scheduled
      for biopsy will be approached by the study nurse who will explain the study and invite the
      men to participate. After the patients provide written consent, she/he will obtain the
      following information from the patient chart: age, race (self-report, white, black, other),
      height, weight (for determination of Body Mass Index, a variable reported to influence PSA).
      Blood draw for study analytes will be coordinated with routine blood draw for PSA testing to
      minimize the need for an additional needle stick. A copy of the informed consent is given to
      the patient and the original is placed in a file for the P.I.

      The biopsy status of men at the time they are invited to participate is unknown. Men are
      "sorted" into cancer and non-cancer groups only after their biopsies are read. Serum samples
      are sent to the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Wake Forest. All assays are performed
      "in house". Based on consultation with our urologists, we anticipate that approximately 30%
      of the biopsies will be positive (i.e., prostate cancer). The majority (approximately 70%)
      will be negative (benign). Approximately 1-2% of the biopsies may be classified as
      "indeterminate". Because there will not be a sufficient number of "indeterminate" pathologies
      to be treated as a separate category, this group will not be analyzed further. However, men
      with "indeterminate" biopsies are eligible for the study if they are re-biopsied.
