      represents a new challenge for doctors and health authorities. However, patients often have
      at least two chronic diseases. These are referred to as "multimorbid" patients, whose
      continuity of care has not been well studied to date.

      This observational study evaluates the association between the continuity of care in
      multimorbid patients seen in general practice and their use of urgent healthcare, their
      quality of life and their burden of treatment.
