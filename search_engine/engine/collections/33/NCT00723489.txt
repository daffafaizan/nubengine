    
      AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections.
      The purpose of this study is to understand the immune response to a yellow fever vaccine in
      adults with AD. This study will provide substantial information about normal and defective
      cutaneous immunity in participants with AD in response to a live virus vaccine, which is
      critical for understanding the EV reaction.

      An individual's participation in the study will last up to 13 weeks. Participants will be
      randomized into one of two arms. The first experimental arm will consist of 20 adults with AD
      and 20 healthy adults. They will receive one dose of YFV-17D by subcutaneous administration
      in the right deltoid and receive one dose of YFV-17D placebo by transcutaneous administration
      in the left deltoid. The second arm will consist of 20 adults with AD and 20 healthy adults.
      They will receive one dose of YFV-17D placebo by subcutaneous administration in the right
      deltoid and receive one dose of YFV-17D vaccine transcutaneously in the left deltoid.

      This study will consist of 6 follow-up visits over a 35 day period after study entry.
