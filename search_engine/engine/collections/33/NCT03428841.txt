      in obstetric patients with accidental dural puncture with epidural needle. Long term follow
      up of these complications has been unknown. The incidence of both auditory and visual
      complications is likely to be high in patients getting accidental dural puncture with 17G
      Touhy epidural needle as compared to small gauge spinal needles. Several case reports have
      been reported with such temporary and permanent hearing and visual loss. A prospective study
      to understand these complications is required. The study will provide us with the true
      incidence of audiovisual complications of dural puncture with an epidural needle. Early
      intervention in cases of dural puncture may alleviate or halt symptoms.
