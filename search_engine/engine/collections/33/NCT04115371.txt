      significant risks including the development of delirium, falls, and nosocomial infections.
      The Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program at Northwestern Memorial
      Hospital attempts to identify and address health related risks for older adults without
      exposing them to the risks of hospitalization,. GEDI is a unique program consisting of a
      multidisciplinary team of Transitional Care Nurses (TCN), social workers, pharmacists,
      occupational therapists and physical therapists who perform ED-based geriatric assessment and
      care coordination.

      To determine the impact of GEDI on health services use and Health Related Quality-of-Life
      (HRQoL) we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing GEDI compared to usual ED
      care(which often involves hospitalization).
