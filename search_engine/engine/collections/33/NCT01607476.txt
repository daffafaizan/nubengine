      of amyloid Beta protein (AB) by secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
      While AB is thought to be toxic to neurons its role leading to AD pathogenesis, this is not
      without debate. In any case, it appears that AB forms amyloid plaques that are largely
      ubiquitous in AD. Neuronal cell death as a result of the disease is another clear
      pathophysiologic finding. Because of the importance of these findings in the development of
      AD, targeted therapies are being investigated to selectively inhibit AB production and/or
      manipulate amyloid load.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality used to noninvasively
      measure functional processes of the body. A trace amount of a radiopharmaceutical is injected
      into a patient and the radiopharmaceutical will be taken up or localized in the body as a
      function of certain biological processes. The detectors of a PET scanner then measure the
      radiopharmaceutical distribution externally and the reconstructed PET images should represent
      the true distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the body.
