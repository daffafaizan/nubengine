      at an increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, determine if human exposure to human
      remains, blood and/or body fluids during the World Trade Center recovery activities is
      associated with increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, and to determine if referral
      to a co-located site for Hepatitis C virus care is associated with improved linkage to
      Hepatitis C virus care in the members of the World Trade Center Health Program born during
      1945 through 1965.
