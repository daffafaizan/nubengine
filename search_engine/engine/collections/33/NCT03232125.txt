      to changes in ventricular re-polarization. This in turn can result in changes of heart
      rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. Ramosetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine three receptor
      antagonist and widely used anti-emetics. However, QTc interval prolongation has been observed
      in a number of patients after administration of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of ramosetron on QTc interval and possible cardiovascular
      adverse effects during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with steep Trendelenburg
      position. Fifty-six patients, aged more than 19 years, undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic
      prostatectomy will be divided into ramosetron group (n=28) and control group (n=28). Randomly
      selected patients of the ramoseton group are given a 0.3 mg of ramosetron after induction. In
      contrast, patients in the control group are given the same volume of normal saline after
      induction and given a 0.3 mg of ramosetron after measurement of QTc interval. The primary
      endpoint is the difference in maximal change of QTc interval between groups.
