    
      Metastatic or locally advanced well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma were treated with
      5Fluorouracil protracted intravenous infusion (200 mg/m2 daily) plus Octreotide LAR (20 mg
      monthly).

      Primary Endpoint: the response to treatment, evaluated according to the RECIST criteria.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  toxicity, graded according to the NCI-CTG criteria;

        -  symptomatic response: evaluated according to the changes in both the frequency and
           intensity of symptoms;

        -  biochemical response: evaluated considering the changes in the tumor marker levels
           (circulating Chromogranin A);

        -  time to progression and survival: were measured from the date of treatment start to the
           date of progression and the date of last follow-up or death, respectively.
