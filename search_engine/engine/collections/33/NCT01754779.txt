      citric acid or potassium citrate can reduce calcium phosphate saturation in urine of CaP
      stone formers. The first study will be conducted in hypocitraturic CaP stone formers without
      hypercalciuria, and will compare the effects of potassium citrate, citric acid and placebo.

      The second study will be conducted in hypercalciuric CaP stone formers on a thiazide diuretic
      who require potassium supplementation, and will compare the effects of potassium chloride
      alone, potassium chloride + citric acid, and potassium citrate alone. Physicochemical assays
      will be applied in addition to computer-based stone risk prediction programs to assess risk
      of stone recurrence.
