    
      A total of 30 ITP patients will be enrolled in the study. These patients should fail to have
      sustained response to multiple first- and second-line treatments of ITP and agree to have
      splenectomy. Before splenectomy, these patients will be reassessed and still diagnosed with
      ITP.Their platelet level will be raised to a safe state before surgery, and the laparoscopic
      splenectomy will be performed in Tianjin People's Hospital. The investigators plan to take
      20ml of peripheral blood (PB) of these patients at 6 time points, including 1 day before
      surgery, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery, and take a small
      amount of spleen tissue during surgery.

      18 age- and gender- matched healthy donor will also be enrolled as controls and taken 20ml of
      peripheral blood. The investigators also plan to take splenic tissue from 10 patients who
      have splenectomy due to Hereditary spherocytosis or trauma.

      And then the investigators will do the experiments step by step. 1, Isolation of peripheral
      blood and splenic mononuclear cells;2, Detection of the percentage of cell population;3,
      Activation and proliferation of B lymphocyte; 4, Activation and proliferation of T
      lymphocyte;5,Apoptosis of platelets by cytotoxic T cells;6,Phagocytosis of platelets by
      macrophages in spleen;7,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cytokines.
