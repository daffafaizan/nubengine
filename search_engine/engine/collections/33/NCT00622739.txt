      been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Their participation will last about 8 weeks (2 weeks of
      screening and 6 weeks of medication management) and enrollment will last for two years. After
      the screening period, all subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized
      to either rapid or slow dose titration of ziprasidone. Subjects in the rapid titration group
      will reach their maximum dose of study drug over 2 weeks, subjects in the slow titration
      group over 4 weeks. The study doctor may deviate from the dosing schedule if clinically
      indicated. The primary data analysis of this pilot study will examine the effect of rapid-
      versus slow-dose titration of ziprasidone on manic symptoms.
