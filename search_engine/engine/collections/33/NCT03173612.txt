      therapy, CBF-AML are stratified into two risk groups: low-risk children are defined as those
      with CR after MAE or CAG, high-risk children are those with CR after consolidation course 1
      or IAE. Non-CBF-AML patients in remission are stratified into three risk groups: low-risk
      children are defined as those with t(1；11)(q21；q23) , GATA1, NPM1/IDH1/IDH2 without
      FLT3/ITD,or an age younger than 2 years without high-risk factors; high-risk children are
      those with CR after consolidation course 1 or IAE or with abnormalities of monosomy 7, 5q- ,
      t(16;21), t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph1]), FLT3/ITD,-17/TP53, RPN1-MECOM, RUNX1-EVI1,
      MLF1-NPM1, PRDM16-RPN1, DEK-NUP214, ETV6(TEL)-HLXB9(MNX1), NUP98-NSD1; intermediate-risk
      children are those who were not in either a low-risk or high-risk group.Low-risk children
      were treated only with chemotherapy, regardless the availability of a suitable HSCT donor.
      All high-risk children were allocated to Allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      in the first remission, including unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Auto-HSCT is
      recommended for intermediate-risk children. No prophylactic cranial irradiation is included
      in the protocol. Patients are treated on an inpatient basis during each treatment phase.
