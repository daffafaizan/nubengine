      higher mortality and a higher risk for complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
      However, there are no effective clinical strategies for preventing prevalence of AKI. RIPC as
      a simple, inexpensive way of protecting tissues against ischemic damage, may also reduce
      kidney injury. That makes RIPC under the area of interests of many researches which apply
      this method to prevent AKI. Investigators conducted a single-center, double-blind trial
      involving patients at high risk of postoperative AKI, in which want to check wether RIPC
      reduce the prevalence of AKI, according Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
      definition, by increase in SCr. Furthermore researchers want to investigate a benefit from
      RIPC in reduction of level of SCr and higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 72 hours after
      off-pump coronary artery bypass as well as reduction of postoperative expression of NGAL an
      early biomarker of AKI.
