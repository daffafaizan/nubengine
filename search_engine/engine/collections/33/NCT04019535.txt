      robust clinical data supporting its routine use in the cardiac catheterization lab.
      Unfortunately, iFR is a proprietary algorithm owned by Phillips Volcano Corporation (San
      diego, California, USA) limiting the use of iFR to those centers with Volcano hardware. Whole
      cardiac cycle Pd/Pa has been another resting measure that has been evaluated and generally
      performs poorly compared to FFR. Although iFR is measured during the wave free period in
      diastole, to date there has been no assessment of diastolic Pd/Pa measurements and its
      potential correlation with the severity of coronary stenoses. Most importantly, evaluating
      the pressure differential across the entirety of diastole must by definition contain the "iFR
      value" and therefore should correlate very close with the iFR assessment. Preliminary
      unpublished data analyzing physiologic data in benchtop modeling from the VERIFY and CONTRAST
      studies suggest a very high correlation between iFR and diastolic Pd/Pa. This relationship
      strengthens when measurements are limited to 65% of diastole, hereby named the Diastolic
      hyperemia-Free Ratio (DFR). These data strongly suggest that DFR could be used as surrogate
      for iFR when iFR is not available and thus leverage the large clinical outcomes data for iFR
      in a new measure that is widely available to all standard coronary pressure wires.

      Although this preliminary data is strong, none of these measures where made prospectively in
      actual patients and the iFR was measured off simulated benchtop pressure waveform modeling.
      This study aims to perform a real-time correlation and agreement between iFR and DFR in
      patients with moderate coronary stenoses and indications for physiologic assessment.
