      greatest predictors of preterm birth is a history of prior spontaneous preterm birth.
      Presently 17 hydroxyprogesterone caproate (intramuscular) is the only FDA approved product
      for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth, however recent studies suggest that vaginal
      progesterone may be used for this purpose, and may even be superior. The American College of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology does not specify the optimal route of progesterone administration
      for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth. It is our intention to compare vaginal and
      intramuscular progesterone to see if one is superior.
