      Therefore, early detection, accurate diagnosis and staging division can effectively guide
      clinical interventions, thereby improving patient survival. Narrowband imaging under
      electronic bronchoscope (NBI) is an emerging optical image emphasis technology that can
      enhance the contrast between the mucosal surface and underlying blood vessels, specifically
      display the distribution of blood vessels, and highlight the subtle changes in mucosal
      structure. Meanwhile, it can reduce unnecessary biopsy with low risk and costs. In recent
      years, NBI technology has gradually begun to show its unique advantages in the diagnosis of
      gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and bladder cancer. The purpose of
      this study is to explore the diagnostic value of NBI under electronic bronchoscopy for early
      detection and accurate diagnosis of lung cancer, and to provide a more economical, safer and
      more efficient diagnosis option for lung cancer patients.
