      a 24-week, multicenter, multinational, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled
      study. Patients were randomized to receive a placebo or testosterone transdermal system
      throughout the study. Safety was assessed by adverse events, lipids, serum chemistry with
      hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabolism evaluation, and hematology. Physical exam
      including clinical assessments of facial hair and acne were monitored.
