    
      Sphincter of Oddi is a complex muscular structure which regulates the biliary and pancreatic
      outflow into the duodenum. Resting pressures >40mm of Hg are considered abnormal. Individuals
      with elevated resting/basal biliary or pancreatic sphincter pressures are thought to have
      sphincter of oddi dysfunction. Sphincter dysfunction often manifests as pain and the nature
      of the pain is dependent on the involvement of either the biliary or the pancreatic
      sphincter. In most instances the pain is debilitating and could impair the quality of life.
      Endoscopic therapy- either biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy, is often performed for
      relief of symptoms. Data regarding the efficacy of such an approach are limited. A recent
      systematic review by the Cochrane reviewers has found only two randomized controlled trials
      evaluating the efficacy of sphincterotomy for relief of symptoms in those with sphincter of
      Oddi dysfunction and there were no data evaluating the quality of life or the health
      economics of such an approach.
