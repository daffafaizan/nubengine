      including cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and
      ovaries. Brassicas are a good source of many nutrients, but the unique characteristic of
      Brassicas is their rich content of glucosinolates. Breakdown products of indole
      glucosinolates in Brassica vegetables show promise for reducing the risk of cancer, but have
      received comparatively less research attention than those of aliphatic glucosinolates. The
      aim of this study is to investigate plasma and urinary metabolites of indole glucosinolates
      from broccoli and to identify novel metabolites that may have roles in reducing cancer risk.
