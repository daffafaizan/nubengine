      tobacco products that contain tobacco material and several filter sections. Recent studies
      demonstrate that the vapor from Heatsticks heated by iQOS device contains 90 to 95% less
      harmful and potentially harmful compounds ("HPHCs") and is 90 to 95% less toxic than the
      smoke of a reference combustible cigarette.

      IQOS with HeatSticks may serve as less risky alternatives to combustible cigarettes and to
      other traditional tobacco products in clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants using IQOS with HeatSticks will have less prevalent presence of respiratory
      symptoms, have better functional exercise capacity, and experience less exacerbations
      compared to those who smoke combustible cigarettes by demonstrating whether the trends of the
      response variables across time is the same between the exposure and the control groups.

      This 5-years observational study includes two cohorts of participants age 40 - 59: (1)
      smokers of combustible cigarettes (CC smokers -control group) and (2) users of IQOS with
      HeatStick (exposure group). The study has baseline and periodic (annual) comprehensive
      clinical assessments, as well as continuous COPD case-finding activities and registering
      acute exacerbations of COPD.
