      based on the model of verbal or visuospatial working memory tests. Video clips that display
      the movement of two, then three, then four different fingers are shown to the subject, who
      must then reproduce them. There are nine different sub-tests: forward span and backward span
      for both hands then for each hand, i.e. six sub-tests, in addition to three sub-tests with
      concomitant interference tasks (verbal, gestural or both). Each sub-test comes to an end when
      the subject fails both attempts of the same item. The entire test takes approximately 30
      minutes.

      A questionnaire is then handed to the subject: the subject provides their full name, date of
      birth, profession, education level (number of years of study post compulsory education),
      laterality, as well as potential professional or leisure activities that might involve fine
      finger movement. They also complete the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory assessment.

      In order to correlate this new test with other validated tasks, each subject is then required
      to perform a verbal and visuospatial working memory task: the digit span test and then the
      spatial memory test, which last approximately 10 minutes.

      The entire protocol lasts approximately 45 minutes per subject. The data is then anonymized
      and processed confidentially.
