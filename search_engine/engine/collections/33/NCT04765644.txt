    
      Primary Objective: To perform a systemic analysis of how COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib
      affects vascular function and 'omic biomarkers including those associated with the
      COX-2/prostacyclin/ADMA axis in healthy male volunteers

      Secondary Objective: To investigate how this is altered by L-arginine supplementation

      Methods: A single centre, double blind, placebo controlled trial will be carried out in
      healthy male volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age. In phase 1, participants will be
      blinded and randomised to receive either Celecoxib 200mgBD for 7 days or placebo. The primary
      endpoint is endothelial function measured by EndoPAT. In Phase 2, the same participants will
      receive either Celecoxib 200mgBD for 7 days + 10g L-arginine supplementation or placebo + 10g
      L-arginine supplementation to see if L-arginine can reverse any endothelial dysfunction
      caused by Celecoxib. Secondary outcomes will include measurement of 'omic biomarkers.
