      Cancer in the first year of life is relatively rare ; however, the age of peak cancer
      incidence among children occurs during the first year of life, representing 10% of all cancer
      that was diagnosed among children younger than 15 years of age. Female and male infants have
      essentially the same overall cancer incidence rates.

      Cancer occurring in infants often has a clinical and biological behavior that is different
      from cancers occurring in older children. The histologic distribution of cancers in infants
      and that in older children are also different.

      Patients & Methods:

      From January 2001 to December 2015, retrieval & analysis of the medical records of infant
      patients, diagnosed with any of malignant tumors, at the pediatric oncology department at
      South Egypt Cancer Institute will be done. Pathologic diagnoses & age of the patients will be
      verified for the enrollment in the study. The collected data will be analyzed to delineate
      the spectrum of these disease entities, their clinico-pathologic features, associated
      patients' demographics and characteristics, treatment modalities received, and outcomes of
      these treatments.
