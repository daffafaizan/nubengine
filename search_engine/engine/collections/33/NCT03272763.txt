    
      This investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded study. Up to 45 OSA
      participants who currently use a full-face mask will be recruited.

      This study will involve a baseline (Visit One) data gathering with the participant's PAP
      therapy and their usual mask. This will be followed by the participants being fitted with the
      trial full-face mask for use in-home (Visit Two).

      The participant then will come in to return the mask (Visit Three) and give their feedback on
      their experience using the mask in home in the form of a structured interview during Visit
      Three. The maximum amount of time the participants will be exposed to the trial mask in-home
      will be 14 Â± 5 days from Visit Two.

      The mask and CPAP (if used from the research pool) will be returned to the institution at the
      conclusion of the trial and participant will return to their usual mask and therapy device
      for the treatment of their Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

      Neither the investigators nor the participants will be blinded to the study.
