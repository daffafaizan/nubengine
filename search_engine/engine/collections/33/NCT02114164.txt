      when the patient is insufflated and deflated during the surgery. As a result of the
      consistent pressure that the AirSealÂ® system maintains, CO2 will be absorbed in lower levels
      when compared to the standard of care systems in which fluctuations in intra-peritoneum
      pressure are seen. Therefore, higher pressures will result in higher levels of CO2 exchange
      in the blood, leading to increased vasodilation and lower pH levels.
