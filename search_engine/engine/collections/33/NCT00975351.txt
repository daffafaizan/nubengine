      level of folate fortification, its bioavailability must be assessed, so that risk-benefit
      analysis can be carried out. Recently, a mathematical model of folate true absorption which
      takes into account the liver first pass was devised (ref 1). In this model, the volume of
      distribution is a convenient method for describing how well a nutrient is removed from plasma
      and distributed into tissues.

      In this study, volume of distribution will be more accurately estimated using an intravenous
      dose of labelled (13C5) dose of natural folate (5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid) in healthy
      adults aged 18-65, over a wide body mass index (BMI) range.

      Healthy adults will be given an IV dose of a small amount of 13C5 5-methyltetrahydrofolic
      acid, and blood samples will be taken at regular time points via a cannula over a 2hr time
      period.

      The primary objective is to estimate the sampled plasma pool volume of distribution in order
      to quantify the fraction of any folate test dose, or folate metabolites, appearing in
      systemic plasma circulation in future studies of bioavailability.
