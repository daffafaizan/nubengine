        1. To program the NIDA CTN CDEs, the NIDA/ASAM electronic Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM),
           and a lean decision support module into Epic.

        2. To study the process of implementation of screening and referral using Epic-driven CDEs
           and CDS in three primary care clinics / practices, including defining potential barriers
           and facilitators to their adoption.

        3. To evaluate the impact of implementation on:

             -  Patient level outcomes (diagnosis, treatment referral);

             -  Medical staff level outcomes (screening and assessment, clinical interventions
                including counseling and treatment referral); and

             -  Systems level outcomes (logistics and costs of introducing the CDEs, feasibility).
