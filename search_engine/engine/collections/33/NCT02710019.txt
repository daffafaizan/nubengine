      of the risk of mental health issues associated with regular marijuana use. By playing the
      Back to Reality video games, youths may absorb knowledge about where and how to access
      community care for symptoms associated with psychosis and problematic cannabis use. The
      purpose of this study is to pilot test the use of the Back to Reality series at increasing
      awareness of the social and emotional implications of underage substance use.

      This study explores the effects of the Back to Reality video games compared to control video
      games (no content about mental health and addiction). Street involved and homeless youth
      registered with Good Shepherd services between the ages of 16 and 19 years of age will be
      recruited. The results will be assessed using quantitative questionnaires and qualitative
      interviews. The data will be statistically analyzed for significant differences in knowledge
      about the risk of psychosis linked to marijuana use among vulnerable youth. The qualitative
      interview assesses the participants understanding and views of potential emotional, social,
      and psychiatric sequelae associated with excessive marijuana use during.
