      looked at to see if it could be a treatment for advanced cancer.

      Subjects will also receive a drug called irinotecan (also called CamptosarÂ®). This drug is
      FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer and some other types of cancer. The
      study drug and irinotecan have never been tested together in humans. It is unknown if the
      combination will be safe and/or effective in the treatment of human cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research questions:

        -  What is the highest dose of the study drug that can be given to subjects in combination
           with irinotecan without causing side effects that are too severe?

        -  How is the combination of the study drug and irinotecan handled in the blood of subjects
           with advanced cancer? Does either the study drug or irinotecan have an effect on how the
           other works?

        -  What are the most common side effects of the study drug and irinotecan when given
           together to subjects with advanced cancer?

        -  Is the combination of the study drug and irinotecan effective in stopping the growth or
           shrinking the size of your tumor?
