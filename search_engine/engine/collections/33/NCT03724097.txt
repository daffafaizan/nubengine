    
      Original computational algorithm Oncobox was developed to determine molecular features of
      individual tumors. It represents the solution for a personalized selection of target
      anticancer therapies. The method is based on the analysis of gene expression profile of a
      cancer sample in comparison with the corresponding normal tissue biosamples in order to
      select the most effective molecular targets for their inhibition and, accordingly, to
      identify more effective target drugs for cancer treatment. Histological material obtained
      from cancer patients during surgery or core-needle biopsy as part of standard treatment will
      be used for the analysis. Total RNA extracted from the tumor material will be subjected to
      next-generation sequencing (NGS). By comparing transcriptome profile of the tumor sample with
      the profiles of the corresponding normal tissue samples the rate of molecular pathways
      activation/deactivation will be calculated, as well as the case-to-normal ratios for the
      individual gene products - molecular targets of drugs. Based on these data, each target drug
      will be assigned with a score reflecting its potential efficacy for each individual tumor
      treatment. A drug with the score value above 0.1 will be considered potentially effective, a
      drug with the score value equal to or below 0.1 - as potentially ineffective. Following
      Oncobox test, 130 target anticancer drugs will be rated according to their predicted
      effectiveness (see the list of eligible target drugs below). This information will be fully
      available to a patient and his/her doctor. The doctor will prescribe treatment according to
      his/her consideration, e.g. based on the standards of care and the patient's life
      indications. After the appointment of therapy, the patients will be divided naturally into
      the following three observation groups. The first group will be formed from patients
      receiving target drugs with the score value above 0,1 as monotherapy or in combination. The
      second group - patients receiving only non-target drugs or target drugs with the score value
      equal to or below 0,1 as monotherapy or in combination. Third group will be formed by
      patients receiving palliative care. Within this study, these three groups will be compared by
      response to the therapy according to the results of instrumental studies, by time to
      progression and by time to progression compared to the previous line of therapy (if any).
      Additionally, overall survival will be measured in all three groups.
