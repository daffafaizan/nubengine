      D3 and omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent the onset or progression of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). The study will also examine whether vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids
      interact with each other, or with specific genes associated with AMD or vitamin D3 or omega-3
      fatty acid metabolic activity, to affect the risk of developing AMD.
