      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks that can effectively treat pain in women after
      cesarean section (c-section). The TAP is a space between the muscle layers of the abdominal
      wall that houses nerves supplying the abdominal skin. The investigators will inject the local
      anesthetic ropivacaine into this space to freeze these nerves and prevent pain following
      c-section. The investigators will compare three different doses of ropivacaine (0.5%, 0.25%,
      0%) to determine the lowest dose that controls pain with the fewest side effects.
      Participants in this study will receive 0.5% (Group 1), 0.25% (Group 2), or 0% (Group 3)
      ropivacaine TAP blocks to control pain after c-section. At 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after
      cesarean section visual analog pain scores (VAS) for pain on movement, pain at rest, and pain
      with cough will be collected along with the time to first postoperative analgesic request,
      patient satisfaction scores, and patient demographics. The analgesic regimen will be
      considered effective if it provides lower average visual analog scores for pain with
      movement. Secondary outcomes will be higher patient satisfaction, better pain control, fewer
      postoperative analgesic requests, and fewer side effects.
