      database will be created to collect the following information: personal data, medical
      history, histology related to the underlying disease, comorbidities, laboratory data, initial
      staging, data on the dosage and the number of cycles administered, the recorded toxicity
      data, the clinical response and the main events (relapse, progression, death, and cause of
      death). These data will then be retrospectively examined in order to obtain information about
      the life-saving treatment.
