      After briefing the patients about the method and obtaining written consent from, he will be
      randomly allocated into either the treatment or control group.

      In the first group patients will be treated by ESWT once a week for 4 weeks. (Each time 3000
      impulses, with 0.25 mJouls/M2 and 3 Hertz of frequency. After each 500 pulses, the probe
      position will be corrected, using trans-perineal ultrasound. The used device in this study is
      the standars electromagnetic DUOLITH SD1- shock waves against erectile dysfunction.

      In the control group, the same protocol is applied but with the probe being turned off.

      The examination is performed in supine position for patient. For each patient, pelvic pain
      intensity considering is performed at the beginning and end of study, by VAS. Patients are
