      stimulation (TENS) (Intervention B) plus usual care, and sham electrotherapy plus usual care
      (control). Each treatment arm will have identical participants enrolled (n=38 per arm) of
      with the same number of visits and investigator contact time.

      Eligible participants will be allocated through computerized randomization utilizing a
      stratified permuted-block randomization employing random block sizes. Allocation is
      concealed. Participants and assessors will be blinded. Participants will not be told what
      types of electrotherapy devices are being studied, only that there are different types, and
      that they may be randomized to receive a sham device.

      Patients will be instructed on the use of the device they received to perform daily home
      therapy. Subjects will be assessed at week 1, 4, 8 and 12 for the primary and secondary
      outcomes measures. Compliance to treatment will be measured through an electronic meter on
      each of the devices, as well as by patient diary. Patients will be allowed to receive usual
      care from their own health care provider, with the exception of invasive procedures or
      surgery. Results will be analyzed by intention to treat methods.
