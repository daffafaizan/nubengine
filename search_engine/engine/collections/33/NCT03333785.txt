    
      The overall objectives of this randomized trial are to test an intervention designed to
      improve coordination/continuity of care between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer
      specialist providers (CSPs), and to improve patient experience with regards to patients'
      perceived continuity of care. Participants will be patients at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer
      Centre in any one of three phases of the cancer continuum: diagnosis (colorectal, prostate,
      or lung cancer), active treatment (breast or prostate cancer) or survivorship (breast or
      colorectal cancer). The intervention involves a secure online eConsultation system that will
      allow PCPs and CSPs to communicate about their patient. Patients will be randomly allocated
      to one of two groups: 1) intervention group whereby their PCP and CSP will use a
      cancer-specific modification of the eConsultation system (eOncoNote) in addition to usual
      methods of communication or 2) control group receiving usual care (i.e. usual methods of
      communication such as telephone, fax, mailed consultation letters and progress notes).
      Randomization and outcomes will be at the level of the individual patient. The primary
      outcome is patients' perception of team/cross-boundary continuity. Secondary outcomes include
      measures of patients' anxiety and depression, and patients' experience of the care process.
      Qualitative methods including interviews with patients, PCPs, CSPs, and cancer system
      managers will also be conducted.
