      pilot year in order to test the effectiveness of a revised children's intervention for Grade
      6. Although there was some evidence of a positive effect of the intervention for girls during
      Phase II, there were no significant effects for boys. In light of these findings, BFY will
      spend the current project year piloting a revised classroom intervention as well as a newly
      adapted after-school intervention component.
