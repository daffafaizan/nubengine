      individuals with a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease between 50-95 years old will
      complete the study. All forty-two individuals will have been on an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor, which is FDA approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, for at least 2
      months prior to initiating the study, unless the medication was not previously tolerated.
      Twenty to twenty-two mild Alzheimer's disease patients will receive riluzole and another
      20-22 will receive a placebo. All patients will have a neurological evaluation and
      neuropsychological tests performed to confirm that they meet criteria for probable
      Alzheimer's disease set out by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's disease
      Association that recently revisited the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria along with FDG-PET biomarker
      consistent with Alzheimer's disease.
