    
      LUS-AMI is an observational cohort prospective study that evaluates the prognostic value of
      lung ultrasound, specifically the number of B-lines, performed within the first 24 hours
      after and ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, by an independent operator
      blinded to clinical outcomes and off-line analysis by another independent operator also
      blinded to clinical outcomes.

      Follow-up is six months after STEMI and the primary outcome is a composite of any cause
      mortality, hospitalization secondary to cardiovascular disease (acute coronary syndrome,
      heart failure or stroke) or need for urgent coronary revascularization. Secondary outcomes
      are each event composing primary outcome separately, new onset heart failure during
      hospitalization, acute kidney injury during hospitalization, new onset clinically relevant
      arrythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
      fibrillation) or unexpected consultation secondary to heart failure.
