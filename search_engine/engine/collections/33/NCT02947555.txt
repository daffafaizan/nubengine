      endproducts (AGE).The concetration of AGE increases with age but is also higher in diabetic
      patients. There is evidence that diabetes could be diagnosed via the detection of lens
      autofluorescence. The investigators are planning a cross sectional clinical trial to evaluate
      if the rate of lens autofluorescence could be associated with the clinical appearance of
      atherosclerotic vascular diseases in diabetic/non-diabetic patients and in patients who
      already had atherosclerotic vascular events and patients without previous atherosclerotic
      events. The cardiovascular and metabolic histoty of patients will be evaluated using a
      questionaire. Antropometrical data, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose metabolism, serum
      lipid profile, CRP, serum creatinine (eGFR) will be assased. ClearPath DS-120
      biomicroscopical optical system (Freedom Meditech, San Diego, CA, USA) will be used for the
      measurment of lens autofluorescence. The measurement will be performed on one eye. Data of
      the different patient groups will be compared using ANOVA, a value of p<0.05 will be
      considered significant.
