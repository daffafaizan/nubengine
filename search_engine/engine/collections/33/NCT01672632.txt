      and muscle oxidative capacity. A comparison will be made with the differences between
      participants with larger versus smaller fat cells in insulin resistance and blood levels of
      lipids. The study will also determine if characteristics of fat cells and muscle can predict
      the development of weight gain-induced insulin resistance.
