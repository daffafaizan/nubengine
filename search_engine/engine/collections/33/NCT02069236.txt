      enzyme activity in capillary blood obtained from a finger stick versus a venous blood
      specimen. We will also compare results of different G6PD tests with known G6PD genetic
      profiles. The results of the study will inform design of future G6PD diagnostic development &
      evaluations. This research will be conducted in MaeSot Thailand, where G6PD deficiency has a
      high prevalence. Study participants will be recruited into three groups of 50 volunteers per
      group: 50 G6PD-deficient individuals, 50 G6PD-normal individuals, and 50 G6PD-intermediate
      individuals. Following a written informed consent, participants will donate about 3 ml of
      venous blood and about 4 drops of capillary blood (fingerstick). There will be no direct
      benefit to research participants.
