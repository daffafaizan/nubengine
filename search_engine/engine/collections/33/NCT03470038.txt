      ischemia in a NGF-sensitized muscle may clarify whether an interaction between NGF
      sensitization and acidic stimulation exist.

      It is hypothesized that acute ischemic exercise with the NGF-sensitized TA muscle, in
      contrast to ischemic exercise in a non-sensitized would: 1) potentiate pain-evoked responses,
      and 2) facilitate NGF-induced muscle hyperalgesia.
