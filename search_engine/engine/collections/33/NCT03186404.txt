    
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a double blind, placebo controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      We will also use stratification to ensure that the proportion of patients with different
      malignancies is balanced between the study arms.

      PATIENT RECRUITMENT: Patients will be recruited from respective oncology clinics at Princess
      Margaret Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences
      Centre and Scarborough General Hospital.

      INTERVENTION: Patients will receive treatment with 40mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo
      started 2-10 days prior to the initiation of AC and continued for one month after completion
      of cancer treatment.

      CARDIAC MRI (CMR): Studies will be performed on a 3.0T scanner (Siemens) and will include
      complete function and tissue characterization. CMR studies will be performed pre-therapy and
      after completion of AC. After de-identification and randomization, a research assistant
      blinded to all clinical data will perform all CMR analysis using commercially available
      software.

      ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: Routine echocardiography studies will be performed at the time of Cardiac
      MRI.

      SERUM BIOMARKERS: Blood work will be obtained on the day of baseline imaging, immediately
      after each cycle of anthracycline, and on the day of post treatment imaging . At each time
      point samples of bio-banking will be collected. Blood sample collection will be done locally
      at the participant's respective site and transferred to University Health Network (UHN)
      biobank for future analysis or analysis of markers that are not available at all sites (e.g.
      high sensitivity troponin I and BNP).
