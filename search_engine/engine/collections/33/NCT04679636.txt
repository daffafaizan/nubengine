      severity of the disease and the social and economic losses caused by smoking cannot be
      ignored. Among them, nicotine dependence is one of the important issues in quitting smoking.
      Nicotine withdrawal symptoms often make the quitters' actions fail, especially anxiety,
      insomnia, and depression, which further affect the lives of quitters. If an intervention can
      be provided to improve the nicotine withdrawal symptoms of quitters and reduce nicotine
      dependence, it should be able to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation.This study is
      a randomized controlled trial to facilitate sampling. It is expected that 80 quitters will be
      recruited at the smoking cessation clinic of the medical center through the referral of the
      attending physician, and 40 will be randomly included in the experimental group and the
      control group. The experimental group will receive biofeedback training for heart rate
      variability for eight weeks, while the control group will receive conventional treatment. Use
      the scale to assess nicotine withdrawal symptoms before and after intervention-the degree of
      anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and insomnia
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), And the degree of nicotine dependence (Nicotine Dependence
      Scale; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence); the autonomic nerve function of the
      participants was measured by heart rhythm variability before and after the intervention; in
      addition, the cessation of smoking was tracked by telephone once a month for six months. This
      study is mainly to explore interventional biological feedback training to evaluate its
      effectiveness in improving the representative autonomic nervous function-heart rate
      variability and alleviating nicotine withdrawal anxiety, insomnia and depression symptoms and
      nicotine dependence.
