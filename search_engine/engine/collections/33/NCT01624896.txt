      China, and remarkable variations of resources available and health system performance have
      been noted. Relatively limited information is available about how evidence-based therapies
      are incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice. In addition, little
      information is available about the magnitude and quality of PCI, which has developed rapidly
      during the past several decades. Practical and applied knowledge from large unselected
      population is needed to guide practice and policy for quality improvement and cost reduction.

      To investigate the treatment pattern and outcomes of PCI during the past decade in China,
      using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design, from 70 sampled hospitals, 7,000
      CAG/PCI cases will be selected in 2011, and 3,500 in 2001 and 2006 separately. Photocopies of
      the 14,000 medical records of CAG/PCI cases will be sent to the national coordinating centre.
      Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests,
      medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted by well
      trained professional abstractors. By characterizing differences in patients' features,
      comparing the use of medications and procedures, and examining the in-hospital outcomes,
      we'll define the gaps between clinical practice and guidelines, as well as the disparities
      across different regions and hospitals, to evaluated the treatment pattern and outcomes in
      the last decade in China. New knowledge will be generated about PCI management all over
      China, to provide evidence for policy-making and clinical guidelines, and to improve patients
      prognosis in future finally.
