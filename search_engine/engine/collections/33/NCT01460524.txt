    
      This is a before-after observational study designed to compare the results in terms of
      hospitalization rate and length of hospital stay between a period when nebulized hypertonic
      saline was included in the treatment of bronchiolitis in infants versus the two previous
      years when this therapy was not used in two hospitals. There will not be any randomization.

      Physicians have been instructed on the use of hypertonic saline for moderate and severe
      bronchiolitis in infants but its totally up to them whether to use this nebulization for each
      particular patient. Two other hospital where nebulized hypertonic saline has never been used
      and will not be used during the next bronchiolitis epidemics will be the control centers.

      The study comprises two periods, one prospective starting on November 2011 and ending in
      March 2012 and one retrospective including the two previous bronchiolitis epidemics, November
      2009-March 2012 and November 2010-March 2011.

      During the prospective period a standardized assessment of the respiratory status of each
      infant will be carried out before and after each hypertonic saline nebulization.
