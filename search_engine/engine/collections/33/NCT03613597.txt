      Medica (Degussa) for the treatment of cancer. Lobaplatin as the third-generation platinum
      antineoplastic agent, showed promising antineoplastic effects in variety of preclinical test
      tumor models. A randomized, multicenter phase III study showed that Lobaplatin plus etoposide
      (EL) regimen is not inferiority to cisplatin plus etoposide (EP) regimen in terms of PFS, the
      tolerance and QOL with EL regimen are better than that with EP regimen. Thus, we perform this
      study was to compare the efficacy and safety of EL and EP regimens concurrently with thoracic
      radiotherapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC.
