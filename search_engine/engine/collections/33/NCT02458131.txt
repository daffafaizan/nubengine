    
      Approach: The proposed research addresses diabetes risk and prevention among racial/ethnic
      minority adolescents in East Harlem (EH), NY. Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to explore
      the best strategies for using peer education for diabetes risk reduction in youth and the
      potential role of mobile health technologies in improving adherence to behavioral
      modification plans. Aim 2 will utilize findings from preliminary studies and Aim 1 to design
      and evaluate a pilot community-based intervention to 1) maintain/reduce BMI (primary
      outcome), 2) improve adolescent dietary, physical activity and weight control behaviors, and
      3) improve other measures of diabetes risk. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately
      after the intervention (3 months) and at one year in the intervention and wait list control
      groups. Aim 3 involves refining the pilot intervention based on an examination of
      intervention feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability and planning for a future R01.
