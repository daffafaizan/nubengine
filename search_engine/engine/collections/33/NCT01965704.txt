      to determine if QTc prolongation is present. A repeat 12-lead EKG will be done after each
      dose of study medication, approximately 2-5 hours post dose; if a neonate has prolonged QTc
      the study drug will be stopped.

      Investigators may obtain up to 9 pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples from the neonates over 5
      days when standard of care blood samples are drawn. These samples will consist of 1 to 2
      drops of blood collected on filter paper and sent to Stanford for PK analysis.

      The modified Finnegan scoring system will be used to evaluate neonates for symptoms of NAS at
      each site and it is considered standard-of-care for babies at risk of NAS. Morphine will be
      the first treatment choice before other treatment medication choices (opioid or non-opioid)
      for NAS symptoms. Each site involved has established guidelines for starting, advancing and
      weaning treatment for NAS. Any medication used to treat NAS will be recorded.

      Interim analysis: will be performed after the first 20 pregnant women and their neonates have
      been enrolled and dosed with study drug. (Interim Analysis was done on first 21 mother/baby
      pairs in May 2016).

      To protect the confidentiality of the patients (study subjects), the lead site, Stanford
      University, received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.
