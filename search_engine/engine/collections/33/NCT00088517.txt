      neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia,
      attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and drug dependence. Among the Dopamine (DA)
      receptors, D1 receptors are understood to be involved in the regulation of motor and
      cognitive activity by modulating DAergic function. Neuroreceptor imaging with Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) allows
      in vivo quantification of the density and distribution of D1 receptors in humans. Recently, a
      new and superior PET radioligand for in vivo quantification of D1 receptors in extrastriatal
      regions has been developed. [11C]NNC-112 is a D1 radiotracer with high specific to
      nonspecific binding, making it suitable for imaging low density D1 receptors in extrastriatal
      regions such as the neocortex. Several studies in humans have confirmed the potential of this
      radiotracer, however, to date, dosimetry studies of [11C]NNC-112 in humans have not been
      performed.

      The specific objective of this protocol is to estimate radiation-absorbed doses of
      [11C]NNC-112 in human subjects. For this purpose, we propose to perform a kinetic whole body
      imaging study of [11C]NNC-112 in healthy human subjects. We hypothesize that the level of
      radiation-absorbed doses of [11C]NNC-112 in humans will be within limits, and consequently,
      we should be able to move to the next stage of our imaging research, where we will use this
      radioligand to measure the density and distribution of D1 receptors in Parkinson's disease.
