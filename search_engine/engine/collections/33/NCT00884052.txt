      half-life is 6-8 hours. Renal function in infants at birth is characterized by immature
      glomerular filtration and is only 20% that of older children. The specific esterase
      responsible for levetiracetam hydrolysis has not been identified and its expression in
      newborn infants is unknown. Depending on its activity, the expected infant total
      levetiracetam clearance will likely be between 15-45% of older populations. However, due to
      immaturity in levetiracetam clearance in infants, accumulation with multiple dosing is
      possible. Therefore the maintenance dose is reduced compared to older children according to
      the anticipated impaired clearance.

      These anticipated differences in levetiracetam clearance and volume of distribution, will
      likely result in a prolonged drug half-life of 10-30 hours in infants. This prolonged
      elimination will require longer sampling to adequately characterize levetiracetam
      pharmacodynamics in this population.

      The primary intent of the data analysis is to determine levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in
      newborn infants and predict the dosage necessary to maintain concentrations similar to those
      seen with effective therapy in other populations. Graphs of serum concentration vs. time will
      be plotted for levetiracetam for each infant. Mean serum drug concentration vs. time curves
      will also be constructed. Summary statistics (i.e., n, mean, standard deviation, minimum,
      maximum, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for serum concentrations for each
      time point and each dose level.
