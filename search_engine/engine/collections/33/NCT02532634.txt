      nausea and vomiting (CINV).However the best 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3R)
      antagonists for use in a triple drug combination for high emetogenic chemotherapy(HEC) has
      not yet been determined in randomized trials. Previous anti-emetic guidelines stated that the
      anti-emetic activities of 5-HT3R antagonists were similar at equivalent doses. Based on the
      meta-analysis of various 5-HT3R antagonists in double regimens, the NCCN guideline has
      suggested palonosetron as a preferred 5-HT3R antagonist in the triple antiemetic drug
      combination. But in Asia, RAD is one of the most popular treatments for HEC-treated cancer
      patients. However, the lack of clinical studies has precluded the recommendation of RAD as a
      standard regimen for HEC-induced CINV. In two previous studies conducted in Korea, RAD
      regimen showed significant efficacy for prevention of CINV which is comparable to the
      efficacy reported from the studies evaluating with PAD regimen. If the efficacy of RAD
      regimen is evidently proven by this kind of randomized multicenter-trial, RAD regimen can be
      more recommended as a standard regimen for HEC-induced CINV.
