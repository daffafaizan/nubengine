      injection , a time interval which is significantly shorter as compared to treatment with
      rFSH. The investigators hypothesized that this rapid increase in the serum FSH concentration
      may result in a significantly higher exposure of the small antral follicles to constant high
      levels of FSH during the early follicular phase, securing not only the recruitment of the
      follicles, but also the continued growth.

      In the current study the investigators examine whether administration of corifollitropin
      followed by 300IU hMG in a short GnRH agonist protocol may result in acceptable pregnancy
      rates in poor ovarian responders fulfilling the "Bologna criteria"
