      gastric bacterial flora in mechanically ventilated patients in order to reduce intensive care
      unit (ICU)complications. Specifically, our goal is to determine whether the oral
      administration of a naturally occurring Lactobacillus species reduces the incidence of
      ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). ICU admission is commonly accompanied by overgrowth of
      the natural gastrointestinal (GI) and oropharyngeal flor by pathogenic organisms. Patients
      requiring endotracheal intubation are predisposed to developing VAP, presumably via
      micro-aspiration of the altered oropharyngeal flora. By reducing VAP rates, we hope to
      improve ICU outcomes, minimize ICU expenses, and most importantly, decrease morbidity and
      mortality.
