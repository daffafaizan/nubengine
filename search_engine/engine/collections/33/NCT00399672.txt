      2,000 IDUs receiving care in our centres (Appendix 1). For those who carry HCV antibodies
      (expected n = 1800), a test for HCV viremia and genotype will be performed. By these
      evaluations, we expect up to 600 individuals to be viremic and carry HCV genotype 2 or 3.
      Within this group, 200 consecutive patients (100/study strategy) will receive therapy for
      HCV, based on their eligibility to do so according to Provincial guidelines for the
      reimbursement of medications. Patient allocation will be according to the study site where
      they regularly receive care. At two sites, patients will be enrolled in a DOT program with
      on-site full-time nursing and counseling support (high intensity, 50 patients/site). At the
      other two sites, patients will receive medication on a weekly basis and will have access to
      part-time nursing and counseling support (low intensity, 50 patients/site). Medical follow-up
      will be according to current clinical standards, and the primary endpoint of the study will
      be the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) six months after completion of treatment.
      Within the study described above, we will use standardized methodologies to calculate the
      total health care costs related to the treatment of HCV infection. We will also assess the
      effect of treatment on the quality of life (QoL) of study participants.
