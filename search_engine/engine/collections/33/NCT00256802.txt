      source of the headpain are the meninges and the large intracerebral arteries. The dilatation
      of the cerebral vessels may not be the origin of the head pain per se, but measurements of
      the intra cerebral vascular bed in the past has proven valuable in the migraine-research, and
      has helped elucidate the basis for the migraine aura (Olesen, Friberg et al. 1990). The
      effects of different signal molecules on the intra cerebral vasculature continue to be an
      important field in the migraine research, in the search for possible pain causing signaling
      molecules.

      Therefore we have set up at study to examine if MR-Angiography (MRA) can be used for
      monitoring of the vascular response after challenge with the known vasodilator GTN. This drug
      was chosen because it is well characterized and a large body of evidence from earlier studies
      could serve as background data (Thomsen 1997).
