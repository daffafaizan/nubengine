      care that may be fragmented across clinicians. Older adults vary in what's most important
      when faced with tradeoffs and vary in the health-related activities they are willing and able
      to complete to achieve their desired outcomes. A potential solution to these problems is to
      move from decision-making predicated solely on disease-guidelines to decision-making based on
      achieving each patient's own specific health outcome goals (e.g., relief of symptoms
      sufficient to allow specific functional activity) within the context of what they are willing
      and able to do (i.e. care preferences) to achieve these outcomes.

      The primary aims of the Patient Priorities Care (PPC) pilot is to assess the feasibility of
      aligning primary and specialty care to focus on the health priorities (i.e. specific and
      actionable outcome goals and care preferences) of older adults with multiple chronic
      conditions (MCC)
