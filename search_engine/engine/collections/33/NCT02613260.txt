      safety-net system and access to care may be limited, novel models of health care delivery are
      warranted. The overall hypothesis is that a centralized panel management model with mailed
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT) will be effective at increasing the uptake of CRC screening
      and could be developed and sustained within the typical parameters of cost-effectiveness and
      budget impact analyses. Barriers to immunization of adults include missed opportunities
      during visits, limited access to providers, and provider and patient beliefs of efficacy.

      Design: To rigorously examine the benefit of the centralized panel management to improve
      uptake of CRC screening with mailed FIT, the electronic health system will be used to
      identify eligible patients who are not up-to-date with CRC screening. Broadly, patients will
      be randomized 1:1 to usual care or intervention arm, stratified by clinic, gender, prior
      screening, and race to receive mailed FIT kits + usual care versus usual care alone. The
      cost-effectiveness of no screening, usual care, and centralized management with mailed FIT
      outreach will be compared using mathematical simulation models.
