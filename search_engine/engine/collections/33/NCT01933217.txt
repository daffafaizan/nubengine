      methylphenidate treatment of attention problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      and (2) provide a better understanding of the relationship of a prior history of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ADHD subtypes after TBI, executive function, and
      attentional control to treatment efficacy. The proposed clinical trial will enroll 50
      children, age 6-17 years, with attention problems >6 months after moderate to severe TBI into
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design trial with 3 dose
      conditions (low, medium, and high).
