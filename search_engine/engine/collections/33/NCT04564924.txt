    
      Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBDï¼‰ is a common complication of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD), which may lead to defective mineralization, altered bone morphology,
      and/or bone turnover. Animal research found that bone changes occur even in the early stage
      of CKD , and with CKD progression, the patient may show symptoms such as bone pain, joint
      pain, bone deformation, and even spontaneous fractures.

      Despite significant advances in understanding bone disease in CKD, most clinical and
      biochemical targets used in clinical practice remain controversial, resulting in an
      undermanagement of bone fragility.Our ability to diagnose CKD-MBD and to initiate strategies
      that could prevent fractures remains limited by the lack of accurate and noninvasive
      diagnostic tools.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a non-invasive method that can improve fracture risk
      prediction and provide early diagnosis for bone abnormalities in patients with CKD.
