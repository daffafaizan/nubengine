      complication rates in patients with colorectal cancer receiving treatment with stoma surgery.
      Prior to surgery patients are randomized to different preoperative education programs. In Arm
      A patients receive a new specific education program (Krankenhaus Nordwest concept) conducted
      by a specialized therapist (stoma-therapist). In Arm B patients receive the standard
      preoperative education program. Standardized questionnaires are used to evaluate quality of
      life and period of hospitalization at baseline and four weeks after surgery in Arm A vs. Arm
      B
