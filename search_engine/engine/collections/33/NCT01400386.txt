      been associated with potential health benefits. A study by Richelle et al. (2001), using an
      LDL oxidation assay, showed that phenolic compounds in coffee possessed antioxidant activity
      which varied depending on the coffee bean source and the degree of roasting. Little is known
      about the bioavailability of phenolic compounds from coffee at various roast levels.
      Therefore, further human studies are required in order to demonstrate the absorption, and
      bioavailability of metabolites that may also be efficient in vivo.

      The main objective of this clinical trial is to investigate the possible difference in the
      bioavailability of chlorogenic and phenolic acids from coffee at different roast levels.

      After medical examination and approval, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the four
      coffee treatments. Each study period correspond to the ingestion of one the treatments and
      study periods are separated by a one week washout period. Blood will be taken as a time
      course for 24h while urine will be collected for 30h. Investigators are also blinded with
      respect to the dose and the treatment given to the subjects.
