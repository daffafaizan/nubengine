      castrate resistant prostate carcinoma with anti-3-[18F]FACBC in prostate carcinoma to
      determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC amino acid imaging can serve as an accurate and efficient
      imaging biomarker.

      Investigators will perform a baseline anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT of the whole body. All
      participants will also undergo conventional staging including 99mTc methylene diphosphonate
      (MDP) bone scanning and computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of
      the abdomen and pelvis which are standard of care at the enrolling institution. This study
      will not interfere with standard patient evaluation or delay therapy.

      All 30 participants will receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Participants will
      undergo a repeat anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT after 1 and 6 cycles and also repeat conventional
      imaging including bone scanning CT or MR of the abdomen and pelvis after 6 cycles. At the end
      of the study, the study team will then record the response (or lack thereof) on
      anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT and correlate that response with response per standard clinical
      criteria including bone scan uptake for skeletal lesions, CT or MR for soft tissue and
      skeletal lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression or regression, and other
      clinical parameters such as declining performance status.
