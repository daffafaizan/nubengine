      effective and is currently considered the gold standard for treating OUD, adherence to MAT
      regimens remains a challenge. The goal of the proposed study is to determine the
      effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention that also utilizes peer mentors in addition
      to professional substance abuse therapists (the Minds and Mentors program [MiMP]) in
      improving adherence to MAT for OUD and reducing relapse rates in a sample of individuals with
      OUD who are also on MAT versus a twelve-step facilitation (TSF) program. The MiMP is a
      twelve-week intervention that uses group therapy and meets once a week for about two hours
      for eight weeks with a professional substance abuse therapist; after the completion of eight
      therapist led sessions, participants will attend four weeks of group therapy sessions
      conducted by a peer mentor. The peer mentor will also attend the initial eight sessions with
      the therapist to establish rapport with participants. The control group will attend twelve
      weeks of a standard twelve-step facilitation program. This study will utilize an individually
      randomized group treatment design with ten participants in both the intervention and control
      groups. Data collection will occur at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12- month
      follow-up.
