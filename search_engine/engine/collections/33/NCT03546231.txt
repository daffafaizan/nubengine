      relatively difficult in echocardiography and the management of tricuspid valve diseases
      remains poorly codified. In developed countries, TR is mainly functional, related to a
      remodeling of the right cavities in response to an increase in the load conditions. This
      remodeling induces a dilation of the tricuspid ring and / or a "tenting" of the tricuspid
      leaflets. Once TR is present, a vicious circle settles because TR increases right ventricle
      dilation. Transthoracic echocardiography is the key examination allowing noninvasive,
      quantification and assessment of hemodynamic repercussions of TR.

      TR remains asymptomatic for a long time, often diagnosed with a significant delay at the
      stage of advanced right heart failure. At this stage, the surgical risk is important, at
      least more important than for left heart valve diseases and it is therefore essential to
      define the right time for proposing valvular surgery to patients. Indeed, TR is an
      independent factor of mortality and only surgical treatment improves the prognosis.

      Current guidelines remain vague given the low number of prognostic studies and of their
      contradictory results often influenced by the significant comorbidities of patients, the
      presence of pulmonary hypertension or left heart valve disease. Only a minority of patients
      (<1%) is referred to surgery because operative mortality is often judged unacceptable in
      elderly patients or in cases of advanced right ventricular dysfunction.

      The constitution of a prospective and retrospective cohort will improve the state of
      knowledge on etiologies, natural history, prognosis and management of patients with moderate
      or severe TR.
