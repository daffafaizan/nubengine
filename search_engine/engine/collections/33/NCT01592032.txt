      end of port indwelling time. Secondary Objectives: 1) Assess bioactivity of antimicrobials in
      lock solutions at the end of port indwelling time. 2) Assess anticoagulant activity of
      antimicrobial-lock solutions at the end of port indwelling time.

      Methods: Randomized, open, block allocation according to time of indwelling of the
      antimicrobial-lock within the ports, unicentric, clinical trial in patients older than 18
      years old with a venous port implanted at Cl√≠nica Universidad de Navarra. Intevention:
      Randomization of 5 patients into one of five antimicrobial-lock solution arms for 1, 3, 5, 7
      and 10 days according to HPLC corrected by urea gradient. Any study arm can be stopped at any
      time from day 1 to day 10, in case of antimicrobial concentration would be less than 1 mg/mL.

      At the end of each antimicrobial lock time frame of ports (1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days), the
      antimicrobial concentration will be determined by high performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) and corrected by urea gradient. The cut-off for the median antimicrobial concentration
      is 1 mg/mL.
