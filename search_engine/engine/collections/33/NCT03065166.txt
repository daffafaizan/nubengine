      multifactorial in nature, and is currently thought of as a chronic inflammatory condition. To
      reduce the risk of CVD and its associated health care costs in California and elsewhere,
      nutrition and health recommendations strongly advocate the consumption of a diet rich in
      fruits and vegetables. Such recommendations are based largely on epidemiological data; the
      mechanisms underlying the putative positive effects of plant food-rich diets are poorly
      defined and an area of active debate.

      In addition to essential vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables contain a number of
      bioactive compounds that may be involved in vascular function. In this regard,
      epidemiological studies have noted a significant inverse relationship between the intake of
      plant foods rich in polyphenols and the risk of both all-cause mortality and CVD. For
      example, the "French paradox" refers to diet patterns that, despite being high in saturated
      fat, are associated with a relatively low cardiovascular risk, which may be due, in part, to
      a robust intake of polyphenols found in red wine, grapes, and other plant foods. Red wine
      contains an array of phytochemicals that have been proposed to improve cardiovascular health,
      with a great focus on polyphenols. However, grape products such as dried cabernet grapes also
      contain substantial amounts of polyphenols that may be vasculoprotective.
