      last few years, so does the need for more effective treatment strategies. Concussions can
      lead to a variety of symptoms that may last from days to weeks after injury.[1] Dizziness and
      vestibular impairments are prevalent in up to 81% of patients after concussion.[2,3]
      Additionally, dizziness and vestibular impairments are predictive of prolonged recovery times
      after concussion.[4] Although there are few studies suggesting that vestibular rehabilitation
      after concussion is promising,[5,6] there continues to be a void in well-controlled studies
      verifying that vestibular rehabilitation can be used to treat patients with dizziness and
      balance disorders after concussion. Due to the lack of controlled studies and current
      practice patterns, patients with concussions are not seen for physical therapy until weeks or
      months after their injury. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of early
      vestibular rehabilitation on reducing physical post-concussion symptoms (e.g. dizziness,
      balance problems), and improving the timeline to achieve medical clearance to return to
      activities such as sports and work activities, when compared to STANDARD care. The findings
      of this study are expected to provide medical and sports related professionals with
      appropriate concussion treatment strategies and improve outcomes of patients suffering from
      concussion.
