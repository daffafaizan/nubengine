      I. Demonstrate the feasibility of serial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers for
      assessment of early, intermediate, and late radiotherapy-attributable physiologic alteration
      of tumor and normal tissues and the kinetics thereof.

      II. Develop MR-biomarker inclusive predictive models for development of
      radiotherapy-attributable normal tissue injury.

      III. Define dose-response relationships between imaging biomarkers and subsequent
      radiation-induced effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients may receive a contrast agent intravenously (IV) and then undergo an MRI
      over 45-60 minutes at baseline, 3-5 weeks after starting standard of care radiation therapy,
      and then at 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years after completing radiation therapy.

      COHORT II: Patients may receive a contrast agent IV and then undergo an MRI over 45-60
      minutes at baseline, and at 5-10 weeks and 12 months after standard of care surgery.
