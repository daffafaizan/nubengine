    
      This clinical study corresponds to a TLIF surgery using a per-operating artificial substitute
      specific biomaterial: autologous osteoblasts punctured on iliac crest and put on a collagen
      support waxed with tri-calcium phosphate (which is osteoconductive) to perform a
      intervertebral body fusion.

      Biomaterial MATRITM BONE: Device of class III, with marking IT in the indication of
      arthrodesis. It will be administered during the lumbar interbody fusion's procedure.

      The material is a matrix of collagen mineralized containing a homogeneous mixture of collagen
      cleansed of type I+III and an osseous biphasic substitute HA / TCP. The proportion of both
      constituents is 90 % of osseous substitute for 10 % of collagen en masse. The collagen is
      reduced in approximately 1 month and the osseous substitute leads to an osseous reshaping in
      6 - 9 months approximately.

      The follow up will last 12 months with 2 visits (6 and 12 months after surgery), 2 CT scan
      slides before inclusion and at 12 months, classical X-rays before inclusion and at 6 and 12
      months, questionnaires (visual analogic scale for pain, and quality of life with OSWESTRY and
      SF36 scales) before inclusion and at 6 and 12 months, and biological exams (CRP/VS, for
      inflammation) at each visit.
