      followed by apheresis to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on days 5-7. PBSCs are
      processed in vitro for enrichment of CD34 cells and transduced with a Fanconi's anemia
      complementation C (FACC) retroviral vector on days 5-10. Patients receive transduced PBSCs IV
      over no more than 2 hours on days 8-10. PBSC infusions may be repeated no more than every 2
      months for up to 4 courses total.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9 months, every 6 months for
      the next year, and then yearly thereafter.
