      seems to be crucial to maximize sustained virological response and minimize the incidence of
      relapses after treatment discontinuations.

      Recent reports showed that it is beneficial to extend the treatment duration in patients
      without rapid virological response at 4 weeks (RNA-HCV < 50 UI/ml).
