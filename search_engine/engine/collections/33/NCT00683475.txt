      of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Chemotherapy, either as a single agent
      or in combination, may lead to clinical response, pain control, and/or improved quality of
      life. Docetaxel is now the first-line standard therapy for AIPC. Mitoxantrone was approved in
      1996 for use in combination with corticosteroids as initial chemotherapy for pain related to
      advanced Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Hormonal manipulations and
      docetaxel-based chemotherapy are often effective in metastatic prostate cancer; however,
      disease becomes refractory to these interventions in the majority of men. Although
      mitoxantrone continues to be a significant agent in the treatment of HRPC, there exists a
      need for more efficacious therapy in docetaxel-refractory- AIPC. Because of the potential
      contribution of Insulin Like Growth Factor Receptor (IGF-IR) and VEGFR-2 mediated pathways in
      prostate cancer pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that each of these biological agents in
      combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone will result in clinically meaningful activity in
      AIPC. Therefore, ImClone plans to conduct a randomized Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and
      efficacy of IMC-A12 or IMC-1121B (ramucirumab) in combination with mitoxantrone and
      prednisone in participants with AIPC.
