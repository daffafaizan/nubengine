      implants.1 However, it has been shown that similar clinical outcomes may be achieved even
      with insertion torque values â‰¤15 Ncm when implants are splinted together. Due to the
      contradictory outcomes on the influence of the torque on osseointegration and a lack of
      histological data in humans, there is a need of more evidences that may support the
      clinicians in the decision making when an unintentional low insertion torque occur at
      implants during the daily practice. So the aim of the study i evaluate histomorphometrically
      the healing at implants installed in Twelve volunteer patients that will be recruited. Two
      screw-shaped titanium devices will be installed in the distal segments of the mandible using
      insertion torque values of either <10 Ncm or ~30 Ncm. The implants were left to heal in a
      non-submerged fashion. After 8 weeks, biopsies will be retrieved and ground sections will be
      prepared for histological evaluation.
