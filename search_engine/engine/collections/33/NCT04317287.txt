    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Cardio formulation in reducing oxidized LDL. Each subject will receive a
      specific dose of the study product to be taken with a meal daily preferably at the same time
      each day with water.

      Participants will receive questionnaires, assessments, blood tests, vital signs and body
      composition analysis.

      The primary objective is the evaluation of the change in Ox LDL in response to the Cardio
      formulation at Days 30 and 60 relative to baseline compared with placebo.

      The secondary objective is the evaluation of the change in anthropometric measurements,
      clinical laboratory evaluations, and health survey scores in response to the Cardio
      formulation at Days 30 and Day 60 relative to baseline compared with placebo.
