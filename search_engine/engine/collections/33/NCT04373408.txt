      surgery on the basis on multiple parameters. All patient will undergo detailed pre-clinical
      evaluation, including an ultrasonographic evaluation of the integrity of the ALL.

      Two subgroups will be compared for the primary outcome (International Knee Documentation
      Committee score at 8 months of follow-up). In subgroup 1, the surgeon will follow the
      ultrasonographic evaluation of the ALL considering the ALL repair (i.e. : ALL intact on the
      ultrasound, ACL repair only; ALL broken on ultrasound; ACL and ALL repair). In subgroup 2,
      the surgeon will not follow the ultrasonographic evaluation of the ALL considering the ALL
      repair.

      Secondary outcomes of interest will be evaluated with multivariate regression analysis.

      Sample size calculation:

      The chosen parameter of interest for the primary outcome evaluation is a continuous response
      variable (IKDC score) from two independent subgroups (ultrasonographic evaluation of the ALL
      followed or not for the surgical repair), considering a ratio of 1:3 between the two
      subgroups. In a previous study (AJSM Sonnery-Cottet 2017) the response within each subject
      group was normally distributed with standard deviation 13.1. If the true difference between
      the group means is the published minimal clinically important difference of 9 (AJSM Nwachukwu
      2017), we will need to study 30 experimental subjects and 90 control subjects to be able to
      reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups
      are equal with probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this
      test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.
