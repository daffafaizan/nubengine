      parent knowledge regarding child development and the home cognitive environment comprised of
      distribution of (1) publicly available developmental monitoring materials, (2) age and
      language appropriate children's books, and (3) text message reminders. Participants in this
      intervention will receive: (1) educational materials about child development and
      developmental monitoring checklists; (2) age and language appropriate picture books; and (3)
      two text messages per week for a 6-month period. Differences in pre- and post-intervention
      knowledge regarding child development and the home cognitive environment will be assessed.
