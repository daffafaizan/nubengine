    
      1. Feasibility study of iris OCTA technology

        2. Establishment of iris OCTA database in normal population and analysis of related
           factors: (1) different sex; (2) different age; (3) different myopic diopter; (4) 24-hour
           diurnal changes from morning to night; (5) before and after mydriasis; (6) different
           blood pressure; (7) different intraocular pressure; (8) different blood glucose; (9)
           before and after exercise. (10) drinking water, tea, coffee and red wine.

        3. Analysis of iris OCTA data related to eye diseases:(1) conjunctivitis; (2) glaucoma; (3)
           childhood myopia; (4) uveitis; (5) diabetic retinopathy; (6) retinal detachment; (7)
           fundus neovascularization.

        4. Influence of commonly used ophthalmic drops on iris OCTA data. Observe the difference of
           iris OCTA test data before and after treatment: (1) conjunctivitis treated with
           levofloxacin antibiotics; (2) glaucoma treated with prostaglandins, adrenalines and
           receptor blockers; (3) childhood myopia treated with atropine drugs (4) uveitis treated
           with hormonal drugs. (5) diabetic retinopathy treated with vasodilator.

        5. Effect on iris OCTA data before and after ophthalmic surgery. (1) cataract,
           phacoemulsification + intraocular lens implantation; (2) glaucoma, iridectomy; (3)
           fundus neovascularization, intraocular injection of anti-VEGF; (4) diabetic retinopathy,
           vitreous surgery.
