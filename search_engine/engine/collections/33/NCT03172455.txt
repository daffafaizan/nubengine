    
      GLASSIA (human alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI), also known as human alpha-1 antitrypsin,
      Kamada-AAT or Kamada-API) is a, liquid, ready-to-use preparation of human A1PI. Alpha-1
      proteinase inhibitor belongs to the family of serine proteinase inhibitors and is primarily
      produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. In addition to its anti-proteinase
      activity, A1PI showed to have anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory
      properties (1-4).

      GLASSIA is an injection solution prepared from human plasma collected from healthy volunteer
      blood donors in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
      Agency (EMA) regulations. GLASSIA was approved in the United States (US) in July 2010 and is
      indicated for chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with clinically evident
      emphysema due to severe hereditary deficiency of Alpha1-PI (alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency).
