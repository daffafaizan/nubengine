      a mortality up to 30%. Intra-abdominal hypertension(IAH）is a common complication of severe
      acute pancreatitis(SAP). The inflammation of the pancreas starts a cascade of pancreatic and
      visceral edema, acute peripancreatic fluid collections, capillary leakage causing ascites,
      paralytic ileus, and gastric dilatation by upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction leading
      to an elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). A sustained or repeated pathological elevation
      in IAP ≥12 mmHg is defined as IAH, it generally occurs often within the first week after
      onset of SAP. Persistent and serious IAH (IAP >20 mmHg ) often leads to new onset organ
      failure or acute worsening of existing organ failure, which is defined as ACS and associated
      with a mortality rate of 49%.

      In the past practice, many patients with ACS undergo decompressive laparotomy, which
      obviously has a risk of complications. Therefore, numerous medical, nonmedical, and minimally
      invasive therapies have been introduced. Neostigmine is an anti-cholinesterase drugs, can
      enhance intestinal peristalsis, promote flatus defecation. World Society for Abdominal
      Compartment Syndrome (WSACS)guidelines,suggest that neostigmine be used for the treatment of
      established colonic ileus not responding to other simple measures and associated with
      IAH.However, no data exist on the effects of pharmacologic promotility therapy on IAP or
      outcomes among those with IAH/ACS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      neostigmine on reducing IAP in AP patients with IAH.
