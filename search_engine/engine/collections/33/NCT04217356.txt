      myelofibrosis. On one hand, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is potentially
      curative treatment but is associated with significant risk of complications related to graft
      failure (the new donor cells does not grow properly after the transplant), side effects such
      as graft versus host disease (the patient's cells attack the new donor cells), and risk of
      infections. Non-transplant therapies such as ruxolitinib provide effective symptom control
      for few months to few years, but are not curative in nature. As such, this study will compare
      the effectiveness of HCT versus best available non-transplant therapies (BAT) in patients
      with high risk myelofibrosis.

      This is an observational study, meaning that participants will be followed to assess the
      effects of their treatment, but no intervention (treatments) will be given as a part of this
      study.
