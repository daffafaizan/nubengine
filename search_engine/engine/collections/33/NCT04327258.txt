      Natriuretic peptides play an important role in risk stratification and management of patients
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery. However, due to genetic variability, the levels of these
      biomarkers may differ in individual patients with cardiac derangement. In the preoperative
      setting, genetic contribution to natriuretic peptide plasma level variability has not yet
      been determined.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to assess genetic contribution to NP plasma level variability in a
      Swiss cohort.

      Methods

      Cross-sectional association study in a cohort of non-cardiac surgery patients.

      This study is a Subproject of a prospective cohort study registered under the ID 041/09.
