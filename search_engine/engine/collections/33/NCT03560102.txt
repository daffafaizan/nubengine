      The planned study should address the possibility to completely ablate breast cancer with the
      dedicated breast MR-HIFU unit. The result of the MR-HIFU therapy should be monitored by
      imaging (contrast enhanced MRI) as well as with histopathological correlation after surgery.

      The patient population would consist of female patients with proven breast cancer scheduled
      for surgical lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      The idea is to evaluate a minimal invasive method to treat breast cancer as a potential
      alternative to surgical resection in the future
