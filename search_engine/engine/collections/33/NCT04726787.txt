    
      The REMIT Trial is an open label, single arm phase IIa study investigating Radiotherapy as
      preferred bridging method prior to Tisagenlecleucel treatment in patients with relapsed or
      refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma approved to receive CD19 CAR-T cells as per their
      licensed indication.

      The trial will recruit 20 patients who have been approved to receive Tisagenlecleucel
      treatment and where the tumour is amendable to radiotherapy as per standard of care.

      Trial subjects (patients) during a 14 day screening phase will have their metabolic tumour
      burden assessed by PET-CT and bridging radiotherapy will be planned. Bridging radiotherapy
      will commence immediately after leukapheresis with dose adjustments according to disease
      burden and localisation.

      Disease areas requiring effective long-term control will receive full dose radiotherapy, 20 -
      30Gy /5-15# and other areas will receive low dose radiotherapy, 4Gy / 2# for optimal tumour
      debulking and priming effects.

      Standard lymphodepletion will be given day -5 to day -3 followed by Tisagenlecleucel infusion
      on day 0. A window of 14-21 days will be left from last dose of radiotherapy and day 0.

      Patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion for a minimum
      of 12 months.
