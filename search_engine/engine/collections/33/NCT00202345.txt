      enrolment (including informed consent), be randomized to one of 2 groups.

      Group A: To receive intravenous iron sucrose to maintain supra-physiological measures of iron
      status ) Group A will be targeted to have ferritin levels between 300 and 500µg/L and/or a
      transferrin saturation of between 25 and 50%. Between 100 and 200mg of intravenous iron
      sucrose will be administered by slow bolus injection one- to two-monthly to achieve these
      levels.

      Oral iron will not be used routinely in this group.

      Group B: Will have oral iron therapy if required to maintain ferritin levels between 100 and
      150µg/L and/or transferrin saturations >20% but <25%. Patients in Group B who are unable to
      tolerate oral iron will be administered iron sucrose if necessary to maintain acceptable iron
      levels.

      Patients in Group B will therefore differ from those in Group A (a) through the routine use
      of iron sucrose and (b) through the maintenance of different ferritin and transferrin
      saturation levels.
