      disease and its supportive tissue associated with several unwanted effects, including serious
      obstetric consequences. Periodontitis is commonly diagnosed in clinical practice based on
      clinical findings and radiological examinations, but also with the help of microbiological or
      periodontal bacterial specimens. Several salivary markers have been investigated and it
      appears that the determination of matrix metalloproteinases provides clear information on the
      difference between gingivitis, periodontitis, and healthy periodontitis. Especially in this
      respect, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP 8) was investigated, which proved to be a fairly
      good marker. Little is known about the effect of periodontitis on reproductive potential of
      women. Some studies have assumed that periodontitis could be one of the possible risk factors
      of infertility of an unknown cause. One of the possible mechanisms responsible for the
      negative influence of periodontitis is the conception of the mediator of inflammation at the
      level of the endometrium and the place of implantation of the embryo.The aim of the study was
      to compare the level of MMP8 in salivary fluid in infertile patients in relation to the
      control group of fertile women, depending on the existence of periodontitis.
