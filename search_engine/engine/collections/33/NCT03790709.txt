      function after 48 weeks of daily treatment. Additional outcome measures include refined
      measures of sleep, behavioral and psychological symptoms typically observed in AD, changes in
      daily functioning of participants and changes in caregiver burden, as well as changes in
      quality of life measures of both, patients and caregivers during treatment with ANAVEX2-73.
      In addition, safety assessments, pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments and collections of CSF and
      blood markers of AD pathophysiology before and after treatment will be performed.
