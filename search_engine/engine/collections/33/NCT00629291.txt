      exposed to the effects of iron deposition in the reticuloendothelial system, including
      cardiac muscle, liver and pancreas. Tools available for iron load evaluation include serum
      ferrtin levels, liver biopsy and echocardiography, all are non specific.

      The purpose of this work is to compare iron overload in the liver, heart and pancreas in
      Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell β thalassemia patients using T2* MRI sequences.

      Patients and Methods: 27 Sickle cell anemia and 28 Sickle cell β thalassemia will undergo
      transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac MRI using T2* sequences and clinical and laboratory
      evaluation for iron overload including ferritin levels and oral glucose tolerance test

      .
