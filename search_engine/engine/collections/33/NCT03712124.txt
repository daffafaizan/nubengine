      of CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) powder for suspension administered orally in women with moderate to
      severe diabetic gastroparesis. Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive
      CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day or placebo, each dosed twice a day (BID); each group will consist of 10
      patients. All patients will receive the standard of care for diabetic gastroparesis.

      Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract express neuronal nitric oxide
      synthase (nNOS), which generates nitric oxide (NO), a key neurotransmitter in the regulation
      of GI motility. Several co-factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), calcium, and
      tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide
      synthase (NOS) is regulated by BH4. In the absence of BH4, uncoupling of NO production occurs
      and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired nNOS bioactivity.

      CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring
      precursor of BH4 via the pterin salvage pathway. Oral administration of CNSA-001 will result
      in increases in both intracellular and circulating BH4 concentrations. Increased BH4
      concentration is hypothesized to improve nNOS function resulting in a positive effect on
      gastric accommodation and emptying.
