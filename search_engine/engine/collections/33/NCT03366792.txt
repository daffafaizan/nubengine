      death in men in the Western hemisphere. Definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer relies on
      biopsy of the prostate gland, which is historically performed by taking 12 random biopsies of
      the prostate by placing a needle through the rectum under ultrasound guidance. Recently,
      advances in MRI techniques have allowed identification of suspicious lesions within the
      prostate prior to biopsy, which has given rise to targeting biopsy cores to high-suspicion
      areas using fused ultrasound-MRI images. However, the most commonly used transrectal approach
      to biopsy is associated with a growing rate of infectious complications as well as poor
      sampling of the anterior region of the prostate, which is furthest from the rectum.
