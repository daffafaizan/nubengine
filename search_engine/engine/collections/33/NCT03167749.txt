      destruction. Therefore, abnormal function of endocrine organs is expected in patients with
      liver cirrhosis.

      Hypogonadism is a frequent clinical feature in patients with liver cirrhosis. These patients
      have gynecomastia, decreased libido, signs of feminization, testicular atrophy and low
      testosterone level, as well as reduced Spermatogenesis. These features are more severe in
      patients with higher Child Pugh score.

      Several hormonal abnormalities are responsible for these clinical alterations.
      Estrogen/androgen ratio has been increased in cirrhosis while there is reduction in serum
      testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone level.

      Hyperprolactinemia is present in patients with cirrhosis and may involve in Hypogonadism by
      an inhibitory effect on gonadotropins.
