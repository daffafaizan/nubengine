      and exercise intolerance, patients may also experience symptoms related to musculoskeletal
      system such as muscle fatigue or pain. Due to insufficient cardiac output and chronic
      arterial hypoxemia, oxygen cannot be delivered to skeletal muscles sufficiently, especially
      during exertion. In addition, inflammation, which is thought to play an important role in
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and disease pathophysiology in these patients, affects skeletal
      muscles as well. Increased sympathetic tone in PAH restricts the perfusion of skeletal muscle
      by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. With the addition of physical inactivity to all
      these factors, skeletal muscle metabolism is further impaired. Furthermore, drugs used for
      the treatment of PAH may induce musculoskeletal pain as a side effect. Musculoskeletal pain
      is one of the most important factors impairing individual's quality of life, regardless of
      whether there is an underlying disease. Our aim in this study is to evaluate pain prevalence
      in the musculoskeletal system over 9 body regions, to compare the pain prevalence of patients
      using different types of PAH drugs and to examine impact of musculoskeletal pain on quality
      of life and functional capacity in patients with PAH.
