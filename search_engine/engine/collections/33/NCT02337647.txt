      Correction Data Collection (DCDC) App on a computer tablet system. There are two objectives
      in this study. The primary objective is to evaluate the functionality of the visual
      distortion app on the tablet computer. Patients will draw their distortions on the tablet
      screen, and the app will record and correct the distortions.The second objective is to create
      a distortion data repository (DDR) that contains retinal maps, data pertaining to the
      anatomical and functional aspects of patients retinas and the distortions. This DDR will be
      used to correlate retinal health to distortions.The correlation will be key in improving the
      correction software of the app. Long term, the app will be used to create a diagnostic tool
      and improve image processing in retinal prosthesis systems.

      Participating subjects must be at least 55 years of age or older with age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). After consent, a chart review will be performed. At the baseline visit,
      subjects will have an electroretinogram (ERG). At the single study visit, to be scheduled
      within 2 weeks of the baseline visit, subjects will use the DCDC app on a tablet computer to
      trace their visual distortions on an Amsler grid. Up to 5 subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The duration of the study is a 2 hour baseline
      visit and a 1 hour study visit, all within 2 weeks.
