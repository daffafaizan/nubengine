      hysterectomy alone does not address the underlying problem of deficient apical support.
      Surgical options for patients with apical prolapse include transvaginal suspension procedures
      using pelvic structures for fixation, such as the sacrospinous ligament or uterosacral
      ligaments.The objective of this study is to compare the sacrospinous fixation with high
      uterosacral in the treatment of uterine prolapse POP-Q stage 3 or 4 in terms of recurrence of
      prolapse,quality of life,complications,post-operative recovery, hospital stay.
