      at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. They will be asked to provide a blood sample
      prior to their surgery. Samples of tumor tissue and normal lung tissue will be taken from the
      samples removed during your lung surgery. The tissue will be used to evaluate DNA. A skin
      biopsy at the edge of the incision that has already been made will be done during your
      surgery. We will take the skin and grow skin fibroblasts. Then we will reprogram the skin
      fibroblasts into induced pluripotent cells. You will be "randomized" into one of the study
      groups to either take Metformin for 6 months with your standard of care follow up or to
      receive standard of care follow up.
