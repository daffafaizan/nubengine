      SCLC patients without treatment often die in 2-4 months. SCLC is a highly heterogeneous
      malignant tumor, the previous treatment principle of the tumor is based on the traditional
      histopathology, which not provide accurate guidance for precise treatment. In recent years,
      breakthrough has been made in molecular classification of breast cancer, non-small cell lung
      cancer, gastrointestinal cancer and of the other tumor, but SCLC molecular classification has
      not yet reported.

      In this prospective study, SCLC tissues and blood samples from extensive SCLC patients will
      be obtained and evaluated of molecular profiling. Eligible population includes: patients who
      have not undergone any treatment and diagnosed of extensive SCLC by
      immunohistochemistry(IHC). The purpose is to evaluate molecular profiling of SCLC patients
      who are sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy (Cisplatin+Etoposide). To compare molecular
      alterations of SCLC patients with different prognosis (Overall Survival, Progress Free
      Survival).
