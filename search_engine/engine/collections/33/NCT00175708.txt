      system the distribution of force will be measured across the plantar surface of the subject'
      foot. The Tekscan system is comprised of a 50 cm square pressure sensor connected to a
      computer interface. The data collection will be made up of two parts:

      Part I: Static Profile: The child will be asked to stand on the mat for 6 seconds for five
      trials. During this time the data collection software will collect force data across the foot
      60 times per second. The software will then calculate centre of force as well as changes in
      pressure during the static trial. The foot will be assessed into the distribution of forces
      across the hindfoot, midfoot, forefoot, and the big toe. In addition, the centre of gravity
      will also be determined.

      Part II: Dynamic Profile: The dynamic test will involve the child walking across the mat for
      a total of 5 passes per foot. Measurements of force will again be taken at 60 Hz.

      The EMED-x400 sensor is rectangular and its dimensions are 47.5 cm by 32 cm. Measurements of
      force will be recorded at up to rates of 400 Hz. Foam pieces (included with the EMED
      platform) are constructed around the platform to establish a levelled and safe runway for the
      patient to walk along. The EMED platform is connected to a computer interface which operates
      on the Novel analysis software. The subject will be asked to walk across the mat
      independently at their ordinary pace. The foot is required to land in the centre of the mat,
      at a minimum of three trials per foot10. Plantar pressure recording takes 10-20 minutes for
      each subject.
