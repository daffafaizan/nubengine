    
      Multicentre, prospective, observational study over 3 years.

      Our study will describe the impact of advancing age on the experience of living with HIV in
      England and Ireland. To address this we will establish cohorts of HIV-positive people aged
      >50 and <50 years as well as demographically matched HIV-negative people aged >50 years.

        1. To analyse the incidence and outcomes of co-morbidities in older-HIV-positive people and
           their relationship with demographic/clinical factors.

        2. To evaluate associations between antiretroviral drug concentrations and age, and to
           assess the potential impact of age on drug efficacy, drug-drug interactions and
           co-morbidities.

        3. To contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based recommendations
           for the clinical monitoring of older HIV-positive patients.
