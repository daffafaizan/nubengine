      in silico to achieve statistically improved low blood glucose index (LBGI) within the
      subpopulation of CABG and valve replacement patients who both receive Glucommander-based
      insulin therapy and meet Manufacturer's guidelines for starting with an initial multiplier
      value of .052, without risking clinically significant increase in exposure to hyperglycemia.
