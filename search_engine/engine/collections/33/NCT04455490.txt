      suture. Conventional surgical approach is open surgery in order to clean the wound, which
      requires multiple dressing changes and involves a longer recovery period. We recently
      developed arthroscopic surgery for delayed wound healing after Achilles tendon suture. This
      therapy may be an alternative approach to open surgery.

      Purposes: In this paper we evaluate the long-term efficacy of endoscopic surgery for delayed
      wound healing after Achilles tendon suture.

      Patients and Methods: Clinical data of 4 patients with delayed wound healing after Achilles
      tendon suture who underwent endoscopic surgery from April 2008 to October 2017 at our
      institute were retrospectively analyzed. There were 3 males and 1 females with age of 39-60
      years, the follow-up period was 8-43 months). All the patients had unilateral tendon rupture
      with 3 cases on the left and 1 cases on the right. Scores on Visual analogue scale(VAS) and
      the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale were used. The
      postoperative outcome was evaluated on the basis of Victorian Institute of Sport
      Assessment-Achilles score and Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS).
