      Tissue Resection System is safe and efficacious as a surgical treatment for men with
      symptomatic BPH, allowing a reduction in the post-operative hospitalization. It is expected
      that bipolar TURP will be safe and efficacious for the surgical treatment of BPH and will
      allow a < 24 hour post-operative hospital stay in > 50% of patients undergoing this
      procedure.
