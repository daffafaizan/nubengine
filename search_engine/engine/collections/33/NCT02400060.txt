      I. Pilot test intervention effects on adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) and
      explore trends in the adherence outcomes by demographic and psychosocial factors defined as
      acceptance, continuation, and adherence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility of study design defined as recruitment rate, rate of using intervention as
      instructed, rate of protocol completion, and completion of psycho-social questionnaires which
      have been associated with adherence to AHT in the existing literature (i.e., depression,
      social support, pain, stress, fatigue, quality of life, pill taking attitude and behavior,
      perceived risk of breast cancer recurrence).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Surveying patients and physicians regarding their comments on the intervention components
      (i.e., video, text messaging, and app [application]) and overall study participation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daily text messages reminding them to take AHT and weekly interactive
      surveys delivered by a smart phone app for 3 months.
