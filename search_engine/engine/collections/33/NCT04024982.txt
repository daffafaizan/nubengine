      an anaesthesiologist. Currently, majority of the TEE teaching is being done in the form of
      didactic lectures with only a few teaching centres offering simulation. TEE skill acquisition
      includes both technical and cognitive skills. Most of the studies done in TEE teaching have
      concluded that TEE simulation is an essential part of TEE skill training. The study team
      wanted to find out what is the best sequence of teaching to achieve the maximum skill
      acquisition in TEE.

      In National University Hospital, Singapore, the Cardiac subdivision of anaesthesia
      specialists are accredited in TEE (American or European exams) and perform independent
      decision making in cardiac surgical theatres while the surgery is on-goingto facilitate
      dynamic decision making such as adequacy of valve repair, global LV function and emerging
      complications if any. The study team realised that TEE skills are also required for decisions
      beyond the cardiac surgical theaters where on the spot critical decisions making is required
      eg: in polytrauma and sudden unexplained hypotension or hypoxia in non-cardiac or ICU
      patients.

      There are existing induction modules and prior teaching avenues in the department of
      anaesthesia such as the Cardiac Anaesthesia Simulation Training (CAST) module targeted at
      junior trainee's level. With initiative to equip every practicing anaesthesiologist with the
      vital skill of TEE image acquisition, the department of anaesthesia is launching a teaching
      program that is an in house training session. The study team aims to understand through this
      study the ideal sequence of teaching intervention to facilitate optimal learning and
      retention.
