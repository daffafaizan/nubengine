    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Arm A:

      Cisplatin 60mg/m2 Day 1 + Etoposide 120mg/m2 Day 1,2,3 + Placebo oral daily given
      continuously for the duration of the study

      Arm B:

      Cisplatin 60mg/m2 Day 1 + Etoposide 120mg/m2 Day 1,2,3 + ZD6474 100mg oral daily given
      continuously for the duration of the study

      For both arms, PE and toxicity evaluation prior to each cycle and disease assessment by
      imaging every 2 cycles. Patients with non-PD and acceptable toxicity will continue protocol
      therapy; patients with progressive disease or excessive toxicity will be taken off treatment.
      Cycles will be repeated every 21 days up to a total of 4 cycles.

      ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

      Life Expectancy: Not specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Platelets > 100K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5K/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 x ULN or < 5 x ULN if judged by the investigator
           to be related to liver metastases

        -  Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 x ULN or < 5 x ULN if judged by the investigator to be
           related to liver metastases

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine < 1.5 x ULN or Calculated creatinine clearance of > 45 cc/min using the
           Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No clinically significant cardiac event such as myocardial infarction; New York Heart
           Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease >2 (see SPM) within 3 months prior to
           registration for protocol therapy

        -  No presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the
           risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

        -  No history of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs),
           bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation) which
           is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained
           ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication is permitted.
