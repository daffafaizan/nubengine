    
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuromuscular disease that causes various degrees of disability
      in mobility and functional activities, causing restrictions on the individual's social and
      professional life, creating advanced disability and impairing quality of life. Problems in
      upper limb function affect quality of life and functional independence of the patients.
      Recovery of restricted daily life functions (such as dressing, personal care, eating and body
      care) is one of the main goals of physiotherapy and rehabilitation in MS and currently,
      conventional physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods are most commonly used. The main
      purpose of this method is to reduce pain, increase range of motion and muscle strength. With
      the developing technology various virtual reality applications have begun to take place in
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs recently. These virtual reality applications are
      used to motivate the patient and keep their interest in the rehabilitation. The aim of our
      study is to investigate the effects of game-based virtual reality exercises added to
      conventional physiotherapy and rehabilitation program in patients with MS.
