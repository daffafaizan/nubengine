    
      This retrospective cohort study included 35 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received
      tofacitinib therapy in rheumatology outpatient clinic between June 2015 and December 2019.
      Patients who received tofacitinib due to unresponsiveness to ≥2 conventional synthetic
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or ≥1 biological disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic characteristics of
      the patients, the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (DAS 28-4 (ESR)), change in DAS-28, health assessment questionnaire score,
      visual analogue scale score, and laboratory parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemogram, lipid parameters, and uric acid were
      recorded. The data at six months of treatment were compared with baseline data. The effects
      related to the treatment as well as the undesired consequences were evaluated.
