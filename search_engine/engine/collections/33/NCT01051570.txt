      Primary

        -  To evaluate the time to progression (TTP) achieved with carboplatin and everolimus in
           patients with castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer that progressed after
           docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen.

        -  To assess the PSA response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS) outcome in these patients.

        -  To investigate the association of TTP and PSA response rate with correlative markers,
           such as phospho mTOR, pAKT, and p70S6.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen.

        -  To explore the association of TTP, OS, and circulating tumor tumor cell count.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, oral prednisone twice
      daily on days on days 1-21, and oral everolimus once daily on days 2-21 of course 1 and on
      days 1-21 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically for pharmacodynamic,
      pharmacokinetic, and biomarker analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
