      clinical and neurological rating scales and neuropsychological tests. They are then
      randomized to either standard treatment (including antipsychotic medications, art and
      occupational therapy, psychotherapy) or to standard treatment plus daily computerbased
      cognitive training (COGPACK; ten 1-hour sessions over two weeks). After repetition of the
      broad assessment battery all patients (and some of their family members) take part in a
      bifocal psychoeducation group program (eight 1-hour sessions over four weeks). Specific
      pre-post measures are illness knowledge, self and expert ratings of adherence to treatment,
      insight to the illness, treatment satisfaction. The study also includes a 9-month follow-up,
      with number of rehospitalizations, days in hospital and psychopathology as the primary
      outcome measures.
