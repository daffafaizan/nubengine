      I. Determine the confirmed response rate of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma
      treated with BMS-247550.

      II. Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
      this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response
      receive 2 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
