      main vessel may impact on the risk of developing SBO.

      The objectives of POMPEI study as follows:

      Primary objective:

      To identify correlation between lipid volume content of MV plaque and risk of SBO (TIMI
      flow<3)

      Secondary objectives:

      To identify the plaque morphology characteristics associated with SBO in patients undergoing
      bifurcation PCI. OCT parameters which will be assessed include: distribution of lipid volume
      and lipid arc in the MV and around SB ostium before and after stenting; prevalence of healed
      plaque rupture and erosion and its correlation with SBO; correlation between calcium
      distribution within the plaque and SBO; correlation between bifurcation angle and SBO; and
      correlation between angiographic images of haziness at SB ostium and OCT findings.

      To determine the prevalence of significant SB ostium stenosis in patients undergoing
      bifurcation PCI.

      To determine the incidences of SBO following bifurcation PCI.

      To determine the incidence and extent of peri-procedural myocardial injury and infarction
      following bifurcation PCI.

      To determine correlation between SB lesion extension from the ostium and SBO
