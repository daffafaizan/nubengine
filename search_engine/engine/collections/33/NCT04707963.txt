    
      This is a two-phase study using both novel and conventional methods to assess how PP
      supplementation affects muscle tissue in young adults who engage in resistance training.
      These two phases will be conducted as part of a 10-week randomized controlled trial in which
      men and women aged 18-30 years (n=40), will be stratified by gender and randomized to a
      resistance training intervention (whole body, two days per week) with PP powder (72g daily;
      n=10 males, n=10 females) provided during the intervention (immediate group, IG) or after the
      intervention (wait-list control, WLC, n=10 males, n=10 females). The aims of this study are
      to determine the acute (deuterium oxide tracer) and chronic (peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography) effects of PP during resistance training on skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein
      synthesis rates, changes in skeletal muscle size and quality, changes in whole and
      appendicular body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), changes in inflammatory
      markers and the fecal microbiome.
