      for hoarding disorder. Participants will be randomized to receive either treatment as usual
      (cognitive behavioral therapy: CBT) or treatment as usual augmented by interpersonal
      psychotherapy (IPT). It is hypothesized that group CBT with IPT will result in greater
      decreases in hoarding symptoms, as compared to standard group CBT. It is further hypothesized
      that CBT with IPT will result in greater reductions in object attachment and maladaptive
      beliefs about relationships with others, as well as greater increases in interpersonal
      attachment.
