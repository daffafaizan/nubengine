      the colon using capsule endoscopy, a swallowable device which contains imagers, light
      sources, a power source and a RF transmitter. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System
      include the elimination of the need for conscious sedation, the minimally invasive, painless
      nature of the exam, and the ability to pursue normal daily activities immediately following
      the procedure . This multi-center prospective, cohort study will evaluate the performance of
      PCCE in visualizing the colon. Up to 394 subjects will participate in this study. All
      subjects to be enrolled will be appropriate candidates for standard colonoscopy based on
      their clinical indication.

      Each subject will undergo PCCE. All generated PCCE RAPID videos will be reviewed by blinded
      PCCE reading physicians. All readers, experienced in PillCam SB, will have undergone
      standardized training and passed a qualification test specific to reading and interpreting
      PCCE videos. Training will be done by reading at least 5 cases to demonstrate proficiency in
      interpretation of PCCE. PCCE results will be compared with that of a colonoscopy procedure.

      Following PCCE procedure, standard colonoscopy will be performed by a colonoscopist blinded
      to the results of the PCCE. The colonoscopist will be "unblinded" during the standard
      colonoscopy procedure at three locations on withdrawal of the colonoscope.

      to standard colonoscopy.
