    
      Main objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the time to progression (primary endpoint)
      with the combination of pemetrexed and bevacizumab in recurrent or metastatic head and neck
      cancer; 2) evaluate the objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and
      toxicities associated with the above therapy and 3) collect tumor tissue from previous
      diagnostic procedures and blood specimens prospectively, before and after therapy, for future
      correlative studies.
