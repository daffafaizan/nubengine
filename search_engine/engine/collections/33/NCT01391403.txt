      fluid (CSF) of individuals with schizophrenia have suggested that this organism might be
      involved in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that
      antimicrobial therapy by using an add-on agent together with a well-proven neuroleptic may
      have favorable effects on a subgroup of schizophrenic patients.
