      the importance of preparedness for a large amount of hospitalized quarantined patients in
      isolation, with the extra challenges it brings. The COVID-19 pandemic challenges the Danish
      health care system in many aspects: An increased number of citizens are expected to be
      admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 infected pneumonia and this will demand extra workforce
      resources, extra use of protective equipment (gowns, masks, gloves, etc) and extra time used
      for taking protective equipment on and off. In concert these extra demands will drain the
      health care system and any initiative to reduce these challenges is needed.

      In this randomized controlled trial, isolated patients with diabetes will be randomized to
      either standard care fingerprick glucose + blinded CGM or Dexcom G6 only.
