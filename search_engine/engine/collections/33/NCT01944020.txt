      physical activity, energy intake (EI), and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Patients will be instructed to use CPAP at home each night throughout the 2 mo treatment
      phase. Before and after the 2 mo treatment phase, patients will undergo a 1-d in-lab testing
      period at the Clinical Research Resource (CRR) at Columbia University Medical Center. Upon
      completion of the laboratory phase 1, patients will return home for a 2 mo treatment period,
      followed by the second tracking period including laboratory visit 2.

      Before and at the conclusion of the 2 mo treatment phase, patients will enter the laboratory
      at the Columbia University Medical Center for a 1-d period. Patients will arrive at ~0800 h
      and will remain in the laboratory for the following 24 h. Blood will be sampled in the
      fasting state in the morning, and will be assayed for select appetite-regulating hormones
      (leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, glucagon-like peptide-1). We will also assess body
      composition. During the laboratory day, ad libitum EI will be measured for each treatment
      phase. Breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner will be served at the standard times, but each
      meal item will be served in excess such that patients will be able to eat as much or as
      little of each food as they choose. Additional snack choices will also be freely available
      during the wake episode.

      There will also be a control group of individuals with OSA who do not use CPAP who are
      studied at baseline and again after a 2 month period in procedures similar to those
      undergoing treatment.
