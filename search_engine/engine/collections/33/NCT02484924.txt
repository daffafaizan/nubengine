      between potency of platelet inhibition and risk of bleeding. Ticagrelor provides faster and
      more effective platelet inhibition than Clopidogrel. In the PLATO trial Ticagrelor reduced
      the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke compared to
      Clopidogrel after ACS (acute coronary syndrome). Although there was no difference in overall
      bleeding there was more non-CABG related major bleeding with Ticagrelor. It has since been
      recommended, in addition to aspirin, in treatment of moderate-high risk ACS by both ESC
      (European Society of Cardiology) and NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence). There
      has been widespread adoption as first line therapy in UK hospitals. There remains potential
      concern about bleeding in a "real world" population compromising more high risk patients;
      particularly more elderly and female, than those in PLATO. The investigators intend to
      perform a large "real world" comparison of bleeding risk with Ticagrelor compared to
      Clopidogrel in a UK ACS population. The investigators plan an observational cohort study of
      patients presenting with ACS at 5 district general hospitals in Merseyside and Cheshire. The
      investigators will collect data retrospectively on 2500 patients treated with Clopidogrel
      prior to the guideline change and 2500 treated with Ticagrelor thereafter. The primary end
      point will be incidence of BARC 3-5 (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) and PLATO major
      bleeding.
