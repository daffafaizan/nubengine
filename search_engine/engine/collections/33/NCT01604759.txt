      spectra over the visible optical region on a site of interest in the subject's mouth,
      including lesional mucosa, normal adjacent and contralateral mucosa. The site for placement
      of the probe will be determined by the examiner, an experienced Oral Pathologist. The probe
      examination will take no more than 15 minutes in addition to the subject's appointment time
      for their routine visits.

      A 4um unstained tissue section from surgery or biopsy, part of their scheduled care, will be
      requested for quantitative histological analysis. The morphometric parameters obtained from
      polarized reflectance measurements will be compared with the histology and quantitative
      pathology (nuclear phenotype score) from the tissue sections from the lesion. The collected
      spectra data from normal looking areas from adjacent normal looking mucosa and contralateral
      mucosa will be used to determine patient to patient variation in the polarized reflectance of
      oral mucosa.
