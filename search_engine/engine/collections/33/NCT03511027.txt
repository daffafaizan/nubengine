      adherence to reducing hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, interventions
      for promoting good adherence should be pursued. To this end, a number of devices have been
      developed to promote medication adherence, though with limited success due to reliability,
      cost, etc. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Karie Automated
      Medication Delivery Device in enhancing medication adherence among a group of
      community-dwelling patients immediately following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.

      This study will utilize a multi-site randomized controlled trial design. One week prior to
      discharge from inpatient rehab, consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      medication self-management education only (SME) or medication self-management education +
      Karie (SME+K). Both sites (West Park Healthcare Centre, and CapitalCare) will recruit 150
      participants for the study. At each site, 75 patients will be in the intervention group (SME
      + Karie) and 75 will be in the control group (SME only).
