      till now. Moreover, PRO data in patients treated for refractory/relapsed HL with BV,
      including long-term effects of BV on patient's QoL in a real-world setting are lacking.

      The goal of this is study is focusing on assessment of patient-reported outcomes in terms of
      QoL and symptom profileas well on evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety of BV in
      patients with refractory/resistant HL in a real-world setting.

      For PROs assessment QoL and symptom data will be received from patients' reports before and
      at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after BV treatment start and in 3 months at follow-up (15 months after
      base-line). The maximum duration of PRO monitoring - 15 months. To evaluate PROs the
      followings tools will be used: RAND SF-36 for quality of life assessment, Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment System (ESAS-R) for symptom assessment and Patient Global Impression of Change
      (PGIC) for assessment of a patient's belief about the effect of treatment.

      For evaluation of response rates, duration of response, PFS and for analysis of AEs/SAEs
      during BV treatment the clinical data will be collected from health records at base-line, at
      3, 6, 9, 12 months after BV treatment start and at 15 months of follow-up or till the last
      dose of BV.

      No randomization and stratification will be applied. The analysis of primary (PROs
      assessment) and secondary outcomes (clinical outcomes) will be provided in the total patient
      population (n=70) and in two subgroups. The subgroups of interest will be: patients with
      relapsed or refractory HL who are not candidates for ASCT with prescribed treatment with BV
      as â‰¥2nd line therapy, and patients with relapse after ASCT with prescribed treatment with BV.
