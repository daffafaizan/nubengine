      to subjects with head and neck cancer suffering from mucositis, a common adverse event of
      radiation therapy and chemoradiation therapy. Ketamine is a schedule III controlled substance
      that is generally used to provide anesthesia for short diagnostic and surgical procedures.

      Ten subjects will be randomized to two treatment arms. Group A will receive ketamine on
      Monday, placebo on Wednesday, and ketamine on Friday. Group B will receive placebo on Monday,
      ketamine on Wednesday, and placebo on Friday. Each subject will swish the study drug or
      placebo for 2 minutes and spit it out. The use of non-maintenance mucositis medications such
      as DLM solution will not be allowed during the clinic visit. Subjects may resume
      non-maintenance mucositis medications at home.

      Subjects will be asked to document adverse effects and pain scores at 30, 45, and 60 minutes
      after study medication. The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) will be used to
      determine a subject's sedation level, if necessary. Treatment will last for up to 6 weeks
      unless an illness or an event occurs that prevents continuation, intolerance to the agent,
      adverse events, resolution of mucositis pain, or the decision to withdraw from the study.
