      I. Test whether the complete response rate among older patients with previously untreated
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality treated with
      lenalidomide is sufficiently high to warrant a phase III investigation.

      II. Estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of this drug in these patients.

      III. Correlate, in a preliminary manner, additional cytogenetic abnormalities with response
      to lenalidomide.

      IV. Estimate the total (complete and partial) response rate and the cytogenetic response rate
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14, 1-21, or 1-28
      (course 1). Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy on day 28 or 35 to assess treatment efficacy.
      Patients with stable or improving disease (i.e., a decrease in blast percentage) without
      progressive disease proceed to maintenance therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning within 42 days after completion of induction therapy, patients
      receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
