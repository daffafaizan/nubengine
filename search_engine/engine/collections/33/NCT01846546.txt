      drainage of CSF were included in the study. Patients delivered within 4 h whose highest
      abbreviated injury score was 3 or less (other than head injury) were considered to be
      isolated TBI cases and were included. To avoid interfering factors, patients who suffered
      open or combined injuries, had existing prior neurological disease were excluded. Those who
      died within the first week of hospitalization and/or whose serial cerebrospinal fluid samples
      could not be obtained were also excluded as having incomplete data. Accordingly, 30 patients
      were analyzed in this study. Demographic data, including age, gender, mechanism of trauma and
      GCS score at admission were documented when the patients arrived at the emergency room. The
      control group comprised 20 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was examined via lumbar
      puncture for investigation of suspected neurological disease. All patients had normal
      neurological examination, negative imaging studies, and none had evidence of trauma or
      preexisting neurological disease, including tumors, vascular anomalies, or abnormalities of
      cerebrospinal fluid. The study had approval from the hospital ethics committee and informed
      consent for participating in the study was obtained from an appropriate member of each
      patient's family before performance of lumbar drainage.
