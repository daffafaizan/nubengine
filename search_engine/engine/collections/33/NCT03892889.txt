    
      This is a phase 3b, open-label, prospective, clinical trial designed to assess the difference
      between inpatient psychiatric hospitalization rates in subjects on oral standard-of-care
      antipsychotic treatment(s) for a period of 6 months followed by a switch to Abilify MyCite
      for a period of 3 months (Months 1 to 3). At the Month 3 visit, the investigator should
      decide if subjects will continue on Abilify MyCite for an additional 3 months (Months 4 to 6)
      or switch to a standard-of-care treatment for the duration of treatment. This trial will
      include male and female subjects who are 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, with a diagnosis
      of schizophrenia. Subjects must have had at least 1 inpatient psychiatric hospitalization
      within 4 years (48 months) and must have been prescribed oral antipsychotics for at least 6
      months or longer prior to screening. Subjects will enter a screening period (up to 45 days).
      If deemed eligible to participate, subjects will enter an open-label Abilify MyCite treatment
      prospective phase for up to 6 months. All subjects who complete or withdraw from the trial
      while on Abilify MyCite will receive a telephone call for safety follow-up approximately 30
      days after their last trial visit. The trial will be conducted at 75 sites in the United
      States, 493 subjects will be screened in order to enroll 320 subjects and complete 224
      subjects.
