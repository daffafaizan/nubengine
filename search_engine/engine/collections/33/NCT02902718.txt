      regions including the face. The device uses Elōs technology which is a combination of
      electrical field at radio frequencies (RF) and intense optical energy that are simultaneously
      applied to the tissue and were found to have synergistic effects. Elōs technology has been
      used at the clinic for non-ablative skin rejuvenation. The levels of Elōs energy used with
      the professional devices at the clinic is much higher than the level of energy used by the mē
      device for home use. The current study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the mē device for home-use non-ablative skin rejuvenation. Healthy female volunteers, seeking
      facial skin rejuvenation treatment will be enrolled.

      The study includes up to 7 visits at the clinic. The defined areas for treatment are one or
      more facial sub areas (e.g., forehead, peri-orbital, cheeks, peri oral). Subjects will be
      provided with the device and will be instructed as to the method of usage. The subjects will
      perform treatments at the clinic and at home according to the schedule detailed in the
      intervention section. Follow ups will take place at the 1 and 2 months visits. Optional
      additional follow up visits will take place 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment.
      Evaluations will include skin safety, tolerability of the procedure, improvement assessment
      by the study doctor and subject, satisfaction. Optionally, before/after pictures of follow-up
      visits vs baseline will be sent to blinded evaluators.
