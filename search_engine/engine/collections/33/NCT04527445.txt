      and consent will be included in this study. Placement of the lead in the operating room with
      fluoroscopy is the standard of care in this procedure. Fluoroscopy is performed with a C-arm
      and there are settings that change the radiation exposure. Patients scheduled to undergo lead
      placement will be randomized to: a) the investigational (reduced radiation with fluoroscopic
      settings) or b. the control (conventional fluoroscopy).

      The surgeon can change fluoroscopy radiation exposure by changing C-arm settings from the
      reduced radiation to conventional fluoroscopic options. During the surgery, the surgeon may
      change the settings from reduced radiation (intervention) to conventional fluoroscopy
      (control) to safely place lead. The surgeon will use their judgment to optimally place lead
      and maintain safety during placement. Any deviation from randomization will be recorded.

      The intervention arm is defined: Reduced radiation fluoroscopy technique is performed by the
      C-arm set at 1 pulses-per-second and reduction of current.

      The control arm is defined: The standard of care in the conventional fluoroscopy, the C-arm
      is set at 30 pulses-per-second and the current set at the default.
