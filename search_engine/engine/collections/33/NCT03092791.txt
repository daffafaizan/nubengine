      This study will look at the safety, tolerability of sIPV in healthy adults, toddlers and
      infants as well as safety and immunogenicity in toddlers and infants. .

      The study will enroll approximately 340 participants including 40 adults, 60 toddlers and 240
      infants. Adult participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups-which will remain undisclosed to study doctor and participants during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Placebo (saline control - 0.9% sodium chloride)

      Toddler participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Reference IPV

      Infant participants will be randomly assigned to one of following treatment groups:

        -  sIPV Low Dose

        -  sIPV Medium Dose

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Reference IPV Adults and toddlers will receive intramuscular injection on Day 1. Infants
           will receive intramuscular injection on Days 1, 29, 57 and 365.

      This is a multicentre trial. The overall time to participate in this study for adult is 8
