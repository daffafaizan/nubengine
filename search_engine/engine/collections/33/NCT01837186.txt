      especially if associated with an underlying fistula. Whilst the perioperative mortality of
      pneumonectomy overall is now less than 5%, this rises to around 25% when complicated by
      empyema, and about 50% when associated with fistula. In addition, there is the morbidity and
      social cost of long-term drainage, chronic sepsis and often multiple operations.
