      normal diet group (ND) with a traditional meal pattern. The two diets were isocaloric and
      included the same amount of protein per kg of body weight; but differed in the distribution
      of fats and carbohydrates; the latter were kept below 5% daily (less than 50g/day) in the KD
      group while represented 55% of the caloric intake in the WD group During the experimental
      period, training loads were similar in the two groups. Athletes were tested before and after
      8 weeks of the intervention. Body composition , basal metabolism, muscle strength and blood
      parameters were measured.
