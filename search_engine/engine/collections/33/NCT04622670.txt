      I. Establish feasibility of delivering a yoga therapy program during chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy (CRT) for loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer undergoing
      chemo-radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the effects and variance of yoga on fatigue, depression, anxiety, pelvic pain and
      over-all quality of life (QOL) in cervical cancer (CxCa) patients undergoing primary
      treatment with CRT.

      II. Examine changes in other psychosocial outcomes including ability to find meaning in the
      illness, spirituality and sexuality.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate whether markers of stress response (plasma levels of other pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, including interleukin-6 [IL-6], and IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, and CRP) change in response
      to yoga therapy and their association with fatigue, depression, anxiety, pelvic pain, meaning
      in the illness, experience, spirituality, and QOL in CxCa patients undergoing primary CRT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (YOGA GROUP): Patients attend at least 2 yoga classes per week over 5-6 weeks lasting
      approximately 60 minutes each for up to 15 classes during the CRT. Patients also complete
      surveys pre-treatment, once a week, and post-treatment over 5-10 minutes and receive a yoga
      manual and DVD during and after CRT.

      GROUP II (WAIT LIST CONTROL): Patients refrain from participating in any new stress
      management activities and receive a DVD. Patients are also offered 4 group yoga classes after
      3 months of CRT. Patients also complete surveys as in Group I.
