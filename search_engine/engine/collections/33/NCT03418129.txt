      treatments for chronic pain, for post-9/11 veterans with co-occuring pain and TBI. Three
      hundred participants will be scheduled for a baseline interview at the Duke Behavioral Health
      and Technology Lab after passing a preliminary telephone screen. After providing informed
      consent, participants will provide data on clinical measures. Electroencephalography (EEG)
      will be used to measure brain activity. Following data collection, participants will be
      assigned to one of three groups (n=100 in each). Each group will receive an iPod Touch with a
      different mobile application (app), which participants will be instructed to use for 10
      minute a day, 4 times a week for 12 weeks. Study coordinators will conduct two home visits
      (week 1 and week 6) and two phone calls (week 3 and week 9) to reinforce training,
      troubleshoot difficulties, and ask about intervention utilization. Follow-up data on clinical
      measures and EEG will be collected at 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks.
