      volunteers, minimum of 14 of each gender. Two doses of study medication will be given as
      single doses on two separate treatment visits. A washout of at least 48 hours will separate
      the treatment visits. Each visit will include an overnight fast at the clinic and 19 blood
      samples drawn for pharmacokinetic analyses. Tolerability of the treatments will be evaluated
      in terms of reported and observed adverse events (AE).
