    
      Patients exhibiting a genetically determined disorder (DPYD*2A) in the metabolic degradation
      of the frequently used anticancer agents capecitabine and 5-FU (fluoropyrimidines) are at
      high risk of development of severe and life-threatening toxicity during standard treatment
      with these compounds. Treatment and recovery of this fluoropyrimidine-induced severe toxicity
      often requires prolonged periods of hospitalization.

      Screening for DPYD*2A in patients to treat with fluoropyrimidine drugs with subsequent dose
      adjustments in mutant individuals prior to start of therapy will possibly reduce the number
      of severe toxicity events. Furthermore, by reducing the frequency and/or duration of
      hospitalization, substantial medical costs can be saved, making this a cost-effective
      strategy.
