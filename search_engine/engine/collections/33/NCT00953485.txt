    
      -  To test a new approach using allogeneic derived mesenchymal stem cell based therapy
           (MSCT) to treat refractory primary Sj√∂gren's Syndrome (pSS)

        -  To determine the disease-free survival in pSS patients treated with MSCT in terms of
           disease activity index, pSS serology and salivary gland function

        -  To assess adverse events of allogeneic MSC transplantation

        -  To assess the association of disease activity index, pSS serology levels, and saliva
           flow rate at baseline with disease-free survival
