        -  Compare the response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival in women with
           unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with two different
           schedules of docetaxel or paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the toxicities and pharmacoeconomics of these four regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these four regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, age,
      ECOG performance status, hormone receptor status (positive vs negative), metastasis to liver
      (yes vs no), and presence of disease progression following anthracyclines (yes vs no).

      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      Courses repeat every 3 weeks (arms I and II) or every 8 weeks (arms III and IV) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment and then every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 165 patients will be accrued for this study.
