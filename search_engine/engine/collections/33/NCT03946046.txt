    
      Open label non-randomised controlled clinical trial comparing clinical localization
      techniques and ultrasonography to guide injections of Botulinum toxin A.

      The primary outcome is to compare both techniques of injection regarding to the health impact
      of cervical dystonia (CDIP-58) measured 1 month after injection.

      The results of this clinical trial will help the clinician to decide which strategy of
      injection is the most effective in terms of benefit/risk ratio to treat the cervical
      dystonia.
