      Hong Kong. Treatment with interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) can reduce the risk of
      HCC. NA is the commonest used medication in Hong Kong. However, most patients require
      long-term treatment and premature drug cessation may lead to hepatitis relapse.

      Under the current regional guidelines, patients who have positive hepatitis B e antigen
      (HBeAg) treated by NA can consider stopping treatment if HBeAg seroconversion has developed
      for at least 12 months. However, up to 30-50% of patients may develop virological relapse
      and/or HBeAg reversion after cessation of treatment. On the other hand, interferon-based
      treatment has a much more durable response. HBeAg seroconversion is maintained in 80% of
      patients after successful treatment with peginterferon. Upon long-term follow-up,
      peginterferon-treated patients are also more likely to achieve hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) seroclearance, a condition closest to a cure of chronic hepatitis B.
