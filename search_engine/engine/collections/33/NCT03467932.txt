      across a dose range for up to 12 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      There are two cohorts in this study. Approximately 360 subjects with T2DM will initially
      undergo a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period (Visits 1 and 2), followed by a 12-week
      treatment period (Visits 3 through 9). Cohort A will enroll 285 subjects; Cohort B will
      enroll 75 subjects

      For 265 of the 285 subjects of Cohort A, the total 12-week treatment period will include a
      Part 1"dose escalation" interval (2 weeks, Visits 3 and 4) and a Part 2 stable dose
      "maintenance" interval (10 weeks, Visits 5 through 9).

      In addition, per FDA request, the remaining 20 subjects (of the cohort total of 285 enrolled
      subjects) will receive excipient-matched placebo in a non-randomized single-blind fashion,
      TID, according to the same schedule as described above.

      For Cohort B (75 of the 360 total subjects), the total 12-week treatment period will include
      a stable dosing period for both Part 1 (2 weeks, Visits 3 and 4) and Part 2 (10 weeks, Visits
      5 through 9).

      Cohort A data will be analyzed after Cohort A data collection has been completed (last
      subject for Cohort A screened on 7 May 2019). Estimated completion for Cohort A is October
      2019. Cohort B data will be analyzed following the release of results from Cohort A.
