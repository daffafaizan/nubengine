    
      The investigators will assess childhood infectious disease morbidity and macrolide resistance
      over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive biannual oral
      azithromycin to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo.

      Randomization of Treatment Allocation. In each site, 30 communities within a contiguous area
      of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized into the azithromycin or placebo arm.
      The investigators will use a simple random sample separately for each study site, but without
      stratification or block randomization within the site. These communities are being randomized
      from the same pool of communities eligible for a sister trial (Mortality Reduction After Oral
      Azithromycin (MORDOR) - Morbidity Study).

      Specific Aims

      Specific Aim 1: To assess whether macrolide resistance is greater in a population-based
      community sample of pre-school children, or in a clinic-based sample of ill pre-school
      children

      Specific Aim 2: To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatments of pre-school
      children can eliminate ocular chlamydia in a hypoendemic area

      Specific Aim 3: To assess the diversity of the microbiome of the nasopharynx, nares,
      conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract
