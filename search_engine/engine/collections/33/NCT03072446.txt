      to 30 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Gel-Bead. Prospectively. Enrolled Gel-Bead
      subjects will be followed at 1-month and 3-months post-procedure.

      Data from subjects treated with Gel-Bead will be compared to data from a previously
      unpublished, but widely presented, 100-patient cohort study at the University Hospital
      Southampton. This study evaluated 20 subjects in five different treatment groups for the
      treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. The five treatment groups include gelatin foam
      slurry, Embospheres, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Bead Block and Embozenes.
