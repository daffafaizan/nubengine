    
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CloudCath System to detect the
      onset of peritonitis as compared to standard of care.

      Study Participants will connect the CloudCath System to their home peritoneal dialysis unit
      and the CloudCath System will analyze the effluent dialysis solution for changes associated
      with peritonitis. The notification capability of the CloudCath System will be deactivated for
      this study so that neither Study Participants nor Study Investigators will be aware of the
      device measurements.

      Following enrollment, Study Participants will use the CloudCath System for 12 continuous
      months.
