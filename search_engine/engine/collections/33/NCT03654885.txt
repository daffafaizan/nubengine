      evaluate the ability of XEN to reduce IOP and reduce the amount of topical IOP-lowering
      medications in subjects poorly controlled on topical therapy. Patients will be randomized
      2:1, resulting in approximately 190 eyes being implanted with XEN and approximately 95 eyes
      will be receiving trabeculectomy. Subjects will be screened for enrollment and eligible
      candidates will be approached to ascertain interest in study participation. Study duration
      will be approximately 12 months.
