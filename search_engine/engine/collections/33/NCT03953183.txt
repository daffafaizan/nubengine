    
      This is a study of daily use of up to 15 P3P products over one month, including 2 confinement
      periods (2 overnight stays at the beginning of the study and 1 overnight stay at the end of
      the exposure period). During the confinement visits, nicotine PK from P3P exposure will be
      assessed as well as pharmacodynamic effects related to craving, sensory parameters, product
      experience, and product acceptance.

      Between the two confinement periods, subjects will return to the investigational site for
      weekly ambulatory visits during which P3P will be resupplied and selected safety and other
      study assessments will be performed.

      From the start of the exposure period onwards, subjects will be instructed not to smoke or
      use other tobacco or nicotine containing products and to use P3P exclusively.
