    
      This study is a single-center, prospective, observational study designed to enroll 50
      subjects presenting with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndromes requiring
      treatment of de novo lesions. Consented subjects are to undergo PCI and have a lesion without
      angiographic calcification.

      Eligible subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for BVS scaffold implant will
      have a BVS-specific implantation protocol with high pressure post-scaffold implantation
      ballooning, designed to specifically address the issue of incomplete BVS expansion. Because
      the scaffold is compliant, a perfectly embedded scaffold is sometimes observed in a lesion
      with soft plaque, resulting in a smaller intra-luminal scaffold volume that may reduce the
      event rate. Enrolled subjects will have OCT ( optical coherence tomography ) pre and post BVS
      implantation to assess the change in the intraluminal scaffold volume and the prevalence of
      scaffold embedding from post-scaffold implantation (using the moderate pressure of 12 atm) to
      post-dilation high pressure (16-20 atm), non-compliant ballooning in relation to the
      underlying plaque.
