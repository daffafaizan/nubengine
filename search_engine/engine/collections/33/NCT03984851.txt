    
      Tonsillectomy is one of the commonest procedures performed in otolaryngology and one of its
      major complications is post-tonsillectomy bleeding.

      The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Surgicel without bipolar cautery in
      achieving primary hemostasis in tonsillectomy.

      The study was a retrospective cohort in three tertiary care centers in xxxx, from January
      2016 to August 2018. All patients underwent at least tonsillectomy, with a proportion
      undergoing additional adenoidectomy, myringotomy, or tube insertion as indicated, were
      enrolled in the study. Patients were stratified to 2 groups according to the surgeons
      preference for the hemostasis technique, one was subjected to cold dissection tonsillectomy
      and achieved hemostasis via the application of Surgicel to the surgical site, and the other
      underwent cold dissection tonsillectomy and attained hemostasis through bipolar cautery.
