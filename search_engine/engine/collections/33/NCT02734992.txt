      headaches mostly via avoidance of external and internal headache triggers. Despite the wide
      use of avoidance in headache management, very little empirical evidence exists to support its
      effectiveness. Attempts at avoiding headache triggers or other internal private experiences
      associated with a headache, may increase trigger potency, restrict lifestyle, decrease
      internal locus of control, and exacerbate and maintain pain perception. New treatment
      approaches, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), emphasize acceptance and valued
      living as alternatives to avoidance. Though ACT is an empirically supported treatment for
      chronic pain, there is limited evidence for its efficacy for head pain, and this evidence is
      afflicted with methodological limitations that need to be overcome before making conclusions
      as to the effectiveness of ACT for headaches. The purpose of the present study is to examine
      in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) whether an ACT-based intervention for headache
      sufferers, added to Medical Treatment as Usual, decreases disability and improves the quality
      of life, compared to only Wait List Control (WL). Pre, post and 3-months group changes will
      be assessed. Patients participating in the ACT group will be monitored for a year period.
