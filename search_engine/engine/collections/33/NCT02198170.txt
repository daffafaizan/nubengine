    
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study consisting of
      two phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will have two
      periods: Screening and Baseline 1. The Randomization Phase will have two periods: Treatment
      Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 with a Baseline 2 assessment prior to Treatment Period 2. In
      the Randomization Phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two possible treatment
      sequences (placebo/ketoconazole or ketoconazole/placebo). Ketoconazole 400 mg or placebo will
      be orally administered once daily for the first four days of each treatment period. On the
      fifth day of each treatment period, in addition to ketoconazole/placebo, 5 mg lenvatinib will
      be orally administered. Ketoconazole/placebo administration will then continue for 13
      additional days. Subjects are crossed over from Treatment Period 1 to Treatment Period 2
      after a 2-week washout.
