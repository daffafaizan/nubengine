      into oxalate. The origin of urinary oxalate is of interest as calcium oxalate is a main
      component of kidney stones. In the rare disease primary hyperoxaluria, excessive production
      of oxalate by the body results in frequent kidney stones and can cause loss of kidney
      function. Primary hyperoxaluria is caused by deficiencies in one of several enzymes involved
      in the glycolate pathway.

      This study will seek to determine how much oxalate is formed from glycolate in normal
      subjects. After consuming a controlled diet, subjects will either ingest or have an
      intravenous infusion of carbon 13 glycolate, a stable isotope of glycolate that can be
      tracked and will also label downstream metabolic products. Blood and urine samples will be
      assessed for their amounts of labeled glycolate and labeled oxalate to provide an accurate
      measure of how much oxalate is made from normal glycolate breakdown in healthy human
      subjects.
