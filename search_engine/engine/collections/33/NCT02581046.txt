      to reduce the world's burden of avoidable blindness, because it is an important treatable
      cause of visual handicap in childhood throughout the world. Successful management of
      childhood cataract is dependent on individualized treatment strategies and postoperative
      supervision for adverse complication is also essential. The timing of surgery of childhood
      cataract depends on the etiology and on the degree of visual interference. Severe bilateral
      cataracts with significant obstruction of the visual axis must be treated and surgery is
      recommended as soon as possible after discovery.

      Several previous studies claimed that ideally cataracts should be removed before 3 months of
      age, while the result of recent researches shows that too early intervention for cataract
      surgery seems aggressive and would cause serious complications, which might cause poor
      long-term visual outcomes. Therefore, in order to control childhood blindness and severe
      visual impairment in China, it is of great importance to ensure that pediatric patients with
      cataract could have good timing of surgery, postoperative rigorous supervision, accurate
      optical rehabilitation and comprehensive treatment of amblyopia.

      In this trial, we aimed to compare the difference of postoperative outcome between surgical
      timing at age of 3 month and 6 month. Patients enrolled into the study will be followed for
      two year and will have study visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
      12 months, 18months and 24months after cataract surgery.
