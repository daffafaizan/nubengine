      program on the reduction in the frequency of medical attention errors in intensive pediatric
      therapies in the public hospitals setting. Secondary: 1) Measure the effect of the
      intervention in increasing the frequency of use of key elements of high quality verbal and
      written communication during the transfer of patients by health professionals. 2) To explore
      the effect of the intervention on the culture of patient safety among health professionals
      who assist pediatric patients in areas of clinical hospitalization. Material and Methods:
      Design: Staged clinical trial (Stepped Wedge) Duration: 9 months (progressive enrollment of 2
      participating units every 2 months). Scope: Pediatric Intensive Care Units Subjects: health
      professionals involved in transfers in each institution. Intervention: Implementation of a
      multi-faceted evidence-based transfer package (I-PASS速) that has already been adapted for use
      in Argentina. The program includes multiple components, including educational training,
      implementation of a mnemonic verbal and written delivery rule I-PASS速, live observations of
      transfers to drive continuous improvement of the quality of intervention, through the
      feedback and a campaign of visual reinforcement materials to ensure sustainability. Events of
      interest: acceptance of the intervention. Frequency of preventable damages associated with
      medical care measured with GAPPS速 as screening tools. Safety culture survey. Length of the
      transfer before and after the intervention.
