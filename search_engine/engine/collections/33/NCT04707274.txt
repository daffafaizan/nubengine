      physical function and sleep, and is characterized by pain and tenderness over the greater
      trochanter.Clinical risk factors for the development of this condition include advanced age,
      female gender, back pain, overweight / obesity, poor abductor hip function, altered gait
      parameters, and psychological distress. The Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment for
      Gluteal tendinopathy (VISA-G) Questionnaire has recently designed as a patient-reported
      condition-specific outcome measurement tool to assess disability due to tendinopathy. VISA-G
      is scored between 0 and 100 (a higher score is expected) and consists of eight items covering
      three main areas (pain, function, and current activity level). Visual analog score for pain
      (0-10), the effect of pain on weight-bearing activities (0-30), and difficulty and / or
      function-related stairs use, including lying on the symptomatic side (0-10), climbing ramps
      (0-10), standing up without sitting (0-10), home or garden work (0-10) and regular exercise
      (0-10), physical activity and sports participation (0-10) are evaluated. The study is planned
      with 40 individuals with gluteal tendinopathy. After questioning the sociodemographic
      characteristics of the individuals, the patients will be asked to fill in VISA-G, Short
      Form-36, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Numeric Rating Scale, Oswestry
      Disability Index, Oxford Hip Score and modified Harris Hip Score.Test-retest will be
      re-applied to those of the same individuals who can be reached after 1 week. The results will
      be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer package program.
