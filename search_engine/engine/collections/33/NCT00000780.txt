    
      Little is known about HIV-infected adolescents as a group and, as a result, small numbers of
      them are currently enrolled in ACTG drug studies. Creative approaches are needed to encourage
      enrollment of HIV-infected adolescents whose socio-demographic profile has made access to
      NIH-sponsored research unlikely.

      At entry and at every subsequent visit, participants are systematically evaluated for
      eligibility and willingness to enter ACTG (or other NIH-sponsored) HIV treatment protocols
      from a menu developed and updated by the Pediatric Adolescent Working Group of the ACTG. A
      survey of participant attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs is administered and updated
      semiannually. Participants attend clinic visits every 3 months and are followed for a minimum
      of 6 months, until the end of the study. They receive periodic physical exams, STD and
      gynecologic or genitourinary evaluations, HIV symptom assessment and related diagnoses, TB
      evaluation, and laboratory tests (hematology and immunology).
