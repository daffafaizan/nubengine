      assessment of cervical dilation and effacement are crucial in recognizing a normal labor from
      and abnormal one. To enhance accuracy and precision among healthcare providers working on
      Labor and Delivery we have created a high fidelity cervical exam simulator. All providers
      working on Labor and Delivery Repetitive will be required to practice on the simulators until
      a pre-specified level or accuracy is achieved. We will prospectively and retrospectively
      assess the number of cervical exams a women receives and the discrepancy between exams
      performed by 2 different providers both before and after the training is instituted.
