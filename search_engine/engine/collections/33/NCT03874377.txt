    
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether it is feasible to integrate a brief,
      adjunctive mindfulness intervention with the standard medical management of obesity in
      adolescents with severe obesity. Mindfulness refers to the experience of paying attention to
      the present moment in a nonjudgmental manner. Mindfulness training enhances one's ability to
      cope with negative emotions and one's awareness of decision-making processes and internal
      experiences.

      The proposed study has two specific aims: 1) to conduct a single arm open trial to examine
      the feasibility and acceptability of the mindfulness intervention in a sample of 15
      adolescents with severe obesity; and 2) to examine the preliminary efficacy of the
      mindfulness intervention on BMI, emotion regulation, eating and weight-related behaviors,
      impulsivity, waist circumference, and blood pressure in comparison to the standard of care.
