      about 34 patients (17 patients per arm). Patients will be randomized to receive either
      prednisone 50 mg po x10 days or an identical looking placebo x10 days. Photographs of the
      polyps will be taken prior to the intervention, on the day of surgery and in the follow-up
      visit. Symptom survey (SNOT22) will also be administered at these same time points. Blood
      loss will be determined volumetrically from the suction canister and by using the Wormald
      Surgical field grading scale. Surgeons will also complete a survey postoperatively evaluating
      visibility, difficulty and ease of surgery. At 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months,
      patients will again fill out the Sino-nasal Outcome Test - 22 (SNOT-22) and the surgeon will
      do an endoscopic assessment by using the Peri-Operative Sinus Endoscopy (POSE) scoring system
      .
