      I. To determine if early oral supplementation improves nutritional status, decreases length
      of hospital stay, and shortens time to engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Serum albumin, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and the degree of mucositis, as scored by the
      National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), a validated and widely
      accepted scale used for rating mucositis. The purpose of our secondary aims is to observe a
      potential correlation between the retrospective and prospective groups, as well as assess the
      need for future research based on these correlations.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive Boost Plus orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or Pro-Stat 101 PO BID
      beginning one week before scheduled HSCT and continuing until hospital discharge. If
      participants do not tolerate the Boost Plus or Pro-Stat, they receive a milkshake PO once
      daily (QD) as an alternative.
