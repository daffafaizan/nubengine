      and estimating the effect size of a new computerized Motivational Enhancement Therapy (cMET)
      intervention for alcohol-involved adolescent primary care patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that 1) cMET, when added to Computerized Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention
      (cASBI), (cASBI+cMET) will be feasible and acceptable when used in primary care; and 2) 12-
      to 18-yr old patients receiving cASBI+cMET will have lower rates of any alcohol use, days of
      alcohol use, drinks per drinking day, and days of heavy episodic drinking, than cASBI alone.
