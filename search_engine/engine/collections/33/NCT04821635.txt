      from cardiovascular pathologies, compared to the same age groups of the general population.
      It is the hypoactivity induced by neurological impairment that is implicated in the first
      place in the pathogenesis of these abnormalities. The search for training methods adapted to
      these patients is justified to limit cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      The aim of this project is to measure the increase in aerobic physical and metabolic
      capacities with a 6-month training on a rower assisted by electrostimulation of lower limbs
      in a population of adults with stabilized paraplegia (non-walkers), of traumatic origin.

      Study is divided in two 3-month phases. The first consists on a training on a rowing machine
      with solicitation of the electrostimulated lower limbs only for a period of 3 months at the
      rate of 3 sessions of 30 minutes per week. The second consists on a training on a rowing
      machine with solicitation of the electrostimulated lower limbs and upper for a period of 3
      months at the rate of 3 sessions of 30 minutes per week. The evaluations are composed of the
      measurement of maximum oxygen consumption, muscle and neurological parameters
