    
      Patients : 20 obese patients (defined by BMI over 30 kg/m2) ongoing for spontaneous breathing
      trial and clinically ready for immediate extubation will be enrolled after obtaining their
      consents. Material : An oeso-gastric double balloon catheter will be inserted in order to
      record oesophageal and gastric pressure and to calculate Work of Breathing and Pressure Time
      Product. Pulmonary Volumes will be recorded by a pneumotachograph. Functional Residual
      Capacity will be recorded thanks to the azote double dilution technique used by the Engstr√∂m
      respiratory care station.Study Protocol : When physicians in charge of the patient decided
      that the patient is ready to be weaned and to have a SBT before extubation, the patient will
      be included in the study. Before extubation, patients will be placed under 5 different
      spontaneous breathing trials conditions in the same order : 7 cm H2O continuous positive
      airway pressure, T piece,7 cmH2O of pressure support, 0 cmH20 of pressure support and 7 cm
      H2O pressure support ventilation with 7 cmH20 of end expiratory pressure. Each trial will be
      performed fo 20 min. Between 2 spontaneous breathing trials, and before extubation, patient
      will receive a 10 minutes period of recovery to their respiratory baseline, defined by the
      respiratory settings before the spontaneous breathing trials.The last step, after extubation,
      will consist in recording the data after 15 minutes, when patient's breathing pattern appears
      calm.
