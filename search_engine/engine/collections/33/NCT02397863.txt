    
      This open-label, multi-center study is open to patients 1 to 18 years of age at time of
      enrollment with medication resistant epilepsy. The study consists of an 8 week baseline,
      titration, and treatment of Epidiolex in a daily dosage up to 25 mg/kg/day, with an optional
      secondary titration schedule after 26 weeks of treatment up to a maximal daily dosage up to
      50 m/kg/day until End of Treatment, followed by a taper-down period, and a safety follow up.
      Treatment will be provided for a total of 52 weeks with an interim analysis conducted 12
      weeks after achieving maximal dose (either 25 mg/kg/day or optimal dose with regards to
      safety and tolerability) and at the end of 1 year of treatment with treatment extensions
      conducted beyond 52 weeks until such time as there is market authorization for Epidiolex, if
      Epidiolex becomes unavailable, or the study is terminated. Cessation of Epidiolex
      administration will be concluded with a taper period and follow-up visit 4 weeks after the
      taper.
