    
      The purpose of this study is to find out the possible relationship among TWEAK/Fn14,
      JAK/STAT3 and IDO as well as their roles in the dysfunction of immune micro-environment of
      endometrium in people diagnosed as repeated implantation failure after in vitro
      Fertilization-embryo transfer(IVF-ET).

      We will use the technology of Western-blot and Immunohistochemistry to find out the
      relationship of the expression of TWEAK/Fn14, JAK/STAT3 and IDO in endometrium . Also, we
      will use technology of Western-blot and Immunohistochemistry to determine whether there are
      differences of the the expression of TWEAK/Fn14, JAK/STAT3 and IDO in endometrium between RIF
      group and control group.
