      setting has not been thoroughly investigated. One pilot study among emergency department
      patients in Australia found no statistical difference between 10 mg and 0.4
      milligrams/kilogram; another investigation suggests that the anti-emetic effect of 10
      milligrams of metoclopramide is no more effective than placebo. In contrast, investigations
      focusing on chemotherapy patients and post-operative patients suggest that higher dosage
      metoclopramide is more effective in treating nausea and vomiting. This emergency department
      study will compare the anti-emetic efficacy of 10 milligrams and 20 milligrams of
      metoclopramide by using the visual analog scale.

      In addition to evaluation of dose, we will evaluate one of the most common side affects of
      metoclopramide, akathisia. Akathisia is characterized by a subjective component of
      restlessness and an objective component in the form of the inability to remain motionless.
      Anti-cholinergic medications are known to reduce extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia
      when dopamine function is impaired in the basal ganglia. In fact, the use of diphenhydramine
      has been shown to reduce the incidence of akathisia in patients receiving a different
      anti-emetic, prochlorperazine. However, no research has focused on the use of
      anti-cholinergic medications to reduce metoclopramide induced akathisia. This investigation
      will assess the use of 25 mg of diphenhydramine in preventing metoclopramide induced
      akathisia in ED patients being treated for nausea/vomiting.
