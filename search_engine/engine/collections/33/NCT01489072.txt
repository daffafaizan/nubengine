      occur. Coughing, hypertension, tachycardia and agitation have been observed during emergence
      of general anesthesia.

      Most patients will cough during emergence. Different techniques and drugs have been studied
      to reduce coughing during emergence.

      There is some evidence supporting the administration of intravenous opioids prior to
      emergence of general anesthesia to reduce perioperative coughing, agitation and haemodynamic
      stimulation. However, depending on the type of opioids given, this may delay the emergence
      from anesthesia. The effect of a remifentanil infusion given in combination with isoflurane
      as the volatile agent has been shown to reduce the incidence of perioperative coughing
      without delaying the emergence of anesthesia. The effect of a small bolus of remifentanil
      given prior to emergence to prevent perioperative coughing has yet to be studied.

      Desflurane is a newer volatile agent allowing early recovery from anesthesia. This agent has
      led to earlier discharge and more rapid resumption of normal activities after surgery.
      However, an incidence of coughing around 70% has been reported after a desflurane-based
      anesthesia.

      This study will compare the effects of two bolus doses of remifentanil (0.25 mcg/kg to 0.5
      mcg/kg) when given prior to emergence to prevent perioperative coughing after a
      desflurane-based anesthesia.
