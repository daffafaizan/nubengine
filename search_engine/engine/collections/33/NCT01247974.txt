    
      The objective of this prospective clinical trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
      the CorMatrix ECM for Pericardial Closure to reduce the incidence of new onset postoperative
      atrial fibrillation by circumferentially reconstructing the normal pericardial anatomy
      following isolated, first-time, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures as compared
      to subjects who did not undergo pericardial closure. Safety will be established by
      demonstrating that the composite clinical event rate for the ECM treatment group is not worse
      than the control group that did not undergo pericardial closure. The efficacy will be
      established by demonstrating a reduced incidence of new onset postoperative atrial
      fibrillation in the ECM treatment group as compared to the control group.
