      switch to doravirine, tenofovir, lamivudine for an additional 2 years beyond the Base Study.
      Study Extension 2 will evaluate safety of the switch to doravirine, tenofovir, lamivudine
      until doravirine, tenofovir, lamivudine becomes locally available, or 4 years beyond Study
      Extension 1, whichever comes first.
