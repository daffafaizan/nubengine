      process of reflection and relationship-building between the patient, their relatives and
      health professionals. It is based on respect for patients' autonomy, involving them in making
      decisions about their disease in a way that is shared between the medical team, the patient
      and their relatives. Up until now, the efficacy of an ACP has not been measured in the
      existing literature, and therefore it is unknown if these programs reach their goal.
      OBJETIVES: The main objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of an ACP program for
      decision-making in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) in comparison to usual follow up
      and care. This objective will be evaluated by the Patient Activation Measure test, which
      measures the participation and self-management of the patient in decision-making. Secondary
      objectives: to evaluate the effect of the program on quality of life, to know if the patients
      wishes expressed through the ACP program are fulfilled, to measure the impact of the program
      on patients' caregivers, to determine the satisfaction of patients included in the program
      and to evaluate the effect on quality of death. METHODS: randomized multicentre clinical
      trial at four hospitals in Madrid. Once they are included in the study, patients' allocation
      to groups (control vs intervention) will be made by alternative sampling. ACP will be applied
      to the intervention group, whereas in the Control Group usual follow-up will be carried out
      in HF units. All patients will fulfil questionnaires and tests related to the objectives of
      the study again after a 12-month follow-up period in order to gauge the effect of ACP in
      patients with advanced HF.
