      proportion of young patients. The development of immunotherapies (such as Ipilimumab), and
      targeted therapies (such as Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor) have resulted in improved survival
      outcomes for patients but is still only measured in months and not years. These targeted
      therapies are also only useful for patients with the relevant genetic mutation, leaving a
      significant proportion of patients without targeted therapy options. The need for more
      effective (and ideally curative) melanoma treatments remains. The Institute of Cancer
      Research, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, have created and developed a new panel of
      inhibitors that aim to more effectively terminate the growth, spread and survival signals
      that sustain the cancer. The broader targets allow patients possessing a range of genetic
      mutations to potentially benefit from this targeted therapy. It is hoped that these drugs
      could be used as both primary therapy for treatmentnaive patients as well as rescue therapy
      for those who have progressed on other targeted therapies.

      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of one of these new
      compounds, CCT 3833, and to define the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced
      melanoma. The study also aims to examine the way that CCT3833 works within the body. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose has been established a small number of melanoma patients, with
      specific mutations and at different treatment option stages, will be treated to gain
      additional safety information and an initial indication of the possible efficacy of CCT3833
      on melanoma tumours.
