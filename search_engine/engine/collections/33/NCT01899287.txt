        -  Early information build on evidence-based skin-protection programmes and work-place
           visits with counselling in skin care, followed by telephone hotline, will give the
           participants increased level of knowledge concerning the treatment and prevention of
           OHE.

        -  Increased level of knowledge concerning prevention and focus on skin care will have a
           positive impact on skin-protective behaviour and will lower the severity of HE and
           prevent the development of chronic eczema.

        -  The decrease in severity of HE will decrease sick leave and keep the participants in
           job, or prevent job loss, or facilitate the re-entry into the workforce.

        -  In total, the intervention will have a positive effect on health-related quality of
           life.
