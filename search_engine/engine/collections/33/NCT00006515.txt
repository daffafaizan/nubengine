      rate in children age 0-14 years of 14 per 100,000. Over the last 30 years a striking increase
      in survival due to improved diagnosis and aggressive treatment approaches has vastly enhanced
      the outlook in this patient population. 75% of children under 15 years age of can be expected
      to survive the diagnosis of cancer for more than 5 years. However, reports of improved
      survival have been followed by increasing awareness of a multitude of long-term
      treatment-related side effects, in addition to an overall death rate 9.6 times higher than in
      the sex- and age-matched general population. Over the last 35 years, patients with pediatric
      sarcomas have been treated in the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) of the National Cancer
      Institute. Since 1971 adriamycin and cyclophosphamide in escalating doses have been
      incorporated in all multimodality treatment protocols. Ifosfamide became an integral part of
      therapy in 1986. The survival rate of patients with these diseases has improved over this
      period of time. Accordingly there exists a group of long-term survivors of therapy employed
      in a series of POB sarcoma protocols who represent a valuable source of information on
      treatment-associated late-effects, e.g. cardiotoxicity, gonadal dysfunction, growth delay and
      stress-related neuroendocrine abnormalities. In addition there may be evaluable
      rehabilitative impairments and alterations in psychosocial behavior that may only manifest
      over time, and prove to be characteristic for this population. This protocol will
      systematically enumerate and describe the incidence and extent of treatment related long-term
      toxicities in this patient population.
