      School and the Veterans Administration Hospital by direct invitation from Dr. Margolis (adult
      HIV clinic director and University director for the NIH-ACTG). We will recruit 20
      HIV-infected adult males who have been treated with stable protease inhibitor therapy regimen
      for the past 6 months. One half of the subjects will have evidence of lipoatrophy (as defined
      by the ACTG29). Each subject will have baseline (BL) measures made, and then will start on GH
      depot or subcutaneous AQ. Patients will be followed every two weeks for the first six weeks,
      then every three months for the remainder of the study. Study parameters to be measured
      include (also see flow chart in appendix):

        -  Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months: OGTT, testosterone level, whole body protein turnover,
           hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenesis measures, DXA scan (for measuring lean
           tissue mass and bone density), bone mineral markers, resting energy expenditure, calorie
           count, T cell subsets, TNF Âµ levels.

        -  Every 3 months: IGF-1 (will obtain every 2 weeks for first 6 weeks), body weight, and
           post-prandial glucose level.

        -  Baseline, 6 and 12 months- CT scan for measurement of thymus size
