      diabetes selfcare. Psychological interventions have been shown to result in improvements in
      HbA1C and depression. Reports on psychosocial outcomes are conflicting and there are no
      studies of quality of life. Our diabetes outpatient population has a higher prevalence of
      anxiety and depression compared to the general public and this led to the development of a
      group CBT intervention designed to reduce anxiety as a co-morbidity of diabetes.
