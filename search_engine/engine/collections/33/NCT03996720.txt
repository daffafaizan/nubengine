      based on clinical outcomes: severe sepsis group (patients who progress into severe sepsis),
      sepsis group (patients who do not progress in to severe sepsis). We intend to perform
      predictive modeling using multivariable analyses of the novel biomarkers and derive a
      biomarker panel and algorithm for early diagnosis of severe sepsis. The predictive value of
      the biomarker panel for early identification of severe sepsis will be compared with
      established indices, such as PRISM III and pSOFA score.
