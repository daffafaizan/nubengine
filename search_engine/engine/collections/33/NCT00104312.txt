      disability that arises from it. We hope to better understand why people with knee
      osteoarthritis develop difficulty with mobility (e.g. walking, standing) in hopes of finding
      a cure.

      This study requires 1 four-hour visit to Harbor Hospital. The visit involves a physical exam,
      a DEXA bone density scan, blood and urine testing, knee x-rays, strength testing and a
      surface electromyography (EMG). Samples of muscle, joint fluid and joint tissue will be
      collected during your planned surgery.

      Participation in this study is entirely voluntary.
