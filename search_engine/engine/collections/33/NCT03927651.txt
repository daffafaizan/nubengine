      to facilitate assessments of ovarian vascular perfusion. Historically, assessment of ovarian
      perfusion has been performed visually or via ultrasound with Doppler evaluation. In patients
      with ovarian endometriomas, evidence of ovarian interstitial microvascular injury has been
      demonstrated similarly by the presence of low flow and high RI. The use of ICG to evaluate
      ovarian perfusion specifically has not been reported. The use of ICG for intraoperative
      perfusion assessment of the ovary could provide more information about the health of the
      ovary and inform the surgical approach to ovarian pathology.

      ICG will be injected intravenously to assess ovarian perfusion in the presence or absence
      (control) of pathology. Near infrared fluorescence imaging will be used to illuminate the
      ICG. The extent of perfusion will be determined using digital imaging software.
