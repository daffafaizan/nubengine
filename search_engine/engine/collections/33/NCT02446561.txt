      reference capsule formulation to determine whether the release rates of the products are
      similar or equivalent in a fed or fasted state. Determination is by measurement of drug
      concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 72 hours
      post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose. Pharmacokinetics parameters of
      AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints
