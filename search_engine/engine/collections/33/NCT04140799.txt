        2. Sample size: Assuming that the target population is 240 and positive predictive value of
           transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography is 89.4%. So, the sample size is 91 cases using
           OPEN Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health (OPENEPI) with confidence
           interval 95% and power of test is 80%.

      All patients underwent transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasonography examination by both anterior
      and lateral approach of the Vocal Cords (VCs) before the surgery, immediately after
      extubation, 2 h, 12h, 24 and 48hour postoperatively by an anesthesiologist with an experience
      of at least three years in ultrasonography scan.
