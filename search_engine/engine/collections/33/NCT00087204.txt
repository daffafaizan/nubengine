      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of rebeccamycin analogue
      (XL119) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndromes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue (XL119) IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course beyond CR. Patients achieving
      a partial response (PR) or hematologic improvement (HI) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      PR or HI. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XL119 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
