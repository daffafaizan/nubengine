      titanium (Ni-Ti) instrumentation systems (OneShape, Revo S and WaveOne) on postoperative
      dental pain in patients with asymptomatic teeth after a single-appointment root canal
      retreatment. A total of a hundred thirty nine patients with asymptomatic teeth and with no
      contradictory medical history who were indicated for non-surgical retreatment at the
      Endodontic Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Medipol University, between September and
      December 2016 were included in this study. All of the patients have been recruited from the
      Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. Out of a hundred thirty nine
      patients, a total of ninety-nine patients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to
      participate was enrolled for the study and were divided into three groups (n=33). Consent was
      obtained from all study participants before the treatment. After removing previous root canal
      filling, instrumentation was performed using One Shape, Revo-S, and WaveOne in groups 1, 2,
      and 3, respectively. All retreatments were performed in a single appointment by one
      endodontist before permanent coronal restoration. Postoperative pain intensity was assessed
      at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 days; and 1 month after the retreatment. The teeth was
      examined according to for pain intensity, percussion & palpation sensitivity, swelling,
      analgesic intake and clinical status.
