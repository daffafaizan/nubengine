      mg/m2/min will be immediately followed by a 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin and
      then a 48-hour intravenous infusion of 5-FU and leucovorin.The starting dose of oxaliplatin
      in the phase I part is 65 mg/m2, with dose increment of 10 mg/m2. Since the recommended dose
      for biweekly single dose oxaliplatin is 85 mg/m2, there will be no further dose escalation of
      oxaliplatin beyond 85 mg/m2.Patients will be entered in cohorts of three.If one out of three
      patients develops DLT, three additional patients will be accrued to the same dose level.9.1.3
      The six patients treated at the MTD dose level will be included in the phase II part of this
      study if only they have measurable lesion(s) prior to chemotherapy.For the phase II part, If
      three or more responders are observed in the initial 21 evaluable patients, the trial will
      proceed to the second stage. Additional 24 patients will be accrued in the second stage of
      the phase II part.
