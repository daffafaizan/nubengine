      called infliximab (Remicade) in the treatment of children with Crohn's disease. In this
      study, subjects will receive multiple doses of infliximab over 62 weeks. The goal of the
      study is to ensure that the medication is safe and effective in children when it is given for
      an extended period of time. All subjects will receive an induction regimen of 5 mg/kg
      infliximab at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Subjects will then receive either 5 or 10 mg/kg infliximab
      either every 8 or 12 weeks for up to 46 weeks followed by an open label extension for up to
      three additional years.
