    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomised, 2-period crossover design study in patients with
      advanced solid tumours.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a
      single dose of AZD1775 (printed capsules).In addition single dose safety and tolerability
      data will be gathered.

      Patients will be screened within 28 days of Day 1 of the first treatment period (Period 1).
      Patients will take part in 2 randomised treatment sequences each separated by a washout
      period of at least 5 and no more than 14 days.

      During Period 1, prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment, each patient
      will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (Fasted-Fed or Fed-Fasted) to receive a
      single oral dose of 300 mg AZD1775 in each of the 2 treatment periods as follows:

        -  Fasted (Treatment A): Single dose 300 mg AZD1775, (3 x 100 mg, printed capsules).

        -  Fed (Treatment B): Single dose 300 mg AZD1775, (3 x 100 mg, printed capsules).

      Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments will be obtained for up to 72 hours post-dose in each
      treatment period.

      On completion of the study (ie, after collection of 72-hour PK sample and safety in period 2)
      patients will be evaluated per current assessments for their eligibility and interest to
      enrol into the open-label continued treatment access study (D6014C000007).
