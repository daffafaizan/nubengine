    
      Primary Objective: Measure the overall response rate for immunotherapy given with quad-shot
      radiotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  Measure the response rate at the target lesion.

        -  Measure the response rate at non-target sites in patients with non-target sites.

        -  Evaluate the durability of response at the target lesion.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate overall survival.

        -  Assess the tolerability of the combination of quad-shot radiotherapy with immunotherapy
           in order to assess the feasibility of this treatment regimen.

      Exploratory Objective: Evaluate the effect of quad- shot administration on increasing the
      immune activation by treatment with pembrolizumab and investigate possible mechanisms.
