      as monotherapy to provide dose(s) and schedule(s) for further Modules of combination therapy.

      Module 2 will evaluate OMO-1 in combination with small molecule EGFR-TKIs.

      Study modules will consist of a Part A (dose finding) and an optional Part B (cohort
      expansion). The option to start Part B and add further modules will be the decision of the
      safety review committee, based on emerging preclinical anti-tumour data and, safety and
      tolerability information from the study as a whole.

      For all modules, Part A cohorts may be expanded by up to 12 additional patients at doses (at
      or above the MBAD) that have been confirmed to be tolerated. These patients will have
      mandatory paired biopsies to assess the tumour for relevant PDc biomarkers, and to explore
      further the tolerability, safety and PK activity at these doses.

      In all combination modules, the dose of each combination agent investigated will not exceed
      their current recommended dose. The starting dose of OMO-1 in combination modules will not
      exceed the one currently tolerated in Module 1 (monotherapy). For cohorts in which OMO-1 is
      dosed in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, dosing will not continue once the cycles of
      chemotherapy have been completed.
