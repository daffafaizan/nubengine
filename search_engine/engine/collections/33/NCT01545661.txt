      the inability to make a rapid diagnosis. This is, in part, due to the inability to obtain
      representative biological samples and the non-availability of cheap, effective, rapid and
      field-friendly diagnostic tools. Indeed, in HIV positive patients, where the sensitivity of
      sputum smear is as low as 20%, culture results take several weeks and a significant
      proportion of patients do not expectorate sputum. Sputum induction for the diagnosis of TB
      has been evaluated in several studies, has been shown to have a good yield, feasibility and
      safety when performed correctly, and with diagnostic comparability to bronchoscopy. Few
      studies have evaluated the performance of induced sputum outside of the hospital environment
      and the tolerability, yield and performance outcome of sputum induction in a primary care
      facility has yet to be evaluated. The objective of this study is two-fold. We seek to
      evaluate, through a randomized controlled trial, the feasibility, performance outcomes and
      impact on time-to-diagnosis and -treatment of sputum induction, in a high HIV prevalence
      primary care setting, for the diagnosis of smear negative/ sputum scarce TB. We hypothesize
      that acquiring an induced sputum sample for smear microscopy and liquid TB culture will
      decrease time-to-diagnosis and time-to-treatment initiation in smear negative/sputum scarce
      TB patients in a primary care clinic in a resource-limited high TB HIV prevalent setting. We
      will also evaluate the potential incremental benefit of novel technologies to improve the
      rapidity and diagnostic yield using induced sputum samples (Xpert MTB/RIF assay, microscopic
      observation drug susceptibility testing (MODS) and the Genotype MTB DRplus line probe assay).
