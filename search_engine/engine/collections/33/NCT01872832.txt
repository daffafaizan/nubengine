      recognized that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors may impact the PK, PD, safety, and dose
      response in different ethnic populations. The purpose of this study is to explore the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and multiple doses of
      RDEA3170 in healthy Japanese males, and to allow comparison of these parameters with the
      Western population.
