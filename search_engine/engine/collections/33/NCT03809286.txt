      laboratory setting. Participants with AUD will be recruited and admitted to the inpatient
      unit for the whole study. After a brief detoxification period, they will receive 3 weeks of
      rTMS while in the research unit. Before and after the 3 weeks of stimulation, participants
      will participate in a decision-making experiment where they can choose to have an alcoholic
      drink or the equivalent amount of money that the drink would cost (alcohol
      self-administration sessions). The investigators will examine their response to alcohol, as
      well as their performance on tasks that relate to impulsivity and memory. Participants will
      also undergo an MRI scan (with spectroscopy) before and after the stimulation period to look
      at changes in the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain. Participants will then meet with a
      study physician for 6 weeks after the study for assessments of alcohol use and medical
      management sessions.
