      better reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive
      function of the subject, and conduct experiments to better control an virtual object on the
      computer screen including a cursor or a helicopter.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the above hypotheses (1) and (2) in a healthy
      subject population.This study will determine the ability of subjects with full cognitive
      function to control a non-invasive brain-computer interface by imagining a particular
      movement. Using non-invasive methods, we will investigate the neural processes that occur
      during the motor imagination tasks associated with controlling a virtual object. Using a
      variety of motor imaginations, we will determine which tasks are best used for BCI control by
      quantitative means of BCI performance and neurological dynamic system analysis.

      Subjects for this study will be healthy, English speaking adult volunteers (18-64 years old)
      with no history of mental illness, neurological deficit, or traumatic brain injury.
