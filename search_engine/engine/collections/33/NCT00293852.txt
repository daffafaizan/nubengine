      the prevalence of obesity (50.8%) and the metabolic syndrome (48.9%) exceeds that of the
      general U.S. population. The metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of 3 out of 5
      components: abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemias (↑ triglycerides and ↓
      high density lipoprotein) and insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Current treatment
      recommendations for the metabolic syndrome include lifestyle modification (diet, exercise,
      and weight control) and targeted pharmaceutical therapy for the individual components.
      Although specialized care for the metabolic syndrome has not been reported, separately, both
      specialty heart failure care and endocrinology care have been shown to reduce hospital
      admissions and health care costs, increase target medication titration and disease control,
      improve quality of life, and survival in patients with heart failure and diabetes
      respectively. As both heart failure and the metabolic syndrome are commonly found in the same
      patients, collaborative out-patient management of both conditions in the same clinic is novel
      and may have a significant impact on outcomes.

      Hypothesis:

      Compared to usual post-discharge follow-up, collaborative treatment of heart failure patients
      with the metabolic syndrome by a team composed of an endocrinologist, cardiologist, patient
      educator, nurse and case manager will result in:

        -  Decreased hospital readmissions and emergency room visits

        -  Health care cost savings

        -  Increased achievement of treatment goals (target blood pressure, HgbA1c, lipids, and
           heart failure medication titration)

        -  Improved patient satisfaction, knowledge, and compliance

        -  Lower levels of markers of inflammation and insulin resistance
