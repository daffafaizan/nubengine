      women and their household, conditional on school attendance, reduces young women's risk of
      acquiring Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The overall goal of the Conditional Cash
      Transfer (CCT) intervention is to reduce structural barriers to education with the goal of
      increasing school attendance of young women, thereby decreasing their HIV risk.
