      compassionate use of this non-approved treatment in one patient from Dr. Peters' private
      practice. Since this treatment has not been used previously in the US, we propose to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the treatment in this one patient by comparing pre and post
      treatment symptom changes.

      Prior to treatment (visit 1) baseline measures will be assessed: vital signs,pelvic/bladder
      pain on a visual analog scale (VAS; "0" being none and "10" being severe), concomitant
      medications, Serum pregnancy test and Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel, Urine cytology,
      urinalysis (dipstick), and culture.

      At visits 2-5 (4 treatment visits) questionnaires will be completed and vital signs, pain
      VAS, post void residual (measured by bladder scan or catheter), unanticipated events, and
      voiding history (voiding diary) will also be assessed. Additionally, cystoscopy will be done
      prior to the first treatment to view the bladder lining. At each treatment visit, the
      patients will have a solution of liposomes instilled in the bladder with a catheter, retained
      for 30 minutes, and be carefully monitored for at least 1 hour after the liposomes are
      drained.

      After treatment, visits 6 and 7 (follow up) will include vital signs with VAS pain
      assessment, post void residual (PVR), urinalysis (dipstick), unanticipated events assessment,
      questionnaire completion and review of voiding diary. Visit 8 (study exit) will include the
      same parameters measured at follow up visits 6 and 7 with the addition of cystoscopy and
      Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel testing.
