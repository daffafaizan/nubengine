      particular preparation, but also on patient specific factors which includes state of
      inflammation, obesity etc. Although effect on glucose disposal is the central to insulin
      action, there could be differences of insulin action on other metabolic parameters. It is not
      known if there is a difference in suppression of inflammation with improved glycemic control
      which could vary with analog insulin. It is unknown if natural insulin (NPH, recombinant
      human insulin with protamine) differs from insulin analogs (glargine and detemir, made by
      substituting amino acid in the native sequence) in terms of metabolic outcome other than
      glucose disposal.

      At this point it is uncertain if there is any clear benefit of use of lantus over NPH in
      inpatient glycemic management. Currently, both lantus and NPH based regimen is practiced in
      inpatient hospital setting. Current practice of inpatient insulin regimen is based more on
      familiarity of physicians with a particular insulin type and personal preference rather than
      evidenced based knowledge. Lantus is an expensive insulin preparation compared to NPH with
      uncertain benefit in inpatient setting. Current research proposal will compare this two
      insulin based regimen in the management of diabetes of hospitalized patients. Information
      obtained through this research will guide the investigators practice in this institution as
      well as in other institutions.
