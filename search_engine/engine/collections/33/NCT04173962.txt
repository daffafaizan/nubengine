      depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the
      ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience
      in at-risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress-induced
      psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience-enhancing pharmaceuticals have been
      identified yet. Pre-clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress
      prevents the developing of depressive-like behavior in animals. In this project the study
      team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies
      also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the
      anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project
      are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1-week prior a laboratory-induced stress (1)
      on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) -
      Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis),
      adrenaline-noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self-reports of anxiety. The study team expects
      that subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms
      of negative affect and anxiety and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress.
