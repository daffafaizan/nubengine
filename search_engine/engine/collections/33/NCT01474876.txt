      manifestations (EAMs), functional status, the use of concomitant nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory medication, and work productivity impairment. In addition, the Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), a new disease activity index in AS, was measured
      in parallel with the standard Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
      score to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab in treating axial symptoms.
