      identify mutations, or changes in the genetic makeup of the cells due to cancer, that are
      specific to the tumor. Based on this information, the investigators will design a test using
      PCR, which is a technology that allows for the amplification of the DNA, that is specific to
      the mutation identified in the tumor. Once verified, the presence (or absence) of ctDNA in
      the blood can be measured. The investigators will measure this blood test prior to surgery
      and at multiple time points following surgery. Specimens will be collected at the time of
      planned clinical assessments.
