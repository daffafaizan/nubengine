      for the delivery of methacholine chloride bronchoprovocation agent to the lungs results in
      the same Provocation Concentration PC20 (provocation concentration, or dose that causes a 20%
      decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 sec or FEV1) as using the English-Wright nebulizer
      for the delivery of methacholine chloride bronchoprovocation agent to the lungs.
