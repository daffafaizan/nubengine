      shown clinical activity, although in a small number of patients. Therefore, is is mandatory
      to improve the results of this strategy and to closely monitor immunologic response and cell
      migration in order to improve our understanding of mechanisms of action and to settle future
      fields of development..

      Objectives: Primary: to confirm clinical activity of this strategy, determining tumor
      response (RECIST criteria). Secondary: to determine: (1) safety; (2) antitumoral immune
      response (through study of delayed hypersensitivity; ELISPOT; activity of Natural Killer
      cells; and serum cytokine concentrations); and (3) DC migration in the organism, by labeling
      with 111-Indium oxinate

      Methodology: phase II trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We
      will perform repeated immunizations with mature DC loaded with autologous tumor. We will
      introduce the following novel elements to enhance efficacy (1) Pre-treatment with
      cyclophosphamide to reduce regulatory / suppressor T cells; (2) maturation/activation of DC
      induced by TNF-alfa, IFN-alfa and double stranded RNA (GMP-manufactured poly I:C), aimed at
      replication of the phenomena observed during a viral infection (3) intranodal DC
      administration in inguinal lymph nodes (4) four daily doses (repeated every 24 hours) in two
      cycles one month apart (5) scintigraphic follow-up of a tracing dose of 111-In labelled DC
      and (6) ) systemic treatment with PEG-IFN alfa and GM-CSF to potentiate activity.
