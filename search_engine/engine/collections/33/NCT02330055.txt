      period. Postpartum airway obstruction is a main cause of anesthesia-related maternal death in
      North America. Upper airway edema following labor and delivery may impair pharyngeal anatomy,
      which can lead to increased vulnerability of the airway collapse during sleep.

      This study evaluates whether the kind of delivery (vaginal birth versus cesarean section) has
      an effect on nocturnal desaturation in the first night after delivery. Furthermore, the
      investigators examine if the upper body position during sleep has an effect on the occurrence
      of oxygen desaturation.

      In addition, the investigators evaluate if preexisting conditions, as indicated by a high
      P-SAP or STOP-Bang-score increase the likelihood of nocturnal desaturation.
