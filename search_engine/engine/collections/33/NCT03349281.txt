      patients (16-39 years of age) with relapsed/refractory ALL utilizing a traditional 3+3 design
      with dose expansion cohort of 6 patients. Starting dose level for pevonedistat is 15 mg/m2.
      If the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) is greater than 1 out of 3 patients in the
      starting dose level, next dose level is 10 mg/m2 (dose level -1). Chemotherapy will consist
      of pevonedistat in combination with a standard VXLD regimen. The duration of each cycle will
      be 29 days.
