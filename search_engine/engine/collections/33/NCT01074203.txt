      transplantation (LTx) and is associated with allograft failure, death and need for
      re-transplantation. Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent HCV recurrence.
      Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an oral thiazolide anti-infectious agent, was safe, well tolerated and
      effective in achieving sustained viral response in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4. Its
      role in the prevention of HCV recurrence after liver transplantation has not been studied. We
      propose to conduct an open label pilot study examining the role of NTZ in the prevention of
      HCV re-infection in eight patients undergoing LTx. First time transplant recipients for
      chronic HCV without history of renal failure or HIV/HBV co-infection, will receive NTZ
      immediately prior to LTx and for 3 days thereafter. The primary endpoint is the number of
      patients who remain HCV-RNA-negative at day 7 after LTx. If at least one patient remains
      negative, the study will be determined to be positive. Additionally, we will examine the
      viral kinetics of HCV, tolerability and safety of NTZ.
