      three groups: (a) young healthy subjects, (b) older healthy subjects and (c) patients with
      chronic stroke.

      Objective: The primary aim is to determine the relative contribution of neural replay during
      wakeful rest and sleep to consolidation of a newly learned skill in young and older healthy
      volunteers, and in chronic stroke patients with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The secondary
      aim is to evaluate differences in replay rates between these subject cohorts. We will also
      explore differences in replay rates, spatiotemporal dynamics of neural replay and sleep
      spindles to generate additional hypotheses and preliminary data for future studies.

      Endpoints: The primary endpoint measure is motor skill consolidation (i.e., offline change in
      correct sequence typing speed following a nap). The secondary endpoint measure is neural
      replay rate. Exploratory endpoints measures are spatial (i.e. - parcellated source space) and
      time-frequency maps of neural replay during wakeful rest and sleep, and changes in
      button-press finger movement kinematics during learning.

      Study Population:

      Arm 1: 46 healthy young (18-35) volunteers.

      Arm 2: 46 healthy older (50-80) volunteers.

      Arm 3: 46 chronic (>6 months post-stroke) stroke patients.

      Phase: N/A

      Descriotion of Site/Facilities: This protocol utilizes the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient
      Clinic, and NMRF and MEG core facilities.

      Intervention: N/A

      Study Duration: 48 months

      Participant Duration: Up to 4 visits lasting approximately 2-4 hours each.
