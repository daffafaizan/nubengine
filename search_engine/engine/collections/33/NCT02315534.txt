      monotherapy prior to resection, followed by post-operative BBI608 administered in combination
      with temozolomide. In arm B, patients who are not candidates for surgical resection will
      receive BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolomide.

      In the phase 1/DLT cohort portion of this study, pharmacokinetics will be evaluated for both
      arms A and B. Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated in all patients who undergo surgical
      resection.
