      Tumour Tracking technology. Markerless Tumour Tracking will be integrated with existing
      treatment machines to provide real-time monitoring of tumour motion during treatment
      delivery. Eligible patients are implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground
      truth for evaluating the accuracy of Markerless Tumour Tracking. The patients will undergo
      the current standard of care radiotherapy, with the exception that kilovoltage x-ray images
      will be acquired continuously during treatment delivery and used to calculate online
      Markerless Tumour Tracking. Markerless Tumour Tracking determines the mean tumour position
      calculated over the most recent 15 seconds and displays shifts exceeding 3 mm.

      The trial will be a single-institution study recruiting only at RNSH Radiation Oncology
      Department.

      As this trial investigates feasibility, our focus will be on estimating the proportion of
      treatment time in which the Markerless Tumour Tracking is within acceptable limits.
