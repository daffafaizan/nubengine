    
      Airtraq sp has been proven effective for intubating patients presenting with difficult
      airway.

      The Airtraq sp allows visualisation of the tracheal inlet only for the intubator.

      By adding a smartphone with a dedicated app (Airtraq Mobile) to the Airtraq sp, the
      visualisation of the tracheal inlet is possible for all the airway providers.

      The investigators aim to demonstrate that the addition of the Airtraq Mobile app improves
      success rate of intubation (primary endpoint), as well as confort of the airway provider,
      shortens time for intubation and reduces injury to the patients while their neck is
      imobilized by a cervical collar, creating a simulated difficult airway.

      Patients will be included if they necessitate an elective general anesthesia and orotracheal
      intubation.

      Exclusion criteria are related to difficult airway, ASA IV and patient refusal.
