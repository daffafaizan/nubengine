      gastroenteritis tract．Nowadays，etiology and pathogenesis of UC have been unclear．Recent basic
      research has been revealed that stem cell can settle down in epithelium of gastroenteritis
      tract，which provide a hope for treating the disease.We hope umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells could not only address the need for epithelial cell replacement but also control of the
      autoimmune response to mocous membrane of colon.
