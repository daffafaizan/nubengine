    
      This is a open label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. 96 patients are planed to be
      1:1 randomized into one of two groups: (1) Tube group, mid-gut tubing prior to the MRE
      examination, administer contrast solution through the mid-gut tube; (2) Oral group,
      administer contrast solution orally, mid-gut tubing after the MRE examination. The primary
      outcome measures are: (1) grade of bowel distention evaluated by a 5-grade scale (1 = 0-20%
      segmental distention, 2 = 20-40% distention, 3 = 40-60% distention, 4 = 60-80% distention, 5
      = 80-100% distention); (2) degree of discomfort before/during/after bowel preparation for MRE
      using a visual 5-grade to describe the severity of nervousness, nausea, vomiting, bloating,
      abdominal pain, and diarrhea (1 = few, 5 = very severe). The secondary outcome measure is the
      accuracy of lesion detection through MRE confirmed by endoscopy (within 1 month before MRE
      and during this hospitalization) will be evaluated by a 5-point scale (lesions locating at
      the terminal ileum, ileocecal junction, hepatic flexure of colon, splenic flexure of colon,
      and rectosigmoid colon, consistency of lesion detection from each bowel segment scoring 1
      point, otherwise not scoring).
