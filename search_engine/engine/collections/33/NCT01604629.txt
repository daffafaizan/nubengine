      short time after the suspension but it has not been evaluated in controlled trials if
      remission could be maintained with a lower dose. A multicenter, national, open-label,
      randomized and controlled clinical trial of 3 years duration (2 years for inclusion + 1 year
      follow-up) is proposed to address this issue. The study will include 190 patients with
      Spondylarthropathies in stable treatment with any single anti-TNF agent and compliance with
      criteria of clinical remission for at least 4 months. Patients will be randomized to
      intervention or control arm, with stratification according to the antiTNF product thet were
      receiving prior to inclusion. Patients will be followed with the calendar of visits
      recommended by the Spanish Society of Rheumatology for clinical practice. The proposed
      hypothesis is of non-inferiority of the experimental arm with dose reduction versus the
      control arm with standard treatment.
