    
      Investigation of the influence of the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle repair following volar
      plate fixation of distal radius fractures with special regards to the forearm pronation
      strength. During the early recovery period of 3 months an improvement of pronation strength
      and functional scorings was hypothesized for the PQ repair when compared to no repair.

      Therefore the patients are randomized to group A = PQ repair and group B = no repair.
      Follow-up examinations after 6 and 12 weeks are scheduled included bilateral isometric
      pronation strength measurement, range of motion, the QuickDASH and the Mayo-Wrist-Score, and
      a visual analogue scale (VAS)
