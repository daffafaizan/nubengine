      on hyperlipidemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotics mainly
      on blood lipids as well as homocysteine levels, glycemic control parameters and hs-CRP levels
      A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was completed with a total of 51
      individuals who have diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Participants were randomly assigned into
      3 groups according to the probiotic type they would consume, groups were as follows;
      Lactobacillus (probiotic group I) (n=18), Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (probiotic group
      II) (n=17) and placebo group (n= 16). They were all requested to have placebo or probiotic
      capsules every day for 8 weeks. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
      triglyceride levels were investigated as lipid metabolism parameters while fasting blood
      glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR levels were investigated as glycemic parameters. Also, hs-CRP
      levels were investigated as inflammatory parameter.
