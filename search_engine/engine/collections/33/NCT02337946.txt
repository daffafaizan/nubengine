      treat people who have advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma of KRAS wild-type. This study
      will look at the efficacy and safety of 5-FU/LV + panitumumab(Pmab) combination therapy or
      mFOLFOX6 + Pmab combination therapy in the participants.

      The study will enroll 164 patients. All participants will receive 6 cycles of Protocol
      Treatment [1]: Pmab 6 mg/kg, DIV, at Day 1, OXA 85 mg/m^2, DIV, at Day 1, l LV 200 mg/m^2,
      DIV, at Day 1, 5-FU 400 mg/m^2, IV, at Day 1, 5-FU 2400 mg/m^2, CIV, at Day 2 once every two
      weeks from cycle 1 through cycle 6.

      Then they will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the treatment
      groups.

        -  Group A

        -  Group B

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 20 months.
