      the propulsion of a bolus from the oral cavity to the pharynx. Successful bolus transport
      requires the tongue to interact with other oral structures, especially the hard palate, to
      generate sufficient impulsive force or pressure gradients that drive the bolus toward the
      oropharynx. Our knowledge of deglutitive lingual pressure dynamics is at best incomplete. The
      available data on oral tongue pressure phenomena are based exclusively on commanded single
      swallows. Oral pressure changes during other important everyday eating activities (e.g., cup
      drinking) have not been studied to date. Past investigations revealed that rapid sequential
      swallowing during continuous drinking, in contrast to commanded discrete swallows, had unique
      tongue-palate contact patterns, surface electromyographic response characteristics, and hyoid
      displacement profiles. Given the different biomechanical properties and motor strategies, we
      hypothesize that oral lingual pressure profiles for sequential swallowing are also different,
      that sequential swallows require less impulsive force, and that selected dysphagic patients,
      especially those whose swallowing deficits are associated with reduced tongue strength, will
      perform sequential swallows more efficiently than they do discrete swallows. This protocol,
      therefore, proposes to test these hypotheses in healthy individuals of different ages, and in
      patients with reduced tongue strength and oral-oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with
      neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, or head and neck cancer. Our goals are to:
      (a) acquire a better and more complete understanding of normal tongue pressure phenomena as a
      function of swallowing tasks, (b) characterize the interrelationship between task-induced
      lingual pressure differences and result of clinical diagnostic tests of swallowing function
      in patient populations, and (c) differentially identify the profiles of dysphagic patients
      who can and those who cannot benefit from sequential swallowing as a
      compensatory/rehabilitative strategy.
