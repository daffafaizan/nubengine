      and aerobic exercise in aspects related to health. More specific:

        1. To investigate the thermoregulatory responses of hemodialysis patients under four
           different hemodialysis protocols.

        2. To assess the changes in muscular architecture and functional capacity in dialysis
           patients after 7 months of intradialytic exercise training.

        3. To assess the impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.
