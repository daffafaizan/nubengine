    
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. To diagnose
      IBS, the so-called Rome Criteria combined with limited laboratory tests should be used.
      However, within the primary care, too much unnecessary diagnostics, for example radiology and
      endoscopy, are used. This is meaningless, stressful for the patient and they also cost a lot
      of money.

      In Örebro Region there are 29 public general health centers. Approximately 300.000
      inhabitants are listed within these health centers. Approximately 150 doctors are currently
      working within the primary health care of Örebro Region. The software program Medrave and the
      electronic patient register in Örebro Region allows to search for the International
      Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for IBS (K58.9 and K58.0) This allows
      retrospective research regarding diagnosing IBS, the used diagnostic tools, comorbidities, as
      well as the different treatments that were used.

      Patients diagnosed with IBS will be identified by ICD-code K.58. By evaluating their patient
      register it will be determined how the GP has made the IBS diagnosis. Patients will fall into
      three categories: those who received a positive IBS diagnosis using the Rome criteria, those
      who received a negative IBS diagnosis and those whose patient record is lacking sufficient
      information.

      Data will also include demographics, number of GP contacts and referrals to specialists,
      diagnostic procedures, treatments, and relevant somatic, psychological and psychiatric
      comorbidities. Data regarding substance abuse will be collected as well.
