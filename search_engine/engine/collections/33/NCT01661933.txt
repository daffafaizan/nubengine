    
      Hypothesis The adaptive Th2/regulatory profile imposed by Na will promote gluten tolerance
      following a micro-dose desensitising programme.

      Primary Aim: To determine the safety and efficacy of Na as a tolerising agent in celiac
      subjects

      Specific Aim 1. Undertake a therapeutic pilot study comparing mucosal histopathology before
      and after a gluten challenge, to be preceded by a programmed desensitising micro-challenge
      using Na as a tolerising agent.

      Specific Aim 2. Assess systemic and mucosal immune responses to gluten micro-challenge, Na
      infection, and gluten re-challenge throughout the pilot study, to be referenced against
      hookworm-naive people with treated and untreated celiac disease.

      Specific Aim 3. Utilising blood and tissue from hookworm-naive celiac disease volunteers,
      undertake in vitro studies focusing on the effects of Na-derived excretory/secretory (ES)
      products on gluten-stimulated gut mucosal cell apoptosis, cytokine and gene profiles.
