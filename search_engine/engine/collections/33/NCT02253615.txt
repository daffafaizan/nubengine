    
      This is a randomized clinical trial study (RCT) with 2 parallel arms. The subjects will be
      divided in 2 groups with a randomized block technique: Elastic Training Group (ETG) and
      Machine Training Group (MTG). The subjects will be submitted to a two-week familiarization
      period and then a sixteen-week of strength training program will be performed twice a week.

      This regimen of resistance training in both groups will consist of four exercises for lower
      limbs and four exercises for upper limbs which will be alternately performed with a
      one-minute interval between them during familiarization and training periods. Lower limb
      exercises will consist of: hip extension and abduction, and knee flexion and extension. Upper
      limb exercises will consist of: bench press, rowing, triceps and high pulley exercise.
