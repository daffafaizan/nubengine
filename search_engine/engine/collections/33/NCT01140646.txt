      I. To evaluate the impact of SAMe on hot flash scores in women with a history of breast
      cancer or women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast
      cancer.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of SAMe in this study population. III. To evaluate the effect of
      SAMe using quality-of-life (QOL) measures.

      OUTLINE:

      During the first week, participants will complete a daily, prospective hot flash diary and
      complete baseline questionnaires and will not be taking any study medication. After this
      baseline week, participants will receive oral s-adenosyl-L-methionine, 400 mg, once daily on
      days 8-14 and twice daily on days 15-49 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
