      Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) is considered as an evidence-based
      treatment for insomnia 2. To date, no Internet-based CBT-I delivered treatment for sleep
      problems in adolescents with ASD has been undertaken. The objective of the study is to
      investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of the Internet-based CBT-I for sleep problems in
      adolescents with ASD.
