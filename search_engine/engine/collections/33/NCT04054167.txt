      I. To evaluate the efficacy of adding ultra low dose radiation (ULDR) to chemotherapy
      free-targeted therapy (CTFTT) in contributing to a durable overall response in treated
      locations by estimating overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if ULDR can improve progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To evaluate the prognostic factors associated with inferior progression-free survival,
      including patient related and previous treatment related and if radiation can overcome these
      prognostic factors.

      III. To evaluate if radiation helps to bridge patients to other investigational drugs, by
      decreasing the disease bulk, controlling their symptoms, and maintaining a good performance
      status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultra low dose radiation for 1-2 days before chemotherapy free-targeted
      therapy. Patients may receive a second, longer course of radiation if the lesion treated does
      not respond.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
