      chemotherapy is poor (Kantarjian et al). Hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine,
      are effective and less toxic regimens, and treatment with these agents has improved the
      prognosis of these patients (Fenaux et al).

      Venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, in combination with azacitidine has shown efficacy in AML
      patients with complete remission rate of 73% and overall survival at 2 years of 40-50% (Di
      Nardo et al).

      On these grounds, the aim of this study is to collect the real-life experience with this
      combination in previously untreated AML patients.
