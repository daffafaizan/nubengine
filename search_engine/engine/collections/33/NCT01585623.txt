      eligibility (screening period 21 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 15 days of
      study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last
      administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are receiving
      benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.
