    
      This is a randomized, non-blinded study comparing the effects of multimodal pain management
      (ibuprofen, tylenol, and narcotics/oxycodone as needed) for relief of post-operative pain in
      patients who undergo hernia repair. Patients who present for elective hernia surgery will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion by pre-operative pain score into a multimodal pain treatment
      group or conventional opiod treatment group for post-operative pain management. They will be
      followed up after their surgery to evaluate their pain scores and narcotic use.
