      separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, suspended in X-VIVO 15 serum-free
      medium, and culture with 1000 U/ml rhIFN-γfor the first 24 h, followed by stimulation with
      100 ng/ml OKT3 , 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 and 100 U/ml IL-1α to activate the CIK.Dendritic cells were
      incubated with CIK. Fresh medium containing 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 was added every 2 days and the
      cell density was maintained at 2×10^6 cells/mL.D-CIK were harvested, washed, and resuspended
      after culture for 14 days. Before cell transfer,D-CIK were incubated with anti-PD-1
      antibody,and a fraction of the D-CIK were collected to assess their number, phenotype, and
      viability of cells, and to test for possible contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins.
      Then, autologous D-CIK (1.0-1.5*10^10 cells) were transferred to patients via intravenous
      infusion. Generally, participants received at least 4 cycles of treatment at 2-week intervals
      or received doses until disease progression occurred. If the participants were
      disease-stable, additional cycles of maintenance treatment were eligible.

      Participants will be evaluated for the safety, clinical activity and toxicity. The primary
      end point was the objective response for each participant at the time of D-CIK and anti-PD-1
      infusion as assessed by RECIST. Peripheral blood of patients were also assessed for related
      cytokine using ELISPOT assays. Additional,the investigators will evaluate tumor markers in
      participants with clinical response/non-response by immunohistochemical staining of tumor
      sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the predictive
      biomarker that may be used in future studies.
