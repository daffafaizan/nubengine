      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of phenylephrine (topical phenylephrine solution)
      applied topically to the oral mucosa of bone marrow transplant patients treated with
      cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of
      phenylephrine applied topically to the oral mucosa of bone marrow transplant patients treated
      with cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation.

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of phenylephrine applied topically to the oral mucosa in
      preventing and/or decreasing severity of oral mucositis in bone marrow transplant patients
      treated with cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of topical phenylephrine solution followed
      by a phase II study.

      Patients undergoing a cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation regimen receive topical
      phenylephrine solution via spray to the oral mucosa 15-20 minutes prior to each
      cyclophosphamide infusion, 25-30 minutes after the beginning of each cyclophosphamide
      infusion, and 15-20 minutes prior to each radiation treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 2 weeks and then at
      3 months.
