      skeletal and smooth muscles, i.e. spasticity. The benefits of botulinum therapy are
      indisputable, however, muscle atrophy is one main adverse effect that may hinder a patient's
      strength and decrease the ability for the practitioner to accurately administer botulinum
      toxin to a specific muscle group. This, in turn may cause unintentional weakness of adjacent
      muscle groups through inaccurate targeting or diffusion of botulinum toxin. Currently, only
      two serotypes (abbreviated to BTX-A (BOTOX, XEOMIN and DYSPORT) and BTX-B (MYOBLOC),
      respectively) are used in clinical practice for spasticity. Research has shown that both
      BTX-A and BTX-B are efficacious in the treatment of spasticity. However, there is no
      documented literature evaluating if there is a statistically significant difference in the
      degree of muscle atrophy using BTX-A versus BTX-B.
