      Fifty percent of these fractures are intra-articular. The past several years an increase in
      open reposition internal fixation (ORIF) for distal radius fractures has been observed. This
      technique leads to a quicker resume of function the first 3 to 6 months compared to
      non-operative treatment. However, some patients continue to have a painful and stiff wrist
      postoperatively. Arthroscopically assisted removal of intra-articular fracture haematoma and
      debris may improve the functional outcomes following operative treatment of intra-articular
      distal radius fractures. Moreover, during arthroscopy the quality of the reduction and the
      presence of associated ligamentous injuries can be assessed.

      To our knowledge, no studies have been carried out to further examine the use of arthroscopy
      after internal plate fixation to remove fracture haematoma and debris on functional outcomes.
      Therefore, the purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the difference in
      functional outcome, assessed with the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score, after
      internal plate fixation with an additional wrist arthroscopy and conventional
      fluoroscopically assisted internal plate fixation in adult patients with displaced complete
      articular distal radius fractures. Secondary, we aim to determine the difference in
      functional outcomes with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score,
      post-operative pain, range of motion, grip strength, complications, quality of life (SF-36),
      and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, for patients undergoing additional wrist arthroscopy
      the quality of reduction, associated ligamentous injuries and cartilage damage will be
      assessed.
