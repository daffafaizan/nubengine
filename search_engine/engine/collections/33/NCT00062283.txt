        -  Determine the response rates in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase
           (MTAP)-deficient cancer when treated with alanosine.

        -  Determine the time to response and duration of response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic activity of this drug in these patients, based on special
           imaging to measure tumor adenosine triphosphate depletion.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive alanosine IV continuously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-145 patients (10-29 per tumor type) will be accrued for this
      study.
