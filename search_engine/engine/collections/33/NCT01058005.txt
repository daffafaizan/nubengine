      efficacy assessments, and to offer the opportunity for participants already enrolled to
      continue receiving study treatment for their planned participation in the study. The study
      had been active in several countries for approximately 1 year, and enrollment had been
      significantly slower than expected. Thus, the decision was made by the Sponsor to terminate
      the study since current and projected future enrollment rates would not have provided
      valuable information in a reasonable timeframe. All clinical efficacy and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) procedures were removed from the protocol, and safety assessments were to be
      managed through standard of care activities.
