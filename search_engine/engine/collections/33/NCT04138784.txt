      are caused by a progressive loss and deterioration of articular cartilage with reactive new
      bone formation at the joint's surface and margins involving articular cartilage, soft
      tissues, and bone damage. Many treatment programs have been developed, including medication
      with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities, and therapeutic exercises. It
      is hypothesized that an individualized comprehensive rehabilitation program uring 8 weeks
      would benefit women with knee osteoarthritis.
