    
      Background:

        -  The most compelling argument in favor of testing immune-based strategies (and
           anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) therapy in particular) in biliary tract
           cancers (BTC) is that chronic inflammation appears to be the most common etiologic
           factor in the development of biliary tract cancer.

        -  Single-agent activity has been shown for PD1-directed therapy in BTC. Given the
           potential for oxaliplatin-induced immunogenic cell death we would like to evaluate the
           combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) chemotherapy with pembrolizumab.

      Objective:

      To determine the 5-month progression free survival (PFS) of Pembrolizumab in combination with
      CAPOX in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis biliary tract carcinoma OR histopathological
           confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics
           which, together with the pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of biliary
           tract carcinoma.

        -  Patients must have at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

        -  No prior treatment with oxaliplatin.

      Design:

      The proposed study is a phase II study of Pembrolizumab in combination with CAPOX in patients
      with advanced biliary tract carcinoma
