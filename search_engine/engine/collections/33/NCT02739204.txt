      COX-2 enzyme to block the inflammatory signaling and has been approved to treat colon cancer.
      In our preliminary findings, Celecoxib significantly inhibited cell growth,proliferation,
      migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma cell (OSCC) lines. The Institutional Review Board in China Medical University
      Hospital (CMUH) has approved the combination treatment of concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and/or
      Cisplatin with or without Celecoxib in a phase II clinical trial for relapse-free primary
      OSCC patients.
