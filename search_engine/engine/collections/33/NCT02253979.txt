      efficiency of the DLT depends on its exact position in the airways, as verified by
      fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) after intubation, and re-verified after positioning the
      patient on the lateral position. The VivaSight TM DL is a single use left DLT with a camera
      embedded in the tube's right side port. The view from the camera appears continuously on a
      monitor. This study was designed to compare the VivaSightTM DL to the standard DLT. The
      primary end point is the time required for intubation with visual confirmation of DLT
      position.
