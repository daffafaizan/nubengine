    
      Open-label, single arm study that will enroll antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected adults who
      are doing well post-liver or post-kidney transplant who are eligible and willing to add
      everolimus to their immunosuppressive regimen (with a target trough level between 3-8 ng/ml).
      Calcineurin inhibitors will be decreased to obtain a 50% reduction in trough levels with the
      addition of everolimus. Subjects will be maintained on that regimen for 6 months.

      Biologic specimens for intensive immunology and virology studies will be obtained before,
      during and after exposure to everolimus. Samples will be analyzed at screening, baseline
      (prior to addition of everolimus), and at weeks 8 and 26 (while on everolimus), and week 52
      (6 months post everolimus discontinuation).
