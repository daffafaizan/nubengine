      orthodontic treatment without tooth extraction. The patients were randomly assigned for
      treatment with customized lingual brackets or with conventional labial brackets. During the
      alignment period 0.012 inch (T1) , 0.014 inch(T2), 0.016 inch (T3)NiTi arch wires were
      performed respectively and the control visits were scheduled by 6-weeks intervals. In all
      sessions, digital models were obtained by intra-oral scanning device after removal of arch
      wire, which then analyzed by software. In order to analyze change in T0 (pretreatment), T1,
      T2 and T3; Little's irregularity index, distance between canine teeth, distance between first
      premolar teeth, distance between second premolar teeth, distance between first molar teeth
      and arch length measurements were performed on digital models.
