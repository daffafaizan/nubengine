      ER have a cardiopulmonary arrest, participants perform intubation and CPR. When it is judged
      as a high-risk group with a high probability of droplet infection, all participants in
      resuscitation team should wear personal protective equipment. Tracheal ultrasound and
      end-tidal carbon dioxide are used to confirm the placement of tube. The gold standard is the
      direct visualization using laryngoscope. The time it takes to confirm the placement of tube
      is also measured.
