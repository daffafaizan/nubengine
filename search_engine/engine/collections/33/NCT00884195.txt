      enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent.

      Subjects are enrolled into the program in groups of 10 to 12 every 6 weeks. Alternate groups
      will be will assigned to the two types of journaling. Each group will be given specific
      instructions related to the form of journaling assigned. These instructions will be in
      addition to the usual care prescribed in the Lifesteps® program. In the intervention group,
      patients will be introduced to gratitude journaling at the beginning of the 12 week class
      series and asked to journal each day. They will turn in their gratitude journal weekly. At
      the beginning of each weekly class, five minutes will be spent discussing the journaling.

      The control groups will not receive the information on gratitude journaling, but instead will
      be asked to complete a neutral journal in which they will journal in a general manner
      regarding their experiences participating in the Lifesteps® weight management program. These
      will also be collected weekly. At the beginning of class, five minutes will be spent
      discussing the journaling.

      There will be one consent form for the two groups. The instruction (either gratitude
      journaling or neutral journaling) that will be given to the subjects will reflect the group
      to which they have been randomized. Both types of journals will be reviewed initially, at
      mid-point and final by the psychologist (Robert Emmons) to verify the quality of reporting.
