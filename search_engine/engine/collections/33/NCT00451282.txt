    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a stepped care model for
      prevention of psychosocial distress (especially posttraumatic stress) after injury. The model
      includes screening for risk, standard follow-up with those at risk, and additional
      evidence-based interventions matched to individual need.

      The study will evaluate the impact of the intervention on psychosocial outcomes (PTSD and
      depression symptoms); as well as health outcomes (adherence to discharge instructions,
      health-related quality of life), and will provide preliminary data to inform
      cost-effectiveness analyses by describing the costs of providing the intervention and
      examining its impact on subsequent health service utilization.

      Study Design: 180 children at risk for persistent psychosocial distress post-injury, based on
      a screening assessment, will be randomized to the Stepped Preventive Care intervention or
      usual care. An additional comparison group of 90 low risk children will also receive usual
      care and be followed for assessment.
