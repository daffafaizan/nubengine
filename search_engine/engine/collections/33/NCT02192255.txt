      prescribed a new medication for uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (A1c), blood pressure, or
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol would improve (a) primary medication adherence, (b)
      medication persistence, (c) medication possession ratio, and (d) A1c, blood pressure or
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control. This study was part of the larger Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality funded SUPREME-DM study. The clinical trial reported here was
      coordinated and led by HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, while data
      collection was coordinated through Kaiser Permanente Northwest and analysis was conducted at
      Kaiser Permanente Colorado. The clinical intervention sites for this study included Kaiser
      Permanente Northern California, Group Health Cooperative, Marshfield Clinic, and Geisinger
      Clinic.
