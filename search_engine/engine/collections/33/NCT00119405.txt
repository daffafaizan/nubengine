      newly diagnosed patients. Recent data suggest that NRTIs are responsible for lipoatrophy, a
      condition marked by progressive fat loss. Another negative side effect to antiretroviral
      (ARV) regimens is mitochondrial toxicity, which can damage the heart, nerves, muscles,
      kidneys, pancreas and liver, as well as affecting the body's ability to produce energy for
      important life processes. It has been hypothesized that lipoatrophy may be related to
      mitochondrial toxicity, but a causal relationship between the two has yet to be established.
      This study will examine HIV infected treatment-naive patients who are initiating their first
      ARV regimens. The regimens will contain 2 NRTI, one of which being zidovudine and a
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The regimens will not contain any
      PIs.

      Patients will participate in this study for 96 weeks. There will be 4 study visits at Weeks
      12, 24, 48, and 96. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and fat biopsies will occur
      at all visits. Additionally, blood collection for metabolic testing will occur at Week 12.
      ARVs will not be provided by this study.
