      important to estimate the morbi-mortality. However, each of these tools has its advantages
      and disadvantages but none of them provides a measure of all components dimensions that
      characterize the associated PA and EE. The current scientific prospects for measurement of PA
      tend to associate several measuring devices. To date, these perspectives are facilitated by
      technological developments and miniaturization of various devices. Thus, the purpose of the
      study is to evaluate wether GPS associated with accelerometer are able to assess the humain
      locomotion and energy expenditure during exercises.
