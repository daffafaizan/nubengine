    
      Pasireotide Long Acting Release (Signifor Â®), a novel long-acting multi-receptor ligand
      somatostatin analogue, has been shown to be more effective for the treatment of GH-secreting
      pituitary adenomas than currently used long-acting somatostatin analogues (LA-SSAs). The
      long-term efficacy of acromegaly patients using LA-SSAs in combination with PEGV was over 90%
      in terms of normalization of IGF-I. The combination of PEGV with pasireotide LAR has not been
      studied yet. Combining PEGV with pasireotide LAR could result in a lower dose and less
      injections of pegvisomant. This may ultimately lead to a more cost-effective treatment and
      improved quality of life.
