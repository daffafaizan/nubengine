      and stimulate VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor) synthesis and stimulate collagen
      synthesis. Nowadays, a lot of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs are being performed. but the
      failure rate of rotator cuff repair is considerably high. Therefore, this study is to
      evaluate the effect of polydeoxyribonucleotide for healing and fatty degeneration of rotator
      cuff.

      Visual analog scale (VAS) of pain and other functional scores of the two group will be
      checked preoperatively and postoperative 3, 6, 12, 24 months. Growth factors (VEGF,
      fibroblast growth factor(FGF), insulin like growth factor(IGF)) will be checked
      preoperatively and postoperative 1h, 2 days, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6 months. Follow up MRI
      will be checked at postoperative 6 months. The parameters will be compared using statistical
      analysis.
