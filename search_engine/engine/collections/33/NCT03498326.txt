      adenocarcinoma patients, and divided them into two groups randomly, one group patients were
      given gemcitabine only according the current guidelines, while the other group patients were
      given gemcitabine combined with the anti-inflammation agent Celecoxib. The disease free
      survivals, drugs related side effects, overall survivals and other endpoints events were
      recorded and analyzed, to assess the celecoxib could or couldn't synergist the gemcitabine
      anti tumor effect on R0 resection pancreatic cancer patients.
