      a day, that is 50 mg/kg every 6 hours in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
      infection manifesting COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019) with hypoxemia. Treatment
      protocol will continue for 4 days (96 hours), and, if needed, the last study-specific
      bloodwork with being collected on day 7. All subjects will be followed to day 28 (phase I)
      and day 90 (phase II) for collection of clinical outcomes data through electronic health
      records (EHR) even though the treatment protocol will be completed by 96 hours from
      randomization at the latest. Secondary outcome data will also be collected either during
      in-person (clinic) visit or via telephone at the 60 and 90-day follow-up.
