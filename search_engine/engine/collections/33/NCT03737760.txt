    
      This study is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study with a follow-up period of 1.2 - 3.5
      years, dependent on when the participant enrolls. Participants will be assessed at baseline,
      and then every six months for 3.5 years or until the study ends, whichever comes first.

      The investigators plan to enroll 200 community-dwelling men and women age 70+ years.
