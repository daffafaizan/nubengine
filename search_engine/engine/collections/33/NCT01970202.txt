    
      The following steps shall be performed in the process of recruiting a patient for the study:

      Preoperatively:

        -  A baseline blood sample for Anti-FXa levels shall be obtained.

        -  Randomization of the patient to one of the two treatment groups

      Postoperatively:

        -  All patients will be treated with Sequential Compression Devices, massive I.V hydration
           and encouraged to ambulate early.

        -  Patients will receive three injections of enoxaparin, according to the treatment group
           they were assigned to, The first injection given on the morning after surgery. Four
           hours after the third injection of enoxaparin a blood sample will be taken from the
           patients and assessed for anti-FXa levels.

      A control group of 5 patients, randomly elected, will be recruited. This group will not be
      treated with enoxaparin. These patients will be treated with sequential compression devices
      and massive I.V hydration, an accepted treatment, proven effective for the studied
      population. The goal is to assess the anti-FXa levels in these patients, representing the
      baseline levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

      Furthermore, the preoperative, operative and postoperative management of these patients will
      be identical to that of the treatment groups and on the third day post-operation a blood
      sample from these patients will be retrieved and assessed for anti-FXa levels.
