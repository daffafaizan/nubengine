      aimed at helping families overcome barriers to childhood obesity prevention. Barriers include
      social, environmental, and family issues.

      This intervention will be compared to a control condition consisting of a community health
      worker (CHW)-delivered intervention aimed at helping families improve positive parenting
      skills.

      The intervention uses multiple delivery modalities to maintain novelty and prevent
      attrition/burden. These include home visits, telephone contacts, print (literacy sensitive
      newsletters), social media (Facebook), and community events. Parents and children will
      complete scheduled assessments at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-up.

      The Specific Aims are:

      Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control condition
      on child physical activity, healthy eating, BMI and utilization of built environment
      resources.

      Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control condition
      on parent physical activity, healthy eating, BMI.

      Aim 3: To examine the potential scalability of the intervention guided by the RE-AIM (Reach
      Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) model.
