      sub-optimally controlled on at least one oral anti-diabetic medication.

      Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria after screening are hospitalized and
      go through the Duodenal Glycemic Control™ treatment.

      Duodenal Glycemic Control™ treatment is conducted by a gastroenterologist, in an endoscopic
      suite, with an off-the-shelf endoscope, using the DiaGone™ system.

      Patients are followed for 6 months for AE and SAE. Patients are followed for 12 months for
      glycemic control parameters.
