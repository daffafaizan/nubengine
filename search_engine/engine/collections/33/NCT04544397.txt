      procedural and follow-up data of consecutive patients that underwent catheter ablation for AF
      with laser ballon (2nd gen system). A number of 3 enrolling centers is estimated with an
      overall number of about 100 patients. A minimal follow-up of 3 months is required before
      analyzing clinical outcomes. The data analysis will focus on implant outcomes and early, mid
      and long-term recurrence of AF, evaluated with intracardiac rhythm monitoring.
