      SUI affects the patients' quality of life and health seriously. To date, there has not
      specific therapy on SUI. Former research showed acupuncture may work for SUI. This
      multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture for simple female stress
      urinary incontinence is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of EA. This project is
      conducted by Chinese researchers, supported by the Chinese Government. The research result is
      expected to provide high quality evidence of EA for simple female stress urinary
      incontinence.
