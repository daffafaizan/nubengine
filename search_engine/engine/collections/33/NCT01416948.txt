      service members returning from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and
      Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Virtually all individuals who suffer TBI (TBI) have acute
      cognitive effects, and a significant number have persistent symptoms. A large number of
      individuals with PTSD also report problems with cognition, however, little is known about the
      treatment of cognitive complaints in either condition and less is known about cognitive
      complaints in individuals with co-occurring TBI and PTSD.

      There is some preclinical evidence that both the cholinergic and catecholaminergic
      neurotransmitter systems play important roles in cognitive function in healthy individuals as
      well as those with mTBI and/or PTSD. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of two
      pharmacotherapies, one that predominantly augments cholinergic function (galantamine [GAL])
      and one that augments predominantly catecholaminergic function (methylphenidate [MPH]), for
      reducing cognitive symptoms in individuals with TBI and/or PTSD.

      Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled design, 159 individuals with TBI and/or
      PTSD with persistent cognitive complaints will be randomized to receive galantamine 12 mg
      BID, methylphenidate 20 mg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective is to assess
      the efficacy of galantamine and methylphenidate in reducing cognitive complaints in patients
      with PTSD and/or TBI. Secondary objectives are to assess the extent to which non-cognitive
      distress responds to galantamine or methylphenidate, and assess the effect that galantamine
      and methylphenidate have on cognitive performance.
