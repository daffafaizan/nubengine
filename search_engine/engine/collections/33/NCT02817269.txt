      at the university. Patients with shoulder complaints (described as pain felt in the shoulder
      or upper arm) will be randomly assigned to either an manual palpation or deep dry needling
      group. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups, a deep dry needling group and
      manual palpation group. Visual analogue scale (VAS), referred pain (ReP) pattern and features
      of referred pain of the infraspinatus muscle will be all assessed post-technique.
