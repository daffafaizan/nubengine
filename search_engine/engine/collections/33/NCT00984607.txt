      were enrolled after informed consent. After a standard upper GI evaluation, oral
      administration of a standard 13 mm barium sulfate tablet was performed and swallowed with
      dilute liquid barium during fluoroscopic monitoring. A spot radiograph was obtained once the
      barium tablet was in the gastric pouch and the dilute liquid barium was passing through the
      gastric band stoma. Post-processing software used the longest radiographic dimension of the
      13 mm barium tablet as the size reference to calibrate measurement of the gastric band stoma
      diameter.
