      cartilage lesions of the knee will be candidates for this study. Baseline data will include
      physical examination of the knee, clinical assessment of knee pain and function using
      validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), radiographs, and MRI. Tissue from
      qualified donors will be used to establish allogeneic MSC banks (using current Good
      Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on standard operating procedures), which will be tested
      and released for clinical use. Patients will undergo surgical debridement of their cartilage
      defect with harvest of the articular cartilage surrounding the defect rim. Following rapid
      digestion into chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix, autologous chondrons will be mixed
      in a 1:4 ratio with allogeneic AMSCs obtained from AMSC banks and suspended in fibrin glue
      for application to the debrided osteochondral defect. All patients will be clinically
      evaluated at 1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, 18 moths, and 24 months
      post-RECLAIM for adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective RECLAIM
      treatment, each subject will be followed-up for study endpoints using a predetermined
      protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, and MRI.
