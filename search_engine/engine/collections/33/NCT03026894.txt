      groups as following; complete denture group (CD) consists of 23 patients wearing conventional
      complete dentures and another Implant overdenture group (IOD) consists of 23 patients wearing
      mandibular complete overdenture with 2 implants. Two panoramic radiographs at baseline and in
      a follow-up to 7 years were used to measure the ratio of bone changes between the anatomical
      bone area and the reference area in the maxillary and the mandibular ridges. The occlusal
      contacts percentage of force in maximum intercuspation anteriorly and posteriorly were
      recorded for both groups by using T-Scan III system.
