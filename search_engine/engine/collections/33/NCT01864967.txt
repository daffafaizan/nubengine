      distributed into groups. Group I was composed by wounds in the right lower limb that received
      carbon dioxide and group II by wounds in the left lower limb that not received carbon
      dioxide, both related to the same patient. Carbon dioxide infusion was performed with the
      needle pointed toward the granulation tissue, 5cm distant from each one at intervals of 4
      days. Biopsies were collected from the wounds before carbon dioxide infusion and after the
      3rd, 5th and 10th application. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using
      Wilcoxon's test and Friedman's variance analysis and multiple comparisons test.
