      concealed envelopes into 2 groups (each included 40 patients), group I managed by radical
      gastrectomy with D1 lymphadenectomy while group II managed by radical gastrectomy with D2
      lymphadenectomy . Both groups were compared regarding postoperative mortality, morbidities,
      tumor recurrence and 2 years survival rates.
