      time communicating with other health care providers. Many of these communications have
      shifted mediums from handwritten notes and face-to-face conversations to phone calls and
      paging systems. More recently the rapid adoption of smartphones has led to the use of
      mobile-enabled technologies using smartphones such as text messaging and email. While these
      technologies may offer ease and fit better within the clinical workflow, they often send
      patient information through unsecure cellular or internet connections. Mobile secure text
      messaging may address these issues by encrypting data and allowing for asynchronous or
      synchronous communication between individual providers or groups of providers. In this study,
      the investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the impact of
      offering mobile secure text messaging on clinical outcomes.
