      approach patients with coronary lesions formerly considered to be classical candidates for
      bypass surgery, e.g. patients with left main coronary stenosis. However, it is still unclear
      whether the good long-term results achieved with the surgical therapy can be reproduced by an
      interventional strategy using drug-eluting stents (DES).

      The aim of the current trial is, therefore, to compare the clinical and angiographic results
      of PCI and CABG in patients with left main coronary stenosis.

      The study was planned as a "non-inferiority" trial based on the hypothesis that PCI may be
      able to reach similar long-term results as compared to CABG.
