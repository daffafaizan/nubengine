      factors, and cytokines in degenerative tendons, indicating that the tendon is constantly
      changing. This change will in turn produce a change in the morphology of the tendon tissue in
      the ultrasound image. However, there have been few studies in the past literature on the
      correlation between constant changes in tendon-specific transcription factors and
      characterization on clinical ultrasound images. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to
      extract the effusion and damaged tendon while performing tendon repair therapy in patients
      with tendon tears, and to analyze the tendon-related transcription factors from histology and
      cytology to understand the changes in tendon homeostasis. At the same time, the
      interpretation of clinical ultrasound images was combined to establish the relationship
      between the biochemical factors of the cell tissues of chronic tendon lesions and the
      clinical ultrasound image. This study will help us to understand the mechanism of chronic
      tendinopathy.
