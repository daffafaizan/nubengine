    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of LCL161 as therapy for primary myelofibrosis (PMF),
      post-polycythemia vera (PV) myelofibrosis (MF) and post-essential thrombocytosis (ET) MF.

      II. To determine the objective response which is defined as CR (complete remission) + PR
      (partial remission) + CI (clinical improvement) after three cycles of treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of LCL161 as therapy for PMF, post-PV MF and post-ET MF.

      II. To determine time to response and response duration. III. To assess changes in symptom
      burden as assessed by Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score
      (MPN-SAF TSS) and M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) questionnaires.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the mechanisms of action of LCL161 in patients with MF; these studies will
      include the analysis of baculoviral IAP repeat containing 2 (cIAP1), X-linked inhibitor of
      apoptosis, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (XIAP), and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)
      polymerase 1 (PARP) protein levels which will be determined by western blot (actin as loading
      control) and will be measured at baseline and at beginning of each cycle for first 3 cycles
      and at end of study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SMAC mimetic LCL161 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
