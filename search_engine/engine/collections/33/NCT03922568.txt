      2018 at Ganin Fertility Center, Cairo, Egypt, were investigated for the gender ratio and then
      divided into three groups according to the sperm selection technique used before performing
      sperm injection; DGC (237 neonates out of 173 ICSI cycles), PICSI (147 neonates out of 109
      ICSI cycles) , and MACS (145 neonates out of 106 ICSI cycles). In PICSI and MACS groups.
      Power analysis was done by comparing the sex ratio of the neonates between DGC, PICSI and
      MACS. The chi-squared test for independent samples was chosen to perform the power analysis
      with Î±-error level at 0.05. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
      significant. All statistical calculations were done using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for
      the Social Science; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) release 22 for Microsoft Windows.
