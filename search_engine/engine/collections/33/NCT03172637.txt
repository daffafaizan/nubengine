      hormones. In women with CKD, elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
      luteinizing hormone (LH) are common. These hormonal changes are detected in the early stages
      of kidney disease and progressively worsen as kidney disease progresse .

      . Women with chronic renal failure commonly have elevated circulating prolactin levels. As in
      men with chronic renal failure, the hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be
      autonomous, as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release.

      It has been suggested that the elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary
      function and contribute to sexual dysfunction and galactorrhea in these patients. However,
      uremic women treated with bromocryptine rarely resume normal menses and continue to complain
      of galactorrhea (if present), despite normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration.
      Thus, factors other than hyperprolactinemia must be important in this setting .
