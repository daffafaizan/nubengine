    
      This study has two purposes:

        -  To determine what different strengths and number of doses of EGEN-001, administered
           directly into the peritoneal cavity, can be given safely in combination with standard
           intravenous chemotherapy for ovarian cancer

        -  To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of EGEN-001 when combined with standard
           chemotherapy; biological markers of EGEN-001 activity will be collected and ovarian
           cancer burden will be evaluated per standard practice.
