      multiple variables in addition to CD3+ cell dose which affect engraftment, immune
      reconstitution, GVH and GVL in these patients including recipient age, diagnosis, disease
      status at transplantation, donor/recipient tissue type match, preparative regimen, and GVHD
      prophylaxis. Thus the ability to produce products with a fixed CD3+ content is critical to
      further research and ultimately to the definition of the "right dose" of CD3+ cells for
      various clinical situations.

      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive a peripheral blood stem cell product from
      their original matched sibling donor engineered to deliver a dose of 3.0+/-0.5 x107 CD3+
      cells/kg recipient body weight. Other components of the graft will not be manipulated and the
      recipient will receive the total number of cells collected with the exception of minimal
      losses that occur during the process of CD3+ T cell isolation.
