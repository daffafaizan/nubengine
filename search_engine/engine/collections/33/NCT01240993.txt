      (MTP; R01 DA17294 / Project Period: 8/20/04 - 12/31/09). MTP is the first parenting
      intervention developed for substance abusing mothers based on the attachment theory. It is
      also the only parenting intervention for substance abusing mothers that has led to
      improvement in maternal caregiving sensitivity and responsiveness to infant and toddler
      distress in observed lab-based interactions. The investigators now have all the research
      materials to conduct a Stage II randomized clinical trial including a treatment manual,
      treatment fidelity scales therapist training program and outcome measures. In this Stage II
      formal efficacy trial, the investigators (1) Introduce new measures of dyadic adjustment and
      child attachment, (2) Add an 18 week follow up period to test for sustained treatment
      effects, (3) Measure major constructs (reflective functioning, representations, dyadic
      adjustment, and child attachment) when they are expected to change, (4) Examine temporal
      mechanisms of change proposed in the MTP treatment model (5) Determine whether improvements
      in dyadic adjustment reduces incidence of relapse, (6) Broaden the MTP therapist pool by
      training four new therapists and (7) Broaden the coding pool by training 3 additional coders
      per measure. One hundred and fifty mothers caring for children ages 12 to 60 months of age
      will be recruited from outpatient substance abuse treatment services at the APT Foundation
      into the intention-to-treat sample and will be randomized to 12 weeks of MTP vs. PEP and
      followed for 33 weeks.
