      acuity loss. Conventional treatments may sometimes improve the visual function, whereas other
      times, the visual acuity continue to decrease, in spite of all the medical, surgical or laser
      treatments.

      Intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF agents (ex. Avastin for our trial) seem to be an
      important tool for certain difficult situations in which at the ocular fundus, out of
      different reasons (advanced age, diabetes mellitus, retinal veins occlusions, etc)new
      pathologic vessels appear, causing devastating changes in the posterior and anterior segment
      as well.
