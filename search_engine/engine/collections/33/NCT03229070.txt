    
      Will include patients between 30 and 80 years of age, of both sexes, submitted to thoracic
      surgery with incision by posterolateral thoracotomy, as well as those submitted to
      video-assisted thoracic surgery for pulmonary resection (bulectomy, segmentectomy, lobectomy,
      pneumectomy).

      The cycloergometer rehabilitation program will be performed twice a day for 20 minutes.

      The expectation of comparing two different types of muscle overload (interval training versus
      continuous training) is that the training of shorter duration and greater load also has a
      greater demand on the cardiopulmonary system of these patients and, therefore, a better
      response to the functional capacity rehabilitation program of these individuals.
