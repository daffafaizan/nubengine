    
      This protocol describes a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to test whether a
      clinic-integrated, low intensity, multi-component behavioral intervention is effective in
      preventing the deterioration in glycemic control, treatment adherence, and quality of life
      that commonly occur during late childhood and early adolescence in youth with type 1
      diabetes. The study will also examine mechanisms and processes that influence the
      effectiveness of family management of diabetes during this developmental period.
