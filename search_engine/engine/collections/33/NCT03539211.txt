      influence and measure the core muscles. Inefficient stability and asymmetrical muscle
      activity of the core have been linked to a wide range of lower extremity injuries. Training
      of the abdominal muscles to obtain symmetrical recruitment for optimal trunk stabilization is
      a widespread clinical practice, however valid and reliable assessment tools and effective
      intervention protocols are lacking. This study uniquely uses both a clinical assessment tool
      and musculoskeletal ultrasound to measure changes in the core muscles following an exercise
      intervention. The overall purpose of this study was to design a valid and reliable assessment
      tool and an effective training protocol to activate the core muscles.
