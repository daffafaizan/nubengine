      such biventricular filling pressures and systemic oxygen extraction can be improved by
      cholinergic stimulation in patients with ME/CFS.

      The objective of this study is to examine the exercise response to pharmacologic cholinergic
      stimulation in ME/CFS patients already undergoing a clinically indicated level 3
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This will be achieved by inhibiting
      acetylcholinesterase with pyridostigmine, thus increasing acetylcholine levels, downstream
      levels of norepinephrine, and enhancing vascular regulation.

      To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:

      Define the response of peak oxygen uptake (VO2) to pyridostigmine. Define the gas exchange
      responses, such as end-tidal CO2 and ventilatory efficiency to pyridostigmine.

      Define the hemodynamic responses, such as right atrial pressures, pulmonary artery pressure,
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, pulmonary
      vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance to pyridostigmine.

      Evaluate the response of skeletal muscle oxygen extraction and lactate to pyridostigmine.

      These determinations will occur during a clinically indicated level 3 CPET, which includes
      exercising on a stationary cycle with a right heart catheter (RHC) and a radial arterial line
      in place. To stimulate the cholinergic response, a single dose of an oral
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, pyridostigmine, versus placebo will be given after the level
      3 CPET. Recovery cycling will be performed after a rest period of 50 minutes. This will be
      administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
