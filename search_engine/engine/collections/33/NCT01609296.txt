      in the lower extremities, usually due to atherosclerosis. Progression of PAD can result in
      critical limb ischemia (CLI), manifested by ischemic pain at rest or in the breakdown of the
      skin, resulting in ulcers or gangrene which ultimately may lead to amputation and death.

      The IN.PACT Global Clinical Study aims to expand and understand the safety and efficacy data
      on the IN.PACT Admiralâ„¢ DEB in a real world population of subjects with intermittent
      claudication and/or rest pain (Rutherford class 2-3-4) due to obstructive disease of the
      superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries.
