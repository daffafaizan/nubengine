           large intestine is used. By following a given procedure for each location in the large
           intestine, the number of lymph nodes can be analyzed for each location to find out if
           this differs and if prognosis is affected by lymph node numbers according to tumor site.

        2. Markers. Different variables are examined for use in clinical judgment to make treatment
           better as well as genetic experimental analyses for comparison with clinical outcome to
           better understanding of clinical behavior.

        3. Laparoscopic resections. The technical challenge of laparoscopic approach has been
           compared with conventional surgery without any difference being observed in trials.
           However, it should be compared with radical open surgery to compare best achievements by
           using number of lymph nodes as well as outcome measures in the short and long term
           (mortality).

        4. Comorbidity, old age itself, type of surgery and perioperative care according to the so
           called fast track surgery may all play a part in reducing perioperative morbidity and
           mortality. A maximum 3% mortality should be aimed for.

        5. Colon cancer usually metastasize to the liver and lungs. Surgical treatment of liver
           metastases has been extensively studied and the prognosis has improved. Lung metastases
           has not been given similar attention but the prognosis of those operated may be good and
           equal that after liver surgery. The need for pulmonary resection and factors associated
           with metastases and lung metastases in particular will be studied.
