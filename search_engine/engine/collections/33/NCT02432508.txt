      the waiting list group), you will be randomized to laser acupuncture and sham laser
      acupuncture group. Each group will include 100 patients and given intervention according to
      their hemodialysis frequency, i.e., BIW or TIW. The intervention will then be crossed over to
      the other one after 4 week of wash-our period. Outcome measurement includes questionnaires,
      biochemistry analysis, instrumental analysis and medication score.
