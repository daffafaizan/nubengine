      DNA, and RNA. Flow cytometry, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), histology and
      immunohistochemistry are assays which can identify specific cell populations and provide
      valuable information regarding the pathologic characteristics of those populations. Flow
      cytometry analyzes the surface markers of cells. Histology and immunohistochemistry further
      characterize surface and cellular molecules and aid in the diagnosis of certain skin
      diseases. Gene expression profiling allows investigators to examine the genes detectable to
      determine the function of the cells involved, and PCR techniques are useful for the diagnosis
      of certain conditions and for DNA analysis.

      By procuring blood, skin tissue, and swab samples from patients with and without neoplastic
      and inflammatory skin disorders at the time of their appointments, the hypothesize that
      future translational research can be conducted on such specimens using the aforementioned
      techniques to further understand disease mechanisms in cutaneous disorders, and to
      potentially discover defective function and genetic mutations within cells from patients with
      neoplastic and inflammatory skin disorders. By establishing a tissue bank, we aim to lay the
      foundation for future work that will improve our understanding of the biology and natural
      history of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous diseases.
