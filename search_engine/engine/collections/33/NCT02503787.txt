    
      Prospective, multi-center, open-label study evaluating programming options in spinal cord
      stimulation on pain relief. All eligible subjects will undergo a Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS) device trial that includes an intraoperative programming trial. Subjects experiencing a
      positive response to the programming parameters (improvement in average overall pain relief)
      during the trial from baseline will move forward with a permanent implant. Those not
      reporting a positive response to the programming parameters will be exited from the study.

      The subjects will complete a number of assessment worksheets to characterize their Quality of
      Life and function and the level of pain they are experiencing from the baseline to 3 months
      post neurostimulation trial.
