    
      This is a phase Ib, dual-center, open-label, single-arm, clinical study to determine the
      safety, tolerability and trends of efficacy of ALECSAT as an add-on therapy to standard
      treatment with carboplatin and gemcitabine in female patients with locally advanced
      inoperable or metastatic TNBC, which has received no more than two prior systemic therapies
      for mTNBC.

      Study treatments will continue until any of the following occurs: disease progression is
      locally verified using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1);
      unacceptable toxicity; intercurrent illness that necessitates discontinuation of study
      treatment; Investigator's decision to withdraw the patient; pregnancy; patient noncompliance
      with study treatment or procedure requirements; withdrawal of consent to treatment; death;
      end-of-treatment visit at month 18; or other administrative reasons requiring cessation of
      study treatment. If chemotherapy is discontinued during the study, the patient will be
      allowed to continue in the study on ALECSAT treatment after discontinuation of chemotherapy,
      based on the Investigator's judgement. In addition, if clinical assessments indicate an
      anti-cancer effect of ALECSAT treatment (at the discretion of the investigator) at end of
      study, patients will be offered to continue ALECSAT treatment after end of the study under
      approved named patient use. Response assessment according to RECIST v1.1 will be performed at
      weeks 9 (±7 days), 18 (±7 days), and 27 (±7 days) after treatment start as by local hospital
      standards. Imaging will continue every 9 weeks (±7 days) thereafter during the first year,
      independent of any treatment delays. Response assessment will be performed every 12 weeks (±7
      days) after the first year. Safety will be monitored according to National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0 (v5.0). Patients
      who discontinue study treatments for reasons other than PD will continue post-treatment
      imaging studies for disease status follow-up as per protocol, i.e., every 9 weeks (± 7 days)
      and 12 weeks (± 7 days) during the first year or second year of study participation, until
      disease progression, start of a non-study anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent to
      study participation, death, or end-of-treatment visit 18 months.
