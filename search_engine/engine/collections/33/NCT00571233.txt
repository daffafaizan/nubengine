      with one ("single") ventricle are similar to levels of these blood proteins in children with
      two ventricles. For children with hearts with a single ventricle, we will examine blood
      proteins at various levels of heart function. To assess blood protein levels, we will collect
      small (6 mL) samples of blood. Heart function will be determined by existing clinical scoring
      systems. Enrolled patients will receive an echocardiogram, which is a dynamic ultrasound
      picture of the beating heart.
