      T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are two predominant cytotoxic effector cells that
      are the major components of antitumor immunity. In mouse models, proliferation of T
      lymphocytes in response to surgical trauma is defective . Programmed death-1 (PD-1) belongs
      to the CD28 receptor superfamily. It is an inhibitory receptor, and its expression is
      upregulated on activated leukocytes, resulting in an inhibited immune response. PD-1
      interacts with two ligands: programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also referred to as B7-H1) and
      programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2, also known as B7-DC). PD-L2 is expressed mainly on
      activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, whereas PD-L1 is distributed widely. In
      addition to immune cells, some subsets of tumor cells also express PD-L1 to escape from
      immunosurveillance. It has been reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be activated by
      surgical stress. Hence, we instigate the effect of anesthetic technique on expression of PD1
      and PD1 ligand.
