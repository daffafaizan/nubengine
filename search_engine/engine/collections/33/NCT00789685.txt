    
      This was a phase I/II open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      efficacy of FP-1201 (IFN Î²-1a) in the treatment of patients with ALI and ARDS.

      The primary objective in the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FP-1201 in
      patients with ALI/ARDS and to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the
      optimum tolerated dose (OTD) in patients likely to derive clinical benefit.

      The study consisted of a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and OTD followed by a separate cohort expansion phase in which the OTD was administered.
