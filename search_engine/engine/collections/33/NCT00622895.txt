      I. To determine the safety and potential efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning with
      fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for the stabilization or regression of disease
      manifestations of severe systemic sclerosis (SSc).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic donor engraftment can be safely established with
      reduced intensity conditioning followed by matched sibling or unrelated donor bone marrow
      transplantation in patients with severe SSc.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2 and
      Cyclophosphamide IV on days -6, -5, and undergo 2 Gray TBI on day -1. Patients receive human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients then
      receive cyclophosphamide IV on days +3 and +4, and beginning day +5 they start tacrolimus
      orally (PO) and enteric coated mycophenolic acid.

      After completion of initial study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then
      annually for 5 years.
