    
      This randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, Phase 2 trial will be conducted at
      multiple sites. The composition of the Quad-NIV Influenza Vaccines to be used in this trial
      includes recombinant H1, H3, and two B hemagglutinin proteins for the 2018-2019 Northern
      Hemisphere influenza virus strains.

      Approximately 1375 healthy male and female subjects â‰¥ 65 years will be randomized into 7
      treatment groups, receiving various formulations of Quad-NIV, with or without Matrix-M1
      adjuvant or one of two active comparator influenza vaccines. Within each site, randomization
      will be stratified by history of receipt of 2017-2018 influenza vaccine. Subjects will
      receive two injections 28 days apart. On Day 0, subjects will receive one of the five
      Quad-NIV formulations or one of the two comparator influenza vaccines. On Day 28, subjects
      will receive either placebo or a licensed influenza vaccine rescue dose, depending on his or
      her initial randomization.

      Subjects will be followed for safety for approximately 6 months, with primary immunogenicity
      results at Day 28.
