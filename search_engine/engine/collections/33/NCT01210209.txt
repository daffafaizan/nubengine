        -  To identify and characterize a genetic susceptibility factor to Ewing's sarcoma by
           performing a Genome-Wide Association Study with as many as possible Ewing sarcoma
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected from patients and their relatives. Blood DNA samples are analyzed
      for susceptibility genes of Ewing Sarcoma.
