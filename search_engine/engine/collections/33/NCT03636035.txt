    
      Tregocel速 is a combination herbal product which as a dietary supplementation may help
      maintain proper performance of joints. Although some studies have reported beneficial effects
      for individual components of Tregocel速, there have been no clinical assessments of
      supplementation with Tregocel速 as a finished product. This study will involve collection of
      data on Tregocel速 supplementation in participants with symptomatic mild knee osteoarthritis
      (OA) who are already receiving standard pharmacological treatment.
