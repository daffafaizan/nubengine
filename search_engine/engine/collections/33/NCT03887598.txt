      deaths worldwide. Therefore, early detection of breast cancer and timely treatment are of
      great significance for controlling and reducing breast cancer mortality. Breast ultrasound is
      an adjunct to extensive use in the detection of breast cancer, but ultrasound is highly
      technically dependent on the examiner, and the results are greatly influenced by the
      subjective nature of the examiner, adding unnecessary surgery and puncture, which causes
      great problems for clinicians and patients.Moreover, the value of conventional ultrasound in
      the differential diagnosis of breast mass is still limited, and the emergence of new
      technologies such as artificial intelligence and elastography has improved the accuracy of
      ultrasound diagnosis to varying degrees.

      S-Detect technology is a computer-aided (CAD) system recently developed by Samsung Medical
      Center for breast ultrasound to assist in morphological analysis based on the Breast Imaging
      Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) description and final assessment.This provides a new way
      to identify the benign and malignant breast nodules.

      The E-Breast technique, unlike conventional strain-elastic imaging technology, performs an
      elastic analysis of the entire two-dimensional image.Moreover, when measuring the elastic
      ratio, it is only necessary to place a region of interest (ROI) at the nodule.Compared with
      the average elasticity of the surrounding area, it is more reflective of the elastic ratio of
      the mass to the surrounding tissue.
