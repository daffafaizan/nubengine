      this study is two-fold and consists of two phases involving the same subjects. In the first
      phase, the study aims to learn how individuals react to lifestyle choices and suggestions by
      examining a small group of people with similar health and lifestyle profiles. Specifically,
      how their food choices, physical activity pattern, sleep pattern, and stress levels affect
      glucose metabolism, stress response, inflammation, and microbiome composition.

      In the second phase of the study, the investigator's goal is to use the data collected to
      develop algorithmic policies that will help people optimize their health through lifestyle
      interventions and supplementation with prebiotics. The ultimate goal is to achieve
      optimization of glucose and stress regulation, inflammation state, and microbiome composition
      by observing real-time variations of these regulatory systems through the use of wearable
      health-monitoring devices and providing lifestyle suggestions via a mobile application.
