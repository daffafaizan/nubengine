      presentation with critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is a very invalidating condition
      characterized by rest pain, march inability, trophic lesions and unavoidable progression to
      major amputations, which are burdened by a high mortality in the first year. The
      pathophysiology of CLI often associates with a defect in the development of collateral
      vessels and angiogenesis, a process which refers to the formation of new blood vessels into
      tissue, due to circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and vascular progenitor cells.
      In the last few years, significant improvement of this condition has been reported following
      bone marrow (BM) autotransplant or autotransplant of peripheral EPCs mobilized from BM
      through the injection of granulocyte-colony stimulatory factor (G-CSF). In a previous study,
      the investigators found that individually variable proportions of circulating CD14+ cells
      expressed low levels of CD34 (CD14+CD34low) and revealed the functional phenotype of EPCs.
      The investigators therefore designed a monocentric randomized clinical trial to compare the
      therapeutic efficacy of BM autotransplant with the autotransplant of a population of
      circulating CD34+ and CD14+CD34low enriched by a closed sterile immunomagnetic system
      (enriched circulating EPCs or ECEPCs), without a previous EPC mobilization from BM.

      Patients will be evaluated for clinical parameters and ABI, TBI, TCp02 before autotransplant
      and at three follow-up times after the autotransplant (4, 24 and 52 weeks); also angio-TAC of
      legs, capillaroscopy, and photoplethysmography will be evaluated at 4, and even at 52 weeks.
