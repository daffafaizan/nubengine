    
      Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) is a long-acting ESA approved for treatment of anaemia in CKD
      patients, and may be administered once a week (QW), once every two weeks (Q2W) or once a
      month (QM) for correction and for maintenance in CKD patients not on dialysis. Prescribing
      information for darbepoetin alfa was updated in August 2013 (in EU and Australia), to
      incorporate the option for correction at QM dosing frequency in CKD patients not on dialysis.
      There is very little published literature describing QM correction in a real-world setting.

      Data obtained from this study are intended to contribute to filling a literature gap and to
      provide a robust source of information for physicians.
