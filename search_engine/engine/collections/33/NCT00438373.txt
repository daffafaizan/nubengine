      receptor expression on the day of hCG or the day of oocyte retrieval and the retrieval rates
      at oocyte pick up.

      For this purpose, m-RNA copy numbers will be assessed in the blood serum of patients
      undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF on different days.

      Furthermore, detailed ultrasound scans will be perfomed, as well as assesment of hormonal
      levels during ovarian stimulation.
