      unavailability of human tissues especially in the early stages of the disease. Eye bank
      tissues are first used for cornea transplants so that by the time they become available for
      basic research studies, the lens is no longer suitable for biochemical nor histological
      studies. Cataracts usually only become available after extraction which is at the end stage
      of their development. However, appropriate surgical lens specimens are no longer available
      because cataracts are generally extracted by the destructive phakoemulsification technique.
      Therefore, noninvasive techniques are required in order to study the lens in vivo.
