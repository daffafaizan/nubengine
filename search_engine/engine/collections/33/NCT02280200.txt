      exercise test will demonstrate a greater PWT compared to PWT assessed without the use of an
      AFO. Secondary hypotheses include evaluation of the effect of an AFO on: 1) calf muscle
      function, 2) claudication onset time, 3) functional ability, 4) peak oxygen consumption, and
      5) patient-reported outcomes. We will also examine the effects of the AFO on outcomes
      following 12 weeks of community walking.
