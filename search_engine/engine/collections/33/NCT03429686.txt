      this research is to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a digital application to aid
      reminiscence for people with dementia.

      This study proposes to design an application, based upon reminiscence therapy, which can act
      as storage for personal and communal 'positive memories' in a range of media types. This
      includes pictures, videos and audio.

      The target for this application is people with dementia and their staff caregivers. The study
      aims to recruit 40-50 participants (40 PwD and 10 staff caregivers). This research will look
      at the requirements for developing and evaluating a mobile application to see whether it
      might be used to aid reminiscence for people with dementia. Additionally, this research will
      ensure whether this digital reminiscence therapy can be delivered and accepted as planned in
      the care of people with dementia in Jordanian care homes. The acceptance of this digital
      reminiscence therapy will be assessed by using semi-structured interviews with approximately
      15 people with dementia and staff care-givers. Quantitative measures will be used before and
      after the intervention to explore whether certain outcomes are sensitive to change. These
      outcomes include memory, communication, anxiety, depression, and quality of life.
