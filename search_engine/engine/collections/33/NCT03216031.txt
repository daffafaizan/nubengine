      a choice for about 30 IF & BHS patients who would otherwise decline exercise interventions.
      Patients previously assessed by Wandsworth Integrated Falls & Bone Health Services have
      identified gardening as an enjoyable alternative to exercise classes. Gardening sessions will
      take place weekly (aiming for 3 groups with 10 patients and 2-4 students and/or staff members
      of the University of Roehampton). Through engaging patients in gardening activities the study
      seeks to achieve 4 main aims: 1. Increase physical activity levels; 2. improve mental and
      physical health outcomes; 3. foster self-efficacy and social connectedness; 4. reduce the
      risk of falls. The at falls risk population will benefit by engaging in a meaningful activity
      (designed and supported by clinicians and aided by students and staff members) which delivers
      on the core principles of strength, power, balance and coordination.
