      or outpatient surgery. MAC provides lower anesthetic agents than general anesthesia, however
      it has been shown to result high anesthetic complication rate because of negligent
      monitoring. Therefore, aim of this study is to investigate the effect of pre-warmed
      intravenous fluids on the core body temperature and the early outcomes.
