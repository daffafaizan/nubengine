    
      The objective of this NIS (according to section 4(23) of the German Medicinal Products Act)
      is the documentation of data on the effectiveness and tolerability of an Apremilast treatment
      under routine clinical conditions in German patients with plaque psoriasis.

      This NIS is intended to reflect the apremilast treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis
      who have received at least one prior conventional, systemic therapy or, if a contraindication
      is present, did not receive a systemic therapy so far, and who were diagnosed by their
      treating physicians to be eligible for an apremilast treatment. The treatment of Apremilast
      will be documented for a period of approximately 52 weeks.
