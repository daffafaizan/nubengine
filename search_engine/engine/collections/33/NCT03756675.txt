      for hematological malignancies. The "GIAC" protocol established by our center has
      successfully crossed the HLA barrier in HLA-mismatched/haploidentical HSCT. The protocol
      entails the following: treating donors with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to
      induce donor immune tolerance, intensified immunologic suppression to both promote
      engraftment and to prevent GVHD, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was included for the
      prophylaxis of GVHD and graft rejection, and combination of G-CSF-primed bone marrow harvest
      (G-BM) and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell harvest (G-PB) as the source of stem
      cell grafts. But peripheral blood transplantation is still prevalent. Compared with BM, G-PB
      is more convenient to collect, and the number of T lymphocytes and CD34+ cells is higher. It
      is reported that G-PB has a higher implantation rate and even a higher disease-free survival
      rate in sibiling-identical transplantation compared with BM transplantation, whereas there
      were also reports with different conclusions. This prospective, one-arm clinical cohort study
      aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of haplotype peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation (PBSCT) in the treatment of acute leukemia.
