      form of dexlansoprazole is being tested to look at the average time that it takes for one
      tablet to disintegrate in the mouth of healthy volunteers. At the point at which the panelist
      would normally swallow the granules, they will record the time and expectorate the
      disintegrated tablet mass and not actually swallow the tablet or granules.

      The study will enroll approximately 8 healthy volunteers. All participants will take one
      dexlansoprazole 30 mg OD tablet on up to three separate study days. No more than 60 mg of
      dexlansoprazole will be tested in any one day.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 2 weeks. Participants will make up to 4 visits to
      the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone approximately 1 week after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.
