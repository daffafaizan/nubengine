      gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy for clinical indications. Patients undergoing
      the procedure will be recruited. Participants will have a high fat liquid meal as breakfast.
      5 hours later, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a subcutaneous
      injection of placebo (n=15) or a subcutaneous injection of the Health Canada approved
      glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogue (teduglutide, Revestive®, Shire Canada)(n=15
      different subjects). 1 hour later, a duodenal biopsy specimen will be obtained from 2-3
      sample sites,snap frozen in dry ice and stored at -80°C for further analysis.
