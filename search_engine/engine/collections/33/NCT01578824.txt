      exhaled breath condensate in vitamin D resistant rickets.

      Introduction: Vitamin D seems to play a role in allergic and asthmatic reactions. Vitamin D
      resistant rickets patients lack vitamin D receptors and cannot absorb vitamin D.

      Aim: To assess the effect of absence of vitamin D receptors on airway reactivity, allergy and
      inflammatory mediators in exhaled breath condensate.

      Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters in patients with vitamin D resistant
      rickets and in healthy controls.

      Participant selection: The study group will consist of vitamin D resistant rickets patients
      followed and treated at the Pediatric Endocrinology Department at our hospital. The study
      group will be compared to an age- and sex-matched healthy control group that had a negative
      methacholine challenge test.

      Sample size: 40 participants in the two groups. Intervention: Each subject will undergo
      evaluation including a respiratory questionnaire, pulmonary function tests, methacholine
      challenge test with determination of PC20, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and exhaled breath
      condensate (EBC). Venous blood will be analyzed for complete blood count + eosinophils, IGE
      levels, and Vitamin D levels. Prick skin test for inhaled allergens will be performed. All
      measurements will be evaluated in a single 3 hour visit, with no follow up study visits.

      Primary end point: Airway reactivity as assessed by methacholine challenge test.

      Secondary outcome parameters: All other parameters are the secondary end points.
