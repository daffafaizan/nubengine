      factors such as ED overcrowding or inadequate training in pain management.

      As intravenous (IV) opioid administration is world-wide recommended for severe pain
      treatment, delays from triage to room admission and to first IV injection directly influence
      this time to pain-relief. Moreover, it is proven that an incorrect adherence to morphine
      titration protocol can participate in ED oligoanalgesia.

      Although ED experience in intranasal (IN) opioid administration is still lacking, this simple
      and non-invasive way of treating pain seems safe and promising. Opioid pharmacokinetic by IN
      route indeed is interesting for ED practitioners : while assuring a timely analgesia, the
      lower Cmax and delayed Tmax by IN route can theoretically limit the risk of respiratory
      depression, in comparison with IV route.

      We propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study on a convenience sample of
      adult patients admitted in our ED (annual census of 80000 attendances) for an isolated limb
      injury, and experiencing a severe pain (score > 5/10 on numerical pain scale).

      For primary outcome, we will compare the proportion of patients relieved (score < 4/10) 30
      minutes after admission, depending on the administration (or not) of a single intranasal dose
      of sufentanil (0,4 mcg/kg) given by the triage nurse.

      Other secondary outcomes will include : evolution of pain scores in the first hour of
      admission and during entire ED stay, proportions of opioid-induced side-effects, proportions
      of patients receiving morphine and doses of morphine administrated, times for discharge,
      patient and staff satisfaction scores.
