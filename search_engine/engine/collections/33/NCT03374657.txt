    
      This study will potentially include 5 cohorts with a minimum of 3 patients per cohort, with
      an optional cohort of up to 6 patients. This trial design uses a staggered patient enrollment
      with continuous data reviews to limit as much unforeseen risk as possible prior to enrolling
      each patient in each cohort or initiating another cohort. Only one eye (designated as the
      study or treated eye) will be dosed per patient. Each patient will be followed for 5 years
      after the subretinal injection of CPK850.
