      Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions recommendations are essentially based on experts'
      opinions. However, disparity in consumption of FFP by cardiac surgery centers in France
      probably reflects heterogeneous practices that are not well characterized. Furthermore,
      health outcomes of these strategies on morbidity and mortality are not documented.

      Objectives

      Primary: to describe transfusional strategies of FFP in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      and either presenting a serious bleeding during pre, per or post-operative periods or
      transfused by FFP without a serious bleeding.

      Secondary:

        -  To estimate the conformity of transfusion or lack of transfusion of FFP to French
           authorities recommendations.

        -  To describe the post-operative mortality and morbidity.

        -  To evaluate the prognostic role of FFP transfusion on mortality and morbidity

      Study design

      Prospective prognostic cohort study, with an exhaustive recruitment in participating cardiac
      surgery centers during the study period.

      Eligibility criteria

      Centers: 16 French cardiac surgery centers.

      Patients:

        -  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valvular replacement, surgery for thoracic aorta
           aneurysm or dissection, heart graft.

        -  Serious bleeding or FFP transfusion during pre, per or post-operative period.

        -  Patient's consent for collecting medical data

      Analysis

      Descriptive analysis of transfusional strategies according to patients' characteristics, type
      of surgery and circumstances of transfusions.

      Conformity to French authorities' current recommendations. Multivariate analysis of the
      prognostic role of FFP transfusion on 30-day mortality.
