    
      The trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with a total of 60
      participants located in the state of Michigan. Patients will be randomized to CBDRA60
      supplement or placebo.

      All participants will be newly diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV2 (assessed using a PCR
      test).

      Each participant will be randomized to either CBDRA60 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The study
      duration for each participant will be 5 weeks, including taking the supplementation (active
      or placebo for 28 days). Of the 60 participants, 30 participants will receive CBDRA60 and 30
      participants will receive the placebo. The infected individuals will be followed to assess
      disease progression defined as the need for hospitalization.

      For participants receiving the CBDRA60 supplementation, it aims to reduce

        1. The need to be hospitalized and

        2. Self-reported disease severity and resolution over 5 weeks Participants will self-report
           symptom severity and disease progression through weekly questionnaires. For each
           specified COVID-19 related symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty
           breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore
           throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea), participants will
           report one of the following 3 options: none (score of 0), mild (score of 1), moderate
           (score of 2) or severe (score of 3) except for new loss of taste or smell which will be
           assessed using a binary score (0 = no loss of taste/smell, 1 = loss of taste/smell) in
           accordance with the HHS guidelines (Sep 2020 document). The total disease severity score
           will be the average across all potential symptoms. The escalation protocol for any
           participants that experience symptoms that are more than mild or continue to progress
           will be directed to contact their primary care physician or their appropriate emergency
           care facility.

      Supplementation Daily sublingual tablet containing 30mg Cannabidiol and 30mg Red Algae, a
      total of 60mg per dose. Participants will take 2 tablets per day, sublingually and with food,
      taken approximately and at least, 8 hours apart, daily for 28 days. Participants will be
      mailed a supply of pills by an overnight courier service.

      Control subjects will receive daily oral placebo tablets of identical appearance and taste
      containing no CBDRA60.

      Study procedures Recruitment Participants will be recruited across Michigan via social media;
      community advocacy groups and equity initiatives; flyers and electronic communications
      distributed in healthcare centers, COVID-19 testing centers, and other avenues. Recruitment
      will primarily be conducted remotely and prospective participants will be asked to complete a
      web-based HIPAA-secure screening survey by the MB Clinical or VSafe system. Screen-eligible
      participants will be contacted by phone by research staff to complete the screening process
      using on-line consent forms.

      Baseline and follow-up Participants will receive messages as a reminder to take study pills.
      They will also be instructed to complete 1x per week online questionnaires for 5 weeks and an
      additional post study follow-up questionnaire at week 8. The questionnaire will include items
      on adherence with randomized supplementation with CBDRA60/placebo, use of non-trial
      supplements of CBD, development of symptoms and new illness, and self-report of disease
      progression and severity status. Non-responders to online notification will be telephoned to
      collect study data.

      Data Management Using ClinOne or VSafe Platform

      ClinOne, a clinical research organization (CRO) with a Vsafe platform will be implemented for
      key areas of improvement of patient engagement and retention throughout the investigation. It
      provides remote online services between patients and the clinicians in charge. It further
      provides services for:

        -  Required screening criteria,

        -  Questionnaires,

        -  Study contact,

        -  Recorded investigatory meetings,

        -  CEO and KOL presentation and important messages,

        -  Training videos. All through a secure online platform.

      All the services can be accessed via the ClinOne or VSafe platform. Patients will use the
      platform for reminders, to access study information, report questions or concerns, and
      communicate with principal investigators and physician. The platform allows the clinical
      trial leader to schedule events via its manager system (S.O.E.M). It is a secure portal to
      share approved study documents, provide a concierge and knowledge digital base, research
      visits, and ePro lite which will be used to deliver the questionnaires to patients and
      guarantee the collection of evaluable data. For reminders on when to take the CBDRA 60
      sublingual tablet an electronic eDosing adherence reminder will be available to notify the
      study participants.

      Lastly, in order to monitor the subjects health, remotely, and to collect additional
      biometric data, a smart BioIntelliSense's BioButton™ medical-grade device and
      HIPAA-compliance data service will be used. This enables effortless remote, multi-parameter
      data capturing that measures vital signs in real time. It comprises a single disposable
      on-body sensor for continuous monitoring of temperature, oximeter readings, respiratory rate,
      heart rate at rest, body position, sleep and activity state for 90-days. Alternatively, a
      similar oximeter / thermometer combination will be provided.

      Headache, New loss of taste, New loss of smell, Congestion or runny nose, Nausea, Vomiting,
      Diarrhea. Each patient will have a composite score ranging from 0-36/day.
