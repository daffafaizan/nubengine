      activity will be measured via 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Age, imaging date, sex, and outdoor temperature will
      be collected for all patients. To evaluate the effects of multiple metabolic parameters on
      BAT activity, we will collect height, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), medical
      history, diagnosis, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, liver triglyceride content, and
      thyroid metabolic activity for all patients with detectable BAT and their negative controls,
      consisting of two patients who underwent PET/CT scans at the same day but without detectable
      BAT.
