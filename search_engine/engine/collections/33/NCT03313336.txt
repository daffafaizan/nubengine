      in healthy male and female subjects, performed at a single study center. Prior to inclusion,
      informed consent will be obtained. A brief medical history, including limited demographic
      data (gender, age and ethnicity) will be recorded, and eligibility for inclusion to the study
      will be established through a physical inspection of hands. Subjects will be shown how to
      complete the VAS. Visual analogue scale (VAS) as a research tool is frequently used for the
      assessment of pain severity and relief. VAS is easy to use and can be applied in a variety of
      settings; results are reproducible. VAS data are sensitive to treatment effects and can be
      analyzed using parametric statistical techniques. At each specific study visit, each subject
      will undergo a left-right comparison of two patch preparations, followed by a repeated test
      with an alternate combination of preparations. Thus, the study will comprise: Visit 1: EMLA
      Test Patch plus Placebo Patch OR EMLA Test Patch plus EMLA current Reference Patch. Visit 2:
      EMLA Test Patch plus EMLA current Reference Patch OR EMLA Test Patch plus Placebo Patch.
      There will be a washout period of at minimum of 4 calendar days between treatment periods
      (visits). No follow-up visit is needed. Any adverse event (AE) that is ongoing at the last
      visit will be followed up as appropriate.
