      given to NAS infants in the first three weeks of life. Breastfeeding is the preferred feeding
      method for NAS infants as it has shown to reduce NAS severity and infant weight loss, though
      women who are not adherent to drug treatment programs or have the potential to use illicit
      drugs are not able to breastfeed due to the risks posed to the infant. Several studies have
      demonstrated the potential for caloric enhancement of formula and breast milk to support
      weight gain in NAS infants. Through a randomized control trial analyzing infant weight gain
      on standard-calorie vs. high-calorie diet regimens, we aim to quantify weight patterns in NAS
      infants and show that increasing caloric intake can improve weight gain.
