      arthritis is suspected. Septic arthritis diagnosis relies on microscopic and bacteriological
      analysis of synovial fluid obtained by arthrocentesis. Direct microscopic examination can be
      made within 2 to 12 hours but it is negative in about 50 % of the cases. It is necessary to
      wait 72 hours to obtain the result of the culture and reasonably rule out the diagnosis of
      septic arthritis. A method of establishing an immediate etiological diagnosis could improve
      the care of patients with joint effusion that is a therapeutic emergency and justify a
      hospitalization and a parenteral antibiotic therapy.
