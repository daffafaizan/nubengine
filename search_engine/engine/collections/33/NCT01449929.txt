    
      ING114915 is a Phase IIIb randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel
      group, fully-powered non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in approximately 468
      HIV-1 infected ART-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once
      daily (approximately 234 subjects) or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234
      subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC).
      The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an
      additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.

      Subjects who fulfil eligibility requirements will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once
      daily or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily. In order to achieve balance across the two treatment
      groups of the study, randomization will be stratified by: screening plasma HIV-1 RNA >/
      100,000 copies/mL (c/mL) or > 100,000 c/mL and background dual NRTI (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC) The
      DTG and DRV/r doses will be administered in an open-label fashion throughout the study.

      Subjects randomized to receive DTG and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will
      continue to have access to DTG until either it is locally approved and commercially
      available, the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, the patient meets a
      protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of DTG is terminated.
      Subjects randomized to the DRV/r arm will receive DRV/r through their Week 96 visit, after
      which they will be discontinued from the study and will need to make alternative arrangements
      to access antiretroviral medication. All subjects will receive background dual-NRTI therapy
      through their Week 96 visit.
