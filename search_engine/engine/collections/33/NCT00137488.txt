      tumor perfusion of patients with LGG will provide a novel understanding of subgroup (low and
      high-risk) of LGG. Thus, this study will allow identifying clinically relevant factors
      predictive for tumor progression and to select patients in high-risk group for adjuvant
      radiation therapy.
