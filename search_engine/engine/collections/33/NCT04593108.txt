      Compare the success rate of misoprostol with versus without letrozole as a pretreatment for
      medical termination of pregnancy during the first trimester.

      Hypothesis:

      Letrozole value as a pre-treatment medication for misoprostol in induction of abortion during
      the first trimester.

      Research question:

      Will letrozole- misoprostol protocol give better results than misoprostol- alone protocol in
      induction of abortion during the first trimester?

      Primary outcome:

      Complete abortion (complete expulsion of products of conception with no need for curettage)
      within one week from the first dose of misoprostol.

      Secondary outcome:

      â€¢ Curettage (surgical evacuation of the products of conception)

        -  Incomplete abortion (retained products of conception).

        -  Considerable bleeding that necessitates immediate evacuation.
