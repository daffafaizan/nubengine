      dapivirine and oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in adolescent and
      young adult females.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescent and young adult females between 16
      and 21 years of age. Participants will be randomized to one of two sequences of one VR
      containing 25 mg of dapivirine to be inserted monthly for 24 weeks and one 200 mg FTC/300 mg
      TDF oral tablet taken daily for 24 weeks. After completing the randomized sequence of two
      study product use periods, participants will then select between the two study products to
      use in the final 24 weeks of the trial. Participants will be able to choose either or neither
      study product during the third product use period. The study includes approximately 76 weeks
      of follow-up per participant.

      Participants will attend monthly study visits, which may include behavioral
      assessments/counseling; physical and pelvic examinations; and blood, urine, and pelvic sample
      collection.
