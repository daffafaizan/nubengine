      ductal closure is critical for postnatal circulatory adaptation. In premature infants the
      circulating prostaglandin levels are higher than at term, and respiratory difficulties may
      lead to a state of hypoxia, which contribute to the failure of the ductus closure. Recently,
      an incidental finding in one preterm infant led to look at paracetamol, one of the most
      common drugs available, as an alternative therapeutic approach to ductal closure. If
      paracetamol is proven to be effective, it could become the treatment of choice for the
      management of PDA, mainly due to its more favorable safety profile.

      Although the recent results available in the literature demonstrates an highly success rate
      in ductal closure with paracetamol, all case studies are not powered to show efficacy of
      paracetamol for PDA closure. Further prospective randomized-controlled trials are needed to
      evaluate the efficacy of paracetamol versus ibuprofen for the closure of PDA.

      If paracetamol is indeed proven to be effective, it could become the treatment of choice for
      the management of PDA, mainly due to its more favorable side effect profile. In order to test
      this hypothesis, a randomized, open label, parallel groups, comparator controlled,
      multicentre, prospective study is proposed.
