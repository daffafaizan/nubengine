             4. distance from suprasternal notch to carotid artery

             5. distance from suprasternal notch to femoral artery

             6. Silent environment

        5. Blood chemistry and complete blood count

             1. Measure at the morning of second day after overnight fasting

             2. complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen/Creatinine, fasting blood glucose, Total
                cholesterol, Triglyceride, High density lipoprotein cholesterol

        6. 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement

      Measurement protocol

        1. 1st day

             1. Visit hospital before 9:00 AM after overnight fasting

             2. start 24 hour urine collection from 9:00 AM (with education for complete
                collection)

             3. start 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, in parallel with 24 hour urine
                collection

        2. 2nd day

             1. Measure central aortic blood pressure

             2. Measure blood Lab
