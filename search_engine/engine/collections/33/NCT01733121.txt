    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NBI-98854 (titrated to subject's optimal
      dose in the range of 25 to 75 mg) compared to placebo, administered once daily (q.d.) for a
      total of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 90 medically stable male and female subjects
      with one of the following clinical diagnoses will be enrolled: schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic-induced TD; mood disorder with neuroleptic-induced
      TD; or gastrointestinal disorder with metoclopramide-induced TD.

      For subjects randomized to active treatment, the starting dose will be 25 mg NBI 98854, which
      may be escalated in increments of 25 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum of 75 mg to achieve an
      optimal dose of NBI-98854 for each subject
