      behavior. However it is less known whether the same effect could be achieved in younger
      children. Furthermore it is not known whether omega-3 fatty acids could also improve parental
      behavior and parenting style which could further reduce behavioral problems in children.
      Moreover, we recently found that children who consume fish more frequently have less sleep
      problems but it is not known whether omega-3 supplements could also potentially improve
      children's sleep. We aim to test several hypotheses in this random controlled trial of
      omega-3 fatty acids.

      The study design will consist of a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      children and their caregivers in a community sample in the city of Philadelphia. It will
      utilize a random parallel design, in which child and mother pairs will be randomly assigned
      to either omega-3 supplementation (treatment condition) or a placebo (control condition).
      This results in 2 groups: (1) child and caregiver both receiving omega-3 and (2) both parent
      and child receiving the placebo. Treatment will last 45 days. Assessments will take place at
      0 months (baseline), 45 days (end of supplementation) and 90 days (45 days after the end of
      treatment).
