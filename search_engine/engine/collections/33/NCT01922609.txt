      endovascular clamping of the common carotid artery, thus exposing the ipsilateral hemisphere
      to hypoperfusion. Approximately 5% of patients do not tolerate the clamp and are in increased
      risk of periprocedural cerebrovascular complication such as transient ischemic attack or
      stroke. To date, there is no method available that could be used to predict the risk of
      occlusion intolerance. The aim of this study is to determine whether preprocedural evaluation
      with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be effective in prediction of occlusion
      intolerance.
