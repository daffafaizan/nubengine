      promoting health. This may contribute to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity,
      allergies and inflammatory conditions. Advances in understanding host-microbe interactions
      imply that maternal microbiota plays a crucial role on health programming. This process
      begins in utero and it is modulated by mode of delivery and diet. The investigator's previous
      data has shown that i) specific shifts in milk microbial composition are associated with
      lactation time and mode of delivery, ii) milk microbes drive the infant microbiota
      composition; iii) maternal microbiota dysbiosis may be transferred to the infant. However,
      factors defining maternal microbiota and its biological role upon infant's health are not yet
      fully understood. Hence, this project aims to characterize maternal microbes to be
      transferred to neonates and determine their function in infant health programming. The
      specific aims are:(1) understanding how the maternal microbiome is influenced by host and
      environmental factors;(2) characterizing the microbial core and bioactive compounds
      transmitted to the offspring mainly via breastfeeding and their key roles in the microbial
      modulation and host response;(3) understanding the interactions among breast milk bioactive
      compounds and their role in infant health;(4) shedding light on how maternal microbes
      influence the infant immune system.

      Results obtained will demonstrate the interaction between infant nutrition, microbes and host
      response in early life and its key role in health programming, enabling new applications in
      the field of personalized nutrition & medicine.
