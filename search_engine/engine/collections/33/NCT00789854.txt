      treatment regimen as assessed by the following variables and, if applicable, by their changes
      from randomisation to week 6 (end of study). Additionally the time of onset of therapeutic
      effect will be assessed by evaluating efficacy data after the first four days (Day 4) of
      treatment as well as after the first week of treatment (Day 8). These analyses will also be
      performed in the subgroups of patients with 2 failed previous antidepressants and patients
      with 1 failure.
