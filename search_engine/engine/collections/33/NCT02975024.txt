      gingiva. The apically repositioned split thickness flap with a xenogeneic collagen matrix or
      with a combination of strip gingival graft and a xenogeneic collagen matrix are frequently
      used surgical techniques, however no data are available, how these graft tissues affect the
      microcirculation of the healing gingiva.

      LSCI is a non-invasive, two dimensional method to evaluate microcirculation of different
      tissues. This new method let us monitor the entire surgical area real-time during the healing
      period.

      The aim of the present study is to define blood flow patterns, which might characterize the
      wound healing of such surgical procedures during the first 6 months of healing in order to
      facilitate treatment.
