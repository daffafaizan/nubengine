      and safety of Abemaciclib as a single agent in patients with biopsy-proven wild type Rb
      extensive stage of SCLC, with platinum refractory disease (defined as no response after 1-2
      cycles of chemotherapy or relapse defined as initial response but relapse after completing
      platinum-based chemotherapy).

      Abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitors) is an investigational drug that works by interrupting the
      rapid and uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Some cancer cells develop because their cells
      overrun the molecular brakes that normally permit cell to divide only when they are needed to
      replace old ones. These brakes are regulated by a group of enzymes known as cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDKs). Alterations causing over-activity of two of these enzymes, CDK4 andCDK6, are
      found in a variety of cancers, including small cell lung cancer with retinoblastoma (Rb)
      protein. The drugs work by selectively turning off the overactive CDK4 and CDK6. As a result,
      the cancer cells' division cycle is halted, preventing them from proliferating.

      The objectives of this study include determining:

        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR) after the first cycle (4 weeks) and then every 8 weeks.

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)assessed at 6 months and Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Safety and adverse events

        -  Duration of response in all responders
