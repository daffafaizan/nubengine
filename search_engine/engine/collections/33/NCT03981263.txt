      Despite improved surgical techniques, there is still around 30% mastectomy performed every
      year. Definitively or temporarily, one of the alternatives to restore a volume in the bra is
      the use of external breast prosthesis. Currently, there are 3 silicone brands that are
      marketed and refunded. These standard prostheses take into account only the curve of the
      patients and not the weight of the remaining breast making adaptation difficult to all body
      types. The difference in breast weights can cause several disorders: postural, pain,
      discomfort, psychological impact on quality of life as well as medico-economic impact.
      MEAVANTI is an external breast prosthesis for custom calibration and personalization, which
      can prevent postural compensation and provide greater comfort.

      The main objective of this study is therefore to evaluate whether the MEAVANTI prosthesis
      improves the quality of life of patients who have undergone a mastectomy compared to the
      standard prosthesis (through the EORTC questionnaires - European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer). This study will be monocentric, cross-over (2 periods),
      prospective, open with a wash-out period of 15 days. The period of the study will be
      conducted over 13 months.

      The expected benefits can be major. The main benefit expected is the improvement of quality
      of life of the patients carrying the MEAVANTI breast prosthesis compared to those carrying
      the so-called standard prosthesis. A reduction in back and neck pain could also reduce the
      costs of patient management. In addition, this will demand referencing by the HAS of the
      custom-made prosthesis so that it is reimbursed in the same way as existing ones.
