      Primary

        -  To determine if mRNA present in circulating tumor cells will help predict response in
           patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with docetaxel.

        -  In parallel with this, based on discoveries made since our protocol was initially
           submitted to ICORG, here we also propose to analyse serum specimens from these
           consenting patients for the presence of EC miRNA, mRNA and protein predictive of
           response to Taxotere.

      Secondary

        -  To develop a predictive model based on the most accurate and sensitive combination of
           these biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Treatment Plan:

      All patients will be treated with Docetaxel on a weekly, biweekly or three weekly schedule,
      dose and schedule at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Blood samples are collected for biomarker laboratory studies at baseline, every 3-4 weeks
      during study, and at disease progression or every 12 weeks after completion of study. Samples
      are analyzed for mRNA via RT-PCR.
