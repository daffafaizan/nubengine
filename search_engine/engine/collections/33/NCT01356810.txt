      ward and who were at risk of delirium were studied. Eligible patients were randomized to a
      multicomponent environmental intervention or standard care. Both groups were well balanced in
      patients characteristics and followed during the full hospital stay by a group trained in the
      application of the confusion assessment method to detect incident delirium.
