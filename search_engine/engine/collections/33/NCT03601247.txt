      droopy, which often occurs as a natural part of the aging process. The droopiness of the
      upper eyelids decreases the ability to see objects in their peripheral vision, causing
      functional deficits. Additionally, the droopiness can be a cosmetic concern for many. The
      most effective treatment option is blepharoplasty or ptosis repair.

      During routine pre-operative counseling, many patients note a fear of prominent facial
      scarring. Different techniques have been described in the literature to minimize scarring,
      from steroid creams to injections to laser therapy; however, there is currently no consensus
      for long-term management of post-surgical eyelid scars. Specifically, there is no study
      examining the efficacy of topical silicone gel on eyelid scars, although a few studies have
      examined its efficacy on other facial scars. Silicone is proposed to aid in healing by
      regulating fibroblast production, reducing collagen production, and modifying expression of
      growth factors.

      The investigator's study is designed to determine whether topical silicone may prevent
      significant post-operative eyelid scar formation. It may help clarify whether there is a safe
      and effective topical treatment for patients undergoing eyelid surgery for whom scarring or
      cosmesis is a concern. It is the first study of silicone gel on the eyelid and is also
      prospective, randomized, and double blinded.
