      leads to toxic phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation in patients with PKU causing mental
      retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral
      abnormalities. Although for most PKU patients early initiation of dietary treatment prevents
      severe complications, discontinuation of dietary restrictions at an early age is associated
      with poor cognitive development and neuropsychiatric disorders are present even in
      early-treated and well controlled PKU patients.

      This study, PKU-016, will be conducted in PKU patients to evaluate the therapeutic effects of
      sapropterin dihydrochloride on the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD), depression, and anxiety.
