           injection to healthy volunteers.

        3. To determine the T½ value of Primapur following a single 300 IU subcutaneous injection
           to healthy volunteers.

        4. To determine the Сmax value of Primapur following a single 300 IU subcutaneous injection
           to healthy volunteers.

        5. To determine the Tmax value of Primapur following a single 300 IU subcutaneous injection
