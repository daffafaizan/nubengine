      income parents of toddlers who were obese to assess whether a mindfulness based parenting
      intervention (PMH) can reduce their stress, increase parenting and improve family healthy
      food and physical activity choices. Parents and toddlers also participated in a Toy Wait
      Task, a behavioral assay of parenting.The empirically-supported stress-reduction
      intervention, plus nutrition and physical activity counseling (Control) for parents of
      preschoolers (aged 2-5) was compared to a nutrition and physical activity counseling alone
      condition to assess whether PMH improved toddler weight, physical activity and parent emotion
      regulation and healthy eating.
