      of 0.375% bupivacaine and 8mg/2 mL dexamethasone.Before injection of the study medication,
      2mL of normal saline with be injected under ultrasound visualization to ensure needle tip is
      in the transversus abdominis plane.Randomization will occur following the written informed
      consent and prior to the start of the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, study patients
      will receive intravenous acetaminophen 1000mg every 8 hours for 3 doses, then oral
      acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours. Subjects will also have patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
      with morphine or hydromorphone. The research staff recording data will be blinded to the
      treatment group. Demographic data will be recorded, including age, date of birth, height and
      weight to ensure similarity between the two groups. A medical history will be obtained as
      well as surgical and anesthesia details. Study patients will be followed for 72 hours
      postoperatively to record the amount of opioid consumption, as well as other pain score data
      using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).The subject's participation will end 72 hours after
      surgery. A telephone interview will occur with the subject if hospital discharge occurs prior
      to 72 hours.
