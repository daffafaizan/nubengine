      inflammatory myopathy, (IIM, polymyositis or dermatomyositis), in particular,
      phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency (Type VII glycogenosis) and acid maltase (GAA)
      deficiency (Type II glycogenosis). Some patients with each of these autosomal recessive
      diseases have been shown to be genetic compounds, with different mutations on the alleles
      from each parent. In this protocol, we seek permission to receive and perform genetic
      screening on samples of tissue, blood, or DNA from patients with known metabolic muscle
      diseases, their family members, patients with undiagnosed muscle diseases, and groups of
      control subjects. Although we will know the names and histories of the patients, and may
      choose to admit them under other protocols for further studies, the tests we propose to
      perform on their DNA are currently only of laboratory interest and we believe that the
      outcome has no implications for the clinical care of the subjects. We propose to obtain oral
      consent, as appropriate to take a limited history and to speak to the patient's physician,
      from those patients and family members we speak to directly. All specimens obtained in family
      studies of a particular disease (e.g., PFK deficiency or GAA deficiency) will be obtained
      after written consent and will be tested only for the genes of the particular disease under
      study. After completion of those tests, the DNA, or products derived from it will be stored
      only under code so that it may be used as a control sample for other studies.
