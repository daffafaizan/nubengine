    
      In the preoperative period, patients who have undergone adequate mediastinal evaluation and
      are considered operable will be treated with durvalumab 1125 mg IV every 3 weeks (Q3W) in
      combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin with pemetrexed or docetaxel,
      depending upon histology).

      Patients will undergo postoperative radiation (54Gy) within 4-10 weeks after surgery (unless
      single station N2 at registration with resultant ypT0N0 after neoadjuvant therapy).

      One to 6 weeks after completion of radiation, patients will receive adjuvant durvalumab 1500
      mg IV every 4weeks (Q4W) for 1 year.

      Patients who do not have surgery due to refusal, physician decision, or local and distant
      progression will have to discontinue study treatment.

      All participants will have imaging assessment prior to surgery after Cycle 2 (Week 6) and
      after Cycle 4 (Weeks 13 15). Patients will undergo potentially curable surgery as per
      standard of care.

      Patients will undergo imaging assessment every 12 weeks after surgery for 2 years, then every
      6 months for 3 years.
