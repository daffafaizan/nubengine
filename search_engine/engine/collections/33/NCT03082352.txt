      washout period of one to two weeks. Subject will be randomly assigned to two groups
      corresponding to two dosing sequences. Each subject will undergo two study (treatment)
      sessions, during which a single oral dose of 100mg metoprolol from either test or reference
      formulations will be administered. The estimated duration of subject's participation will be
      about 29-36 days (i.e. 3 weeks for screening and medication restraint, 1 day each for study
      (treatment) sessions I and II, 1 - 2 weeks as washout period. Venous blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0h), and up to 24h post dose. The plasma concentrations of metoprolol
      will be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze
      the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as
      Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. ANOVA will be calculated on logarithmically
      transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate
      the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to
      assess the bioequivalence of the two products
