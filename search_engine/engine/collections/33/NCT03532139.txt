    
      This is a randomized pilot trial to estimate the effect of rosuvastatin on levels of tissue
      factor bearing microparticles (TFMP) in patients undergoing surgery for presumed ovarian
      cancer (including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma). Women will either be
      randomized to enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily (Arm A) or enoxaparin in combination with
      rosuvastatin (Arm B). Arm C will receive thromboprophylaxis according to standard of care and
      not be randomized. Levels of circulating TFMP will be assessed in all patients on Day 1 and
      following surgery (days 15, 30 and day 60). A bilateral lower extremity ultrasound will be
      performed on days 30 and 60 for all participants to estimate the rate of VTE in the 3 arms.
