      stiffness. Currently approximately 150 people attend Saint James's Hospital rheumatology
      department for management of their condition. Physiotherapy plays a key role in this
      management. As this is often a younger patient population, it can be challenging for them to
      attend appointments due to work and family commitments. It is envisaged that this pilot will
      enhance treatment options for all participants.

      The aims of this study are: to improve use of exercise and physical activity using an online
      exercise application; to improve self-management skills in monitoring progress and ability to
      exercise independently using an online exercise application; to provide an online appointment
      review option to patients who are unable to attend physiotherapy appointments in St James's
      Hospital.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to record and analyse the study data, using SPSS
      software.
