      potentially be candidates for study. After obtaining parental consent, the infants will be
      prospectively and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1. Treatment group: to receive IV
      pentoxifylline (5 mg/kg/hour to run over 6 hour x 6 days) and 2. Placebo group: to receive an
      equal volume of Â½ normal saline to run over 6 hours x 6 days.
