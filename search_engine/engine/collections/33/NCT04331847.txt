        1. A quantitative observational descriptive study among women presenting for
           abortion-related complications to determine the frequency and severity of
           abortion-related complications including near-miss cases and death. Data will be
           collected through a medical records review and a quantitative survey among women
           presenting for abortion-related complications to determine the sociodemographic and
           clinical characteristics of the women with abortion-related complications, the type of
           abortion, the type and severity of complications and the clinical management received.
           It will also give insight into the characteristics of near-miss events following unsafe
           abortion.

        2. A qualitative study about women's experiences associated with a near-miss event (and
           potentially life threatening): their pathway of access to care including their
           decision-making process, their own perceptions and opinions and other factors or
           conditions that might contribute to the near-miss event (in-depth face to face
           interviews).

        3. A rapid health facility assessment with the health professional in charge of
           Post-Abortion Care will complement the assessment of the quality of management of
           complications

        4. A Knowledge Attitudes, Practice and Behavior quantitative survey among health care
           providers involved in the management of abortion-related complications will identify
           provider-associated factors that may contribute to near-miss events.
