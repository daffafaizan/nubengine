      data exist on the use of pharmacotherapy for adolescents SUD (Substance Use Disorder). One
      promising pharmacotherapy approach is to treat co-occuring psychiatric disorders. A common
      co-occurring disorder in adolescent SUD is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      Fortunately, new ADHD medications, such as atomoxetine, that do not have addictive potential
      are now available. However, all controlled studies of atomoxetine have specifically excluded
      teens with SUD. Therefore, little data exist on the safety and efficacy of the medication in
      this population. This research project will address the important research gap with the
      specific aim: to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine for ADHD in
      teens with SUD.
