      unique shockwave transducer operable to deliver shockwaves to a treated region confined to a
      narrow rectangle. Shockwaves generation follows the electromagnetic principle. Low intensity
      shockwaves do not inflict pain and anesthesia or sedation is not required.

      This current study is a prospective, pilot, randomized, uncontrolled clinical study aimed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two treatment schedules on symptomatic ED patients.
      The patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into active treatment groups.

      Rationale:Linear Shockwaves has been known to bolster angiogenesis by increasing the levels
      of vascular endothelial growth factor.
