    
      Patients (with Total Cholesterol (TC) ranging between 5.83-7.64 mmol/l), never treated with
      lipid lowering drugs, with symptomatic carotid stenosis >70% (NASCET criteria), and therefore
      eligible for carotid endarterectomy, were recruited. All patients were enrolled within 30
      days from the clinical event, and randomized to one of three treatment groups. Each group,
      composed of 20 patients, received atorvastatin 10 mg/day (AT-10 group), or atorvastatin 80
      mg/day (AT-80 group), or cholestyramine (Questran, Bristol Myer Squibb) 8 g/day plus
      sitosterol (Unilever) 2.5 g/day (C-S group) for three months prior to the vascular procedure.
      A placebo group was not included for ethical reasons due to the high cardiovascular risk
      profile in this population.
