      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved (08-008161) protocol "Lp-PLA2 and Coronary
      Atherosclerosis in Humans" and (10-000044) "Lp-PLA2 and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Humans
      Aim III" in which the investigators are examining the impact of long-term inhibition of
      Lp-PLA2, with a specific novel inhibitor, on Lp-PLA2 activity and improvement in coronary
      endothelial function.

      The substudy will allow the investigators to also examine the additional endpoint of lipid
      core content of atherosclerotic plaques and hence plaque vulnerability. Plaque lipid
      composition will be measured using the LipiScan or LipiScan IVUS catheter (InfraReDx Near
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) System with or without intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      capability) at baseline and again at 6 month following Lp-PLA2 inhibition.

      The study will provide insight into the role of the endogenous Lp-PLA2 in early coronary
      atherosclerosis, a potential therapeutic target for early coronary atherosclerosis in humans.
