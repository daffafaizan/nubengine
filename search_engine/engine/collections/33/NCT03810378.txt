      effects of two low-carbohydrate (low-carb) diet patterns, addressing a gap in the evidence
      base in this area that will lead to 1) improved treatment strategies for common adverse
      clinical conditions, 2) improved health for these individuals, and 3) long-term decreases in
      health care costs. This impactful research will advance the field of personalized and
      precision medicine.
