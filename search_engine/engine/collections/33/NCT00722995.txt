      (40 >= BMI <= 50), a super obesity (BMI >50), a super super obesity (BMI>60), and obese
      patients (BMI>35) with a failure of gastric banding is constantly increasing. In these
      patients, the surgery risk is proportionate to the weight and / or gastric surgery records.

      This risk is high, in bariatric surgery, for gastric bypass procedure. This justifies the
      evaluation of new procedure to reduce the morbidity allowing the reduction of morbid
      /mortality associated with the intervention.
