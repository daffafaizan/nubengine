      I. To determine the feasibility of rigidly (linearly) registering PET to CT images and
      applying this fused dataset to guide surgery with an image-guided navigation system and a
      handheld positron probe in order to facilitate disease detection and improve resection
      accuracy in advanced stage colorectal cancer.

      II. To complete development of software for the nonlinear registration of PET and CT
      datasets.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo preoperative whole-body PET scans and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.
      Patients then receive 18 F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) 60-90 minutes prior to
      surgery and undergo intraoperative CT scans using a handheld probe and computer navigation
      system.
