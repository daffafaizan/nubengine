      manuals developed for depression and anxiety will be used to construct the 8-week treatment
      program. The flexibility of modular based treatment allows patients and counselors to
      personalize interventions and skills for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms. The first
      treatment session will be in-person. All following sessions will be provided by telephone.
      Caregivers will have the option of being involved in 2 ways throughout treatment - as a
      "coach" to facilitate use of new skills by their loved one with PD and as a recipient of
      stress- management support. The scope of caregiver involvement will vary across patients,
      based on their preference. Involved caregivers will be given the opportunity to participate
      in 1 telephone-based stress-management session and 1 follow-up call scheduled individually
      during the first 4 weeks of treatment.
