      monitoring ( for 3 years), in selected stroke and TIA population on the basis of age, stroke
      etiology, and prescreening for cardiac arrhythmias helps to increase a detection of AF to
      16.7% (range, 14.3% to 20.0%) in compare to ambulatory ECG detection of AF 6.4% (range, 5.3%
      to 9.0%). The AF detection after stroke and TIA strategically changes the therapeutic
      approach. In correlation with mentioned above the incidence of both specific genetic markers
      of AF and occurance of AF in this population and healthy volunteers are interesting.
