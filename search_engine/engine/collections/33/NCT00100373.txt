      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been shown to account for a significant portion of
      these illnesses. The causative factors associated with severe RSV disease in the elderly are
      not well understood. The contribution of viral load, host inflammatory responses and the
      cellular immune response to disease pathogenesis are unknown. A better understanding of these
      processes may be useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for RSV disease.
      Although the adult groups at highest risk for serious RSV disease are elderly and high-risk
      adults, we propose to use the challenge model in young healthy adults to determine optimal
      timing of specimen collection and the feasibility of performing certain tests before moving
      ahead to the target groups with natural infection. The purpose of this study is to measure
      the immune response (how the body fights infection) to an experimental preparation of live
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV. Participants will include 20 healthy adults age 21-40.
      Study procedures will include drawing blood, urine samples, respiratory exams, vital signs
      and temperature, diary cards, nasal mucus weight and nasal washes and swabs. All participants
      will receive vaccine via nose drops. Patients will participate in the study for about 2
      months.
