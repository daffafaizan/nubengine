      series quoting up to a 27% infection rate. The original hypothesis stimulating this study is
      that HBOT after calcaneal plating can decrease such high rates of infection. Validation of
      this hypothesis would not only alter guidelines for standard procedure (plate
      osteosynthesis), but would also help to avoid difficult follow-up operations and improve
      functional outcome after calcaneal fracture. To date, this therapeutic approach has not been
      systematically tested in the existing literature. As further motivation for this study, the
      assessment of the existent microcirculation as a potential screening parameter will be
      analysed. In order to do so, it is assumed that wound infection partially develops due to
      disruptions in the microcirculation. This leads to the hypotheses, that by measuring the
      microcirculation, patients at high risk for post operative infections could be identified
      before operation, planning a different less invasive approach or conservative treatment.
