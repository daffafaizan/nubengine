    
      There are 2 aims of this study. The intent of aim 1 is to measure the effect of obesity on
      glucose transport and metabolism in the human brain. This study aim will be conducted in
      non-diabetic, obese individuals and age- and HbA1c-matched normal weight individuals. A total
      of 15 non-diabetic - normal weight individuals and 15 obese individuals will be enrolled.

      The second aim randomizes 40 non-diabetic, normal weight individuals. The intent of aim 2 is
      to determine whether acute elevation of NEFA levels in lean, healthy individuals will alter
      cerebral glucose transport. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either
      intralipid or normal saline.

      The focus of this protocol registration is the randomized portion of the study (aim 2).
