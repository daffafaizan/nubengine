    
      The aim of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of Leflunomide in
      treating patients with IgG4-related disease by comparing the outcomes of prednisone and
      leflunomide combination therapy with prednisone mono-therapy. The follow-up period will be 12
      months. During the follow-up period, results of laboratory tests and image examinations,
      IgG4-RD RI and other parameters which can reflect treatment response as well as adverse
      effect events will be recorded.
