      I. To evaluate the feasibility of incorporating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as
      a component of definitive local treatment for oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      II. To estimate the 12-month progression free survival (PFS) rate after study enrollment
      utilizing a strategy of definitive local treatment to all sites of disease in oligometastatic
      RCC as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of SBRT on cellular replication, measured by ki-67 staining.

      II. To determine the systemic therapy free survival at 12 months. III. To estimate the
      overall survival at 12 months after study enrollment. IV. To estimate the freedom from new
      lesion development at 12 months. V. To determine the treatment related toxicities associated
      with SBRT as part of definitive local therapy for oligometastatic RCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT over 1 day to 3 weeks based on the judgment of the treating radiation
      oncologist.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, and then
      every 18 weeks for 1 year.
