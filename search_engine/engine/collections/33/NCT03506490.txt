      years old) and were divided in two groups: a control group (N = 15; M = 67, 6 years old; SD =
      4.1 years old) and an experimental group (N = 18; M = 67, 4 years old; SD = 4.4 years old).
      The participants performed a Soda Pop test before the aerobic training session (Baseline).
      The training session lasted 45 minutes and was composed of running exercises. After the
      training session, the motor memory consolidation was held in three different stages:
      Training; 1 hour after training; 24 hours after training.
