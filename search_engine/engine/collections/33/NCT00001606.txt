      normal development or maintenance of the auditory system. One strategy for identifying some
      of the genes important for auditory processes is to ascertain large families each with
      several hearing impaired individuals. Initial contact will be made by family physicians,
      audiologist, supervisors in schools for the hearing impaired, and directly by the principal
      investigators during surveys of schools for the deaf and visits with hearing impairment
      self-help groups. Members of a family will be evaluated by an audiologist, and instances of
      hearing impairment will be documented and categorized. A clinician would then examine hearing
      impaired and unaffected members of the family for the presence of other clinical features so
      as to distinguish between nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of hearing impairment. Pedigrees
      of these families will be analyzed to determine the mode of inheritance of the hereditary
      hearing impairment segregating in each family. Families will be ascertained through
      audiologists and other clinicians, genetics clinics, schools for the hearing impaired and
      through linguists and medical anthropologists who study unique sign languages and the
      sociology of communities with a high proportion of hearing impaired individuals. The mutated
      gene will then be genetically mapped by a linkage or association based strategy, using DNA
      typing of highly polymorphic genetic markers distributed across the human genome.
