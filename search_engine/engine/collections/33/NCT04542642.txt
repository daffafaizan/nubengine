    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, decentralized study to evaluate patient
      engagement with PEAR-008, a game-based digital therapeutic for the treatment of opioid use
      disorder.

      PEAR-008 is a new version of reSET-O, an FDA-authorized mobile application treatment
      (available by prescription only) for opioid use disorder. The study will examine if changing
      the application's delivery format and enhancing clinical content affects how patients use and
      interact with the intervention.

      Prospective participants will complete a short screening assessment and if eligible complete
      informed consent procedures at the beginning of the Baseline visit. Qualifying participants
      will attend weekly virtual study visits during the 8-week treatment period.

      In addition to weekly assessments, additional assessments will be administered at week 4 and
      week 8. Participants will be asked to complete a follow-up assessment 4 weeks after
      completing treatment.
