      ultrasound daily. Lung ultrasound will be assessed by LUS-score for acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) (0-36 points, Bouhemad 2015). Findings of B-line artifacts and
      consolidations will be noted. In addition to LUS, clinical parameters from physical
      examination and laboratory tests will be collected. Participants wil be followed until either
      admission to intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation or until clinical
      improvement. A group of patients with mild Covid-19 infection will be recruited and screened
      once as reference.

      Apart from assessment with LUS, patients are managed according to routine care.
