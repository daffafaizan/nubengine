      degree of Trendelenburg tilt (25 - 30°), 2) carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption and 3) increased
      intra-abdominal pressure (10 -20 mmHg). Slight modifications to any or all of these three
      factors can lead to a significant decrease in morbidity.

      The AirSeal® valveless trocar system reduces CO2 absorption when compared to standard trocars
      during renal laparoscopy. Also, use of this trocar system provides a more stable
      intra-abdominal pressure when compared to standard trocars, a feature that could possibly
      allow for laparoscopic surgery to be performed at lower intra-abdominal pressures.
