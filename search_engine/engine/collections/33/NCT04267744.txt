      monitoring using novel noninvasive technologies in HF patients in an outpatient setting.
      Investigators will gather dynamic, longitudinal data from multiple sensors, in addition to
      patient-reported and physician-reported data. Both the patient interface through interactions
      with the sensors and mobile application, and the clinician interface through the monitoring
      portal, will be evaluated for usability, utility and efficacy.

      Patients will be recruited for the study from the Barnes Jewish Hospital Advanced Heart
      Failure Clinic. Eligible individuals will receive onboarding instructions and a study
      schedule detailing the required surveys and clinical activities they will be asked to
      complete over a period of 7 months. In addition to onboarding instructions and a study
      schedule, individuals will have the kit of sensors shipped to their home.

      After the Myia Home Hub and Myia Sensor Suite are set up, data will begin to be transmitted.
      Following a run in period where data is collected and delivered but not acted upon by
      clinicians all eligible participants will move forward with 6 month interactive study
      monitoring.

      In addition to obtaining questionnaires and using the devices in the Myia kit, participants
      will also be asked to obtain their blood pressure and weight daily.

      During the course of the study, outpatient health status data for the group will be
      collected, summarized and delivered to clinicians in an electronic dashboard. The format and
      content of the data dashboard will be updated based on user feedback throughout the study.
      Required changes deemed appropriate by the healthcare team will be incorporated into the
      software platform alongside any standard updates.
