      motor function after brain injury. The purpose of this protocol is to determine (a) if
      movement observation results in encoding of a motor memory in the primary motor cortex and
      (b) if observation of motor training can enhance the effects of physical training in healthy
      volunteers. If so, this may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients
      who are unable or partially able to train. We will test our hypotheses by means of focal
      single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a group of healthy volunteers. Our
      outcome measure will be the change in TMS-evoked movement direction as a function of training
      strategy. So far we found that this is the case in healthy volunteers (see data in analysis
      of the study). The purpose of this protocol is to determine if action observation can elicit
      the same effects in adult chronic ischemic stroke patients who have had originally
      significant motor weakness but recovered to the point of being able to perform the motor
      tasks, possibly resulting in a useful rehabilitative strategy.
