      the key consideration in the long-term periodontal prognosis of these subjects. Periodic
      prophylaxis may prevent loss of clinical attachment over long periods of time even in
      patients with less than optimal plaque control. However, there are limitations in routine
      subgingival re-instrumentation especially in bleeding pockets, as only 50% of these sites
      improve. Furthermore, the persistence of bleeding pockets increases the risk of disease
      progression and tooth loss. Thus there is a need for adjuncts that may improve the outcome
      especially in subjects with recurrent periodontitis during SPT. Some studies reported
      significantly better results with subgingival administration of local minocycline in residual
      pockets post initial periodontal therapy over a short period of time. There are few studies
      assessing the efficacy of topical minocycline gel in subjects with recurrent periodontitis
      while in SPT, and the long term effect.

      The present study will examine the significance of the adjunctive effect of the subgingival
      application of a 2% minocycline hydrochloride controlled-delivery system (MHS) in comparison
      to subgingival instrumentation with application of a placebo gel, 3 months after therapy in
      subjects with recurrent periodontitis undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) and to
      assess the substantivity of the gel attributable to the adjunctive delivery of the medication
      that will be detected at 3 months during a 9-month period of regular SPT.
