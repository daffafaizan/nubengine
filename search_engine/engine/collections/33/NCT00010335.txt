    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is completed. CD34+
      cells are separated from the rest of the PBSCs.

      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -5 and -4. Patients receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3
      and -2. CD34-selected PBSCs are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV daily beginning
      on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years and then every 5 years thereafter.
