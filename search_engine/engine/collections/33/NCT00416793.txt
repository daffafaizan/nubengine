      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) at 6 months with the combination of bortezomib and
      carboplatin in patients who previously received 1 prior regimen for metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective tumor response rate, the duration of response, time to tumor
      progression, and overall survival.

      II. To evaluate biological effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. III. To evaluate
      the safety profile of this combination. IV. To evaluate archival tissue for
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and E-cadherin and Zeb-1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and carboplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
