    
      The study is a retrospective review of the author's experience treating chronic brain injury
      with HBOT, supplemented by cases communicated to the author, who developed untoward effects
      during or after their HBOT. The object of the study was to affirm or refute the author's
      general impression that there was an optimal dose of HBOT in chronic brain injury which was
      lower than the traditional dose applied in chronic non-central nervous system wounding.
      Furthermore, when this lower dosage range was exceeded and approached the traditional doses
      for non-CNS wounding oxygen toxicity would result. To address these impressions the study
      seeks to review the author's medical records and other patient/doctor communications to the
      author where side effects of HBOT occurred in the treatment of chronic brain injury and
      abstract signs, symptoms, and the dose of HBOT employed.
