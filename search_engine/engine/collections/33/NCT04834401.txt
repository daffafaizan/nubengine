      SARS-CoV-2, which developed into a pandemic claiming the lives of over 500,000 people in the
      United States and over 2.5 million worldwide. Antibodies against the spike glycoprotein are
      believed to confer immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease
      of the central nervous system, which is typically treated with immunomodulating medications,
      referred to as disease modifying therapies (DMTs). Some DMTs resulted in a diminished
      capacity to develop antibodies against natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. This study is
      designed to evaluate and compare the effect of DMTs on antibody response to mRNA vaccines for
      COVID-19. Serum samples will be collected from 30 participants per treatment arm at 8 weeks,
      24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 72 weeks following vaccination with mRNA-1273. Geometric mean titers
      of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG will be measured to evaluate and compare peak antibody titers,
      as well as the duration of antibody response. The results will likely impact clinical
      decision-making, and guide treatment strategies for safely managing MS during the ongoing
      pandemic.
