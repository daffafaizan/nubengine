      progressive disease characterized by joint and bone destruction from tophaceous deposits and
      renal impairment due to gouty nephropathy. Hyperuricemia, defined as a serum urate
      concentration greater than 7.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), is the underlying metabolic
      aberration leading to urate crystal deposition in gout. Gout has several clinical
      presentations, including: recurrent acute attacks of inflammatory arthritis; deposition of
      monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in joints, bones and even parenchymal organs
      (tophaceous gout); renal impairment; and uric acid nephrolithiasis.1 As serum urate levels
      increase beyond greater than 7.0 mg/dL, the risks for gouty arthritis or for renal calculi
      increase.

      Febuxostat is a 2-aryl-thiazole derivative chemically engineered as a novel xanthine
      oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor. Febuxostat is being developed as an orally administered
      agent for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.

      Subjects with palpable tophi >10 millimeters (mm) in length and width and as round as
      possible will have the tophus measured on two separate visits by two different raters to
      assess the inter- and intra-rater reproducibility of direct physical measurement.
