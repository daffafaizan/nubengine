    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, dose escalation study to document the
      effects of adventitial delivery of temsirolimus (Torisel) after revascularization of lesions
      below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Up to 60 patients
      (20 low-dose, 20 high-dose and 20 control) at up to 15 sites in the United States. This study
      will assess the safety and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial
      deposition of temsirolimus in reducing intimal hyperplasia, inflammatory markers and
      composite safety endpoints in patients with clinical evidence of chronic critical limb
      ischemia after revascularization of one or more angiographically significant lesion(s) in
      below-knee popliteal or tibial vessels.
