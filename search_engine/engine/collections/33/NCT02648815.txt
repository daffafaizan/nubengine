      associated with mortality ranging from less than 10% to as high as 85%, according to various
      studies. The management of SAP is complicated because of the limited understanding of the
      pathogenesis and multi-causality of the disease, uncertainties in outcome prediction and few
      effective treatment modalities. Generally, sterile necrosis can be managed conservatively in
      the majority of cases with a low mortality rate (12%). However, infection of pancreatic
      necrosis can be observed in 25%-70% of patients with necrotizing disease; it is generally
      accepted that the infected non-vital tissue should be removed to control the sepsis.
      Laparotomy and immediate debridement of the infected necrotic tissue have been the gold
      standard treatment for decades. However, several reports have shown that early surgical
      intervention for pancreatic necrosis could result in a worse prognosis compared to cases
      where surgery is delayed or avoided. Therefore, several groups worldwide have developed new,
      minimally invasive approaches for managing infected necrotizing pancreatitis. The
      applicability of these techniques depends on the availability of specialized expertise and a
      multidisciplinary team dedicated to the management of SAP and its complications.
