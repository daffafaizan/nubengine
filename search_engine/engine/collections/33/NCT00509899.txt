    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study of ruxolitinib, a
      small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, administered orally to patients with PMF,
      PPEV-MF or PET-MF. The study is comprised of 3 parts:

      Part 1: Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (complete).

      Part 2: Exploration of alternative dosing schedules (complete).

      Part 3: Further evaluation of selected dose regimens, including additional response measures
      to explore effect of ruxolitinib on symptoms and other parameters including daily physical
      activity and long-term survival (ongoing).
