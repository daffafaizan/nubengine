        -  To identify the molecular and pathophysiological changes which occur during the early
           stages of androgen deprivation (AD) and during emerging castration-resistant prostate
           cancer.

        -  To test functional imaging as a non-invasive tool to measure treatment response and
           validate this using biological endpoints.

        -  To develop clinical models to predict how tumors will respond to AD and identify new
           targets once AD fails.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Group A: Patients likely to receive androgen deprivation (AD) as first-line therapy
           undergo blood and prostate biopsy sample collection before and after treatment on days 0
           and 14 or 90. Patients receive an androgen receptor inhibitor followed by maintenance
           with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue beginning on day 0. Patients also undergo
           diffusion-weighted MRI, MR spectroscopic imagining, quantitative T1W mapping, and T1W
           perfusion sequence.

        -  Group B: Patients already receiving AD undergo blood and prostate biopsy sample
           collection within 4 weeks of diagnosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer and
           before initiating any second-line therapy.

      Blood and tissue samples are assessed via DNA and RNA genetic analysis, gene expression
      studies, and comparative genomic hybridization to identify novel markers of androgen response
      and resistance.
