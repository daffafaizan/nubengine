      japonicus, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Schisandra chinensis, etc. It is used for the treatment of
      chest pain caused by Qi-yin deficiency and blood stasis in traditional Chinese medicine. The
      symptoms include chest tightness, chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, fatigue, dry
      mouth and dry throat. Clinical applications suggested that Yangxin Shengmai granules were
      safe and effective in the treatment of coronary heart disease. However, high-quality clinical
      trials are still needed to further confirm, so as to provide theoretical basis for the
      treatment of stable angina pectoris with traditional Chinese medicine.

      The study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of Yangxin Shengmai Granules in
      the treatment of stable angina pectoris.
