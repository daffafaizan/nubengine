      randomised trial to investigate the effect of screening colonoscopy on CRC incidence and
      mortality. In Poland, in Warsaw area, at least 10,000 subjects 55-64 years of age are to be
      invited to screening colonoscopy. A personal letter of invitation containing date and hour of
      appointment is mailed to every individual randomised to the screening group. Up to 60% of
      invitees do not respond to the initial invitation and reminding letter. The aim of this study
      is to compare the effect of reminding letter and educational intervention on attendance to
      screening colonoscopy in nonresponders to initial invitation to screening colonoscopy.
