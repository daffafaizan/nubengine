      I. Determine the feasibility and safety of whole body vibration (WBV) in adult cancer
      survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      II. Determine the effect of WBV training on weight, body composition (muscle and fat mass)
      and physical functioning in adult cancer survivors with CIPN.

      III. Explore the effect of WBV training on symptom relief (neuropathy symptoms, pain,
      fatigue) and readiness to exercise in adult cancer survivors with CIPN.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (WBV): Participants complete two 10-minute WBV sessions per day, 7 days per week for
      12 weeks.

      GROUP II (USUAL CARE [UC]): Participants receive usual care and keep their same physical
      activity or dietary habits over 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 12 weeks.
