    
      Background: Antimicrobial resistance has decreased the worldwide eradication rates of common
      used triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection (less than 80%).

      Objective: To determine the optimal pre-concommitant treatment length for rabeprazole based
      sequential-concomitant hybrid therapies for adults infected with Helicobacter pylori in
      Eastern Taiwan.

      Design: Randomized, open-label, prospective controlled trial.

      Patients: 231 patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers and infected by Helicobacter pylori.

      Measurements: 13C-urea breath test, upper endoscopy, histologic evaluation, rapid urease
      test, bacterial culture, assessment of antibiotic resistance and CYP2C19 genotype of host.

      Intervention: 231 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection are recruited and randomly
      assigned to receive one of the following therapeutic schemes: group 1, 14-days hybrid
      therapy: rabeprazole 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1g bid treated for 7 days, then rabeprazole 20mg
      bid + amoxicillin 1g bid + clarithromycin 0.5g bid + metronidazole 0.5g bid for other 7 days;
      group 2, 12-days hybrid therapy: rabeprazole 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1g bid treated for 5
      days, then rabeprazole 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1g bid + clarithromycin 0.5g bid +
      metronidazole 0.5g bid for other 7 days; group 3, 10-days hybrid therapy: rabeprazole 20mg
      bid + amoxicillin 1g bid treated for 3 days, then rabeprazole 20mg bid + amoxicillin 1g bid +
      clarithromycin 0.5g bid + metronidazole 0.5g bid for other 7 days. Repeat upper endoscopy for
      histologic evaluation, rapid urease test or 13C-urea breath test after 4 week of treatment to
      assess the treatment result. The influence on the hybrid therapies of antibiotic resistance
      of Helicobacter pylori and CYP2C19 genotype of host were determined.

      Expected results: The rabeprazole based sequential-concomitant therapies for eradication of
      Helicobacter pylori is very effective, and the outcome is not affected by antibiotic
      resistance of Helicobacter pylori and CYP2C19 genotype of host.
