      will be treated intravenously (through a vein) every two weeks for 70 weeks (approximately 18
      months). The first three infusions must be done at the site, but if the infusions are well
      tolerated, subsequent infusions may be done by a qualified healthcare provider in the home or
      other suitable location. Each participant must return to the site every 3 months for
      evaluation of cognition as well as blood tests and scans of the brain.
