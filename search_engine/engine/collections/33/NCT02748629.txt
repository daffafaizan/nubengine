    
      Single-center patient-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing self-gripping mesh
      (Parietex ProGrip) and standard Lichtenstein method using lightweight polypropylene mesh.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to the Lichtenstein Operation (L) and ProGrip Repair (R)
      group. Patients will be followed for one year. The primary outcome measure are: postoperative
      pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Assessments will be
      made before the surgery, in the day of discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.

      Secondary endpoints: recurrence rate, post-operative complications (short and long-term),
      foreign body sensation, incidence of surgical-site injury, costs, hospital stay, surgery
      duration, safety and patients satisfaction.
