      support its usage for improvement in upper limb activity and function. Combination of BoNT-A
      and occupational therapy (OT) is found to be more effective then OT alone in reducing
      impairment, improving activity level and goal achievement. Intensive hybrid training models
      of CIMT and BIT and noninvasive brain stimulation are promising treatments on motor learning
      in children with CP. The aim of this clinical trial is to show the additional gains that
      could be provided by an integrated treatment of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (t-DCS) plus intensive hybrid training model of modified CIMT and BIT to BoNT-A injections in
      children with unilateral CP.
