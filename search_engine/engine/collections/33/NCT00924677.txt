      peroneal, saphenous, tibial and obturator) (Kennedy et al. 1982; Hirasawa et al. 2000). These
      articular branches around the knee joint are known as genicular nerves. Several genicular
      nerves can be easily approached percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance. In our study,
      genicular nerves were effectively blocked with local anesthetics under fluoroscopic guidance,
      leading to a significant reduction in knee pain. Rf neurotomy is based on the theory that
      cutting the nerve supply to a painful structure may alleviate pain and restore function. we
      evaluate the efficacy of RF neurotomy in reducing pain and improving function in the elderly
      with chronic knee OA.
