      of tense ascites in cirrhotic patients. When paracentesis is performed without volume
      expansion, an high proportion of patients develop a complication named post-paracentesis
      circulatory dysfunction, which is characterized by a marked activation of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. PPCD has been associated with renal impairment, rapid
      recurrence of ascites and shorter survival. Infusion of albumin is very effective in the
      prevention of PPCD, but has sever inherent drawbacks: the theoretical possibility of
      transmission of infectious diseases and the high costs. Other synthetic plasma volume
      expanders have been proposed in the last decades, but they are less effective than albumin
      when large (> 5 L) volume paracentesis are performed. Albumin is conventionally given in a
      dosage of 8 gr per liter of ascites removed; however no information has yet been reported on
      the use of lower dosages of albumin in this context. This would be interesting, because of
      the obvious advantages in terms of costs reduction.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of the infusion of albumin 4 gr vs 8
      gr per liter of ascites removed in the prevention of PPCD.
