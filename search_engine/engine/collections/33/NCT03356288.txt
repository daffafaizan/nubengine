      as they breathe out and this makes a specific pattern, or "waveform". This waveform can tell
      a clinician a lot about the underlying health of a person. There are disease specific CO2
      waveforms for common breathing conditions such as Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). However up until this point there has been no accurate and non-invasive
      method of measuring the tidal breath CO2 waveform.

      This study will test the N-Tidal C, a new handheld device that accurately measures this
      waveform, and whether it can differentiate different causes of breathlessness; namely asthma,
      heart failure, pneumonia, breathing pattern disorders and motor neurone disease.
