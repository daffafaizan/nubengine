    
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, international, randomised controlled trial with a 1:1
      allocation ratio. Patients with positive margins and/or pT3 disease will be randomised to
      adjuvant RT (Standard Arm) or active surveillance with salvage RT delivered at early relapse
      (Experimental Arm). 64 Gy in 32 fractions will be delivered to the prostate bed. QoL
      self-assessment questionnaires, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score and toxicity will be
      assessed at baseline, the end of RT and annually for 5 years. Patients will be seen by their
      doctor 6 monthly for the first 5 years, then annually for the next 5 years. A blood test
      measuring prostate specific antigen (PSA) is done 3 monthly for the first 5 years for
      patients randomised to early salvage RT, then 6 monthly from years 5 to 10.
