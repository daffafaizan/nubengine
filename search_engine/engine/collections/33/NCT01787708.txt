      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to
      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more
      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo
      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune
      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune response.

      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the
      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and
      depigmentation therapy. Visible red light has been shown to stimulates melanocyte migration
      and proliferation resulting in repigmentation of vitiligo patches. However, there are only a
      few studies published on the efficacy of red light in vitiligo. The investigators plan on
      conducting a prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy of red
      light in the treatment of vitiligo.

      Study Objective To evaluate the potential for red light to induce repigmentation within
      vitiligo patches.
