      improvements in both exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with COPD. The
      intensity of exercise training is of great importance to yield a true physiologic effect.
      However, in patients with severe COPD, exertional dyspnea and leg fatigue make it impossible
      for the patient to maintain intensity of training for enough time to achieve a physiologic
      training effect. NIV has been reported to be used as support for exercise to improve exercise
      tolerance and respiratory performances in patients with mild-to-severe COPD with inconsistent
      results. Evidence from previous studies have suggested that NIV with a single-limb circuit
      with Whisper Swivel II expiratory valve or Plateau exhalation valve assisted during exercise
      in patients with COPD caused CO2 rebreathing. CO2 rebreathing may have a negative impact on
      efficacy. Previous studies have proved that exercise tolerance was improved ventilated by NIV
      with a dual-limb circuit. In theory, NIV with a dual-limb circuit consists of one inhalation
      limb that introduces air into the patient's airways and one exhalation limb that leads
      exhaled gas outside of the airways, there is no risk of rebreathing. However, there was no
      report on whether there's no risk of rebreathing in COPD patients ventilated during exercise
      by a dual-limb circuit. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine whether there was no
      CO2 rebreathing occurred assisted with NIV with dual-limb circuit in patients with stable
      severe COPD after exercise with exertional dyspnea.
