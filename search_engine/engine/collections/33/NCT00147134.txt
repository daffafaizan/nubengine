      suggested with respect to decreased morbidity, decreased pain, faster recovery, and shorter
      hospital stay.1-4 However, the long-term survival of LAP for colorectal cancer is still
      unclear, especially for advanced colorectal cancer requiring extended lymphadenectomy. Thus,
      the investigators designed a study which investigates whether LAP is suitable for advanced
      colorectal cancer with respect to survival and post-operative morbidity.
