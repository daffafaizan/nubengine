      addition to propylthiouracil (PTU) and groups receiving placebos in addition to PTU.
      Comparison of DC maturation were performed before and after the oral 1α-D3. DC maturation was
      assessed based on the expression of DC markers (HLA-DR, CD80, CD40, CD83, CD14 and CD206) and
      the ratio of cytokines interleukin-12/IL-10.
