      cancer treated by D2 gastrectomy at Alexandria University hospital between January 2010 and
      January 2016, (Group I). Another 68 consecutive patients presented by operable gastric cancer
      treated by D1 gastrectomy earlier during the same period were included as a control (Group
      II). All patients had undergone preoperative gastroscopy and biopsy, chest and abdomen
      computed tomography (CT). All surgeries were performed by surgeons experienced in both D1 and
      D2 dissection and a standardized protocol for D1 and D2 gastrectomy was followed in all
      patients. The type of gastrectomy (distal or total) was done according to the site of the
      tumor; distal gastrectomy was done if there is a free safety margin of 4 cm beyond the
      proximal resection line otherwise total gastrectomy was done. Resection of the spleen and/or
      pancreatic tail were done if directly invaded by the primary tumor or metastatic LN. Patients
      with p T2 or greater, or with positive LN received adjuvant chemotherapy. Follow up was done
      as outpatient visits for average 5 years. Both groups were compared regarding postoperative
      morbidity and mortality, disease recurrence and survival rates.
