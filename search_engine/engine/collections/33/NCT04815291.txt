    
      This Canadian registry is intended to assess the utility of SAVI SCOUTÂ® in the Canadian
      public healthcare system where there are limited resources and a conservative approach to
      patient and clinician exposure to harm (i.e., radiation, COVID-19 exposure, patient emotional
      trauma). By assessing the utility of reflector insertion at the time of biopsy, this study
      will be able to measure the impact on patient visits to the breast center for invasive
      procedures between biopsy and surgery, and quantify this value to the public healthcare
      system. The efficacy and safety of this system will be further assessed, as well as the
      acceptance of clinicians and patients.
