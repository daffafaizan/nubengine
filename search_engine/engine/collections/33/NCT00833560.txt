    
      This is open-label (both the participant and the investigator know what treatment
      participants will receive), prospective (participants are identified and then followed
      forward in time for the outcome of the study), multi-centre, and non-randomized (participants
      are assigned to different treatment groups by the investigator) study. The study will be
      conducted into 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Approximately 400 participants will be enrolled
      (30 in Part 1 and 370 in Part 2). In Part 1 the optimum dose of cyclophosphamide will be
      evaluated and in Part 2 the selected dose of cyclophosphamide from Part 1 will be
      administered. Part 2 will include a screening period of a maximum of 14 days followed by
      chemotherapy (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone) of a maximum of three 21-day
      cycles. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study.
