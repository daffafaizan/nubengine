      An educational need assessment is undergone prior to educational content preparation by
      interviewing 5 community pharmacists. After educational content preparation by instructors,
      the outcome assessment tool (knowledge, attitude questionnaire) would be designed by a
      distinct investigator. Closed and Open-ended questions are included to investigate different
      levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

      The questionnaire would be validated by specialists other than the instructors and it will
      piloted to investigate the reliability( Cronbach's Alfa > 0.7).

      Community pharmacists of Tehran,Capital city of Iran, would be invited to participate in the
      study. The participants would be randomly assigned to 3 groups by random number table. Each
      group receives the same education content with a different method:

        1. Didactic lecture

        2. Didactic lecture plus case discussion in a large group

        3. Didactic lecture plus small group education with simulated patient(SP). Interviewing
           with SP is conducted by small group facilitators with Brain Storming Technic.

      Each participant receives a compact disk which includes the educational material and he/she
      would be able to contact the instructors by phone or e-mail during the follow-up period.
