    
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle
      mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality
      of life and death (Goodpaster et al, 2006; Delmonico et al, 2007). The contributing factors
      are those related to aging process, non-optimal diet, bed rest or sedentary lifestyle,
      chronic diseases and certain drug treatments. Most of these factors are present in the older
      population with comorbidity, frequently institutionalized to receive a professional long-term
      care.

      Since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010)
      recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength
      and/or physical performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, interventions should be focused
      in both criteria. The aim of this study is to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and
      strength in institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia.

      To this purpose, the investigators study undertakes two physiotherapy interventions to
      preventing/treating Sarcopenia, namely, maintenance of muscle mass and improvement of
      strength in peripheral and respiratory muscles. Both interventions are common in the
      following features: supervision, duration, frequency and intensity of the training program.

      The primary outcomes are those related to muscle mass and strength. Secondary outcomes will
      be related to muscle function (muscle endurance and/or physical performance), costs and
      health status (number of falls and fractures, exacerbations of chronic diseases,
      hospitalizations and deaths during the year after concluding the physiotherapy
      interventions).
