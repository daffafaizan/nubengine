    
      HPV persistent infection is the major causal factor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
      (CIN) and cervical cancer. The important roles of E6 and E7 playing in HPV-driven
      carcinogenesis make them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. Previous evidences
      showed that using designated TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 as genome editing tool could produce
      disruption of HPV16 and HPV18 E6/E7 DNA, significantly decreasing the expression of E6/E7,
      inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell lines growth.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TALEN-HPV E6/E7 and CRISPR/Cas9-HPV E6/E7
      in treating HPV Persistency and HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasiaâ…
