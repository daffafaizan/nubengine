      patients enrolled in the single dose phase (Group A). Patients who successfully completed the
      single dose phase (i.e. did not experience a grade-3 targeted adverse event) could enter the
      multiple dose phase and receive ranibizumab injections for an additional 11 months.
      Simultaneously, the multiple dose phase was initiated in two parallel dose groups of
      additional patients (Group B), who received ranibizumab injections for 12 months. After
      patients in Group A and Group B had completed the multiple dose phase, all patients who
      provided written consent and were considered eligible based on the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria of the extension phase had the opportunity to continue on study treatment with the
      individualized flexible treatment regimen guided by monthly acuity scores and other
      ophthalmic examinations until approval of ranibizumab in Japan.
