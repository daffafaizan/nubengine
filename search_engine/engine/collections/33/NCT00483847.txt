      safety observational cohort program designed to obtain long-term safety data in multiple
      sclerosis (MS) participants treated with TYSABRI in a clinical practice setting in countries
      other than the United States and Canada.

      The Prescribing Physician will collect participant information at routine clinic visits
      (using standard data collection tools) at approximately 6-month intervals for 5 years from
      the first TYSABRI infusion.
