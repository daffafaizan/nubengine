        -  The optimal timing of clamping of umbilical cord in preterm infants : A subject of
           debate.

        -  Even a brief delay in cord clamping leads to an additional transfer of iron amounting to
           40-50 mg/kg which may prevent iron deficiency.ยน

        -  This low cost intervention can have significant public health importance in resource
           constrained settings.

        -  The effect of this intervention on neurobehaviour of preterm neonates has not been
           assessed.

        -  This aspect has been identified by WHO and Cochrane as a potentially researchable area
