    
      Methods: This 3-year prospective project will be divided into four phases: (1) Exploration of
      the IP-SDM needs of continuous breast cancer rehabilitation: We will interview breast cancer
      patients and consult breast cancer care professionals with different disciplines to
      understand the IP-SDM needs of breast cancer rehabilitation in each treatment period. (2)
      Development of communication and decision aids: An expert panel will develop a mobile
      application prototype of communication and decision aids. The prototype will be testes for
      the understandability and applicability by breast cancer patients. (3) Development of
      decision coaching and IP-SDM training programs: We will consult experts to develop a decision
      coaching training program for breast cancer patients and an IP-SDM training program for
      interprofessional rehabilitation team. (4) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the
      patient-centered continuous and interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast
      cancer rehabilitation: We will conduct a parallel-group, single-blinded randomized controlled
      trial and recruit 116 breast cancer patients at Taipei Medical University Hospital to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the IP-SDM approach.

      Expected results and impacts: We expect that the patient-centered continuous and
      interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast cancer rehabilitation will
      effectively improve patients' IP-SDM self-efficacy, quality of IP-SDM process, patients'
      satisfaction with decision, concordance between preferences and the chosen options, patients'
      upper limb function and health-related quality of life. In the future, this IP-SDM approach
      will be promising to be applied to other medical institutions and other cancer populations,
      so as to enhance patient-centered, interprofessional and continuous practice in cancer care.
