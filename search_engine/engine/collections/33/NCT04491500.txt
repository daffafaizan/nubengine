      limited in Yushu. Zhongshan ophthalmic center, sun yat-sen university in Yushu blindness
      project has lasted many years. Some medical staff who arrived at Yushu will have a plateau
      response. The high altitude hypoxia on retinal microcirculation evaluated by OCTA has not
      been reported. The aim of the study is to observe the microcirculation changes after
      exploring a hypobaric and hypoxia environment using OCTA, and relation with the plateau
      response. OCTA is a non-invasive examination and could see the microcirculation of the fundus
      directly and quickly.
