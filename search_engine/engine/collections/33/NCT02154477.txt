      diabetes have subnormal free testosterone (T) concentrations in association with
      inappropriately low leutinizing hormone (LH) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)
      concentrations. These patients thus suffer from hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH). Obesity
      and metabolic syndrome are also associated with HH. Animal studies and in vitro data have
      shown that insulin action and insulin responsiveness in the brain are necessary for the
      maintenance of the functional integrity of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis. Insulin
      concentrations can be increased in the brain by delivering insulin intranasally with vianase
      device. The aim of this project is to study the effect of one dose of intranasal insulin on
      release of LH in obese diabetic men with HH. 15 obese men with type 2 diabetes and low free T
      along with normal LH concentrations will be recruited for the study. The study will be
      carried out at the clinical center of Texas Tech (Odessa campus). There will be two study
      visits, each comprising of blood tests every 15 minutes over 6 hours. 40 IU of intranasal
      insulin or saline will be given after a baseline period of blood sampling of 2 hours.
      Student's t-test will be used to compare the change in LH concentrations after intranasal
      saline or insulin.
