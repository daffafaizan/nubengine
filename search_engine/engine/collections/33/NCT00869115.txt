    
      This is a single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, escalating dose phase
      I interaction study. The three dose levels of istaroxime or placebo will be randomized
      sequentially to three cohorts (I to III) of 16 patients each (12 patients on istaroxime and 4
      patients on placebo). Digoxin will be administered non blinded in all patients, once daily in
      the morning after a standardized breakfast, continuing with previously personalized dosage
      schedule during the screening period, treatment period, post treatment period and follow up
      period. Prior to accrual of cohorts II and III, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will advise
      on the continuation to the next istaroxime dose, based on a predetermined safety review.

      This 37 day study includes a screening period (Days -21 to -1), a treatment period (Day 1), a
      post treatment period (Days 2-4), and a follow up period (which includes one patient visit on
      Day 14). Patients will be confined in the phase I research center from Day -2 to Day 4.
