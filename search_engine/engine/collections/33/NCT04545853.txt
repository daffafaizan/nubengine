      in people with musculoskeletal pain complaints. This study will be carried out as a
      cross-sectional study. Participants will be recruited by means of flyers and social media.

      Pain cognitions will be assessed using questionnaires (The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),
      The llness perception questionnaire-revised (IPQ-R), The Pain Vigilance and Awareness
      Questionnaire (PVAQ), The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), The 36-item short form health
      survey (SF-36)), whilst movement-evoked pain will be assessed using a lifting task.
      Participants will need to rate the experienced pain immediately after completing the task. To
      estimate the extent to which pain cognitions explain movement-evoked pain, correlational
      analyses will first be conducted between all variables to determine what variables will be
      included in the hierarchical regression analysis.
