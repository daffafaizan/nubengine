      their assigned group at Visit 1. For participants 6 months to < 9 years of age for whom 2
      doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
      (ACIP) guidance, a second intramuscular injection of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine was
      administered at Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1).

      Blood specimens were obtained from all participants prior to the first vaccination:

        -  At Visit 1 (Day 0) and 28 days following the final vaccination (Visit 2, if no study
           vaccine was administered at Visit 2; or Visit 3, if a second dose of study vaccine was
           administered at Visit 2), for participants 6 months to < 9 years of age (Group 1 and
           Group 2)

        -  At Visit 1 and 21 (window, 21-28) days post-vaccination (Visit 2), for participants
           greater than or equal to (>=) 65 years of age (Group 3) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),
           suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), or Adverse Event of Special
           Interests (AESIs) were collected from Visit 1 through Visit 2 for participants receiving
           1 dose of study vaccine, and from Visit 1 through Visit 3 for participants receiving 2
           doses of study vaccine.

      Study duration per participant was approximately 28 days for participants 6 months to less
      than (<) 9 years of age, and 21 days for participants >= 65 years of age.
