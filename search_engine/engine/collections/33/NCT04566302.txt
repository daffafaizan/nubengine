      microscopy devices. The investigators have previously utilized the SECM technology for
      imaging large area of human esophagus in vivo. They have also developed endoscopic capsule
      devices which have been used to safely image over 60 human subjects, healthy volunteers and
      subjects with eosinophilic esophagitis, using SECM technology, rapidly.

      When used for skin imaging, SECM can provide real-time three-dimensional confocal imaging and
      significantly reduce the imaging time. While SECM has been successfully used for imaging
      human esophagus in vivo, its utility in skin imaging needs to be tested in a new pilot study.
      The investigators will be taking images with a dermatoscope as well. This will the control to
      compare the experimental images to, as the dermatoscope is the standard of care diagnostic
      tool for dermatologists.
