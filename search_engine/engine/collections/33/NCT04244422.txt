    
      METHODS: Fourteen (8 females and 6 males) patients with age range of 30-55 years who had
      radicular cysts associated with non-vital teeth, were operated at the Oral and Maxillofacial
      Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. The patients were randomly
      divided into 2 groups;1) the study group (7 patients) in which cyst enucleation using
      piezosurgery was employed, 2) control group in which the cysts were removed using the
      conventional technique. The following parameters were assessed; postoperative pain, time of
      operation, hemorrhage control and field visibility, ease of operation, neurosensory
      evaluation and radiographic percentage of change in bone defect volume between preoperative
      and 3-months postoperative values.
