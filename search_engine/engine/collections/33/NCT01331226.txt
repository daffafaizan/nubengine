      Helpline. Our primary aim is to examine the efficacy of two levels of telephone counseling
      for support persons (1 or 3 sessions) compared with a control condition on the proportion of
      smokers who call the Helpline over the 7 month follow-up period. We hypothesize a dose
      response relationship between number of telephone sessions provided to the support persons
      and smoker calls to the Helpline. Additional aims are to examine smoker quit attempts and
      cessation, and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.

      Nonsmoking adult support persons (N=1020) residing in Minnesota will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to one of three study conditions: (1) control condition -written self-help
      materials, (2) written materials plus one telephone session, or (3) written materials plus
      three telephone sessions. Outcome assessments will be completed by support persons and
      smokers at post-treatment (week 4) and at 7 month follow-up.

      This design will allow for evaluation of whether results from our previous trial (Patten et
      al., in press, AJPM) can be replicated when the intervention is implemented within a
      "real-world" setting. That is all support person intervention calls will be delivered by the
      Helpline. Moreover, we will examine the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a
      streamlined version of the intervention (i.e., 1 call). Furthermore, the proposed study will
      provide new data on quit attempts and cessation among the smokers. Ultimately, positive
      findings from this line of research could serve as the basis for expanding the range of
      helpline services to nonsmokers.
