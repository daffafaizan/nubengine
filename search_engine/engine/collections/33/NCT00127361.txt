      had been chosen by a nulliparous, underinsured, low-income woman and who had received brief
      training in supportive labor techniques. The objective was to compare labor outcomes,
      specifically cesarean section rates, in women accompanied by this additional support person
      (doula group) with outcomes in women who did not have this additional support person (control
      group).
