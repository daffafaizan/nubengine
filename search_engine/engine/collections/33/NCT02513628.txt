    
      Prospective observational study including all consecutive successfully resuscitated and
      TH-treated CA patients without traumatic or neurological etiology of CA in two French ICUs.
      ONSD measurements were performed on day 1, 2, and 3 after return of spontaneous circulation

      until ICU admission).
