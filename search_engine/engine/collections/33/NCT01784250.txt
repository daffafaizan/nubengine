      group design to determine the efficacy of the pre medication propranolol and clonidine versus
      placebo for reducing anxiety during third molar removal surgery. Patients will be assigned to
      3 groups of 20 patients each. One group will receive 150 mcg of clonidine, the second group
      will receive propranolol 40mg, and the control group will receive placebo. The modified
      dental anxiety scale will be applied before and after surgery in order to evaluate the change
      in anxiety level, which will be assessed as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes
      include the measurement of changes in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate
      evaluated before, during and after surgery. Additionally, pain will be assessed through
      numerical pain scale at 3, 6 and 24 hours after surgery. Also, possible side effects will be
      identified (vomiting, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and drowsiness). Statistical analysis:
      qualitative variables will be described by absolute and relative frequencies, and
      quantitative variables will be described by the mean along with standard deviation or the
      median with interquartile range depending on the distribution of the data. One-way ANOVA or
      Kruskal Wallis will be used (depending on the fulfillment of assumptions) in order to compare
      the quantitative variables amongst the groups. The chi squared test will be used to compare
      the qualitative variables. The confidence intervals will be estimated at 95% for all effect
      magnitude measurements calculated.
