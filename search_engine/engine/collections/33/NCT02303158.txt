      fulfilling the dementia criteria (Global Deterioration Scale, GDS, stages 1, 2 and 3). A
      longitudinal, prospective population study with two years follow-up. A cohort of will be
      included in the study. The patient's depression will be defined and categorized according to
      its severity (Yesavage Scale), whether it's endogenous or reactive (Holmes and Rahe scale)
      and taking into account the patient's medical history of depression.

      There will be a prospective follow-up of conversion to dementia (starting from GDS Stage 4).
      It will be considered that dementia corresponds to AD if the biological markers of LCR
      present typical changes of AD at the moment of inclusion (Beta amyloid low and P-tau high).

      It will be studied if there's any correlation between the clinically defined depression types
      and a high risk of progression to dementia and especially to AD.
