      given time. Moreover, sleep disturbance is known to be particularly prevalent in patients
      suffering from mental illness including affective disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety
      (Baglioni, 2016). We hypothesise that the use of amber glasses will aid the time taken to
      fall asleep without the need for the use of hypnotic medication.A prospective study looking
      at 15 new patients admitted to one mental health ward will be undertaken. Data will be
      collected on twice weekly basis on the patient's use of: amber glasses alone, hypnotic
      medication alone or both. Hypnotic medication will include sedating antihistamines,
      benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zopiclone. Medication prescribed for
      dual purpose will be assumed to be used for the treatment of insomnia if given after 2300
      hours. Each patient will be enrolled for a period of 4 weeks and the review of use and
      suitability will take place in ward review meetings.

      Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment tool at baseline
      and at the 2 and 4 weeks. At the end of the study period, percentage use of amber glasses and
      zopiclone will be used to compare against a historical average of hypnotic use for the most
      recent 15 admissions over a similar 4 week period.
