    
      This is a multi-centre, multi-country, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 2b
      study. The study will have a single-blind run-in period and will be adaptive with respect to
      the number of subjects recruited into each dose group. Four doses of BAY3427080 (40 mg once a
      day, 80 mg once a day, 120 mg once a day and 160 mg once a day) will be investigated and
      compared to placebo, in five parallel groups. Subjects will participate in the study for a
      total of approximately 19 weeks, comprising a screening period of 1 week, a 14 week treatment
      period, and then a final follow up visit 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period. There
      will be a total of 8 visits whilst participating in the study. Subjects will record their hot
      flashes in an electronic diary during the screening period to establish eligibility and
      throughout the study after randomisation.
