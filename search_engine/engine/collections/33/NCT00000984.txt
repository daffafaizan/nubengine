      of human cells by HIV in laboratory tests. However, the activity of rCD4 still needs to be
      confirmed in clinical trials. It is hoped that these tests will show that rCD4 is both safe
      and effective in treating children who are infected with or who are at risk for infection
      with HIV.

      Children have preliminary testing and evaluation to determine eligibility and health. The
      dosage schedule varies with the dose. During the course of the study, children are monitored
      for safety through physical exams and blood tests. They have blood withdrawn to study the
      response to rCD4 and measure the activity of rCD4 in the body. Children may receive
      immunization of DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) or DT and a polio vaccine to measure
      their antibody response. If the rCD4 is beneficial, children may continue treatment. The
      study is conducted in four parts:

        -  Part A: Children 13 to 18 years old.

        -  Part B: Children 3 months to less than 13 years old.

        -  Part C: Full-term infants over 3 months old.

        -  Part D: Preterm infants less than 3 months old. Parts C and D are not started until
           parts A and B have been completed.
