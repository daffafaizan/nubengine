      2-128). The use of preventive doses of enoxaparin (4,000 to 6,000 anti-Xa per day) or
      unfractionated heparin (10,000 to 15,000 IU per day) has been associated with a reduction in
      mortality of approximately one-third in patients with D-dimer levels greater than 3 μg/mL or
      those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC (sepsis-induced coagulopathy) score > 4)

      For the intensive care unit patient, the preventive enoxaparin dosages were increased to
      4,000 anti-Xa IU twice daily and to 6,000 anti-Xa IU twice daily if the patient weighs more
      than 120 kg. Curative treatment is even proposed in cases of marked inflammatory syndrome
      and/or hypercoagulability (e.g. fibrinogen > 8 g/L or D-Dimer > 3 μg/mL or 3000 ng/mL) even
      without symptomatic thrombosis.

      Given the lack of data on the use of these high "prophylactic" doses of enoxaparin, it is
      proposed that anti-Xa activity be monitored after the 3rd injection, and then regularly in
      the event of renal failure (because LMWHs are renally eliminated), to look for overdosage
      exposing a higher risk of bleeding. It is also proposed to regularly monitor (at least every
      48 hours) the hemostasis of patients in search of multivisceral failure, or of coagulopathy
      of consumption which will require a re-evaluation of the heparin therapy dosage, these events
      being associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage.
