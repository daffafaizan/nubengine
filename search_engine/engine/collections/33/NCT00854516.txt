      aging population. It is believed that venous insufficiency is the underlying condition
      responsible for 54-81% of leg ulcers. About 8% of leg ulcers are related to arterial
      insufficiency and about 14% have a mixed aetiology. Compression therapy is considered the
      most effective treatment for these ulcers. The overall cost of chronic venous leg ulcer is
      high because long term ongoing care is required. Also the quality of life of these patients
      is jeopardized due to long lasting ulcer treatments and inconvenient compression therapies.

      Several compression products are available on the market and there is a large body of
      literature describing the clinical benefit of different compression systems.

      A new treatment approach with the new device is to have an effective working pressure
      combined with a low resting pressure. A high working pressure achieved by a rigid sleeve
      around a patient's leg is essential to support the muscle pump, necessary for sufficient
      blood reflux. However the resting pressure could be low without relevant reduction of
      compression efficacy but with an increase in safety for patients with a mild to moderate
      peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). A high resting pressure is believed to be a
      main reason for reduced arterial skin perfusion which can result in pressure related skin
      damage. Accordingly most compression systems are not indicated for patients with an ABPI
      lower than 0.8. About 25% of patients with chronic venous insufficiency suffer from PAOD and
      hence are very difficult to treat with compression. With the new device, these patients could
      be sufficiently treated, because a low resting pressure is believed to have low influence on
      skin perfusion.
