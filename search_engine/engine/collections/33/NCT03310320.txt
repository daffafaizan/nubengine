    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel group Phase 1b
      study, designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects, clinical efficacy and safety of
      AZD0284 compared with placebo as measured by the relative change from baseline in Psoriasis
      Area Severity Index (PASI score), other disease assessments of involved body surface area
      (BSA), static physicians global assessment score (sPGA), pruritis and biomarkers associated
      with the mechanism of disease and AZD0284. Disease activity will be assessed throughout the
      study as will changes in skin biopsy biomarkers. The study population will be comprised of
      patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as defined by PASI score, BSA and sPGA.

      Following completion of screening assessments and meeting all eligibility criteria, patients
      will be randomised to receive AZD0284 or placebo for 4 weeks of treatment followed by a 4
      week follow up period
