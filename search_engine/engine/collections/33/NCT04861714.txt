      arthroplasty (TSA). Regeneten has been suggested as a bioinductive implant to aid in rotator
      cuff healing. We hypothesize that applying this technology could aid in obtaining higher
      rates of subscapularis healing for TSA when utilizing SP or ST, which in turn could lead to
      improved outcomes.The 50 randomized subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the
      standard subscapularis repair group or the standard repair with Regeneten augmentation group.
      Subjects will be blinded to their treatment assignment until they complete all study visits.
      Upon withdraw from the study, termination from the study, or new or recurrent symptoms
      requiring a subsequent surgical procedure, the blinded assignment will be revealed to the
      subject. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively and return post-operatively at Week 2,
      Weeks 6, Month 3, Month 6, and Year 1. The primary outcome will evaluate subscapularis repair
      integrity and healing at one year post-op.
