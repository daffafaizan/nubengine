      of caesarean sections in primiparous obese patients, with a spontaneous onset of labour,
      without increasing maternal or neonatal morbidity. This would be a major step forward in
      reducing morbidity in an at-risk population and in improving the obstetric prognosis for
      future pregnancies.

      The research is a double-blind controlled trial, including primiparous obese women in
      spontaneous labour, for whom a prescription of oxytocin is decided. Oxytocin is currently
      indicated for notably "insufficiency of uterine contractions, at the beginning or during
      labour".The recommended dosage in the market authorization will be used for the control
      group.

      The control group will receive oxytocin at 2 milli-International unit /mL and the
      intervention group at 4 milli-International unit /mL, controlled by pump (final volume = 500
      mL) or electrical syringe (final volume = 50 mL).

      The primary objective is to compare the effect of higher doses of oxytocin (intervention
      group) vs standard doses of oxytocin (control group) on the rate of caesarean sections in
      obese patients with spontaneous onset of labour.

      The secondary objectives will be to compare the effect of higher doses of oxytocin
      (intervention group) vs standard doses of oxytocin (control group) on maternal and labour
      complications (length of labour, arrest of labour, interruption of oxytocin perfusion and
      reason, uterine hyper-stimulation, mode of vaginal delivery, reason for caesarean section,
      post-partum haemorrhage, maternal blood transfusion, volume of oxytocin infusion, oxytocin
      side effects), as well as foetal complications and neonatal complications.
