    
      This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to establish the dose regimen and evaluate
      the preliminary efficacy and the safety/tolerability of poziotinib in patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 2 prior HER2-directed
      treatment regimens.

      Each treatment cycle will be 21 days in duration. During each 21-day cycle, patients who are
      eligible for participation will receive poziotinib orally once daily.

      All treated patients will be followed up until disease progression, death, intolerable
      adverse events or up to a maximum of 24 months whichever comes earlier.
