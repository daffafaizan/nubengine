      emotional component and on emotional cognition. It will add a better understanding of the
      mechanisms of pulmonary rehabilitation on dyspnoea.

      Patients with COPD will be included before starting a pulmonary rehabilitation and be
      evaluated with questionnaires (including the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile, and quality of
      life questionnaires), emotional cognition (at rest and right after an endurance test, using
      some short movies sequences and pictures of faces expressing some well defined emotions) and
      smile production analysis.

      After having followed a pulmonary rehabilitation, the same evaluation will be realised and
      results will be compared before and after the intervention.
