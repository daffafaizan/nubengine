      "medical device". The study involves women age 18 and older who are currently pregnant, at
      least 24 weeks' gestation or later, and who live in the USA. Up to 8,000 pregnant women are
      expected to participate in the study. This study will involve review of Owlet Band data and
      participant responses to questionnaires throughout the study. The purpose of this research is
      to observe if using the new Owlet Band and the associated iPhone app can help pregnant women
      in managing their habits, anxiety, stress, enhancing bonding and attachment to their infant,
      while still maintaining their standard medical care.
