      trial. 174 firstly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who need radical radiation
      therapy will be randomly divided into either early intervention or common intervention group.
      oxycodone control release tablets will be used to control the pain caused by radiation oral
      mucositis when the pain level is mild or moderate, respectively. The primary outcome
      measurement is nutrition status. Quality of life (QOL), the clinical outcomes, and the
      adverse effects are also to be observed.
