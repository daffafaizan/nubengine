    
      In this study we develop the minimal important difference for the 1-minute sit-to-stand-test
      (STST) with an anchor-based method.

      First step of this study is to find out the differences in the number of repetitions during
      1-minute STST, 6-minute walk distance and health-related quality of life from pre to post
      inpatient pulmonary Rehabilitation program (3 weeks Duration) in the Schoen-Klinik
      Berchtesgadener Land.

      In Addition, Balance tests on the Leonardo-Mechanograph will be performed and the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) will be
      assessed.

      For the second step we will use an anchor-based approach to estimate the MID of the STST.
      6MWD and CRQ are used as anchors for which the MID has been established before.
