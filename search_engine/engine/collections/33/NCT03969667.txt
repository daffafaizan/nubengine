      symptom against physical or psychological stress for healthy individuals. However, it can
      negatively affect the performance of individuals in activities of daily living. In the
      clinic, fatigue is assessed by self-reported scales. Different fatigue scales have some
      advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. Moreover, it is stated that only one
      scale cannot fully measure the fatigue of individuals in different health status, therefore
      different scales have been developed.Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) is an easy-to-understand,
      short, fast and useful fatigue scale that evaluates fatigue with two dimensions (physical and
      mental) and enable individuals to express perceived fatigue clearly. Psychometric properties
      of CFS have been investigated in general population and different disease groups but not in
      only healthy young adults.
