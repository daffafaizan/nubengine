      mediators in 4 distinct clinical settings of standard radiotherapy. In addition to collecting
      blood specimens, the study will also collect physical and dosimetric information of treatment
      such as total dose, number of treatments, and/or size of the radiation targe, as these will
      allow the investigators to study the impact of radiation variables on the immune system.
      Stool specimens will be collected at baseline, end of radiation therapy and during the follow
      up visit to detect microbiome changes associated with different radiation treatment at
      various time points. Humans are colonized by commensal bacteria, which outnumber human cells.
      These normal bacteria colonize mucosal surfaces and play a critical role in immunity. It is
      hypothesized that the underlying microbiota may also undergo changes in composition that
      correspond to the regimen of radiation that is utilized. By collecting stool specimens,
      investigators will be able to study microbial changes and how these changes correlate with
      alteration in immune mediators (i.e., lymphocytes, cytokines) present in blood samples
      before, during and after radiation; and explore the association between these parameters and
      type of radiation received.
