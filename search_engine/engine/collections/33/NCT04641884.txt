      Onco-dermatology were asked to report cases of bullous pemphigoid induced by antiPD-1/PDL-1
      therapy from 2014 to 2019. In this retrospective, observational cohort study, investigators
      included patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, with a diagnosis of bullous
      pemphigoid occurring during treatment or up to 12 months after its discontinuation. Diagnosis
      of BP was made by the dermatologist and was based on the following criteria developed by the
      French Bullous Study Group : compatible clinical presentation (absence of atrophic scars,
      absence of mucosal involvement and absence of predominant bullous lesions on the neck and
      head), compatible histopathology findings (subepidermal blister on skin biopsy; and linear
      deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement-membrane zone), positive DIF studies, positive
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP180/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BP230. For each
      case, collected data were : sex, type of tumor, type of checkpoint inhibitor, age at the
      onset of the checkpoint inhibitor, time from the onset of BP compared to the onset of the
      PD-1 inhibitor, clinical presentation of BP, results of complementary exams (skin biopsies,
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for BP180 and BP230 and indirect immunofluorescence studies
      if available); treatment of BP used, consequence on antiPD-1/PD-L1 therapy, course of the
      tumor, other irAEs. Overall tumor response was determined by the treating oncologist and
      classified using RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).
