      neuraxial anesthesia will be asked to provide consent for ultrasound to be used at their
      bedside to identify the interspace where the neuraxial anesthetic was administered. A low
      frequency ultrasound probe and sterile gel will be used to perform the less than five-minute
      study. The site of the neuraxial anesthetic placement will be identified by the puncture mark
      on the skin. The investigators will note the patient's medical record number and BMI, the
      names of the resident and attending anesthesiologist who placed the neuraxial anesthetic, the
      documented intervertebral space at the time of neuraxial anesthetic placement, anesthetic
      type, whether ultrasound was used for the initial neuraxial placement, and the documented
      intervertebral space identified post-partum by ultrasound.

      Following 3 months of data collection, information regarding the documented intervertebral
      space versus the actual intervertebral space that the neuraxial anesthetic was administered
      will be provided to each anesthesiologist and resident. Following delivery of this
      information, an additional 3 months of data collection will be performed (the same as the
      first 3 months) to evaluate whether a practice change took place.
