      primary schools and local food producers evaluating two interventions designed to improve
      primary school children's knowledge of and interest in food and where it comes from, with the
      ultimate aim of driving improvement in health, well-being and educational status. Key Stage 1
      and 2 pupils will be recruited from 15 primary schools in the North West of Northern Ireland
      and will be randomised to one of four intervention arms: i) 'Engage', ii) 'Nourish', iii)
      'Engage' and 'Nourish' and iv) Delayed of duration up to 6 months. Study outcomes include
      food knowledge, attitudes, trust, diet, behaviour, health and wellbeing and will be collected
      at baseline and six months.
