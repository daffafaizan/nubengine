    
      This is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating
      RAPA-201 cells in subjects with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma.

      After a subject consents to the study, an apheresis procedure will be performed to collect
      cells to manufacture the investigational product, RAPA-201 cells. During Cycle 1, subjects
      will receive pentostatin and low-dose, dose-adjusted Cyclophosphamide (PC regimen), but will
      not receive RAPA-201 cells. During Cycles 2 and beyond, Subjects will receive a conditioning
      regimen consisting of the PC regimen followed by the RAPA-201 cell infusions.

      Subjects will receive at minimum five cycles of treatment. If a subject has stable disease,
      they will receive an additional four cycles of PC regimen+RAPA-201 cells.

      All subjects who complete the active treatment portion of the study, prematurely terminate
      the study, or subjects who discontinue active treatment due to a toxicity attributable or
      related to the study drug will complete the follow-up portion of the study (approximately one
      year).

      Patients who experience progressive disease will be taken off study.
