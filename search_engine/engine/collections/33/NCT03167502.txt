      studies have compared the effect of eccentric versus concentric reinforcement in knee
      osteoarthritis. Our study aims to show the effectiveness of an eccentric reinforcement, the
      interest of a work supervised by a sports coach to maintain activity over time and to study
      the effect of this activity at the muscular level. The main objective is to study the effect
      of an eccentric muscle strengthening program on walking performance in osteoarthritis
      patients. The secondary objectives are to study: the effect of fatigue on walking, the
      relationship between fatigue and the level of physical activity, the effect of training on
      perceived fatigue and the effect of training on the function and at muscular level. This is a
      randomized, interventional trial. 40 subjects are planned. Inclusion criteria include: age
      40-85 years, KL 2 and 3. The subjects are divided into two groups to perform either eccentric
      or concentric work. 2 sessions per week for 6 weeks. At baseline and at the end of the study
      a clinical evaluation and MRI will be carried out for evaluation of the criteria of judgment
