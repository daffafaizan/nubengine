      DBS implants in the NAc using the Abbott Medical Infinity DBS system. The primary outcome of
      this study is to demonstrate the safety of bilateral NAc DBS in patients with
      treatment-refractory opioid use disorder. Secondary outcomes include time to relapse,
      remission of opioid use, and change in opioid craving scores. Other secondary outcomes will
      include the following: Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS), neurophysiological tests, body weight
      and biochemical markers of health and nutrition. If effective, DBS may reduce opioid use and
      opioid relapse in people with opioid use disorder who may continue to display relapse despite
      ongoing multidisciplinary standard of care. NAc DBS will be performed in two stages. Stage I
      (DBS brain electrode implantation) will require the subject to be admitted post-operatively
      for an overnight stay. The subject will return approximately 1 week later for stage II
      (implantation of the IPGs and extension wires). Two weeks after the stage II DBS operation,
      subjects will undergo systematic testing each of the quadripolar contacts and formal
      programming. Subsequent parameter settings will be changed at routine outpatient visits based
      on clinical effects. Standard of care can consist of methadone or buprenorphine maintenance
      treatment provided by an addiction specialist.
