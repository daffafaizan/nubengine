      which cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of these cases. Smoking topography, a key
      facet of smoking behaviour, can be subjectively or objectively measured by quantifying puff
      volume, maximum puff velocity, interpuff interval, puff duration, number of puffs per
      cigarette, and the time to smoke a single cigarette. Smoking topography can estimate exposure
      to carcinogenic toxins present in cigarette smoking (Djordjevic, Hoffman, & Hoffman, 1997).
      Evidence exists to support that exercise modifies smoking topography (Katomeri & Taylor 2006;
      Mikhail, 1983; Reeser, 1983; Zacny & Stitzer, 1985).

      Recently, Faulkner and colleagues (2011; N = 18) were the first to implement a handheld
      smoking topography device (CReSS Pocket) to measure smoking behaviour in the context of an
      acute bout of exercise after a temporary period of abstinence. They found that brisk walking
      influences an individual's smoking topography. In specific, participants assigned to the
      exercise condition smoked less per puff and took shorter puff durations, compared to the
      passive sitting condition. Overall, smoking topographical studies require further
      investigation due to methodological flaws in order to allow for the objective collection of
      smoking behaviour data and improved external validity in a sufficiently powered study.
      Furthermore, the role of cravings, withdrawal and affect as potential mediators of
      topographical changes due to exercise is a novel area of research.
