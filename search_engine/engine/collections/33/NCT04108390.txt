      Exclusion criteria: any lower limb disease, fractures, infections, pregnancy, received any
      treatment in the previous 3 months.

      Initially, the base measurements were as follows: paint intensity, pressure pain threshold at
      the gluteus medius trigger point, ankle range of motion and balance of the lower limb.

      Once baseline measurements will be taken, the same evaluations will be performed at 4 weeks
      from the start.
