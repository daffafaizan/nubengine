    
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the stabilizing splint versus the pivot splint as jaw
      exercise together with stabilizing splints for treatment of TMJ anterior disc displacement
      without reduction

      PICO:

      Population (P): Patients with symptomatic anterior disc displacement without reduction.

      Intervention (I): pivot splint.

      Comparator (C): stabilizing repositioning splint (ARS).

      Outcome (O):

      Primary outcome:

      Patients' subjective pain experience. Each patient will be asked to rate his or her current
      and worst pain intensity on numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 with zero being no pain and
      ten corresponds to the worst pain that the patient ever had.

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Maximum mouth opening (MMO). Assessment of MMO will be performed by measuring the
           distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors using a
           ruler.

        2. Lateral excursion. Assessment of lateral excursion will be performed by measuring the
           distance in mm between midline of upper and lower jaws

        3. Protrusion. distance in mm from the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor to the
           incisor edge of the mandibular incisor will measured in the maximum protruded position.
