      in long-term care (LTC), where antipsychotic use is relatively common. Inappropriate
      antipsychotic prescribing is a key quality indicator by which clinical outcomes might be
      monitored and improved in LTC but limited evidence exists on the most effective strategies
      for reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use.

      The objective of the study was to evaluate a multicomponent approach to reduce inappropriate
      prescribing of antipsychotics in LTC.

      A prospective, randomized stepped-wedge, study design was used to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention in 10 LTC facilities in Canada. The intervention consisted of an educational
      in-service, provision of evidence-based tools to assess and monitor neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (NPS) and monthly interprofessional team meetings.
