      effects (valvular stenosis or valvular insufficiency). Furthermore, frequently is required
      prophylactic use of antiplatelet drugs due to myocardial remodeling and antiarrhythmic
      conditions that may be associated. Patients with severe aortic stenosis may also acquired von
      Willebrand disease type 2A due to proteolysis of vonWillebrand factor. Despite of this, the
      treatment of valve disorders often requires cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. On
      average 50 to 60% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery receive blood tranfusions. Blood
      cell transfusion is an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in
      critically ill patients. The use of desmopressin seems beneficial only in patients with
      congenital or acquired platelet dysfunction. In general population, such use is not validated
      due to inconclusive results of researches.
