      Primary

        -  Determine response in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerance to and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the median and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease receive 2 additional courses beyond
      best response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
