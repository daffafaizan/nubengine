      from the environment through a biochemical process and then transmit these images to the
      brain via electrical impulses conducted from the inner retina to the optic nerve and
      ultimately to the occipital cortex.

      In the human eye, three types of specialized ganglion cells transmit electrical impulses to
      the brain. Among these three cell populations are rod and cone cells, which participate in
      the photo-transduction step of light perception, along with other light sensitive ganglion
      cells. It is a system whereby the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin (or one of its analogs)
      rearranges in response to light, and this change in chemical structure fires electrical
      impulses to the brain which in turn interprets the incoming impulses as a visual image.

      Transcorneal Electrical Stimulation (TES) using the "OkuStimÂ®" device delivers electrical
      impulses to damaged and/or diseased photoreceptor cells. This electric stimulation of the
      retina may help to preserve VA and/or the visual field.
