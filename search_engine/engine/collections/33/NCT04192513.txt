    
      A Randomized, Observer-Blinded, Vehicle Controlled, Single Dose, Dose Escalating, Single
      Application Within-patient Bilateral Comparison. The goal is to determine the safety and
      tolerability of DBI-001 Gel vs. Placebo in Adults with Atopic Dermatitis and to determine the
      antibacterial effect of a single application of DBI-001 Gel on the abundance of S. aureus.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of disease state severity and signs and
      symptoms of local tolerability (pain / burning / stinging, pruritus, erythema, edema, and
      scabbing / crusting) and review of adverse events. Any local skin reaction that requires use
      of a concomitant therapy or study discontinuation will be reported.
