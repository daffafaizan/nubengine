      survival of patients with recurrent GBM treated with Erlotinib plus Sirolimus.

      This is an exploratory, single-arm, phase II study designed to assess the anti-tumor activity
      of a combinatorial regimen consisting of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus among patients with
      recurrent GBM. The combinatorial regimen of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus is rationally designed
      to simultaneously inhibit upstream (EGFR) and downstream (mTOR) mediators of
      Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3/AKT) signaling. In a recently completed
      phase I study, we determined that an EGFR inhibitor (Gefitinib) can be safely combined with
      Sirolimus at dose levels that are routinely used in the monotherapy setting. Therefore, the
      primary endpoint of this study is the probability of progression-free survival at 6 months
      among recurrent GBM patients treated with standard doses of Erlotinib plus Sirolimus. An
      important secondary objective is to further assess the safety of Erlotinib and Sirolimus for
      patients with recurrent GBM.
