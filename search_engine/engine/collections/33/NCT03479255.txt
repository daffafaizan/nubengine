      disease, but compliance is poor. Coaching programs may help but requires significant
      resources. Smartphone programs may increase the efficiency of such efforts. The study aim is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a coached, smartphone-enabled exercise program versus
      physician directed exercise therapy (usual care) in patients at Grady Memorial Hospital's
      vascular clinic.
