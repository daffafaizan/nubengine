      acquired from outside the hospital (CAP) that requires intensive medical care. Mortality of
      (s)CAP patients admitted to ICU range from 35-58% depending on time and admission of the
      patient and has not much improved in the last years.

      BT086 contains a sufficient number of antibodies against the most frequent pathogens as well
      as antibodies against lipopolysaccharides and lipid A. Therefore, it can be assumed that
      administration of BT086 early in the clinical course of a severe infection such as sCAP may
      provide an effective adjunctive treatment to standard antibiotic therapy for sCAP patients.
