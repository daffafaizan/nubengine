    
      This trial was designed to evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside/ferric derisomaltose
      compared with IV ferric carboxymaltose on s-phosphate in subjects with IDA caused by
      different etiologies.

      The subjects received either a single intravenous (IV) dose of iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose (1000 mg at baseline) or two IV doses of ferric carboxymaltose (one dose 750 mg
      at baseline and a second dose 750 mg on day 7; cumulative dose: 1500 mg). The study subjects
      were monitored for up to 35 days from baseline.
