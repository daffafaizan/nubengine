      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination
      with rapamycin (sirolimus) and infusional cyclophosphamide and pulse dexamethasone (cy/dex)
      for patients with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate biological activity and efficacy of the combination of cyclophosphamide,
      dexamethasone, rapamycin and hydroxychloroquine in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To determine whether this treatment regimen results in mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) and autophagy inhibition in primary myeloma cells during therapy and if this
      corresponds with treatment responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.

      Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 (days 5-28 of course 1),
      sirolimus PO on days -2 to 4, and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) continuously and
      dexamethasone PO on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
