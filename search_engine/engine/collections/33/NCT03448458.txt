    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Establish the feasibility of using gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET as a predictive
      imaging biomarker for neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      Correlate progression of disease with degree of uptake on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET examination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE intravenously (IV). Within 55-70 minutes, patients
      undergo PET/CT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for at least 1 year.
