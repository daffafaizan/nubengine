    
      This study will be a single center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy
      participants. The study will consist of 3 parts: In Part A, the effects of steady-state
      dosing of a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A (fluconazole) on the single-dose PK of
      avatrombopag will be assessed. In Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong
      CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed. In
      Part C, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A and moderate CYP2C9 inducer
      (rifampin) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed.

      Each Part of the study will consist of 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment
      Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline Period 1.The Treatment Phase will
      consist of 2 treatment periods: Treatment Period 1 (administration of a single oral dose of
      avatrombopag 20 mg alone under fed conditions); and Treatment Period 2 (administration of
      oral doses of each inhibitor or inducer alone and concomitant administration of a single oral
      dose of avatrombopag 20 mg with each inhibitor or inducer [fluconazole in Part A,
      itraconazole in Part B, or rifampin in Part C] under fed conditions).
