      determine the rates of the different pathways and synthesis rates of glutathione when
      critically ill children are fed by the enteral route, and the difference among various age
      groups. The study size will include 45 critically ill septic, pediatric patients (15 infants
      at 1 month-3 years of age, 15 children at 4-12 years of age and 15 adolescent at 13-19 years
      of age), males and females admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children's
      Medical Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be 4 kg. The number of subjects
      includes an expected drop out rate of about 20%, in order to obtain 15 patients with complete
      data in each group. Patients will receive nutritional support as per standard care. This
      study will yield important knowledge and may lead in the future to changes in the current
      practice on the management of critically ill pediatric patients in the PICU.
