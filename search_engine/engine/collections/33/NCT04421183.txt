      maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The excretion of high levels of mucoprotein
      takes part in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through restraining trophoblast invasion. This
      study aimed to investigate levels of serum mucoprotein three in hypertensive diseases of
      pregnancy. This study included a total of eighty cases that 20 normal pregnancy, 20
      gestational hypertension, 20 preeclampsia, and 20 HELLP syndrome patients from June 2010-
      January 2011. This is the first study measuring levels of serum mucoprotein three in
      gestational hypertensive disease. MUC3 levels showed a distinctive increase in hypertensive
      diseases of pregnancy compared with the pregnant control group. As a result, it is found that
      plasma mucoprotein 3 levels increase as the severity of hypertensive diseases of pregnancy
      increases; and plasma mucoprotein 3 could be a precursor for the evaluation of the severity
      of the disease.
