      patients. Many parameters have been developed to aid weaning from MV such as P/F ratio
      (PO2/FiO2) and rapid shallow breathing index (respiratory rate/tidal volume), however,
      sensitivity and specificity for most variables are still variable in literature.

      Multiple studies have found that patients tolerantof SBTs were found to have successful
      discontinuationsat least 77% of the time.

      Causes of weaning failure include: airway and lung dysfunction, brain dysfunction, cardiac
      dysfunction, diaphragm dysfunction, and endocrine dysfunction .

      Diaphragmatic dysfunction is a common cause of weaning failure , however most of the
      traditional methods used for evaluation of diaphragmatic function (fluoroscopy,
      trans-diaphragmatic pressure measurement) are invasive and not available.

      Ultrasound assessment of diaphragmatic function has been developed recently providing an easy
      and safe method for evaluation of diaphragmatic excursion and thickening.

      It was found that weaning failure (Re-intubation within 48 hours) was associated with
      diaphragmatic excursion <1 cm and thickening fraction <28% several studies reported the value
      of diaphragmatic ultrasound to predict weaning failure ,however no one of them used
      diaphragmatic ultrasound to guide weaning.

      previous studies showed that failure rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation was 27%
      ,however failure rate in our department was 43% adding ultrasound derived values aims for
      improving success rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation.
