      with rare genetic lipids disorders. We will take advantage of the new technology of whole
      exome sequencing to find the cause of dyslipidemia that we haven t been able to find using
      past methods. We will work with geneticists to review the sequence data for unexpected gene
      changes (incidental findings) that do not explain the lipid disorder but gene changes that
      can cause medical disorders such as rare forms of cancer or heart disease. The opportunity to
      participate in the Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO) program will enable us to take
      advantage of our expertise in other rare lipid disorders and translate this knowledge into
      new diagnostics and therapies, which is a key mission of the NIH.
