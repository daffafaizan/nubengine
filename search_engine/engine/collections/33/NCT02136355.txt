      treatment for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. SABR uses modern
      radiotherapy planning and targeting technologies to precisely deliver larger, ablative doses
      of radiotherapy.

      The use of SABR as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery may provide a novel therapeutic
      opportunity. In oncology, the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy prior to
      surgery has become widespread for several types of cancer, and in many instances improves
      local control over and/or survival compared to surgery alone. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy
      provides several theoretical advantages, including potentially decreasing the rate of
      positive margins, decreasing the size of the required resection, or by sterilizing the tumor
      to avoid seeding of circulating tumor cells during surgery. Although radiologic outcomes
      after SABR illustrate local control rates of approximately 90% in many studies, the presence
      of residual post-treatment fibrosis may confound this assessment of recurrence.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate a novel treatment approach: the combination of
      neoadjuvant SABR followed by surgical resection in patients with T1T2N0 non-small cell lung
      cancer, in order to measure the true pathologic rates of local control after SABR, to develop
      new imaging biomarkers or response, and to assess clinical outcomes, including toxicity,
      relapse patterns, and survival.
