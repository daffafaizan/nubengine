      metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular diseases
      (CVD), obesity, and other related conditions in populations of the African Diaspora. This
      project takes advantage of the well-established infrastructure and success of Dr. Anne Sumner
      s NIDDK clinical protocols. The project will aim to enroll subjects from her cohorts which
      include whites, African Americans and Africans living in the United States with the goal of
      performing quantitative trait analysis using a candidate gene approach to understand the
      genetic basis of serum lipid levels, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and other metabolic
      parameters. For aim 2, we propose to perform whole exome sequencing in a subset of cases
      (n=48, 96 chromosomes, African ancestry) to identify both rare and common variants for
      multiple metabolic parameters. Variants identified by the exome sequencing effort and by a
      current sequencing project of six candidate lipid genes will be genotyped in the entire
      cohort. Overall, these studies will further efforts to understand if black-white differences
      as well as differences within black populations exist in the genetic basis of T2D, CVD, and
      obesity. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will form the basis
      of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural researchers, and
      non-NIH scientists.
