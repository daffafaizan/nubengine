      group of 9 subjects). Cellulosic textiles, incorporating noble metals (Ge, Ti, and Ï€
      elements), developed by Green Energy Nano Technology Co., Ltd, were used in the test group,
      while commercially available regular textiles were used in the control group. The safety and
      efficacy of the treatment to the subject's sexual function quality were assessed through the
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the validated Portuguese version of the
      Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) questionnaires. In the same session, the symptoms
      related to ED were assessed through the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and the
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed
      once a month and followed up for 3 months. The incidence of severe adverse effects was
      analyzed to assess product safety.
