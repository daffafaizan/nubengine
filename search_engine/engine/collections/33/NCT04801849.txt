      units (IU), 400 IU, or 800 IU of Vitamin E or matching placebo for 24 weeks. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine the minimum effective dose of Vitamin E
      (d-alpha-tocopherol) based upon relative change in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from
      baseline to 24 weeks.
