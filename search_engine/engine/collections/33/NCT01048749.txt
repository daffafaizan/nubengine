      mechanical stresses, but a large portion is thought to occur primarily from intervertebral
      disc degeneration with resultant reduction in overall spinal height. The use of specific
      postures and rest periods to increase the overall spinal height has been suggested through
      various stadiometric research studies. This overall spinal height change can be used as a
      treatment tool for management of symptoms of chronic low back pain and signs of nerve root
      compression.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of aquatic vertical suspension on
      spinal height, symptom location and pain intensity compared to a more commonly used land
      based supine flexion position.

      The study will be conducted at one outpatient physical therapy clinic with subjects recruited
      from the local community.

      A single blinded True Experimental Repeated Measure cross over design will be utilized.

      Spine height will be measured using a commercially available stadiometer. Spinal height
      measurements will be completed after loaded walking, supine land based flexion positioning
      and after aquatic vertical hang.
