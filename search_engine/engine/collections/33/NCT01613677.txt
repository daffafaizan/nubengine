      Tumor dimension assessments will be performed at baseline through abdominal/pelvic magnetic
      resonance imaging, to be repeated in 3 months intervals and evaluated according RECIST
      criteria. The first cohort, composed by the 06 first patients, will undergo a separate
      positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) evaluation at baseline and 90 days apart.

      Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry), ECG and physical examination will be done on
      every visit.

      Drug pharmacokinetics will not be assessed in this study. For the screening Baseline periods,
