      (or representative parents of patients) affected by ENPP1 deficiency and the acute form of
      ABCC6 deficiency. All study participants will complete the RSVP, PRO tools and upload a proof
      of disease form, followed by an interview conducted by a trained interviewer. It is estimated
      that each respondent will need up to 60 minutes for the entire process; 20 minutes to
      complete the RSVP, PRO tools and to upload proof of diagnosis of ENPP1 deficiency or the
      acute form of ABBC6 deficiency, and approximately 40 minutes to complete the interview and
      address any follow-up questions if needed.
