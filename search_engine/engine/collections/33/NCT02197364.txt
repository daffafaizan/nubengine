      Part 1: The purpose of this part is to evaluate the role of KL-6 as a biomarker in the
      clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) by detecting serum KL-6 levels among
      patients with ILD, and comparing them to the clinical diagnostic criteria and other
      respiratory diseases, including pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and healthy control group.

      Part 2: The purpose of this part is to study the value of KL-6 levels in terms of ILD
      treatment effect evaluation through the detection of serum KL-6 levels before treatment and
      30-90 days after treatment. Treatment includes anti fibrosis, anti-inflammatory and other
      conventional therapies.
