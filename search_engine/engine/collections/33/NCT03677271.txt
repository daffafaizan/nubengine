      Centre. In particular the Chronic Cardiac Disease theme because it focuses on Heart Failure
      and how to improve clinical care and outcomes, physical function and quality of life of those
      living with heart failure. The project will develop and evaluate a novel non-pharmacological
      therapeutic approach (home-based exercise programme with behavioural support) which
      recognises the complexity of heart failure and the need to treat each individual patient in
      an optimal way. Such therapy will be tailored for people with heart failure who are, under
      current clinical care, lacking the well-recognised benefits associated with exercise therapy.
      After initial evaluation, it is expected that this project will inform development of a large
      definitive trial (subject to separate funding application) which findings will be translated
      into clinical care to improve outcomes in people with heart failure. Results of such a trial
      are expected to have a significant impact on current clinical practice and the development of
      new cardiac rehabilitation guidelines for heart failure.

      It is important to indicate that home-based exercise cardiac rehabilitation programmes have
      been introduced in an attempt to widen access and participation as an alternative to
      supervised centre-based rehabilitation in conditions other than heart failure. Home-based
      exercise programmes are reported to be equally effective as centre based programmes in people
      with coronary artery disease i.e. following myocardial infarction and/or revascularisation,
      but remain to be designed and evaluated in those living with heart failure and this is
      subject to the present investigation
