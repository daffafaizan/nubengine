    
      100 patients undergoing laparoscopic TEP ( Total extraperitoneal repair) inguinal hernia
      repair under general anaesthesia will be randomized into 2 groups by the closed envelope
      method. In case of difficulty in Single port TEP inguinal hernia repair, the procedure will
      be converted to conventional 3 port repair for patient safety.

      2 groups of participants: Group A will undergo laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with 3
      ports (10 mm , and 2 ports of 5 mm ).

      Group B will undergo laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with a single port (12 to 15 mm
      transumbilical).

      Patient will be informed at consenting that 3 wound plasters will be applied to their abdomen
      regardless of whether they are in the single port or 3- ports group so that they would not
      know which group they have been randomized to. The blind will only be lifted after pain score
      and area of pain has been recorded before discharge.
