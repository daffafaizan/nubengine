      Providence VA Medical Center (PVAMC). Following this consultation, patients who are to begin
      rTMS therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited to
      participate in this study. About 1 week prior to the scheduled beginning of rTMS therapy,
      research participants who provide informed consent will complete baseline neuropsychological
      measures. Within a few days of completing these measures, and before beginning rTMS therapy,
      participants will receive an MRI scan, including structural and functional imaging.
      Participants will have a similar set of MRI scans up to three times during the course of rTMS
      therapy, and complete neuropsychological measures at these scanning sessions. A final MRI
      scan will be conducted within a week of completing the rTMS therapy course, and
      neuropsychological measures will be completed at this session.
