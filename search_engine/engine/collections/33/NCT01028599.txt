      heart transplantation, cardiac transplant recipients are randomized to 8 weeks of intense
      physical training or control. Vascular function is measured non-invasively using forearm flow
      mediated dilatation. Effect on the blood natriuretic peptides and the inflammatory markers is
      evaluated using blood samples at baseline and after the training or control period.
