      literature, with regards to the relationship between core stability and athletic performance.
      Number of research studies have also been completed that underline the benefits of core
      stability training on injury prevention or performance, but in combination with other
      training modalities such as speed, power, strength and agility. Although several studies have
      investigated core stability benefits in athletes but there are very limited studies have
      presented the role of Pilate training in increasing the core strength and stability of
      cricket players in order to maximize their performance in the game. This study will
      contribute in describing the effects of Pilate training in cricket players.
