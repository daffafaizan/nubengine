      I. Assess the efficacy of cordotomy for patients with unilateral advanced cancer pain.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the patient experience of cordotomy for cancer pain refractory to palliative care.

      II. Determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as a noninvasive biomarker
      for a successful cordotomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo a cordotomy over 1-2 hours.

      GROUP II: Patients receive morphine via injection into the spine and undergo a fake cordotomy
      over 1-2 hours.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and once every month for up to
      6 months.
