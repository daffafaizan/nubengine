      Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) provider intervention including introducing RDTs
      with detailed instructions, one-off training, job aides and on-the-site supportive
      supervisory visits and (ii) combined provider intervention [as under (i)]and community-based
      intervention (using primary and secondary schools as focal points)including school malaria
      events with drama, peer-health education, distribution of health education materials. Types
      of facilities include: public primary health facilities, private pharmacies and private
      Patent Medicine Dealers (PMDs)in Enugu State. The two sites in Enugu State are: Enugu urban
      (comprising of Enugu East, Enugu South and Enugu North Local government areas (LGA) and Udi
      LGA. The impact of the interventions will be evaluated using a 3-arm stratified, cluster
      randomized trial with a cluster defined as a geographical community and the two study sites
      as the strata. The three arms of the trial are:

        -  Intervention - Provider intervention

        -  Intervention - Provider plus school-based malaria activities

        -  Control - Expected practice (once RDTs have been introduced)

      Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      with basic provider training on malaria diagnosis and treatment; and (ii) the basic provider
      training [as under (i)] plus enhanced provider training to improve the quality of care that
      includes aspects of interactive self awareness, communication modules between health workers
      and also between health workers and patients. Types of facilities include: public district
      hospitals, public health centres (including integrated health centres), mission hospitals and
      mission health centres (including integrated health centres)in Yaound√© and Bamenda Health
      Districts. A stratified, cluster randomized trial will be used in which health facilities are
      the cluster and the two study sites are the strata. The three arms of the trial are:

        -  Intervention - RDTs with basic provider training;

        -  Intervention - RDTs with basic plus enhanced provider training;

        -  Control - which represents current practice and neither intervention will be
           implemented.
