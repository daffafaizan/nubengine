      mortality in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation or ventilatory
      support.

      Intravenous or oral dexamethasone are well evaluated in randomized study but other oral
      corticosteroids are not. Compared to dexamethasone, prednisolone is more available in France
      and easily taken by patients, especially in case of home medical care.

      The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of prednisolone and dexamethasone are different. To
      obtain similar effects, prednisolone should be theoretically taken twice a day and at a
      superior dose than the strict prednisone equivalence of 6mg dexamethasone.
