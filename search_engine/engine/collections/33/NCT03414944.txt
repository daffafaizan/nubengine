    
      In this prospective phase 1 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selective brain
      radiotherapy in NSCLCs with limited brain metastases, patients will received selective brain
      radiotherapy based on SIB and hippocampus, inner ear avoidance.

      Prescription dose: Gross tumor (PGTV) 40-50 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks + EBI (PCTV) 30 Gy/10
      fractions/2 weeks.

      OARs dose limits: Hippocampus D100%≤10Gy, Dmax≤17Gy,Inner ear: Dmean ≤15Gy. All patients were
      observed and recorded daily for acute radiation impairment during radiotherapy. Follow-up
      every 2 months will be performed after radiotherapy.

      The primary endpoint:Acute and chronic radiation response, QOL in patients, vestibular
      function,neurocognitive function based on mini-mental state examination(MMSE) questionnaires,
      hearing.

      The secondary endpoint included:objective response rate (ORR);intracranial progression-free
      survival (iPFS); OS (defined as the time from study beginning to death from any cause).
