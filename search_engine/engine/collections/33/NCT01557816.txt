      of the knee. The duration of the study will be up to 5 weeks. Eligible subjects will have
      chronic OA of the knee. After meeting initial entry criteria and prior to randomization,
      there will be a 1 week wash-out from existing therapy. Subjects will then be treated in a
      blinded fashion for 1 week with either naproxen (3 days at 250 mg twice a day followed by 4
      days at 500 mg twice a day) or placebo. After the first week of treatment, subjects will have
      a week of wash-out followed by a second period of 1 week of the alternate treatment. Subjects
      will not be allowed to use oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other oral
      analgesics, nor will they be allowed to use topical medications on their target knees during
      the study. Acetaminophen will be allowed as a rescue medication (as needed up to 2 g/day)but
      subjects will be told not to take acetaminophen at least 12 hours before study visits.
      Seventy (70) subjects will be randomized to ensure that 60 subjects complete both treatment
      arms.
