      pressure (BP). In particular, the reduction of the normal 10 to 20% sleep-time BP decline
      (non-dipper pattern) is associated with elevated risk of end-organ injury, particularly to
      the heart, brain and kidney. These results suggest that cardiovascular risk could be
      influenced not by BP elevation alone, but also by the magnitude of the circadian BP
      variability. Moreover, at least two independent prospective studies have suggested that
      nighttime BP is a better predictor of risk than daytime BP. Common to all previous trials is
      that prognostic significance of ABPM has relied on a single baseline profile from each
      participant, without accounting for possible changes in the BP pattern, mainly associated to
      antihypertensive therapy and aging during follow-up. The MAPEC study investigates, first, the
      comparative prognostic value of several BP parameters (including, among many others, BP
      variability, the diurnal/nocturnal ratio, diurnal and nocturnal means, slope of morning rise,
      etc) in the prediction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; and, second, whether
      potential changes in the circadian BP pattern after Chronotherapy with antihypertensive drugs
      are associated to changes in cardiovascular risk.
