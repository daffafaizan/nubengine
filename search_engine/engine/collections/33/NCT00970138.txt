      been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, the efficacy of these treatment is
      still unsatisfied for their toxicity and limitation in prolonging survival. Based on the
      promising results of apatinib in the phase I study, this clinical trial has been designed to
      evaluate whether apatinib can improve progression free survival in patients with metastatic
      gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy compared with placebo. Patients will
      be randomized to 3 groups, one group patients will receive the treatment of apatinib 850mg
      qd, one group patients will receive apatinib 425mg bid, and the other group will receive
      placebo.
