      feasibility study is to define the variables to be included in a subsequent pilot study,
      assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective cohort study, and the logistics for the
      study (i.e., training, patient recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, etc.).

      Upon completion of the feasibility study, a prospective pilot cohort study would be performed
      to measure outcomes using the FACE-Q Skin Cancer module for patients receiving skin grafting
      or local flaps after excision of facial skin cancers.
