      Primary nitinol stenting for superficial femoral artery (SFA)) lesions has been shown to be
      superior to balloon angioplasty alone. Zilver PTX a paclitaxel -eluting nitinol stent has
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for femoro-popliteal artery use.
      Previous study have reported safety and effectiveness of the Zilver PTZ in patients with de
      novo or re-stenotic lesions of the femoro-popliteal artery.

      Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel intravascular imaging modality with a unique
      and fine resolution of 10 Âµm at the level of a red blood cells providing detailed images of
      vascular wall following stent implantation for evaluation of optimal stent apposition and
      expansion as well as intraluminal clot.

      20 patients with symptomatic critical limb ischemia (CLI) and claudication without CLI
      (Rutherford class 2-6) and identifiable SFA disease on angiogram requiring percutaneous
      peripheral intervention (PPI)will be enrolled in this study. We would like to study the
      vessel apposition and expansion immediately after initial implantation as well as evaluation
      of late stent malapposition and neointimal hyperplasia at the 12 months follow up after
      Zilver PTXTM stent implantation using intravascular OCT imaging. Follow up visits will take
      place at 1 month, 6 month, 12 month and 13 month after the procedure.
