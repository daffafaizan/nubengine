      represent the largest minority group. Latino cancer patients engage in advance care planning
      less often and receive less value-consistent care at the end-of-life (EoL) more often than
      non-Latino cancer patients. The proposed research addresses the pressing need to reduce
      Latino EoL care disparities by developing an intervention for improving the therapeutic
      alliance between oncologists and their Latino cancer patients.

      The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test the feasibility and acceptability
      of an intervention designed to improve the therapeutic alliance (TA) between oncologists and
      their Latino advanced cancer patients. Mixed methods will be used to create a conceptual
      model of the TA between oncologists and their Latino advanced cancer patients. The TA
      intervention will be pilot tested in a randomized control trial. The underlying hypothesis is
      that an intervention based on an empirically-sound conceptual model of the TA between
      oncologists and Latino advanced cancer patients, that supports oncologists' and patients'
      autonomy, competence, and relatedness, will lead to improved TA between oncologists and
      Latino advanced cancer patients, which in turn will lead to reduced disparities in advanced
      care planning engagement and end-of-life care quality.
