      Lifestyle modifications such as increased levels of physical activity are recommended as the
      Ô¨Årst line of anti-hypertensive treatment. A recent systematic review showed that isometric
      handgrip (IHG) training was superior to traditional endurance and strength training in
      lowering resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The average length of previous IHG training
      studies is approximately 7.5 weeks with the longest being 10 weeks. Therefore, presently it
      is unknown if it is possible to further lower blood pressure levels beyond the 10 week mark.
      Recently, the investigators developed a novel method for monitoring handgrip intensity using
      a standard Nintendo Wii Board (Wii). The primary aim of this study is to explore the effects
      of 20-weeks IHG home training facilitated by a Wii in hypertensive older adults (+50 years of
      age) in lowering SBP compared to usual care. Secondary aims are to explore if/when a leveling
      off effect on SBP will occur during the 20-week intervention period in the training group and
      to explore adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training.

      Methods: Based on previous evidence, the investigators calculated that 50 hypertensive older
      adults (+50 years of age) is needed to achieve a power of 80% or more. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IHG home training +
      hypertension-guidelines on lifestyle changes) or to a control group (hypertension-guidelines
      on lifestyle changes). Participants in the intervention group will perform IHG home training
      (30% of maximum grip strength for a total of 8 min per day per hand) three times a week for
      20-weeks.
