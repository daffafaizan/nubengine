      overproduction of lymphoblasts or lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood; it
      is frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. It can spread to the lymph
      nodes, spleen, liver, the central nervous system (CNS), and other organs (sanctuary sites).
      Without treatment, ALL usually progresses quickly.

      B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells express surface antigens that parallel their
      respective developmental lineages. Precursor B-cell ALL cells typically express CD10, CD19,
      and CD34 on their surface, along with nuclear terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. About 20%
      of adult ALL patients have a cytogenetic abnormality that is indistinguishable from the
      Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1, t(9;22)), according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

      The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both malignant cells
      via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This results in the
      formation of the "immunological synapse" and the subsequent T-cell activation on leading to
      killing of malignant cells. AFM11 has 2 binding sites for CD19 and 2 for CD3, its molecular
      weight is ~ 105kDa compared to diabodies like blinatumomab with one binding site for each
      target and a much lower molecular weight ~ 55kDa. In addition, preclinical experiments have
      shown that AFM11 has about a 100 fold higher affinity to CD3 compared to diabodies and is
      inducing higher cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of low effector:target cell ratios.
      These differences might allow for a shortening of the infusion times and potentially higher
      clinical efficacy compared to blinatumomab.
