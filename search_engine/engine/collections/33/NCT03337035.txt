      (CONSORT) guidelines that are published for the evaluation of randomized controlled trials.
      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study. Subjects will be
      randomized to 2 groups:

      Phase 1: a. oral placebo, and b. oral probiotics; Phase 2: a. intranasal Oxytocin(OXT) + oral
      placebo, and b. intranasal OXT + oral probiotics

      The treatment will proceed for a total of 28 weeks. In the first phase (16 weeks), all the
      patients will be randomly and proportionally divided into two groups: Group A (30 subjects)
      receives oral probiotics while Group B (30 subjects) receives an oral placebo. In the second
      phase, subjects in Group A and Group B will continue their respective oral probiotics or
      placebo administration as in Phase 1. In addition, both groups will be simultaneously
      administered with intranasal OXT spray.

      Testing will be performed 3 times total (before, during, and after treatment). The tests
      include behavioral surveys, cognitive tests, clinical autonomic tests, and blood tests for
      oxytocin levels. Investigators plan to select up to 10 subjects from each group to conduct a
      series of MRI studies at week 0, week 16 and week 28.
