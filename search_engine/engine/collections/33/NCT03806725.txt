      tomography (CT) including coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

      This study evaluates the effect of LOCM on liver transplant candidates with normal and
      decreased renal function undergoing CCTA. Incidence of post-contrast acute kidney injury
      (PC-AKI) will be compared between the two groups before and after contrast medium exposure.

      LOCM is a potential cause of PC-AKI, especially in vulnerable population with decreased renal
      function. According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) manual on contrast media,
      however, many published studies on PC-AKI in the past have been heavily contaminated by bias
      and conflation. More recent studies do not confirm a high risk of contrast induced
      nephropathy.

      End stage liver disease patients with normal renal function do not seem to be at a higher
      risk of developing PC-AKI. Only limited data reporting a low incidence of PC-AKI after
      contrast-enhanced CT in patients with liver cirrhosis and concomitant decreased renal
      function exists. Proof of low PC-AKI in this specific population would allow to redirect
      patients from invasive catheterization to CCTA as their cardiac clearance before
      transplantation. This study will prospectively investigate the incidence of PC-AKI in this
      specific at-risk population.
