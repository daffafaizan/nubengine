    
      This is a prospective cohort study, with study visits at Enrollment and subsequently at â‰¤10
      days , 1 month (+/- 7 days), 3 months (+/- 7 days) , 6 months (+/- 14 days) , and 12 months
      (+/- 14 days) after heart transplant surgery.

      BIS measurements will be performed on patients both in the pretransplant and post-transplant
      periods except when contraindicated in the pretransplant setting concerning patients with
      advanced heart failure. Because the use of BIS is contraindicated in the setting of permanent
      pacemaker and/or internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) devices, BIS assessment cannot be
      performed in the pretransplant setting for patients with advanced heart failure as the
      majority of these patients already have these devices in place. However, at the time of
      cardiac transplantation, these devices will be removed from those patients with advanced
      heart failure and the BIS measurements will then be performed shortly after transplantation,
      and then serially during the post-transplant period at various time intervals for one year in
      order to track changes in body composition.

      These measurements will be compared to traditional measurements performed at the time of
      preoperative evaluation by the nutritional and dietitian support team.
