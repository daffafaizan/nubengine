      does not involve the Central Nervous System (CNS). Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher
      disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia,
      hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased
      quality of life. Gene-ActivatedÂ® human glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB; velaglucerase alfa) is
      produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has
      an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme. Velaglucerase alfa
      contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary
      target cells in Gaucher disease. This study was designed to determine the efficacy, safety
      and pharmacokinetics of GA-GCB in men, women, and children with Type 1 Gaucher disease. Each
      patients duration of treatment was 12 months.
