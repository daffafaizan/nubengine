      treatment study. The study will consist of neoadjuvant treatment period (weeks 1 to 20),
      surgical evaluation period (weeks 20 to 24), and a post-surgical/follow-up period
      (approximately 3 years). Subjects will be treated on an outpatient basis.

      Neoadjuvant therapy will consist of epirubicin + cyclophosphamide given every 2 weeks for
      four cycles followed by a three week break. Subjects will then receive docetaxel every two
      weeks for four cycles + trastuzumab (one loading dose) then maintenance dose every 2 weeks
      for 4 treatments.
