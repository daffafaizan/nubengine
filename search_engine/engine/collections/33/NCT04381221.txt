      to assess the feasibility of a comprehensive, patient-centred service for palliative care in
      children with cancer by adapting and advancing ePRO systems, which aim at supporting the
      communication between the patients, their parents and the treating medical healthcare
      professionals. Participants of the study are pediatric oncology patients between 6 and 17
      years of age and at least one of their parents, receiving treatment at one of the
      participating clinical centers due to leukemia or solid tumors. With regard to the study,
      apps have been developed for both groups of participants, which includes inter alia a game in
      which questions about burden considering symptoms can be answered by the children.
