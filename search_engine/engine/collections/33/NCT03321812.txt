      and structure of normal cartilage. The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy of arthroscopic decalcification bone scaffold combined with microfracture in the
      repairment of articular cartilage defects by randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients with
      clinically diagnosed knee cartilage injury according to 1: 1 were divided into experimental
      group and control group. The experimental group will be treated with decalcification bone
      scaffold combined with microfracture .The control group will be treated with microfracture .
      The patients will be treated by the same surgeon in this study group. MRI evaluation, Lysholm
      score, IKDC score, Tegner score, VAS score are selected as the measures of outcome, while the
      blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine, CRP, ECG and other laboratory tests will be
      recorded inclduing the incidence of adverse events.
