    
      The overall goal during this study will be to conduct a small scale pilot study with 80
      hospitalized patients and 80 acute care nurses. Specific Aim 1 will establish acceptability,
      feasibility, and potential effect size of the patient-centered narrative intervention for
      hospitalized patients with serious illness. For specific aim 2, the investigators will
      compare the effects of the narrative intervention to usual care for the primary outcome of
      patient's perception of quality of communication and patient's psychosocial and spiritual
      well-being. For specific aim 3, the investigators will conduct usability testing, applying a
      user-task-system-environment evaluation process to determine essential requirements for
      integration and use of the patient-centered story into the EHR, from the perspective of an
      important end user: the acute-care bedside nurse. These results will support future R01
      applications for testing/tailoring patient-centered narrative interventions to improve QoL
      for patients living with serious illness.
