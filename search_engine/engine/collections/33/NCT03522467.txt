      enrolled in to a prospective single-arm cohort study, in which they will receive an orally
      administered cannabis oil formulation as an add-on therapy to current treatment regimens.
      Subjects entering the acute study phase will be titrated to a tolerated dose at which a
      sustained pain response is reached, and may subsequently enter a 12 week chronic phase during
      which safety and durability of pain response will be assessed at their stable dose.
