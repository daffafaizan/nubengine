      5 years after lung transplantation about 50% of all patients have this syndrome. There are
      nearly none therapy options. Besides effective therapy of any gastrooesophageal reflux and an
      oral medication with azithromycin none further regimens are known. Photopheresis could show
      in several studies a benefit for patients with gvhd after bone marrow transplantation or for
      chronic rejection after any other solid organ transplantation. Just little case reports could
      show beneficial effect in patients with bos after lung transplantation.

      This is the first controlled, randomized study with patients with bos after lung
      transplantation to investigate the effectiveness of this therapy in that patients.
