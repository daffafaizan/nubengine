      cigarettes in young adults who are dual users of cigarettes and cigars, if flavor, such as
      fruit or menthol, makes FCs more addictive, and if there are differences for men and women.
      The first hypothesis is that the potential for FCs to cause addiction will be lower than that
      of cigarettes, but will increase as cigarette cost increases. Second, flavored FCs will be
      more addictive than unflavored FCs, and that the effect of flavored FCs on addiction will be
      greater in women than men. Last, participants will smoke more FCs and fewer cigarettes when
      given flavored compared to unflavored FCs. This study employs a crossover design (controlled
      for menthol status) in which 145 young adult dual users will be assigned a flavored or
      unflavored FC and then switched to the other type after 1 week. We will utilize the Cigarette
      Purchase Task, other standardized measures of dependence, and ecological momentary
      assessments to study the relationship between depenednce indicators and smoking in the
      natural environment.
