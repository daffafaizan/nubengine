        -  Determine the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in managing hot flashes and
           menopausal vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women with a history of node-negative
           invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast who are receiving adjuvant
           tamoxifen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on blood coagulation and lipid profiles in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior hysterectomy (yes vs no), symptom complex (vasomotor vs
      vaginal vs both), duration of hot flashes (less than 1 year or no hot flashes vs 1 year or
      more), and average daily number of hot flashes (less than 10 or none vs 10 or more). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients who have not undergone prior hysterectomy receive oral
           medroxyprogesterone once daily for 6 months. If, after 1 month, symptoms do not resolve,
           patients receive oral conjugated estrogens once daily in addition to medroxyprogesterone
           for 5 months. Patients who have undergone prior hysterectomy receive oral conjugated
           estrogens once daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months. Quality of life is
           assessed at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 12 months.
