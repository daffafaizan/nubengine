      surgical or non-surgical treatment. In addition, the optimal time to start exercise treatment
      after the injury, with or without surgery, is not well understood. Animal studies show
      positive effects of early mobilization in tendon healing. Neuromuscular exercise has shown
      better effects than strength exercise in people with knee injury or knee disease. There are
      few studies in humans focusing on exercise as treatment, without surgical intervention, after
      ATR.
