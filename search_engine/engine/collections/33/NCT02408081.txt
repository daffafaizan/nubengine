      factors associated to readmission for elderly medical patients. Families with elderly members
      in general want to be involved in the caring and want to maintain a close relation to their
      elderly family member. However, disease in a single family can have a negative effect on all
      members and may result in dysfunction of the family. International guidelines recommend that
      the patient's relatives are involved in patient education as well as the treatment. Family
      interventions might contribute to decline depression and readmissions, besides enhanced
      quality of life and family function among elderly medical patients and their next of kin.
