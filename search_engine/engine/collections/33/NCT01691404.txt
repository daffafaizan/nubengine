      supplementation will be investigated. The products under investigation will be epicatechin
      and quercetin-3-glucoside. Subjects will be asked to consume either 160mg of
      quercetin-3-glucoside, 100mg of epicatechin or a placebo capsule for a period of 4 weeks.
      Measurements of vascular function and blood pressure will be taken before and after each
      4-week intervention period. A 4-week washout period will be planned between each
      intervention.

      Measurements of vascular function will include flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave analysis,
      pulse wave velocity and vasomotion as well as biomarkers of inflammation and vascular
      function.
