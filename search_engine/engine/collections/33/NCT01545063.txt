      discharge to ask them about indicators, quality of life and discrepancies in medication use.
      After the follow-up, medical dossiers will be consulted to know which indicators are followed
      in practice.

      The role of the different health care providers will be investigated by face-to-face
      interviews with different healthcare professionals.
