      results. Aim 1 will compare the number of blood products utilized in each resuscitation
      strategy. Aim 2 will analyze the coagulation and inflammatory mediators in each resuscitation
      strategy to determine if there is a difference in the mechanism of coagulopathy. Aim 3 will
      determine if the different resuscitation strategies have an effect on post resuscitation
      adverse events.
