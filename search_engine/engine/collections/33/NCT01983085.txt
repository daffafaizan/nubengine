      wounds. The dressing consists of 2 stable layers that when placed together release Nitric
      Oxide. In preclinical studies NOx delivery has caused significant vasodilation, angiogenesis
      and demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity.

      This is a multi-centre, 160 patient, randomised, controlled study. There are 2 arms to the
      study. 80 patients will have treatment applied to a SPT burn wound and 80 patients will have
      treatment applied to a SPT graft donor site wound.

      The controls will be intra-individual. Each patient will have their wound divided into 2,
      half of the wound being treated with the NOx dressing, the other half treated with standard
      of care. The positioning of the dressings will be randomised.

      The NOx dressing will be changed at least every 2 days and the standard of care changed
      according to normal clinical practice and patients will be treated until the wound is healed.

      The study will evaluate:

        -  The size of the wound

        -  Eepithelialisation

        -  Trans-epidermal water loss

        -  Infection status.

      There will be 3 and 12 month follow up with assessment of scarring.
