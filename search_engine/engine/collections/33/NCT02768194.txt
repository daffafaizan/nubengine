      dentifrice containing stannous fluoride to occlude tubules compared to a regular fluoride
      dentifrice and a negative control (mineral water). The study treatments will be administered
      for a total of 10 days, with participants wearing two appliances in their mouth that will
      hold samples of dentine. The dentine samples will be examined after 1, 4, 8 and 10 days of
      treatment using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the resulting images graded for the
      amount of occlusion. In addition, the robustness of any occlusion generated by the treatments
      will be tested by exposing the dentine samples to an acid challenge (orange juice) after 9
      and 10 days treatment.
