    
      This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded Phase 2 study
      intended to evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of 3K3A-APC following treatment
      with tPA, mechanical thrombectomy or both in subjects with moderate to severe acute ischemic
      stroke.

      Approximately 115 subjects were to be randomized, which included the planned 88 subjects in
      groups of 4 subjects to either 3K3A-APC or placebo (in a 3:1 ratio) and the additional
      placebo subjects who were enrolled during safety review pauses. This study used a modified
      version of the continual reassessment method (CRM) in order to establish a maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD).

      Eligible subjects received 3K3A-APC or placebo every 12 hours for up to 5 doses
      (approximately 3 days), or until discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first.
      Subjects were monitored for safety evaluations through Day 7 (or discharge, if earlier) and
      were expected to be seen on Day 7, 14, 30, and 90 for safety and outcome evaluations.
