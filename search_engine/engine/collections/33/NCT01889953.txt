      transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) but is associated with better quality of life than PTBD
      in patients with inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction who have failed prior ERCP.
      Furthermore, EGBD may be associated with decreased procedure-related costs. Patients who
      undergo PTBD usually require multiple procedures for stent exchange/upsize. Our initial study
      will be a prospective multicenter feasibility study that will include patients with
      inoperable distal biliary obstruction who have failed ERCP. If feasibility is demonstrated,
      our goal will be to compare EGBD and PTBD in a randomized multicenter international trial
      with a crossover design.
