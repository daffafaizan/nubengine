      standard treatment with docetaxel improves progression-free survival for patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the second and third line settings.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To compare response rate of patients in both treatment arms

        -  To compare overall survival of patients in both treatment arms

        -  To compare toxicity in both treatment arms

        -  To determine whether the survival benefit from suramin is associated with reduced
           M-phase entry in peripheral blood lymphocytes
