    
      This is a single-center prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study in 10 male or female
      subjects, age 18 to 65 years, who desire laser removal of a tattoo which contains all black
      ink. Subjects will receive up to 5 laser treatments, spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart, and will be
      followed at 3 months post-final treatment. Number of laser treatments required shall be based
      upon tattoo response to laser irradiation. The Investigator will terminate laser treatments
      upon 100% clearance of tattoo or after 5 treatment sessions, or in the event of an adverse
      effect which requires cessation of laser treatment.
