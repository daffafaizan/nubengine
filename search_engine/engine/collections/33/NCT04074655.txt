      commit themselves to use the driving simulator daily (5 days/week), and 15-20 minutes/day for
      a period of 2 consecutive weeks. The location for these simulation sessions will be one of
      the Family rooms of the Lindenwood Retirement Community. During the experiment, the research
      assistant (RA) of the study will be present and monitor participants for any plausible
      simulator sickness. In case if a participant presents any simulator sickness symptom, the
      experiment will be stopped and the RA will remain with the participant until s/he feels
      alright to go back to his/her room or with a caregiver. The RA and PI may withdraw the
      participant from the study if it is for their benefit.

      Participants' performance data and the duration of which they practice are all being recorded
      and uploaded on the secure server of the PI. After the end of the 2-week exercise program,
      participants will be assessed again by Morris Water orientation test, SSQ, and MADRS; SSQ
      test will also be run after the first session of the experiment.

      Furthermore, their feedback about using the driving simulator will be collected through a
