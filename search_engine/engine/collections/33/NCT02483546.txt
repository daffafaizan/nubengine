    
      This was a randomized, controlled trial of a simulation- based educational intervention
      designed to increase medicine student's clinical skills in cardiac arrest procedures .The
      investigators included 181 fifth-year medical students rotating in the emergency department
      of Fattouma Bourguiba University hospital of Monastir (Tunisia) during the period from
      January 2013 to January 2014.Students were randomized into two groups using a random number
      generator to an intervention group (simulatortrained, n = 99) or a control group
      (traditionally teaching, n =82).

      The investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, non-blinded study to determine whether
      simulation based training is superior to traditional teaching in the assessment and
      management of simulated patients presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by
      ventricular fibrillation.
