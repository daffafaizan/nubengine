      are the gateway to serious and potentially lethal infectious diseases. Several studies have
      demonstrated that dental students are among the most vulnerable to blood-borne exposure due
      to both their limited and restricted working area and developing skills level. This situation
      makes the use of post exposure prophylaxis is very important. Therefore, this study is
      conducting to evaluate the awareness level of fifth year dental students regarding post
      exposure prophylaxis.
