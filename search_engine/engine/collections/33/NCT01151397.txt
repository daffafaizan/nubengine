      obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of na√Øve patients with genotype 2, 3.
      Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors. The current study examines
      whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, for 3 months therapy could improve viral
      response. The working hypothesis is that 3 months therapy with Vitamin D + Peg + Ribavirin
      significantly improves RVR, EVR, and SVR.
