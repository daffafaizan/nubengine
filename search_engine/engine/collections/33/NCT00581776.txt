      rate (CRR) to the VcR CVAD regimen (response rate at completion of induction). Patients will
      receive Rituximab, Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Dexamethasone in
      three week intervals for 6 cycles; then rituximab consolidation (weekly x 4) , then one dose
      of rituximab every 12 weeks until 5 years or disease progression.
