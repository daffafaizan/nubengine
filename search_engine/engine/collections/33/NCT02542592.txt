      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented.

      Hip-arthroplasty surgery and the inflammatory stress response in general affect the potential
      of recovery. The basic physiological mechanisms behind restoration of recovery after surgery
      are still unresolved. The many different immune cells involved in the complex signal response
      enables wound healing and recovery, and the individual immune signal pattern might be able to
      predict recovery. The effects of glucocorticoids on this immune signal pattern is unknown and
      calls for further investigation.

      The study is to be considered as exploratory. This study is embedded in a primary study
      registrated as: NCT02445898
