      disease affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 50 years. There is a
      worldwide increase in disease prevalence due to the increasing age of human populations. The
      disease is characterized by tremor, stiffness of the limbs and trunk, impaired balance and
      coordination, and slowing of movements, leading to immobility and frequent falls. Patients
      also sometimes develop other symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, disturbed sleep, and
      emotional problems. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
      substantia nigra region of the brain. The cause and mechanism of continued neuron cell death
      in the substantia nigra is currently unknown.

      Epidemiological studies suggest an association between Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis,
      vitamin D inadequacy and altered bone and mineral metabolism. Accumulating evidence indicates
      that patients with Parkinson's disease are at a higher risk for fractures compared to healthy
      subjects. This could be attributed to several contributing factors including increased rate
      of falls, vitamin D deficiency, reduced body mass index and reduced bone mineral density.
