      alpha-galactosidase deficiency. This enzyme deficiency causes deposits of
      globotriaosylceramide in virtually all cell types of the body. The majority of hemizygous men
      develop a severe multisystemic disease dominated by renal failure, neurological and cardiac
      involvement. There is a specific treatment based on enzyme replacement therapy.

      The incidence of Fabry disease is estimated between 1/60000 and 1/3500 in the general
      population.

      Infertility in Fabry disease is poorly documented. Only a few cases have been reported, from
      alteration of spermogram to azoospermia. The identification of deposits suggestive of Gb3 in
      light microscopy and electron microscopy at the level of the genital tract argues in favor of
      the attack of this device. The low prevalence of Fabry disease requires a cross-sectional
      multicenter study to determine the frequency of alterations in sperm characteristics, their
      impact on fertility, and the possible effect of substitution therapy, in order to establish
      appropriate measures. adequate preventive measures.

      The objective of this project is to estimate the prevalence of spermatic abnormalities in
      patients with Fabry disease.The main objective of this project is to estimate the prevalence
