      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of motexafin gadolinium (MGd) when given concurrently
      with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma.

      II. Estimate the overall survival of patients treated with concurrent radiotherapy,
      temozolomide, and MGd followed by post-radiation temozolomide.

      III. Determine the short- and long-term adverse effects in patients treated with this
      treatment.

      IV. Estimate the progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial
      GBM or gliosarcoma treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium (MGd).

      PHASE I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and
      36-40. Beginning the night before the first dose of radiotherapy and ending the night before
      the last dose of radiotherapy, patients receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily on
      days 0-39. Patients also receive MGd IV over 30 minutes prior to radiotherapy once daily on
      days 1-5 and 8-12 and then on days 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 36, 38, and 40.
      Beginning 28 days after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide
      once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-7 patients receive escalating doses of MGd until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which no more than 6
      eligible patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive temozolomide as in phase I. Patients also
      receive MGd as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
