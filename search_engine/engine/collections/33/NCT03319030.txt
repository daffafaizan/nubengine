      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) with an updated recommendation to include moderate aerobic
      exercise. Historically, children with DMD were advised to not exercise as it was thought to
      accelerate muscle loss. Today, there is new data suggesting that moderate aerobic exercise
      that does not strain muscle may be beneficial and improve a child's quality of life with
      regard to heart disease, fatigue, and other factors of overall health. Although it is
      expected that children who exercise will experience health benefits, there is no scientific
      evidence indicating a positive or negative effect in a DMD population.

      This study is trying to understand the role of aerobic exercise in boys with DMD and how it
      may impact heart, muscle, and lung function using newly identified biomarkers. The goal is to
      correlate increased aerobic exercise with improved functional outcomes and changes in
      biomarkers.

      The data collected from this study will allow future development and implementation of an
      innovative and disease-specific home aerobic exercise program that in the future will be
      recommended to families of children with DMD.
