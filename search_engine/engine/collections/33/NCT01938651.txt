      I. To implement quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, diffusion-weighted
      (DW)-MRI, 31 phosphorus (31P) MRS, magnetization transfer (MT)-MRI, chemical exchange
      saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI, and high-resolution structural imaging at 7 Tesla in patients
      for diagnosing breast tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo measurement of tumor perfusion and permeability using DCE-MRI, tumor
      cellularity using DW-MRI, phospholipid metabolism using 31P MRS, macromolecular content using
      MT-MRI, and cellular protein content using CEST-MRI. Diagnostic performance of one, or a
      combination, of these metrics will be investigated in the context of breast cancer.
