      (Niacin/Niacinamide) supplement can be used to slow the progression of PD.

      Inflammation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology as evidenced by the
      presence of microglia in the substantia nigra in post-mortem samples as well as activated
      microglia and cytokines in clinical and animal studies. The use of non-aspirin non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs was found to reduce the risk of PD. The investigators recently
      identified an anti-inflammatory receptor GPR109A that is upregulated in PD. Niacin has a high
      affinity for this receptor, suggesting that it (niacin) may play an important role in
      reducing inflammation in PD. The investigators also found that individuals with PD have a
      chronic niacin deficiency. In a three month trial at Augusta University (the investigators'
      affiliate) the investigators demonstrated that niacin was helpful for PD patients in reducing
      inflammatory macrophages and boosting the anti-inflammatory macrophages in blood.

      In this VA-funded study, the investigators will determine the effect of 18 months
      over-the-counter (OTC) niacin or niacinamide supplementation on inflammation (as assessed in
      the blood and spinal fluid) and severity of the PD symptoms.
