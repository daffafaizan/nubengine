    
      The purpose of this study is to adapt ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men),
      developed by Dr. John Pachankis, to simultaneously target the multiple adverse health
      outcomes sexual minority women disproportionately face, including depression, suicidality,
      and alcohol abuse, that are linked to minority stress processes.

      Project EQuiP will adapt the ESTEEM program for sexual minority women in three distinct
      phases. The focus of this registered protocol will be Phase 3, however Phases 1, 2 and 3 are
      described below.

      Phase 1 will involve conducting interviews with 20 sexual minority women (SMW) who report
      experiencing depression, suicidality, and alcohol abuse. Information from these interviews
      will be used to gather insight from participants that can help inform the adaptation of a
      cognitive-behavioral treatment approach to specifically target sexual minority women's unique
      experiences with minority stress.

      Phase 2 will involve consultation interviews with 10 community-based mental health experts
      who treat psychosocial health problems among at-risk SMW. Involvement of key community
      members in intervention design optimizes intervention dissemination and allows frontline
      professionals to shape the intervention that they would be most willing to implement. Input
      of mental health experts working with the SMW community will be used in order to translate
      existing, but largely untapped, clinical wisdom regarding SMW's minority stress experiences,
      mental health, and alcohol use into the development of the intervention.

      Phase 3 will involve pilot testing the adapted cognitive-behavioral treatment through a
      randomized controlled trial with 60 SMW who report experiencing depression, anxiety, and
      alcohol abuse.
