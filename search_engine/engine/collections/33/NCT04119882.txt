      J-Glyc measured with a novel in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test. Blood samples from eligible
      consenting subjects will be collected at hospital admission, throughout different post
      admission times (1h, 3h, 24h and 72h or discharge). The quantification of circulating Apo
      J-Glyc levels will be analysed in correlation with clinical data providing information about
      Apo J-Glyc as an ischaemia biomarker and its diagnostic and 6-months prognostic value.
