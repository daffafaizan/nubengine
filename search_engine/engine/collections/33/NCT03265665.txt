      (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma
      exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA
      women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain
      the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity
      among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory
      function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection
      between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among
      sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in
      asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization.
      Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical
      activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a
      8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women
      with asthma.
