      Primary

        -  To measure psychosocial correlates of desire for hastened death (DHD) and change in DHD
           in patients with late-stage cancer by examining the relationship among a patient's
           perception of being a burden, their caregiver's perceptions of the patient's
           burdensomeness, and DHD changes over time.

      Secondary

        -  To identify coping and personality factors in both caregivers and patients that may be
           related to the patients' DHD and changes in their DHD.

      OUTLINE: Patients and caregiver dyads complete questionnaires at baseline, 2 months, and 4
      months. The dyads complete demographic questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale (HADS), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), and the
      Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). Patients also complete the Schedule of Attitudes
      Toward Hastened Death (SAHD), the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief
      COPE), the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF), and the Caregiver Demands
      Scale (CDS). Caregivers also complete the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily
      Living (IADL).

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed for stage and node status at primary diagnosis,
      previous oncology surgeries, previous adjuvant treatments, treatment at time of recurrence,
      disease free interval, site of metastasis, and response to current treatment.
