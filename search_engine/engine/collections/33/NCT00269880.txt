    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and
      safety of abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in combination with two different heparin
      regimens in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment groups: abciximab/low-dose weight-adjusted heparin,
      abciximab/standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin, or placebo/standard-dose weight-adjusted
      heparin. The primary outcomes of the study include the number of deaths, myocardial
      infarctions, or repeat revascularizations within 6 months, and the number of deaths,
      myocardial infarctions, or severe myocardial ischemia leading to urgent repeat percutaneous
      coronary intervention or urgent coronary artery bypass surgery within 30 days. Please see
      attached results.

      Abciximab bolus plus 12-hour infusion with standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin; Abciximab
      bolus plus 12-hour infusion with low-dose weight-adjusted heparin; Placebo bolus plus 12-hour
      infusion with standard-dose weight-adjusted heparin
