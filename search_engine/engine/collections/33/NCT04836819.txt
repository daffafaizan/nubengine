    
      Patients will be divided into three groups.

      Group L: The patients will receive intravenous lidocaine (2 mg/kg/h) immediately after
      anesthesia induction. At the end of the surgery, the dose will be decreased to 1 mg/kg/h. The
      infusion will continue until 12 hours after the operation.

      Group K: The patients will receive intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg/h) immediately after
      anesthesia induction. At the end of the surgery, the dose will be decreased to 0.3 mg/kg/h.
      The infusion will continue until 12 hours after the operation.

      Group D: The patients will receive intravenous dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg/h) immediately
      after anesthesia induction. At the end of the surgery, the dose will be decreased to 0.3
      mg/kg/h. The infusion will continue until 12 hours after the operation.

      Ketamine, lidocaine, and dexmedetomidine doses will be calculated according to ideal body
      weight, lean body weight, and actual body weight, respectively.

      Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random number list, and a
      statement indicating the patient's group will be placed in a closed envelope numbered
      according to the result. Each patient will be asked to choose an envelope, and the patients
      will be assigned to the study according to the group mentioned in the envelope.
