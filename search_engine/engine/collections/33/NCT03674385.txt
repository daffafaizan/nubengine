      Clomifene is in the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) family of medication. It
      works by causing the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, and
      subsequently gonadotropin from the anterior pituitary.

      Vit E is used in treatment of pco due its anti-oxidant effect.
