    
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and pervasive disorder
      characterised by problems in attention, impulse control and activity regulation that
      substantially burdens patients, families, and society. ADHD is often associated with
      challenging behaviours that can induce negativity, even in parents who would otherwise cope
      well.The efficacy of behavioural training for parents of children with ADHD symptoms is well
      established, however it is less clear which type of parenting intervention should be offered,
      and which aspects of parenting behaviour to focus on. It is not established whether an
      intervention designed specifically for families of children with a diagnosis will be more
      effective and cost effective than less specifically-targeted interventions.

      Parents In Control (Parents InC) offers specific support around empowerment, information and
      behaviour management specific to ADHD, as well as understanding of the child's development
      context. Parents InC has been used for a number of years in Scotland and has been evaluated,
      with promising results, but with relatively small sample sizes, no long-term follow-up, no
      economic evaluation and, most crucially, no comparison to an alternative intervention or to a
      control group. The investigators now need to understand if it: i) is at least as effective as
      the current best-evidenced alternative, Incredible Years, in impacting children's behaviour
      outcomes; ii) is cost-effective; and iii) offers something helpful and unique compared to
      other parenting programmes in terms of parenting self-competence and quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and likely size of a substantive
      randomised controlled trial comparing an ADHD specific parenting intervention to a
      diagnostically less-specific parenting intervention (Incredible Years). Specific objectives
      are to test (1) whether parents of children recently diagnosed with ADHD are willing to be
      randomised to Parents InC or IY; (2) whether sufficient numbers of families can be (a)
      recruited and (b) retained such that a full-scale RCT is likely to be feasible; (3) whether
      research procedures and efficacy measures are feasible and acceptable to participating
      families (including health economic measures and consent to link to routine datasets); (4)
      whether families participating in Parents InC achieve similar scores on the parenting sense
      of competence scale at 12 months post randomisation as those in the comparison arm
      (Incredible Years); (5) Whether the two intervention arms significantly differ on any other
      measures; and (6) the mean cost per participant of Parents InC.
