      consecutive colonization and possible infection due to MDR pathogens.

      One therapy option is the use of inhalative colistin, as this agent has been demonstrated to
      be effective against these pathogens. Data on pharmacodynamics or - kinetics are transferred
      from older studies or from other patient populations. For patients with pulmonary
      colonization or infection due to an MDR pathogen the systemic resorption of the drug is not
      known, consequently systemic side effects including kidney or neural damage are not
      predictable.

      This study focus on patients with inhalative colistin therapy and uses therapeutic drug
      monitoring to determine the rate of systemic resorption of colistin. For the evaluation of
      neurotoxicity function of peripheral nerves (neve conduction velocity) and of the eighth
      cranial nerve is monitored. Nephrotoxicity is estimated by creatinine level (-clearance) and
      the RIFLE criteria.
