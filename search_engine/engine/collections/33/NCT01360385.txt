      The CRUISE study has shown a remarkable positive effect of 6 monthly injections intravitreal
      Ranibizumab on visual function in eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO. Eyes with CRVO
      are at risk of severe complications to retinal ischemia, particularly proliferative
      retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma. It is not known whether intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy
      ameliorates or aggravates retinal ischemia and thus the risk of ischemic complications is
      unknown. Since complications to retinal ischemia take time to develop, and are relatively
      infrequent, the CRUISE study was not designed, or powered, to investigate the impact of
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on these complications.

      The Oxymap oximeter allows objective non-invasive measurement of the oxygen saturation in
      retinal vessels and thus the degree of retinal ischemia. The rationale behind the present
      study is to use this instrument in order to obtain preliminary information on the effects of
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on retinal ischemia in CRVO eyes without having to wait for
      ischemic complications to arise in a large study population.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with intravitreal
      Ranibizumab on the retinal oxygen saturation in eyes with newly diagnosed central retinal
      vein occlusion (CRVO),

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of intravitreal Ranibizumab on visual
      acuity and central retinal thickness in eyes with different degree of ischemia.

      Study design

      The research project is a case-series study of CRVO-patients with three monthly injections of
      Ranibizumab and a 3 month follow-up period, during which Ranibizumab injections are provided
      as needed.
