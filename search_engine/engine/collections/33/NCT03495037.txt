      individuals have an elevated risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or dementia.
      Many of these individuals report difficulties with complex activities of daily living.

      RWST aims to reduce these difficulties in everyday life by providing a meta-cognitive
      training approach that compensates for age-related executive changes. The approach is
      provided within the context of individually identified everyday-life difficulties.

      The psycho-education approach is a Brain-Health Workshop supplemented by intellectually
      stimulating activities such as doing Sudoku and/or word searches. This approach provides
      information people may use to inform health behaviour changes.
