      including medical students, non-medical students and general populations four different
      protocols of CPR training were applied and their efficacy were compared between the groups.
      Meanwhile, 12 months after the study course, 460 participants from three groups were asked to
      take part in a theoretical and practical exam to evaluate the long term efficacy of the four
      protocols.
