      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in patients with chronic hepatitis C in Japan. The primary
      objectives of this study are to verify the superiority of efficacy of UDCA 600 or 900mg/day
      to that of 150mg/day and the safety of UDCA treatment. The primary endpoint was percent
      changes of serum alanine aminotransferase(ALT) levels at 24-week of administration compared
      to pre-administration levels and secondary endpoints, serum aspartate aminotransferase(AST)
      and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase(gamma-GTP) levels. Further, changes of bile acid composition
      and HCV-RNA levels at 24-week of administration were examined.
