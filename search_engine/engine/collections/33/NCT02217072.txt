    
      A Randomized controlled study of two different educational support interventions developed
      for children in foster care (age 6-13). One intervention is school-based and involves a team
      of professionals at the child's school, and the other is a home-based tutoring intervention
      provided by the foster parents. The participants in the study are assigned to three groups
      (the two intervention groups and control group). Based on power calculation we aim to recruit
      approximately 180-200 foster children, their foster parents and public schools to participate
      in the study.
