    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab and palliative
      radiation therapy in patients with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head
      and neck previously exposed to an anti PD-1 or PDL-1 monoclonal antibody.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure objective response rates based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1. criteria in patients receiving the durvalumab, tremelimumab and palliative
      radiation therapy (RT) combination.

      II. Determine overall and progression free survival in patients enrolled in the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on
      day 1, week 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 cycles or every 6 weeks for up to
      3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then
      receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1, week 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      up to 9 cycles or every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy using either
      hypofractionated, image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) over 3 fractions every other day (QOD) during week 3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and
      10 months, and then every 12 months.
