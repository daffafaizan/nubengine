    
      This study is a 10-week open-label EPA+DHA treatment trial in adolescent (aged 12-18 years)
      patients with major depressive disorder exhibiting partial response to SSRI medications.
      After a screening visit, patients were randomized (stratified by gender) to open-label fish
      oil supplements at a fixed dose of either 2.4 g/day or 15 g/day (2 tablespoons/day) for 10
      weeks.

      A physical examination, a complete blood count (CBC), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
      levels were determined at baseline and Week 10, and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure,
      weight, height, body mass index, temperature) were obtained at each visit. At each visit,
      safety and tolerability were assessed using a structured side effect interview, the Side
      Effects Form for Children and Adolescents.

      At baseline and all weekly visits, depression symptom severity was determined with the
      Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), a 17-item observer-rated questionnaire,
      and remission was defined as a CDRS-R score of â‰¥28. If a patient's depressive symptoms
      worsened over the course of the trial (defined as 30% worsening relative to baseline on two
      consecutive visits using CDRS-R scores), they were withdrawn from the study. In view of the
      potential risk for developing hypomanic symptoms following LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation,
      manic symptom severity was monitored over the course of the trial with the Young Mania Rating
      Scale (YMRS), an 11-item observer-rated questionnaire.

      fMRI scans were performed at baseline and at 10 weeks.
