        -  Determine the relationship between the level of EF5 binding and pretreatment hemoglobin
           level, tumor size, and stage of disease in patients with stage IIB, IIIB, or IVA
           cervical cancer.

        -  Determine whether pretreatment tumor hypoxia (measured by EF5 binding) is associated
           with overall survival, progression-free interval, and local control in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between EF5 binding and CD-31 labeling (tumor vasculature)
           and Ki-67 labeling (cellular proliferation) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1. Tumor hypoxia is measured using
      immunohistochemical techniques. Biopsies are collected 1-2 days later. Blood is collected
      before EF5 is administered and again at the time of surgery.

      Patients are followed approximately 1 month after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
