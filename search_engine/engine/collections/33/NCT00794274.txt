      will include two centers (University of Cincinnati and Medical University of South Carolina).
      The study will evaluate patients with chronic disease who are on a stable treatment regimen
      and have no significant change in their Sarcoidosis Skin Activity and Severity Index score
      (SASI) at two visits at least one month apart.
