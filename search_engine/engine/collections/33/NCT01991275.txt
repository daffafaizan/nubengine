      prostatectomy is becoming the most popular surgical method for prostate cancer. The small
      incision after robot-assisted prostatectomy is thought to reduce the postoperative pain.
      There is few investigations for the strategy to reduce the postoperative pain of
      robot-assisted prostatectomy.

      The intrathecal morphine injection is known to reduce postoperative pain for surgeries like
      hepatectomy, myomectomy and open prostatectomy. This method, however, is not yet studied for
      the robot-assisted prostatectomy. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of
      intrathecal morphine for the patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy.
