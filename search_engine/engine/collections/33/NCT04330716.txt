      education methods on the level of participation in genetic testing for hereditary cancer
      risk. A prospective study examines outcomes before the development of a disease.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization and a
           series of questionnaires.

        -  Participants will be randomized, or assigned by chance, to one of two methods of
           pre-genetic test education and after completing either pre-test education participants
           will be offered the opportunity to have genetic testing performed

      Two methods of pre-genetic test education:

        -  video education

        -  in-person counseling

        -  Genetic testing will be performed by blood draw.

        -  It is expected that 500 people will participate in this study

        -  Participants will be in the research study for up to 5 yrs after enrollment
