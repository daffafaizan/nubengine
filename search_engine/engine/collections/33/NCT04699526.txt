      (UPC) training for Peruvian school administrators and teachers to reduce substance use among
      students. Twenty-eight schools were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions
      (14 per condition). Prevention leadership action teams were formed at intervention schools to
      implement evidence-based school policies and positive school climate activities, and a
      classroom substance use prevention curriculum. Substance use outcomes were assessed with
      repeated cross-sectional samples of students in 2018 and 2019. Multi-level analyses were
      conducted to assess intervention effects on students' substance use and related problems.
