    
      This study is a pilot phase 1, randomized, double-blind, two-arm, parallel group, single-dose
      study, which is designed to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, PK and PD of CT-P41 and
      EU-approved Prolia in healthy male subjects. Approximately 30 male subjects will be enrolled
      and randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. In each treatment
      group, all subjects will receive a single 60 mg dose of either CT P41 or EU-approved Prolia
      by subcutaneous injection via a PFS on Day 1, followed by 134 days of safety, immunogenicity,
      PK, and PD measurements.
