      an important mediator of chemoresistance in AML. Although a number of receptor / ligand pairs
      have been implicated, the CXCR4 / SDF-1 axis functions as the principal regulator of homing
      and retention of both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells in the marrow. AMD3100 is a
      bicyclam molecule which reversibly blocks CXCR4 binding to SDF-1 and is being developed
      clinically as a mobilization agent for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Preclinical
      data from our group has demonstrated that in murine models, plerixafor can disrupt the
      interaction of leukemic cells with the marrow microenvironment and sensitize blasts to the
      effect of chemotherapy. Based on these data, we have initiated a phase I/II study in patients
      with relapsed or refractory AML in which plerixafor is administered prior to salvage
      chemotherapy.
