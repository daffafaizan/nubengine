      tomography) angiography including a coronary calcium score, at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of patients will be
      collected. Peripheral venous blood sampling will take place on this occasion. Coronary artery
      calcification scores will be estimated by a Radiologist using default software. Patients
      eligible for the bone metabolism substudy will be required to attend the University of Surrey
      for peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) of bone mineral composition of the
      radius. In the intervening period we will ask them to complete a 4-day food diary and wear a
      UV dosimeter, the latter to assess typical UV exposure, for one week.
