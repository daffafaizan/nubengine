    
      Phase I, open label, multi-center dose escalation (DEP) and dose expansion (EXP) study
      designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK (pharmacokinetics), PD (pharmacodynamics) and
      anti-tumor effects of ALRN-6924 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or advanced
      myelodysplastic syndrome with wild-type (WT) TP53. ALRN-6924 is a stabilized cell-permeating
      peptide designed to disrupt interaction between the p53 tumor suppression protein and its
      endogenous inhibitors murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX)

      Men and women 18 years of age and older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or
      advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and for which standard treatment(s) are not available or
      are no longer effective can be enrolled. Treatment of patients in the DEP and EXP phases will
      continue in the study until documentation of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      patient or physician decision to discontinue study participation is made.
