      the inflammation in participants presenting with active scleritis. This will be performed
      using an open-label pilot study. Subjects will receive 5mg/kg intravenous infusions of
      infliximab at 0, 2, 6 and 10 weeks. After these initial infusions, participants may contine
      to receive 5 mg/kg dose infusions or may receive 8 mg/kg dose infusions depending on the
      treamtent response. Treatment response is defined as a decrease in inflammation by at least 2
      steps on the scale of grades 0-4 , or a decrease to 0 assessed at week 14. A combination of
      thse two dose infusions (5 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) will be given for the remainder of the study
      according to set schedules. The primary outcome will be the ability to control active
      scleritis defined as at least a 2-step decrease in sleral inflammation,scleritis within 14
      weeks of initiating infliximab therapy. Secondary outcomes will be the amount of reduction in
      concomitant immunosuppressive medication (measured using the grading scale in Section 4.5.2),
      changes in pain, redness (measured using a visual analogue scale), photophobia, changes in
      visual acuity (changes of 10 letters from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity will be
      considered clinically significant), the typical time between flares, and numbers of flares
      and times between flares while in the study.
