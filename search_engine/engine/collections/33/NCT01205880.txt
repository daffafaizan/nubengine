    
      This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral comparison study. A total of up to 12 subjects
      with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis will be enrolled in this study, so that at least 10
      subjects complete the 4 week trial. These 12 subjects will receive the combination therapy of
      Clobex® Spray and Vectical® Ointment to treat their psoriatic lesions (except those on the
      scalp, face, groin, axillae or other intertriginous areas). Half of the subjects will first
      apply the Clobex® Spray followed by the Vectical ointment to lesions on the right side of
      their bodies, and Vectical® Ointment first followed by Clobex® Spray to the lesions of the
      left side of their bodies. The other half of the subjects will first apply Clobex® Spray
      followed by Vectical® Ointment to the lesions of the left side of their bodies, and Vectical®
      Ointment first followed by Clobex® Spray to the lesions on right side of their bodies.
      Treatment will be applied twice daily for 4 weeks. One target area on each side of the
      subject's body will be chosen for target lesion assessment.

      All subjects will be consented prior to any study evaluations/procedures. Study evaluations
      including Target Lesion Severity Score (TLSS) and photography will be performed at
      Baseline/Day 0, week 2 and week 4.
