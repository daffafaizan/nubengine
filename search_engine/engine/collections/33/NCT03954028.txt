      recruit 12 patients who need gingival soft tissue augmentation. It is a split-mouth design:
      CTG will be used in one side of soft tissue augmentation, and ADM will be used on the other
      side. 3 months after graft healing, clinical measurements including soft tissue thickness,
      transparency visualization, tissue profile record with impression cast study model, and
      digital photography of tissue will be performed. The gingival punch biopsies ( 2mm diameters)
      will be performed in both sides of grafting areas under the local oral anesthesia injection.
      The collected tissue will be split into two halves, one for histological examination, and
      another half for gene analysis.
