      thoracic vertebra T10 and T11 ( there were no enough studies done to test the efficacy,
      safety and impact on the quality of life of radiofrequency thermocoagulation of splanchnic
      nerves at level of T10 ). Aim of the Study is to compare between the efficacy, safety and
      impact on the quality of life of radiofrequency thermocoagulation of bilateral thoracic
      splanchnic nerves at level T10 and T11 vertebra and chemical neurolytic block of them at
      level of T11 vertebra only in the management of upper abdominal cancer pain.
