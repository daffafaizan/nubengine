      I. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
      patients at risk for HCC in a multicenter setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) and determine the
      prevalence of HCC in each CEUS LI-RADS category.

      II. To evaluate inter-reader reliability of CEUS for HCC diagnosis. III. To evaluate
      covariates that might limit diagnostic performance of CEUS for HCC diagnosis.
