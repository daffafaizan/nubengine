      yrs) were enrolled for the study to eliminate bias from confounding factors. They were
      divided into three groups consisting of 20 subjects in each group based on the clinical and
      radiological parameters; Periodontally healthy (Group I), Chronic gingivitis (Group II) and
      chronic periodontitis ( Group IIIa) from whom serum samples were collected. The Group IIIb
      further comprised of the subjects from Group IIIa, who had received non-surgical periodontal
      therapy (scaling and root planing). Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks
      post therapy. Fetuin A and MMP-7 concentration was determined from serum samples of patients
      using ELISA. The results of our study depicted that Fetuin A concentration negatively
      correlates, whereas, MMP7 positively correlates with the extent of periodontal inflammation.
      Further, Periodontal therapy demonstrated a significant increase in serum Fetuin A and
      decrease in MMP 7 levels establishing the influence of periodontal therapy in stabilizing
      their levels.
