      preliminary efficacy of a remote service delivery model for young people living with HIV aged
      13-24 years that will include a monthly service needs assessment and optional delivery of HIV
      treatment services. YPLWH will also be randomized to receive (or not receive) mobile
      check-ins from study staff and access to two-way messaging capabilities to obtain continuous
      support for adherence to ART and COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

      Investigators will also assess the impact of the COVID-19 lock-down orders on multi-level
      factors (individual, socio-behavioral, structural) over time among young people aged 13-24
      years living with HIV (same cohort as above) and without HIV. Particular focus will be given
      to experience and perpetration of gender based violence. In addition, investigators will
      assess the impact of multi-level factors on compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines,
      health service utilization, and engagement in HIV care (YPLWH only). Findings will be
      examined overall and stratified by HIV status and gender.

      Ultimately investigators hope to: (i) determine whether a remote service delivery model will
      help retain young people in HIV care and (ii) Inform the development of an intervention for
      young people in the study communities who may be experiencing GBV and associated outcomes in
      the wake of the pandemic.
