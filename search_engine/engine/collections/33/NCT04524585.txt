      exhibit a very high respiratory drive despite receiving high doses of sedatives.
      Consequently, these patients usually receive full neuromuscular blockade, with the goal to
      avoid such injurious respiratory efforts. Unfortunately, full neuromuscular blockade is not
      without complications. To address this issue, the use of partial neuromuscular blockade has
      been proposed as a strategy to maintain respiratory muscle activity while providing lung
      protective ventilation.

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of safe spontaneous
      breathing using partial NMB in severe ARDS patients supported on VV-ECMO.

      An esophageal balloon and a catheter will be placed. Once adequate sedation has been ensured,
      small boluses of cisatracurium will be administered. Then, an infusion of cisatracurium will
      be started to maintain spontaneous breathing at esophageal pressure swings (Pes) of 3-10 cm
      H2O or selected diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) targets. After establishing a sedation
      and NMB dosing regimen at which safe spontaneous breathing is achieved, we will document
      whether these targets can be maintained over a 24-hour period.
