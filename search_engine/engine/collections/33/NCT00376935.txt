      adults; however, some people on potent ART experience poor recovery of CD4 counts despite
      maximum suppression of viral load. Such uncontrolled HIV infection is associated with the
      reduced ability by the human body to create new T cells (or thymopoiesis). HIV infected
      adults experiencing reduced thymopoiesis are at increased risk of clinical disease
      progression.

      The thymus is the primary site for CD4 cell development; research suggests that keratinocyte
      growth factor (KGF) may enhance thymus activity in individuals who exhibit reduced
      thymopoiesis. Palifermin is a modified version of the naturally occurring KGF that is
      approved to treat people with hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of palifermin in increasing CD4 counts, through enhanced
      thymopoiesis, in treatment-experienced HIV infected adults with suppressed viral loads but
      low CD4 counts.

      This study will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four arms:

        -  Arm A participants will receive placebo

        -  Arm B participants will receive palifermin 20 mcg/kg

        -  Arm C participants will receive palifermin 40 mcg/kg

        -  Arm D participants will receive palifermin 60 mcg/kg

      Participants will receive intravenous doses of their assigned intervention on Days 1, 2, and
      3. All participants must remain on their current ART regimen for the duration of the study.
      ART will not be provided by the study. There will be six study visits, and they will occur at
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24. All visits will include a targeted physical exam and blood and
      urine collection.
