      clinically significant agitation in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients. It will also
      investigate pharmacogenomic, genetic, and clinical predictors of response to citalopram
      therapy. The management of agitation is a major priority in treating patients with AD.
      Non-pharmacologic options have limited effectiveness. Several pharmacologic options have been
      explored, but findings for anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors are
      disappointing or associated with questionable risk-benefit ratio. Better pharmacologic
      options are needed. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show promise as a
      treatment for agitation in AD, based on evidence of a link between agitation and brain
      serotonin system abnormalities in AD patients, and on preliminary clinical data from a
      single-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which citalopram was superior to
      perphenazine and placebo.
