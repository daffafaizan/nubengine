      appears during increased intra-abdominal pressure which can be measured objectively. It is an
      important social and hygienic problem. Its prevalence varies fron 12-55% depending on age,
      and geography. The economic costs of this condition were estimated to reach 24 billion
      dollars in the US in 1995. The objectives of this study are to evaluate two non-invasive
      methods of treatment of stress incontinence.

      Methods: 200 women who chosen from the community and suffering from SI will enter the study
      and will be randomized to one of two arms. The first arm is the Paula method of circular
      muscle exercises: these women will receive private lessons from a registered Paula
      instructor. The system is based on activating circular muscles in the body. The second arm
      will receive instruction in pelvic floor muscle training by a physiotherapist.

      The clinical trial will compare the efficacy of the methods for the treatment of SI. The
      candidates for inclusion in the trial will undergo a gynecological exam and a "Pad Test". The
      efficacy will be measured in terms of changes in the Pad test (quantity of urinary leakage)
      and subjective reports of the participants on leakage, quality of life and sexual function.
