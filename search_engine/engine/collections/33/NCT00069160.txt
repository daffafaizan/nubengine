      Accumulating evidence indicates that in some malignancies P-glycoprotein (Pgp) can confer
      resistance, and that its reversal can improve therapeutic outcome. Clinical trials
      investigating Pgp antagonists have been hampered by the occurrence of unpredictable
      pharmacokinetic interactions, which have required dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic
      agents to avert excessive toxicity. Tariquidar (XR9576) is a new Pgp antagonist that is more
      potent and has prolonged activity. Phase I trials with paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and docetaxel
      have demonstrated that tariquidar (XR9576) has minimal pharmacokinetic interactions while
      surrogate studies have confirmed in vivo inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug transport.This study
      seeks to determine the pharmacokinetic interaction, if any between docetaxel and tariquidar
      and to evaluate the potential for activity in lung, ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian
      tube and cervical cancers. Renal cell cancer has been added in a 3/1/06 amendment. The
      secondary goal is to evaluate the impact of tariquidar on uptake of (99m)Tc-sestamibi in
      recurrent or metastatic tumors of patients with lung, ovarian, renal or cervical cancer.
