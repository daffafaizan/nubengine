    
      BP-C1, solution for injection 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent. Active substance of the product, which
      is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration,
      is a cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic
      acids derived from lignin. The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a
      product with clear and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other
      platinum analogues, e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      In this study BP-C1 will be administered as supportive care to patients with metastatic
      breast cancer (stage IV), who had undergone at least three lines of chemotherapy.

      This study will be open-label, multi-centre with a sequential safety design based on 3-level
      between-patient Response Surface Pathway (RSP) algorithm. The eligible patients will be
      allocated to five independent sequences, with three patients in each sequence. The BP-C1
      treatment period will be 32 days, the follow-up period will be 28 days after the last BP-C1
      dose.
