      veterans with military service related chronic PTSD who have been partial or non-responders
      to antidepressant medications.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Risperidone is safe and well-tolerated in veterans with military
      service related chronic PTSD, and patients will comply with its prescription. As a result,
      patients will show improvement in the secondary consequences of PTSD for the veteran and for
      the VA.

      Intervention: Usual (PTSD) care plus Risperidone vs usual (PTSD) care plus placebo Study
      Abstract: Four hundred veterans with the diagnosis of military-related PTSD will be enrolled
      at 20 VAMC hospitals over a two-year period. An equipoise stratification design will be used
      to randomize patients in a double-blind manner to risperidone or placebo (~200 patients in
      each group) for six months of treatment. Usual care will be provided for all patients for
      treatment of PTSD and other psychiatric and medical disorders. Comparisons between the
      risperidone and placebo groups will be made at the end of six months to answer the primary
      question. The sample size is calculated to give 90% power at the two-sided alpha level of
      0.05 for the overall test for the CAPS score change.

      STUDY UPDATE/NOTES: The study kicked-off in late July 2006 with recruitment expected to begin
      October 1, 2006.

      Oct2006 - Participating sites are seeking approval for the protocol amendment which resulted
      from the Kick-Off meeting. Patient recruitment at each site will begin as soon as they
      receive approval of the amendment.
