    
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) noninvasively measures peripheral tissue oxygen saturation
      (StO2), offering promise as a guide in the early treatment of severe sepsis; however, the
      role and utility of this technology is still evolving.

      There are three main NIRS measurements reported in the literature: continuous StO2
      measurement (StO2 initial), StO2 occlusion slope (StO2 downslope) in response to VOT testing
      and StO2 recovery slope (StO2 upslope) in response to vasoocclusive testing. The purpose of
      this study is to assesses the association of each of these parameters with severity of
      illness, organ dysfunction and death.

      This study will utilize the Hutchinson InSpectra StO2 tissue oxygenation monitor, which is
      FDA approved for use in monitoring patients during circulatory or perfusion examinations of
      skeletal muscle, or when there is a suspicion of compromised circulation.
