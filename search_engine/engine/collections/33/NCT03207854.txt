      immunotherapies (including immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunostimulatory/immunomodulatory
      agents, cellular therapies, stem cell transplantation) and compare to changes in patients
      receiving conventional chemotherapy, targeted-agent therapy, and healthy normal volunteers
      using multiparameter flow cytometry, time-of-flight mass cytometry, cytokine quantification,
      functional analysis of immune cell subsets isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting
      (FACS), and genetic and proteomic techniques (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequencing,
      ribonucleic acid sequence [RNASeq], reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR],
      Western blot).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Optimize methods for measuring functional status of circulating immune cells and
      hematopoietic progenitors (activation, inhibition, cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity).

      II. Use genetic and epigenetic techniques to a) study clonal diversity in T cell subsets b)
      determine the genetic basis for T cell immune reconstitution following stem cell
      transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and healthy normal volunteers undergo collection of peripheral blood samples for
      analysis via flow cytometry, RNASeq, immunohistochemistry, cytometry by time of flight
      (CyTOF) experiments, cell cultures, and functional studies of immune cell subsets obtained by
      FACS. Patients also undergo collection of bone marrow and leukopheresis/leukoreduction
      specimens, and single cell suspensions and bulk excised tumor biopsies are obtained from
      routine testing for analysis via immunohistochemistry or CyTOF.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.
