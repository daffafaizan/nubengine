      financed by AFM is in progress and aims to establish a program of adapted physical training
      performed at the patient's home under supervision. This program was developed in order to try
      to meet the two following requirements: 1) to be compatible with the daily
      professional/social activity of patients so it can be integrated in their life routine; 2) to
      be intense enough so functional benefits can be induced. The first phase is a controlled and
      randomized study where patients with FSHD participate in a 6-months supervised training
      program combining aerobic and strength training sessions on an ergocycle.

      This second phase of our research project aims to evaluate whether a long-term integration of
      this adapted training program into patients' lifestyle is possible. The same tools, same
      method and same measurements of training program will be used with remote monitoring, less
      frequent as it was in the first phase, over a period of 24 months. This second experimental
      work will also be based on multi-factorial evaluations, i.e. biological, physiological,
      functional, and quality of life questionnaires and remains collaboration between Universities
      of Saint Etienne (L. Féasson), Grenoble (B Wuyam) and Örebro (F Kadi) within the Rhône-Alpes
      Reference Centre for Rare Neuromuscular Diseases (JC Antoine).
