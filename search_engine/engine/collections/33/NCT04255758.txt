      extract waste metabolites. Glymphatic system function (healthy glymphatic flow) may prevent
      accumulation of harmful substances and therefore slow down the onset of neurodegenerative
      diseases.

      The hypothesis is, that glymphatic flow could be increased through exercise and enhanced
      cerebral arterial pulsality, which might explain some of the brain health benefits of
      exercise proven in epidemiological studies. This study indirectly investigates the acute
      changes in the glymphatic flow acutely after aerobic exercise using MREG that measures pulse
      wave propagation as an indirect surrogate marker for glymphatic flow.

      Twenty healthy subjects (n=20, 10 male, 10 female, age 18-45 years) will perform 25 minute
      70%VO2max cycle ergometry exercise. The glymphatic flow and cerebral perfusion will be
      measured using magnetic resonance imaging sequences before and after exercise. The glymphatic
      flow is measured using 10 Hz fMRI technique called magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG).
      In addition, perfusion MRI is used to evaluate changes in brain perfusion.
