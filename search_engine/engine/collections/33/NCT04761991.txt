      provides excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value, enabling the safe exclusion of
      significant CAD. However, its positive predictive value remains suboptimal (c.50%).
      Undertaking additional CT-FFR improves specificity and positive predictive value, reducing
      unnecessary invasive coronary angiography. It has been established that CMR perfusion imaging
      offers excellent diagnostic accuracy for the identification of functionally significant
      coronary artery disease. The diagnostic performance of qualitative CMR perfusion assessment
      may be further enhanced by additional quantitative assessment. The purpose of this
      prospective observational study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of all three
      modalities (CT-FFR and qualitative and quantitative CMR perfusion imaging), involving 300
      patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred for invasive coronary angiography. A
      subset of 167 subjects will undergo an additional accelerated CMR scan for comparison.
      Invasively measured fractional flow reserve (FFR) will serve as the reference standard.
