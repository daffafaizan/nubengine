      there are few RCTs of ARBs in COVID-19. Guo and colleagues' meta-analysis showed that
      ARBs/ACE inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality[29]. Our structured literature
      review (Cheng et al., submitted) shows that SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that bind ACE2 cause
      acute cardiac injury in nearly 50% of cases. Safety concerns of ARBs in COVID-19 arise
      because ARBs increase cardiac ACE2[30], potentially increasing SARS-CoV-2 cellular uptake and
      worsening outcomes. On the other hand, ARBs block the effects of excess angiotensin II and
      could be beneficial. Our proposed ARBs CORONA II Phase 3 RCT will establish whether losartan
      can decrease mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Primary - Losartan (25 to 50 to 100 mg daily) decreases mortality and is safe in hospitalized
      COVID-19 infected adults compared to standard of care.

      Secondary - ACE pathway proteins (aka RAS components) (ATI, AT1-7, ATII, ACE and ACE2
      levels), cytokines and metabolomics/proteomics predict mortality and efficacy of losartan in
      hospitalized COVID-19 adults

      RESEARCH DESIGN: We will assess losartan (25-50-100 mg daily) vs. usual care for safety and
      efficacy in decreasing organ dysfunction and mortality of hospitalized adults with COVID-19.
