      methylprednisolone on the relapse risk in the PP period in MS, these data have to be
      confirmed by a larger study. The impact of such a strategy remains also uncertain concerning
      the risk of long term disability. In this project, the investigators will also analyze the
      influence of the delay of DMD reintroduction after delivery on the relapse risk but also on
      the risk of disability. The results will have an important role in the therapeutic management
      of the post-partum period in MS patients.
