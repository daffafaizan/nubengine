      posing a considerable burden on health care systems globally. The disease is characterized by
      inflammation of the airways with eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, airway
      epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and other cells, by airflow obstruction and by
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The disease is triggered by multiple gene-environment
      interactions. Asthma heterogeneity is recognized in terms of clinical phenotypes of asthma
      whereby classic asthma (CA) and cough variant asthma (CVA) are identified. classic asthma is
      a common phenotype of asthma that presents episodic dyspnoea and wheezing with or without
      cough. Cough variant asthma is a phenotype of asthma that presents solely cause of chronic
      cough.

      Eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) is a common cause of chronic cough, which like eosinophils
      asthma is characterized by airway eosinophilic inflammation, but unlike asthma there is no
      airway hyperresponsiveness or variable airflow obstruction.

      Improvement of disease diagnosis and management require a better understanding of disease
      heterogeneity. A useful biomarker for phenotype recognition will represent underlying
      pathologic mechanisms of disease, marking heterogeneity and guiding personalized treatment
      approaches. Our hypothesis was that the different clinical manifestos in patients with
      eosinophilic bronchitis, classic asthma, and cough-variant asthma could be caused by
      differential gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      differential inflammation profiles and other aspects.
