      defects and air trapping. Some of these defects are persistent, while others can be provoked
      with virus-induced exacerbations or bronchial challenge and recur in the same general areas
      on repeated challenge, suggesting localized airway dysfunction. In preliminary studies,
      inflammatory parameters tended to be more prominent in segments that showed ventilation
      defects on imaging. Therefore, we hypothesize that asthma exacerbations, in some patients,
      are associated with incomplete recovery and activation of airway inflammatory cells in a
      regional distribution. This leads to enhanced airway injury with airway dysfunction as
      reflected by ventilation defects and air trapping, and a more generalized increase in disease
      severity. To evaluate this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1. To refine
      phenotyping of severe asthma using new variables from multiple domains in a large
      longitudinal patient cohort; and to determine the contribution of asthma exacerbations to
      disease progression. 2. To characterize regional obstructive patterns at baseline and their
      relationship to changes in pulmonary function; and to determine how incremental changes in
      regional airway dysfunction after asthma exacerbations may contribute to severe asthma. 3. To
      determine the contribution of established and novel biomarkers (YKL-40, vWF, & P-selectin),
      in refining the severe asthma phenotypes and the role of inflammatory cells in causing airway
      injury following virus-induced asthma exacerbations with subsequent development of
      ventilation defects.
