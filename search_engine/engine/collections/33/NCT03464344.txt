      will be enrolled within 30 days after ICH onset. Brain MRI performed at baseline will be
      analyzed blinded to clinical data. Patients with presence of cSS will be compared with those
      without cSS.

      During a systematic follow-up of 24 months, patients will undergo neurological,
      neuropsychological and MRI evaluation. The investigators will compare the rate of recurrent
      symptomatic ICH at 24 months in patients with vs. without cSS.
