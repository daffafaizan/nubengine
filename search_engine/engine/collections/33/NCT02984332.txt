      quadriceps muscle volume and muscle protein synthesis rates. Participants wore a leg brace on
      one leg and ambulated on crutches during the immobilization period. Thirteen healthy young
      males were recruited to undertake this study.

      It is currently understood that unilateral leg immobilization will result in a reduction in
      muscle size (Berg et al., 1996, Wall et al., 2015) and muscle protein synthesis rates after a
      period of disuse (de Boer et al., 2015, Glover et al., 2008). Recent research in this area
      has shown that even short term periods of leg immobilization (i.e. <1 week) will result in
      reductions in muscle size and muscle protein synthesis rates after the period of disuse (Wall
      et al., 2015). However we currently do not have detailed information on how muscle disuse
      affects muscle size and muscle protein synthesis over time during short term disuse (e.g. the
      first week).

      The stable isotope tracer deuterium oxide (D2O) will be applied to assess cumulative muscle
      protein synthesis between days 0-2, 2-7 and 0-7 of the immobilization period in both the
      immobilized and non immobilized legs. This will be in-conjunction with bilateral vastus
      lateralis muscle biopsies before and after 2 and 7 days of immobilization. Furthremore,
      quadriceps muscle volume was assessed via MRI scans that again occured before and after 2 and
      7 days of immobilization. To gain a mechanistic insight on the molecular changes during
      disuse a custom designed 48 well Taqman low density microarray genecard was applied to assess
      the transcriptional response on genes involved in muscle protein synthesis and breakdown.
