      with excessive scaling due to hyperproliferating keratinocytes, infiltrating granulocytes,
      and a dense mononuclear infiltrate with activated T cells. To date, no one mechanism has been
      explanatory for the panoply of changes that occur in both the dermis and epidermis of
      psoriasis patients. Several key findings have shown that cutaneous T cells play a key role in
      the propagation of the disease; memory-type T cells home to the skin, specifically due to
      expression of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), and are the main effector cells in
      psoriatic tissue responsible for the production of cytokines that result in exacerbated
      cutaneous inflammation. T cell recruitment is thought to occur in psoriasis, in part, as a
      result of cytokine and chemokine release from keratinocytes, macrophages, and endothelial
      cells. CLA-positive T cells migrate into the tissues where memory-effector T cells are
      activated and expand. This migration is critical to maintenance of the psoriasis lesions,
      because anti-LFA-1 antibodies (efalizumab) are effective in treating psoriasis, resulting in
      blood lymphocytosis and tissue depletion of T cells. Despite many years of using UVB
      phototherapy in the treatment of psoriasis, its mechanism of action is based mainly on in
      vitro exposures of isolated cells and on extrapolations from UV effects on normal skin, with
      little direct data from lesional skin.

      Previously, our studies determined optimal single efficacious dose using the Excimer laser,
      refined the mechanism of UVB action in psoriasis, developed key cytokine quantitative meth
      -ods to assess targeted mRNA levels in psoriatic tissue after treatment, demonstrated that
      regulatory T cells from psoriasis tissue and blood appear to have a functional defect, and
      demonstrated that UVA component of solar radiation is a critical and significant contributor
      to UV-induced in vivo immuno-suppression. All of these previous findings lead us to our
      current hypothesis that direct selective apoptotic effects on the T mem/Teff cells may result
      in decreased APC activation and IL-12 over-riding of Treg suppression and a re-balanced
      Tre:Tmem/eff cell ratio which in turn may have a sustained remittive effect (high duration
      multi-month clearing of a psoriasis lesion after a single UVB laser light treatment.)
