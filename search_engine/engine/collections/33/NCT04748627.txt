      patients and environmental factors associated with IBD in 29 regions globally. Via the web
      registration, investigators intend to form a new prospective, uniformly diagnosed,
      population-based inception cohort of patients with IBD. Physicians, gastroenterologists,
      family doctors, surgeons and pathologists in the study area will be notified repeatedly about
      the study by letter, telephone, internet, personal visit of the investigators, and encouraged
      to inform investigators of every possible new case of IBD. Endoscopic, pathology and
      radiology records will be canvassed repeatedly for likely cases, both electronically and
      manually. By these methods, investigators intend to capture over 90% of possible cases. All
      patients are required to meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD on the basis of clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic or radiological evidence or mucosal biopsies. Infectious
      gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, entamoeba and cancer have to be ruled out. The web-based
      database application will be used for online registration of the various registration forms
      and questionnaires and the database is located on a central secured server. With the data
      collected, an online interactive atlas will be created which allows the community to
      visualize the most up-to-date epidemiology of IBD with the aims to promotes knowledge
      translation and research endeavours of stakeholders and provide infrastructure, resources,
      and expertise to define Crohn's disease burden in regions of the world where the disease is
      emerging.
