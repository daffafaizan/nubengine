      Changes in the planned statistical analysis, November 9, 2015 The original plan for
      statistical analysis was published in; Askim T, Langhammer B, Ihle-Hansen H, Magnussen J,

      Original plan for statistical analysis Reporting will follow the CONSORT statement for
      parallel group randomized trials [40]. Descriptive statistics will be performed in order to
      present the population and the characteristic of the two groups. All analyses will be
      analysed as intention-to-treat analysis according to the CONSORT instructions. Analysis of
      covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to study differences between groups according to the primary
      endpoint, motor assessment scale at 18 months after inclusion. The ANCOVA model will include
      stroke severity, age, pre stroke disability, treatment group, and motor function at baseline
      as covariates. Mann-Whitney U test will be used for secondary data not being normal
      distributed. In all analyses we will control for potential confounding factors, investigate
      effect modifications, and present both unadjusted and adjusted effects with 95% confidence
      intervals.

      Subanalysis will be performed according to the stratification variables (stroke severity, age
      above 80 and recruitment site) to explore trends within subgroups of patients.

      Mann-Whitney U test will be used for secondary data not being normal distributed.

      Subanalysis will be performed according to the stratification variables (stroke severity, age
      above 80 and recruitment site), gender, and cognitive status (Mini Mental State below 25), to
      explore trends within subgroups of patients.

      Missing values will be handled using single imputation (typically for items on instrument
      scales), or by multiple imputation, as appropriate.
