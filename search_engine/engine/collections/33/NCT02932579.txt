      the important role of genes and different phenotypes/genotypes that make each individual
      unique in pain responses, including drug biotransformation, transportation, and drug-related
      side effects to name a few.Thus, recognizing the genetic profile of each individual prior to
      the prescription of pain medication for postoperative dental pain management will be
      essential to provide a more effective and safer pain therapy.Additionally, we suggest that
      80% of the individuals in the general population exhibit a genetic profile that influence a
      normal pain response to non-opioid pain therapies. Hence we postulate that the integration of
      a pharmacogenomic testing to guide the prescription of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, not only,
      could lead to improved clinical postoperative dental pain outcomes, but also, significantly
      reduce opioid analgesics prescriptions by dentists.
