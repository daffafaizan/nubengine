      prevalence is approximately 1% in the general population but symptomatic patients are rarer
      (0.01%). It is caused by a partial or total quantitative deficiency (type 1 and type 3) or by
      a qualitative defect (type 2) of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric protein that
      is required for platelet adhesion and serves as factor VIII (FVIII) carrier. Type 2 VWD is
      further divided in four subgroups (2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N) that are distinguished according to
      the nature of the VWF defect. Most patients with type 1 VWD can be treated with the synthetic
      vasopressin analogue desmopressin (DDAVP; 2-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin), whereas
      patients with type 3 VWD and most patients with type 2 VWD require concentrates containing
      VWF. Plasma-derived FVIII concentrates, which were initially developed for the treatment of
      haemophilia, contain large amounts of VWF and are used in patients for whom DDAVP treatment
      is deemed ineffective or contraindicated. Voncento® (CSL Behring) is a plasma-derived
      FVIII/VWF concentrate registered in France since 2015 for the treatment and prevention of
      bleeding events in patients with inherited VWD. OPALE is an observational study describing
      the use of human coagulation FVIII/VWF concentrate (Voncento®) to treat and prevent bleeding
      episodes in a French cohort of patients with inherited von Willebrand disease in the real
      life settings. The aim of the OPALE study is to describe the efficacy and the safety of
      Voncento® in the prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding.
