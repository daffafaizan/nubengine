      abnormalities, are associated with dynamic disorders, high visceral sensitivity, changes in
      mucosal and immune functions, changes in intestinal flora, and abnormal central nervous
      system regulatory functions. FGIDs are the most common causes of diagnosis and treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases in children. During the past 10 years, new progress has been made
      in the study of various FGIDs in children of different ages. FGIDs Rome Commission of Experts
      revised the relevant diagnostic criteria and officially published the Rome IV criteria for
      pediatric FGIDs in Gastroenterology in 2016. Due to many factors, the epidemiological survey
      data of pediatric FGID are still lacking in China. Whether Rome II, Rome III or Rome IV,
      their diagnostic criteria and epidemiological data were from other countries and regions, so
      their suitability for China's children remains to be verified. This study plans to understand
      the prevalence and clinical characteristics of pediatric functional gastrointestinal
      disorders in mainland China through multi-center investigation and clinical epidemiological
      analysis, to reveal the prevalence characteristics and related factors of functional
      gastrointestinal disorders in children of all ages in mainland China, to establish a
      diagnostic standard system for pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders in mainland
      China, to provide evidence-based basis for the formulation of new Roman standard for
      functional gastrointestinal disorders, and to provide new ideas and treatment basis for the
      diagnosis and treatment of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders.
