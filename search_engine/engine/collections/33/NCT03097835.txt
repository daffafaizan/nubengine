      effectiveness of hyperdiltue Botox® Cosmetic in improving overall skin quality, more
      specifically evenness of skin tone, reduction of pore size and improvement in the appearance
      of preexisting skin scars. The ability of hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic to improve overall skin
      quality is likely optimized when it is injected uniformly in hyper-diluted small aliquots in
      order to "saturate" the dermis. We propose to prepare Botox® Cosmetic in a manner that is
      approximately 4 times more dilute compared to the typical Botox® Cosmetic preparation. A 4x4
      centimeter area located in the mid-cheek adjacent to the nose will be injected with
      hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic. Botox® Cosmetic is not FDA-approved for this use. A maximum of
      15 subjects will participate in this study, all of whom will receive injections of Botox®
      Cosmetic during the course of this study.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-masked study. This means neither
      the study doctor nor participant know the experimental agent (e.g., 0.9% saline solution and
      hyperdiluted Botox® Cosmetic) injected on each side of the patients' faces. The study will
      last for a total of 75 days. Evaluation of the study is based on the analysis of photographic
      images obtained during the study.
