    
      This is a multi-institutional, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      assessing the efficacy of tesamorelin as a therapy to improve functional recovery following
      peripheral nerve injury. Tesamorelin is a drug that stimulates increased production of growth
      hormone, and growth hormone has been shown to improve nerve regeneration and functional
      recovery in animal studies. A total of 36 participants with repaired ulnar nerve lacerations
      will be enrolled, of which 18 will be randomly assigned to receive the study drug and 18 will
      receive the placebo. To avoid bias, the study participants and investigators will be blinded
      to the treatment group assignments. Following enrollment, each participant will have 12
      monthly follow-up visits during which participants will undergo testing to assess recovery.
      Outcome assessments will include clinical exams, MRI, electrodiagnostic studies and
      questionnaires. The total duration of the study is expected to be 4 years.
