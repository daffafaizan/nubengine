      countries. Maternal mortality remains high and many newborns suffer from premature delivery
      and /or gestational growth retardation both in length and in weight accumulation.

      The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished
      populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the
      risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth. However, acceptable supplements and
      delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fortified BEP supplement for
      pregnant and lactating women to improve birth weight, fetal and infant growth.

      This research includes 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1 - part 1: Formative research to identify preferred product types of a fortified
           BEP supplement;

        -  Phase 1 - part 2: Formative research with a 10-week home-feeding trial to determine the
           acceptability of a fortified BEP supplement for longer-term consumption.

        -  Phase 2: A community-based, individually randomized efficacy trial of the fortified BEP
           food supplement including 1,776 pregnant and lactating women aimed at testing 2
           hypothesis: supplementing pregnant and lactating women with a fortified BEP supplement
           will improve fetal growth; improving fetal growth will have a positive effect on health
           and growth during infancy.
