      administered concurrently with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable
      pancreatic or biliary tree tumors. II. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Assess tumor uptake of PCI-0120 (by MRI signal characteristics) in these
      patients. IV. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PCI-0120 in these patients. V.
      Determine the objective response (by radiologic criteria) in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium (PCI-0120).
      Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 15 minutes 3 times weekly concurrently with external beam
      radiotherapy (EBRT) 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. After completion of EBRT and PCI-0120,
      patients may undergo radiotherapy boost for 5 consecutive days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of PCI-0120 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 6-12 patients are treated at the recommended phase II
      dose. The recommended phase II dose is defined as the dose immediately preceding the MTD.
      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-21 patients will be accrued for this study.
