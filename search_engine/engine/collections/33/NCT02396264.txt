      characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. The central
      importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been established by
      several in vivo and in vitro studies. No data are available for the best therapeutical
      approach for metabolic dysfunction of PCOS. In addition, although insulin resistance is a
      crucial pathogenetic factor for PCOS and lifestyle change program improves insulin
      resistance, no available data can also suggest whether non-obese women with PCOS benefit or
      did not from lifestyle change program including diet without calorie-restriction. Although
      there are not studies focused on the effectiveness and safety of Mediterranean diet in PCOS,
      several indirect studies performed in obese and/or insulin resistant subjects, seem to
      suggest a potential role of this diet in PCOS population and, in particular, on long-term
      PCOS-related health risk. In this study, the investigators' purpose is to compare two
      nutritional protocols in order to find the best dietetic approach for improving clinical,
      metabolic and hormonal outcomes in normal weight women with PCOS.
