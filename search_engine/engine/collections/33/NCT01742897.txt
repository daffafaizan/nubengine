    
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), single-arm, prospective
      study (study following participants forward in time) of TTS-fentanyl matrix form in knee
      osteoarthritis participants. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open label
      treatment phase consisting of 2 periods, and an evaluation phase. The first patch will be
      applied on the first day of treatment phase by the investigator, and sufficient patches until
      Day 30 will be provided to the participant with the instructions to apply the patch. The
      TTS-fentanyl dose will normally be increased, if needed by 12.5 microgram per hour taking
      into account the daily dose of supplemental paracetamol required by the participant. Efficacy
      with regard to pain control will be recorded principally by the participant via
      questionnaires in a daily diary. This record will be used to support more detailed
      assessments at study visits on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC) questionnaire. Participants' safety will be monitored.
