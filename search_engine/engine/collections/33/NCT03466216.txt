      confirmed NET, a positive somatostatin analogue scan, and no prior history of PRRT therapy.

      The study will begin with a single ascending dose (SAD) of AlphaMedix™ administered by IV.
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor
      response or DLT. Once tumor response is observed, the study will convert to a Multiple
      Ascending Dose (MAD) regimen. The MAD treatment regimen will start with the previous safe
      cohort's dose and will consist of 3 IV administrations of AlphaMedix™ at 8-week intervals.
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor
      response or DLT.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using
      ascending doses of AlphaMedix™. The secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic
      properties and preliminary effectiveness of AlphaMedix™.
