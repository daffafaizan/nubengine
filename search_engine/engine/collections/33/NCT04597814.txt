      are often increased in interstitial lung disease patients.

      This study was undertaken to investigate the source of these serum tumor markers.We
      hypothesis that these tumor markers are released from the lung.

      The broncholveolr lvge fluid levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen
      19-9 (CA19-9), CA125 were measured in the interstitial lung disease patients before lung
      transplantation. The immunohistochemical test was performed in the specimen lung after lung
      transplantation.
