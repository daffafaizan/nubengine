      traumatic injuries. Administration of vasoactive medications, including norepinephrine, is
      not advocated in North American trauma systems due to the belief that vasopressors will
      worsen clinical outcomes and increase mortality. However, in European trauma systems
      prehospital vasopressor administration is included as part of the guidelines for the
      management of hypotension and hemorrhagic shock. There are multiple physiologic explanations
      for why prehospital vasopressor administration may be useful in patients with traumatic
      shock, such as providing adequate blood pressure to maintain vital signs until arrival at the
      trauma center, allowing adequate organ perfusion in the setting of low blood flow, and
      supplementing decreased hormone production in the later stages of hemorrhagic shock.

      The purpose of this retrospective study is to investigate if prehospital norepinephrine
      administration is associated with decreased mortality in patients with traumatic shock. The
      investigators will collect patient data from previously collected sources of information and
      trauma databases from three separate locations: the TRAUMABase consortium in Paris, France;
      TRENAU trauma database from Grenoble, France; and the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in
      Baltimore, MD, USA. The investigators will perform statistical modeling to propensity score
      match patients that received prehospital vasopressors with patients that did not receive
      prehospital vasopressors and assess the association with 24-hour and 28-day mortality.
