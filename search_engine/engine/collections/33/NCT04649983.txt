      relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are patients who resisted
      anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or with CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, We launch
      such a clinical trial using CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and
      refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22
      targeted CAR-T cell therapy.
