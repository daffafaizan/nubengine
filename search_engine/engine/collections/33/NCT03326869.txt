      from -0.5 to +0.5 D) as well as ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the
      investigation. In the non-delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and inlay implanted
      on the same surgical day. In the delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and
      dissected but the corneal inlay is not implanted. After one to three months, the corneal
      inlay is implanted on a second surgical day.
