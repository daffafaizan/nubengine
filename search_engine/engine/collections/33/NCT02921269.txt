    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity (proportion of patients with objective response by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1] criteria) of
      atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the duration of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To assess safety by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE
      v.5.0).

      III. To describe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as measured
      by objective response, by PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells measured by
      semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      IV. To describe the efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as measured
      by objective response, by intratumoral and peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality and
      tumor infiltrating lymphocyte proportion.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
