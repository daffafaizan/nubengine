      after STEMI and always correlates with a poor prognosis. However, precise and simplified
      assessment of MVD is difficult, especially in the acute phase of STEMI patients. Resent
      studies suggested that FFR could be overestimated when MVD exists. But whether the
      overestimated value of FFR caused by CMR defined microvascular obstruction (MVO) could
      reflect microvascular function is still unclear.

      In the previous study EARLY-MYO-QFR-I, we have demonstrated that the relationship between
      Contrast-enhanced CMR defined MVO and QFR. While angiography images were collected on a
      retrospectively manner, and the study population were selected (STEMI patients with
      spontaneously recanalized culprit vessel before PCI) to verify our hypothesis.

      This phase of study would be a prospective study. We tend to created a new study population
      by a temporary artificial stenosis inside the stent by partially inflating a balloon catheter
      during pharmacologic hyperemia in STEMI patients.
