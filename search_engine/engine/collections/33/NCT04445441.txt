      followed-up until the patient is discharged from the hospital. They will be seen daily during
      the period of their active clinical follow-up at the hospital. At each visit, the medical
      history since the last visit (including treatments taken), signs and symptoms in progress if
      any, will be collected. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected on Day 0, 3, 7 and 14 and
      then on day 21 if he is still positive in order to assess the evolution of the viral load.
      However if until the end of the follow-up on D21 the test is still positive, the sampling
      will be continued until the patient become negative as recommended by the national standard
      of care for the Covid patients management in Burkina Faso.

      In terms of safety, an ECG will be performed on day 0 prior to the treatment administration
      and this will be repeated on day 7 and day 14 and every week until it normalizes or the
      patient will be recommended to see a cardiologist to check the normalization of his ECG after
      discharge from hospital. Adverse events will be recorded including biological parameters
      (biochemistry and hematology) will be monitored, as well as changes in relevant laboratory
      parameters.
