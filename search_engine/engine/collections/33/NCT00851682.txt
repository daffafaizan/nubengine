      imaging will be done on prostates once removed. Results from the final pathology with be
      compared with results of imaging to determine the accuracy of the image analysis in cancer
      localization and staging.

      Brachytherapy patients will undergo an MRI prior to their scheduled procedure. Two areas of
      suspected cancer and two areas without suspected cancer will be prospectively identified
      based on the MRI imaging. At the time of brachytherapy, transrectal needle biopsies will be
      obtained from the previously identified areas. The needle cores will be reviewed by study
      pathologist to determine the accuracy of the image analysis in cancer localization and
      staging.
