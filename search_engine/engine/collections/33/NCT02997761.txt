      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by complete response (CR) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further examine the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-ALL as measured by overall response rate (ORR, defined as CR plus CR
      with incomplete count recovery [CRi]), relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS),
      minimal residual disease (MRD) response, proportion of patients bridged to allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT), and toxicity.
