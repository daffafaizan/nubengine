      shows that only around 50% of cancer patients are able to satisfy estimated protein-calorie
      requirements. It is also emerging a strong correlation between nutritional status,
      particularly body composition, and adherence to active treatment. International guidelines
      suggest that parenteral nutrition (PN) is recommended in malnourished, hypophagic cancer
      patients suffering from gastrointestinal complications or with expected prolonged inadequate
      food intake, when enteral nutrition is not feasible. Although recent trials suggest that
      supplemental PN (SPN) could help to improve the nutritional status of malnourished cancer
      patients, there are no studies on the clinical effects of early SPN in cancer patients at
      nutritional risk receiving first-line chemotherapy.
