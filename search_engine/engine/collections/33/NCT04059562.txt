    
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, non-randomized, exploratory, multi-centre
      pilot study with median progression free survival as primary outcome.

      In total 28 patients (including 3 calculated drop outs and invalid cases) with advanced
      cholangiocellular carcinoma after failure of a gemcitabine based first-line therapy will be
      enrolled at 5 centres.

      To examine the efficacy of a combination therapy of Trifluridine/Tipiracil and Irinotecan in
      patients with advanced, non resectable or metastatic cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma
      after failure to respond to a previous gemcitabine treatment.

      The study will be accompanied by a translational research program:

      Before treatment and after each radiological tumor assessment (Q6W) blood and stool will be
      collected and extensive panels of biomarkers will be accessed.

      Patients will be treated until radiological progression. In average this will be about 4
      months. A follow up is planned every 3 months up to 6 months to asses life quality and
      progression data.
