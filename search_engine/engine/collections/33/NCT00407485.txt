      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent, locoregionally advanced, or
      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with VEGF Trap.

      II. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine
      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the tolerability and
      safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
