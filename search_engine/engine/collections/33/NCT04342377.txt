      process that includes imaging with Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) and Systematic Sampling (SS) of mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) by Endobronchial
      Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). Collectively, the results of these
      staging procedures dictate whether patients will be treated with surgery, radiation and/or
      chemotherapy. Current guidelines for SS through EBUS-TBNA mandate the biopsy of at least 3
      mediastinal LN stations (4R, 4L and 7) in the chest, even if they appear normal on CT and PET
      scan. Despite improvements in diagnostic techniques and safety, LN biopsies remain onerous
      for the patient and costly to our healthcare system. SS is also unreliable, yielding
      inconclusive pathology results in 42.14% of cases, especially for Triple Normal LNs, which
      are LNs that appear normal on PET, and CT, and EBUS. In fact, SS results in mostly negative
      or inconclusive biopsies for Triple Normal LNs, which may be due in part to their very low
      probability (< 6%) of malignancy. As such, the researchers have proposed to replace the
      onerous and unreliable process of SS by a simpler Selective Targeted Sampling (STS) staging
      process. In STS, Triple Normal LNs will not be biopsied, due to the very high negative
      predictive value (NPV) of malignancy. STS follows the simple notion that only LNs that have
      the potential to be malignant should be biopsied, whereas LNs which are very likely benign
      (i.e. Triple Normal LNs) should not be biopsied.
