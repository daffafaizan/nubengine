      inhaled ciclesonide in children with asthma. The study enrolled 1080 patients.

      Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups which were undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study:• Ciclesonide 40 µg, 80 µg or 160 µg • Placebo-
      this is similar to study drug but has no active ingredient. Ciclesonide was inhaled via a
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI with HFA-134a propellant), with or without spacer, once daily in
      the evening throughout the study. All participants were asked to document daily AM and PM
      peak expiratory flow (PEF), daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores and number of puffs
      of rescue medicine in an electronic diary. This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide.
      The overall time to participate in this study was 20 weeks. Participants made multiple visits
      to the clinic plus a final visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
