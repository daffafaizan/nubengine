      age, sex and history of smoking. Similarly, CV events are known causes of mortality in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The investigators propose to
      determine the parameters influencing the evolution of CV risk in a cohort of COPD patients
      followed over 5 years. For this the investigators will study the role of inflammation,
      oxidative stress, and vascular, respiratory and peripheral muscle function parameters.

      In order to study a sufficient number of patients the investigators propose to group data
      from two cohorts: a first cohort of 121 COPD patients that already exists (currently closed
      to inclusions but still undergoing follow-up (NCT00404430)) and a new cohort of 150,
      decompensated or not, COPD patients.

      This study is of major scientific interest and will enable to obtain extremely important
      information to better understand COPD.
