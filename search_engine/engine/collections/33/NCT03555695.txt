      designed for individuals with early to middle stage PD, focused on incorporating upper and
      lower limb movements in multiple directions, increasing awareness throughout the body,
      shifting body weight and rotation, relaxation of the muscles, improving reaction time, using
      complex repetitive actions to improve coordination, footwork training and centered weight
      shifts to help with fall prevention, and striking shields for self-defense and stress relief.

      Before beginning the karate classes, each subject will attend a pre-intervention focus group
      during which subjects will complete an assessment focused on overall mobility, gait, balance,
      mood, and quality of life. Subjects will be prompted to share their thoughts on exercise,
      balance, and mindfulness practices in general and in PD specifically.

      Following the 10 weeks of twice-weekly karate classes, subjects will attend a
      post-intervention assessment and focus group during which the pre-intervention assessments
      will be repeated and the subject's impressions about the karate classes and their
      effectiveness will be measured.

      Finally, the study team will contact subjects 6 months post-intervention to assess continued
      engagement in karate or related activities and again, the subject's quality of life and
      global impression of change.
