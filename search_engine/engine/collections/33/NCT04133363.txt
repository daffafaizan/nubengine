      bone healing following ridge preservation of extraction sockets using either L-PRF/FDBA
      layered technique or L-PRF/FDBA or L-PRF alone in a total of 30 patients (10 in each arm).

      Qualifying participants and defects will be randomized following a computerized permutation
      block to receive either technique on day of surgery. Tooth extraction will be performed with
      a flapless minimally invasive technique, followed by socket grafting with a randomized graft.

      The mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft that will be used in this study will be
      obtained from the same donor, lot and tissue bank to account for variation in age, race,
      gender and related healing potential of different graft sources.

      Bone core biopsies will be harvested at time of implant placement 3 months following socket
      grafting. Bone cores will then undergo histological and histomorphometrical analyses to
      determine qualitative and quantitative healing differences between three treatment groups.

      Clinical measurements are gathered at 2 time points (grating and implant placement) at all
      defects and will be compared for differences.

      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) initial scans are conducted immediately following socket
      grafting and second scans obtained prior to implant placement. Virtual implant planning
      software will be utilized to assess and compare the 2- and 3-dimensional changes for all
      defects.
