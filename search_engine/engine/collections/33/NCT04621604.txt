    
      Anti-PD-1antibodies (iPD-1), nivolumab (NIV) and pembrolizumab (PEM), act by blocking the
      interaction of the PD-1 receptor with its PDL1/PDL-2 ligands, which are overexpressed by
      tumour cells and their microenvironment, thus restoring an effective anti-tumour response.
      NIV and PEM are indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with classical
      LH. They are administered as intravenous infusions on an outpatient basis. The recommended
      dosage for IVN or EMP in LH is based on solid tumour experience and no
      dose-concentration-effect studies have been conducted.

      According to the literature, therapeutic efficacy appears to be highly variable, and could be
      related to differences in treatment exposure.

      Since Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) is a prognostic factor in LH and the clearance of
      iPD-1, and thus exposure to iPD-1, is related to clinical efficacy, we hypothesize that TMTV
      influences the exposure to iPD-1 and thus its therapeutic efficacy.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between TMTV and anti-PD-1 exposure in
      refractory or relapsed LH. Highlighting such a relationship will make it possible to identify
      treatment algorithms according to the initial TMTV with a target plasma concentration defined
      according to the TMTV measurement. New therapeutic biomarkers would thus be highlighted.

      This personalised medicine approach would make it possible to maximise the effect while
      reducing toxicity. This project is a first step in the implementation of a clinical study
      leading to recommendations for anti-PD-1 dose adaptation based on concentration and TMTV.
