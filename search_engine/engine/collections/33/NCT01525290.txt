      time of symptom onset, e.g. due to recognition of stroke symptoms on awakening. Intravenous
      thrombolysis with Alteplase is available as effective and safe treatment of acute stroke
      within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. However, in about 20% of acute stroke patients time of
      symptom onset is unknown. This large group of patients is currently excluded from treatment
      with Alteplase. The objective of the research proposed in the WAKE-UP project is to provide
      effective treatment options for this large group of acute stroke patients.

      WAKE-UP is designed to prove efficacy and safety of MRI-based intravenous thrombolysis with
      Alteplase in patients waking up with stroke symptoms or patients with otherwise unknown
      symptom onset. Patients will be enrolled based on MRI findings indicative of acute ischemic
      stroke less than 4.5 hours of age.
