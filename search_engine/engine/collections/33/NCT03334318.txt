    
      Participants who consent to the study will have an Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro sensor placed
      on the back of their upper arm at their first PERL visit after this ancillary study has begun
      and at all subsequent PERL Visits. The sensor will be continuously worn by participants for
      14 days. At the end of the 14 days, the sensor will be removed and mailed by the participant
      to the Coordinating center. Since subjects are at various stages of the PERL protocol, the
      number of remaining visits at which the CGM will be applied will vary among subjects.

      STUDY AIMS

        1. To assess the effect of glycemic variability, as measured by the coefficient of
           variation of CGM glucose (CV, the ratio of standard deviation and the mean of CGM
           glucose values), on the PERL renal functional endpoint (iohexol GFR at the end of
           study).

        2. To assess the effect of other glycemic parameters measured by CGM (mean glucose, % time
           70-180 mg/dL, % time below 54 mg/dL, % time below 70 mg/dL, % time above 180 mg/dL, %
           time above 250 mg/dL, mean amplitude of glucose excursions [MAGE], low blood glucose
           index [LBGI], high blood glucose index [HBGI]) on the PERL renal functional endpoint.

        3. To assess the relationship between CGM-measured glycemic parameters and HbA1c at various
           levels of renal function.

        4. To compare the effects of CGM metrics on the PERL renal endpoint and the corresponding
           effect of HbA1c.

        5. To assess the effect of allopurinol treatment on all of the different glycemic metrics
           including HbA1c, CV, etc. and on their association with the PERL renal endpoint.
