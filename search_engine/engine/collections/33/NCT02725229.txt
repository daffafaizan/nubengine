      immobilization, insufficient respiratory functions and the inability to cough due to median
      sternotomy. Invasive and noninvasive interventions such as epidural analgesia, local regional
      blockade and the use of intravenous (IV) opioids, are used for postoperative pain management.
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a noninvasive technique that is
      effective for postoperative pain management. It has been demonstrated to produce effective
      analgesia and reduce postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, and it has no side effects. Parasternal local anesthetic infiltration around the
      sternum has been demonstrated to be useful in providing early postoperative analgesia,
      reducing opioid requirements and, therefore, producing a potential positive effect on
      recovery. The present prospective, randomized controlled study included 120 patients, 18 to
      65 years of age, who were scheduled for elective valve repair or coronary artery bypass graft
      (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A random number table was used to randomly
      allocate patients to one of three treatment groups to relieve postoperative pain during the
      first 24 h following median sternotomy: parasternal block group (parasternal block combined
      with levobupivacaine infiltration and PCA(patient controlled analgesia)); TENS group (TENS
      and PCA); or the control group (PCA alone).
