      Intrauterine devices are as efficacious as tubal ligation, require no on-going effort on the
      woman's part to protect her from pregnancy, and are underutilized in the US. We are
      interested in determining whether placement of an intreatuereine device (IUD) at the time of
      confirming the completion of a medical abortion may have similar expulsion and continuation
      rates as IUDs placed after pregnancy (usually a 4-6 week time period). If this is the case,
      women may save the time and effort of yet another clinic visit, as well as have immediate
      protection against pregnancy after their abortion. FDA labeling does not specify or restrict
      time of insertion and therefore this study is in compliance with FDA labeling.
