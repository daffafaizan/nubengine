      infections. Close monitor of serum level is important to ensure its safety and effectiveness.
      So far there is not enough data to support the optimal dose regimen of vancomycin in patients
      on SLEDD-f. In this study, we draw blood levels between 2 doses of vancomycin to determine
      the pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin and fraction removed by SLEDD-f so as to
      determine the most appropriate dose regimen.
