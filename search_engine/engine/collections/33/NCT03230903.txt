      including regular exercise helps patients with severe disability to maintain muscle strength,
      reduce disease symptoms and improve quality of life. However physical therapy programs at
      clinical settings require constant travel which may limit access of patients with mobility
      disability to these services on continuous basis.Technology can allow patients with mobility
      disability exercise at home under supervision of their rehabilitation team. Currently it is
      unclear how effective this approach is. The study aims to demonstrate that the patients who
      were helped by the new technology to exercise at home will have better fitness, less symptoms
      and better quality of life. If so, other patients with significant mobility disability will
      be able to take advantage of this technology. This approach can be extended to people with
      different diseases causing mobility impairment and it can be used not only for physical but
      also for cognitive and occupational rehabilitation.
