      combination with upper extremity training, over the course of a month, to evaluate changes in
      upper extremity function, dexterity, and ability to complete activities of daily living. The
      use of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) has been demonstrated, through human and animal
      studies, to be an effective way of increasing spinal motor excitability and strengthening
      residual synaptic connectivity. AIH utilizes short duration (<2 min) exposures to reduced
      oxygen levels (~10% inspired oxygen), with alternating exposures to air with normal oxygen
      levels (~21% inspired oxygen).

      Previous publications demonstrate that AIH is a safe and effective intervention to modify
      motor function in individual with chronic incomplete spinal cord injuries. The use of AIH has
      been shown to influence the activation in musculature, within 60-120 minutes of
      administration. In addition, when coupling AIH with overground gait training, an increase in
      functional endurance, as evaluated through the 6 minute walk test, and gait speed, as
      evaluated through the 10 meter walk test, were demonstrated. In addition, the use of hypoxic
      training has been studied in healthy individuals and athletes; however, literature examining
      the effect of a single bout of AIH on performance is limited.
