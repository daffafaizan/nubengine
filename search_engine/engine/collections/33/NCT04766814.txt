      ages of 50 - 80 years diagnosed with AF as evidenced by rhythm strips or written
      documentation; 40 healthy women subjects between the ages of 50-80 years and 40 healthy women
      between the ages of 20-30 years.

      Participants will be recruited from the Tulane University Cardiology Clinics and also from
      volunteer research registries. These participants will be asked for consent to draw for
      another 8 ml (1.5 teaspoons) of blood during routine diagnostic blood draws. These blood
      samples will be de-identified by the PI upon receipt and no identifiable information will be
      maintained. Leukocyte subtypes including monocytes, neutrophils and B cells will be isolated
      from blood and DNA extraction will be carried out from the leukocyte subtypes. These
      leukocyte DNA samples will be sent to New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts for DNA
      methylation analysis to identify target regions of epigenetic elements associated with
      upregulation of NLRP3 gene expression that might be related to disease progression with age.
      Real-Time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be carried out at Tulane Research and
      Innovation for Arrhythmia Discoveries (TRIAD) Center, Tulane University School of Medicine
      from RNA extracted from leukocyte subtype to check the level of expression of NLRP3 highly
      associated with inflammation in AF.
