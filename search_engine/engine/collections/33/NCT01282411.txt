      to branch vein occlusion (BRVO), though it has not been shown to be effective for central
      vein occlusion (CRVO). Intravitreal corticosteroids have been shown in many case series to be
      effective at diminishing macular edema secondary to both BRVO and CRVO. Sustained drug
      delivery models have been sought after to relieve the need for frequent injections. Ozurdex
      has recently been found to be effective for the treatment of macular edema following BRVO or
      CRVO and has been approved by the FDA for these indications. The onset of effectiveness and
      duration of action on the anatomic thickness of the retina have not yet been demonstrated. In
      addition, it is uncertain as to when the clinician can label the patient as a responder or
      nonresponder. We also believe this study will help identify patients that may need more
      frequent dosing schedules.
