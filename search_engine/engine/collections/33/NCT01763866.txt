      eligibility. During screening, all participants received subcutaneous placebo corresponding
      to the once monthly dose volume. Participants who completed the screening period and met
      eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 5 open-label statin cohorts (atorvastatin 10 mg
      or 80 mg, rosuvastatin 5 mg or 40 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg) for a 4 week lipid stabilization
      period based on statin therapy at the time of study entry (no statin use vs non-intensive
      statin use vs intensive statin use).

      After the 4-week lipid-stabilization period, eligible patients taking rosuvastatin or
      simvastatin during the lipid-stabilization phase were then randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      groups: evolocumab (140 mg, subcutaneous, every 2 weeks) or matching placebo (subcutaneous,
      every 2 weeks), or evolocumab (420 mg, subcutaneous, monthly) or matching placebo
      (subcutaneous, monthly). Patients taking atorvastatin during the lipid-stabilization phase
      were then randomized to 1 of 6 treatment groups: evolocumab (140 mg, subcutaneous, every 2
      weeks) and placebo (oral, daily), evolocumab (420 mg, subcutaneous, monthly) and placebo
      (oral, daily), placebo (subcutaneous, every 2 weeks) and placebo (oral, daily) or ezetimibe
      (10 mg, oral, daily), or placebo (subcutaneous, monthly) and placebo (oral, daily) or
      ezetimibe (10 mg, oral, daily).

      A participant was considered randomized into the study after successfully completing the
      screening period, meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and undergoing both randomization
      procedures.

      Participants randomized to simvastatin who were taking verapamil or diltiazem prior to
      randomization received simvastatin 10 mg once daily (QD) while participants who were taking
      amlodipine, amiodarone or ranolazine prior to randomization received simvastatin 20 mg QD.
      All other participants randomized to simvastatin received simvastatin 40 mg QD.
