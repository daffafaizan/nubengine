      thereby making it ideal for use in the outpatient setting.

      The proposed Exploratory Development research project is a double-blind randomized controlled
      clinical trial comparing the efficacy of gabapentin to placebo for the outpatient treatment
      of benzodiazepine dependence. The goal of this project is to study the effects of gabapentin
      on the participants' benzodiazepine use in a facilitated taper-to-abstinence model, where
      participants will be actively using benzodiazepines at study entry, gabapentin treatment will
      be introduced, and participants will be counseled to gradually discontinue benzodiazepine use
      over the study period while gabapentin treatment is maintained. A modified version of Medical
      Management will be used to facilitate compliance with study medication and other study
      procedures, and includes clinical instruction for gradually reducing benzodiazepine use 25%
      per week. Benzodiazepines are not prescribed in the proposed study; participants continue to
      obtain benzodiazepines from their own prescribed or nonprescribed sources.
