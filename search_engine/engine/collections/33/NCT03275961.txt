      treatment for major depression using SMART. The intervention will be weekly group therapy
      session of SMART for 8 weeks duration. Once enrolled, participants will complete a Structured
      Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID). The SCID will primarily serve to confirm a diagnosis
      of Major Depressive Disorder. Each study intervention group (3-4 groups) will be composed of
      6-8 research participants per group. There will be no comparison group. The investigators aim
      to assess adherence with goal of 75% completion of the 8 sessions of SMART and of the
      homework assignments. Resilience will be measured with the Connor-Davidson resilience scale.
      Secondary outcomes will include subjective and objective clinical rating scales for major
      depression.
