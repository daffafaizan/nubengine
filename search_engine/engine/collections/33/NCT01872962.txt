    
      Patients Patients with non-keratinizing NPC T3-4N1M0/TxN2-3M0 (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are
      randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy plus CCRT or CCRT alone. Patients in both
      groups receive cisplatin 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, concurrently with
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). IMRT is given as 2.0-2.30 Gy per fraction with five
      daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to a total dose of 66 Gy or greater to the primary
      tumor. The induction chemotherapy plus CCRT group receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) and
      cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for three cycles before CCRT. Our primary endpoint is
      failure-free survival(FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional
      failure-free survival (LR-FFS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS) rates and toxic
      effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the
      safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
