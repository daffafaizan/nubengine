      substantial increase over the past 10 years in Veterans seeking Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) treatment services, the VA system is straining to accommodate these needs, relying
      heavily on group-based treatments. The proposed research will take the next step in the
      literature on group psychotherapy for PTSD by examining a group cognitive behavioral
      treatment (GCBT) program with promising pilot data. This application supports a randomized
      controlled trial, which will compare GCBT with Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP). The
      trial will involve 196 male Veterans with combat-related PTSD who will be randomly assigned
      to GCBT (n= 98) or SGP (n =98) to determine efficacy within a naturalistic care environment.
      Outcome data will be collected pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-, 6- and
      12-month follow-up. Two aims are included, one focusing on outcome with respect to PTSD
      symptom severity, the second focusing on treatment generalization to comorbid emotional
      disorders (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse), and
      distress and impairment. Data will be examined using latent growth curve modeling, with
      emphasis on determining efficacy and effectiveness. The information provided by the proposed
      project could assist in developing more effective care models for individuals with chronic
      PTSD from numerous traumatic experiences. Additionally, this project represents an effort to
      move the literature on group-based treatments for PTSD ahead, through inclusion of advanced
      methodological and analytic approaches.
