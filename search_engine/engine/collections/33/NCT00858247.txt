      internationally. The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last three decades and
      currently 16 % of American adolescents are obese. Nearly 30% of obese adolescents demonstrate
      a metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. These
      abnormalities lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for vitamin D
      insufficiency and up to 80% of obese adults have been found to be insufficient in vitamin D.
      Observational studies in adults have shown consistent associations between low vitamin D
      status and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. There is paucity of
      data on the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and its implications in obese adolescents.
      It is also not known whether treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in children or adults might
      result in improvement in insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors.

      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that vitamin D insufficiency correlates positively with insulin
      resistance and cardiovascular risk in obese adolescents and that vitamin D3 supplementation
      decreases insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in this population.

      Objectives:

        1. Determine if there is any correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and homeostasis model
           assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HDL cholesterol and C-reactive protein, in
           obese adolescents.

        2. Study the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on various parameters reflecting insulin
           action, secretion, lipids and C-reactive protein in obese adolescents.
