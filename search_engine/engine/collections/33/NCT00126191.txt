           disease is defined as one area of disease measuring less than 10cm and a normal blood
           test called LDH (lactate hydrogenase). Patients not fitting the "low risk" criteria are
           considered "high risk".

        -  If the patient has "low risk" disease their treatment cycle consist of three cycles of
           A.

        -  If the patient has "high risk" disease they will receive Cycle A followed by cycle B
           which will then repeat.

        -  Cycle A consists of the drugs: rituximab, cyclophosphamide, oncovin, doxorubicin and
           methotrexate (R-CODOX-M). The treatment cycle is approximately 14 days. A spinal tap is
           performed on day 1 and day 3 of the cycle and the patient will be hospitalized until
           between day 11 and day 13. After the patient's blood counts return to normal(usually
           around day 21),the next round of treatment will occur.

        -  Cycle B consists of the drugs: rituximab, ifosfamide, VP-16 and ara-c (IVAC). The
           treatment cycle is approximately 5 days. A spinal tap is performed on day 4 and once
           blood counts return to normal the patient will start cycle A again.

        -  After the patient has finished the treatments, they will be re-evaluated with CT scans
           and PET scans to determine whether or not they are in remission. Every three months for
           two years, blood tests and CT and PET scans will be performed. Follow up after that will
           be every 6 months for two years.
