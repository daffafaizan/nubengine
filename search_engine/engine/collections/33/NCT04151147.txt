      trial.Randomization was performed by simple coin toss to select the side of CGFs fibrin gel
      placement before the commencement of third molar surgery. In this way, the sides in each
      patient were randomly divided into 2 study groups:

      Group I (test) - with CGFs placed in the extraction socket Group II (control) - without CGFs
      placement All operations were performed under local anesthesia by the same surgeon. An
      envelope flap was raised to provide access. Bone removal was done with the help of stainless
      steel burs. Constant irrigation with saline was used while removing bone to prevent thermal
      necrosis. Third molar was luxated with the help of straight elevator and then extracted with
      the help of third molar forceps. After extraction, any remains of the dental follicle were
      removed and the extraction sockets were irrigated with 60 mL of sterile saline. To prevent
      the flap laceration, bone contouring was also performed under sterile saline irrigation. CGFs
      fibrin gel was then randomly placed into one socket and the opposite side was considered as
      the control. Finally, wound closure was completed with silk suture.

      The primary outcome variable was AO, classified as present or absent.It is characterized by
      postoperative pain in and around the extraction side, which increases in severity within
      first week after the extraction, accompanied by a partially or totally disintegrated blood
      clot within the alveolar socket, with or without halitosis. Other defining symptoms that have
      been reported in the literature are radiating pain towards the temporal region and ear,
      inflamed gingival margin, ipsilateral regional lymphadenopathy and, less commonly, low-grade
      fever.
