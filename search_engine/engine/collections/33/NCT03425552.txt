    
      This study will be a randomized, two-way, two-treatment, two-period, crossover, open label,
      laboratory-blind, multiple dose study at steady state, under fasting conditions.

      To main purpose of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability of Paliperidone
      100 mg prolonged release suspension for injection (Pharmathen S.A, Greece) and XeplionÂ®
      (Paliperidone) 100 mg Prolonged Release Suspension for Injection (Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.,
      Belgium) following multiple Intramuscular Injections (five doses in each period, one dose
      every 28 days) administration to patients with schizophrenia who are already receiving a
      stable regimen of paliperidone prolonged release suspension via the intramuscular route.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability between the
      two products.

      Five injections of Paliperidone 100 mg prolonged release suspension will be administered
      intramuscularly (in the deltoid muscle) to study patients in each period (one injection every
      28 days).

      A total of 70 patients will be randomized into two sequences (Test-Reference or
      Reference-Test).

      The doses will be administered to study patients in each period, according to the
      randomization plan , as clarified in the table below:

      Period I Day 0 First dose Day 28 Second dose Day 56 Third dose Day 84 Fourth dose Day 112
      Fifth Dose

      Period II Day 140 First dose Day 168 Second dose Day 196 Third dose Day 224 Fourth dose Day
      252 Fifth Dose

      Following up the last dose of each period, a series of blood samples will be collected from
      each patient in order to determine the bioavailability of the received drug. More
      specifically, patients will return to the clinical site to give the scheduled PK blood
      samples on Day 113, Day114, Day 115, Day 116, Day 117, Day 118, Day 119, Day 120, Day 121,
      Day 122, Day 123, Day 124, Day 125, Day 126, Day 127, Day 128, Day 129, Day 130, Day 132, Day
      134, Day 136, Day 138, Day 253, Day 254, Day 255, Day 256, Day 257, Day 258, Day 259, Day
      260, Day 261, Day 262, Day 263, Day 264, Day 265, Day 266, Day 267, Day 268, Day 269, Day
