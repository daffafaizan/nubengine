    
      Part 1: The investigators intend to investigate the inter-individual variation in metformin
      Area Under Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC) following a single dose of oral metformin based
      on the plasma concentration of metformin after 3 and 10 hours and urine collection for 24
      hours . Part 2: The investigators intend to contribute with DNA and metformin AUC
      determinations from subjects from part 1 to a major international study that aime to
      highlight the Genome Wide Association (GWA) between the entire genome and variations in
      metformin pharmacokinetics (AUC) in a large group of healthy subjects and patients. Part 3:
      The investigators aim to investigate the potential interaction between codeine and metformin
      in the intestine.

      The investigators secondary objective in part 3 is to investigate if the plasma concentration
      of morphine increases when codeine and metformin are given together due to competitive
      inhibition of the Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) transport protein (in the liver).
      Furthermore, the investigators will measure lactate after metformin ingestion as a proxy for
      metformin's effect on the intestinal mucosa, both after oral and intravenous metformin
