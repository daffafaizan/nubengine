    
      A randomised, controlled, parallel-group, open-label study comparing treatment with the GLP-1
      analogue semaglutide in combination with lifestyle interventions to lifestyle interventions
      alone in obese PWH.

      The study will enroll HIV-1 infected patients ≥ 18 years with BMI ≥30kg/m2 or BMI ≥27kg/m2
      and hypertension, dyslipidaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of semaglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise
      in achieving greater weight loss in obese PWH as compared to diet and exercise alone.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of immune function and HIV viral
           reservoirs in obese PWH.

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of glucose and lipid metabolism in obese
           PWH.

        -  To explore the effect of semaglutide on markers of inflammation and gut microbial
           translocation in obese PWH.

        -  To assess the safety of semaglutide in obese PWH on stable ART.
