    
      This is a phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study assessing the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile, maximum concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC0-t) of
      Triferic iron administered intraperitoneally in chronic kidney disease patients on peritoneal
      dialysis (Continuous Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD) or Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal
      Dialysis (CAPD)).

      Screening can be up to 4 weeks, and the enrollment period is approximately one week. There
      are two treatment (dosing) visits and one follow-up visit during the enrollment period.

      At each treatment visit, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive either a single
      ascending dose of Triferic administered intraperitoneal (IP) during a long (12 hour)
      peritoneal dialysis dwell or a single 6.6 mg dose of Triferic administered IV over 4 hours.
      Blood samples will be obtained at defined times over 12 hours to establish the total serum
      iron PK of IP Triferic as well as the clinical serum iron profile.

      The IP dose of the first Cohort will be 5 mg Triferic iron/liter IP. Subsequent Cohort IP
      doses will be 12.5 mg Triferic iron/liter, and 20 mg Triferic iron/liter, with the final
      Cohort dose to be determined (TBD). The IV dose will be 6.6. mg for all Cohorts. Six patients
      will be enrolled in each Cohort, with enrollment in the subsequent (higher dose) Cohort not
      being initiated until the completion and evaluation of the previous (lower dose) Cohort.
