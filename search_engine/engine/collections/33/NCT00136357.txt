      incorporating mind-body techniques decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress in adolescents.
      Students will be screened for posttraumatic stress using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and
      eighty-two qualifying students will be randomly assigned to a 12-session mind-body group
      program or a wait-list delayed intervention group. The program will be conducted by the
      teachers at a high school in Kosovo and include meditation, biofeedback, drawings, autogenic
      training, genograms, and a variety of movement and breathing techniques. Changes in
      posttraumatic stress symptoms will be measured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire.
