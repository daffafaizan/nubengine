      Newer MR-scan studies indicate that Escitalopram may have an immediate cognitive and
      emotional effect. Patients with high pain catastrophizing are mentally vulnerable and may be
      sensitive to the effects of Escitalopram.

      We therefore investigate the effect of Escitalopram as a perioperative analgesic in this
      group of patients where the pain problem is pronounced.
