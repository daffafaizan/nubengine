      immune cells in peripheral blood and then given back to the patient after amplified in vitro
      that can improve the anti-tumor immune response and is effective treatment of the cancer. Tcm
      cells are effective anti-tumor immune cells that exhibit the long-term survival and
      self-renewal capacity in vivo. Autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy combining surgery or
      chemotherapy could effectively prolong survival period and improve quality of life in
      patients.

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths, which account for one third of all
      deaths due to cancer worldwide. The most common histologic type of lung cancer is
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is accounting for almost 85%. There are no targeted
      therapeutics in patients with high-risk recurrent stage II NSCLC after postoperative
      chemotherapy, therefore, autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy would be a safe and effective
      treatment.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous Tcm cells
      immunotherapy in patients with high-risk recurrent stage II NSCLC after postoperative
      chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the experimental arm to receive 3
      cycles of autologous Tcm cells immunotherapy or to the no intervention arm.
