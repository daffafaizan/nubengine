      receive each treatment for 12 weeks followed by a minimum 4-week wash-out period. During the
      pistachio treatment, participants will consume two ounces per day (57 g) of pistachios as an
      evening snack. During the control phase subjects will be given advice to consume 1-2
      exchanges of carbohydrate as an evening snack, which is consistent with usual care. Markers
      of glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and gut health will be assessed at the
      beginning and the end of each treatment period.
