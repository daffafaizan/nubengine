      within the cement canal. However, some RCTs indicate that maintaining an AP causes
      postoperative pain, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms of pain when
      AP has been performed. We, therefore, would like to conduct a RCT to increase the sample size
      of the previously performed RCTs to do an systematic review.
