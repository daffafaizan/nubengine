      normally resulting in recurrent infections. Children with these disorders are subject to
      recurrent, severe, often life-threatening infections and are hospitalized more frequently
      than their peers. Frequent hospitalization and chronic illness can affect growth,
      development, socialization, and educational opportunities.

      Specifically, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder in which
      phagocytes fail to generate an oxidative burst. In 26 patients followed at the NIH tested for
      behavioral problems at the request of a parent or staff member, we have observed a 23% rate
      of mild mental retardation. However, it is not clear whether this is due to CGD per se or the
      recurrent infections and hospitalizations. We seek to determine the prevalence of cognitive
      disabilities in children with CGD and other leukocyte disorders. We seek to determine whether
      abnormal leukocyte functioning may be related to specific behavioral phenotypes or impaired
      cognitive functioning. We also seek to clarify whether impaired cognitive functioning is
      related to the effects of frequent and prolonged hospitalization or other variables such as
      severity of illness in this population.
