      adult patients with T2D with moderate to extreme obesity (BMI 35-45 kg/m2) and suboptimal
      glycemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7-10%) without significant diabetic
      complications, will be randomized to usual care alone (n=30) or vBloc therapy plus usual care
      (n=30) to assess the superiority of vBloc therapy plus usual care than standard usual care
      alone in improving diabetic control. The vBloc therapy will be delivered through an
      electrical and reversible vagal blocking device (the Maestro Rechargeable System) implanted
      using laparoscopic surgery. The device was approved by the FDA in 2015 for weight loss in
      adults with BMI 40-45 kg/m2, or BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 with one or more obesity-related co-morbid
      conditions. The study will recruit patients over a 12-month period and follow each individual
      for 12-months post intervention. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c at 12-months post
      randomization. The secondary outcomes are changes in weight, waist and hip circumferences,
      blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell health measured through oral glucose
      tolerance testing, dietary intake, eating behaviors, physical activity, quality of life and
      potential circulating biomarkers. Medication use, clinical labs and adverse events will be
      compared as well.
