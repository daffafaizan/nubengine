      years. Children with ASD were randomized to the low FODMAP diet or habitual diet for 2 weeks.
      At baseline and after a two-week intervention period, the parent/caregiver completed the
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
      Gastrointestinal Module. The parent/caregiver also completed a dietary food record, and stool
      consistency/frequency record (three days before start to intervention and the last three days
      of the intervention) of their children.
