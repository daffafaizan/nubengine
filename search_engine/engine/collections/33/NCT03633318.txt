      inclusion body myositis (IBM) will be compared with age and sex matched normal data. Along
      with EIM parameters, clinical outcome measures will be obtained to understand how EIM data
      correlates with these parameters. A focused study to assess muscle health in IBM patients
      through EIM is essential to gather further insight into the potential application of this
      technology as a disease biomarker. Additionally, this investigation will provide critical
      data for the design of a subsequent biomarker validation study.
