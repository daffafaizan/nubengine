      derived human mesenchymal stromal cells for treatment of moderate to severe ARDS in 60
      patients, 40 MSC and 20 placebo, in a 2:1 randomization. This trial is the extension of the
      Phase 1 pilot trial (NCT01775774). Patients were followed daily for adverse events through
      day 28, death or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. Vital status was collected at 6
      and 12 months after study enrollment.
