      countries have this condition. Chronic pain is pain that persists longer than six months. It
      lead to psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, anger and chronic fatigue. It
      decreases life quality, lower self-esteem and decrease work force. Because of these factors
      and the high cost of treatment, it impacts social economics highly. Chronic pain is caused by
      wind-up effect of the nervous system which the inhibitory signals are impaired. The nervous
      systems is therefore tuned up. Mindfulness based pain management helps lower this wind-up
      effect by noticing self, to observe and release stress. It has been proven to alter brain
      activity, enhance self control, improve attention and decrease secretion of stress hormones.
      It decreases pain and allow patients to regain control of life.
