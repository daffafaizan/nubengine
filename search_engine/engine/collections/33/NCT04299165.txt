    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-centered trial carried out at in-patient
      PR-hospital centers in Germany and Switzerland . The interventions will involve use of KAIA
      COPD-app program (Arm 1) or an active comparator i.e. usual care (Arm 2). Patients completing
      an in-hospital PR-Program and consenting to participate in the study will be screened for the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study. After fulfillment of the
      screening requirements, they will be randomized into one of the two arms with parallel group
      assignment in a 1:1 ratio. The training program will be delivered to the participants grouped
      to the arm 1 through KAIA COPD-App and arm 2 as provided in regular recommendations or
      standard of care through the PI. In total, 104 participants will be included to the trial.
      Treatment period will last for 24 weeks. Electronic versions of Questionnaires will be used
      to collect patient reported assessments remotely. The primary outcome measure is the change
      in physical activity of the intervention group in comparison to the control group, measured
      over one week as mean steps per day with the Polar A 370 activity tracker, from baseline (end
      of PR) to 6-months follow-up. The secondary outcome measures are functional exercise
      capacity, health status, sleep quality, exacerbation rate, depression and anxiety symptoms
      assessed at several intervals.

      This study seeks to prove the implications of the Kaia COPD mobile application in COPD
      patients after PR. The app offers educational, exercise training plus activity monitoring and
      motivational program that can be easily implemented in the patient's home-setting enabling
      patients.
