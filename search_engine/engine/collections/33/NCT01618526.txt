      anti-inflammatory effects and to change the composition of the faecal micro flora in the
      colon.

      In this unblinded dietary intervention cross-over study 20 subjects with metabolic syndrome
      are subjected to two types of diet intervention:

        1. a western style diet, WSD, with a low fiber content and

        2. a healthy carbohydrate diet, HCD, a high fiber diet. Between the two 4-weeks diet is a
           wash-out period of four to eight weeks. The participants are subjected to endoscopy with
           tissue samples before and in the end of each intervention. Fecal and blood samples will
           be collected at the same time.

      We hypothesize that a high content of resistent starch and arabinoxylans increases colonic
      butyrate concentration, changes colon's mucosal immune system and the microbiota.

      A small pilot study will be carried out on 12 healthy volunteers in order to obtain a
      reference to participants with metabolic syndrome. The healthy volunteers will be subjected
      to an endoscopy but no dietary intervention.
