      phase to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with HER2 expressed advanced malignant solid tumors
      (phase 1a) and an expanded cohort (phase 1b) to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with metastatic,
      HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary aim of the phase 1a portion of this study is to
      determine the safety and tolerability of FS-1502. The primary aim of the phase 1b portion is
      to demonstrate efficacy.
