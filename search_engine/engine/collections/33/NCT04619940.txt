      shoulder subspecialty outpatient clinic who agreed to participate in the study and 18
      volunteers who had not experienced shoulder pain before enrolled in the study. Participant
      age range was determined as 40-70 years.

      The IHandyÂ® app is a free app with a visual display similar to that of the digital
      inclinometer in terms of digital size. In this study, due to its prevalence in the literature
      and its use in clinics, manual goniometer (gold standard) was chosen to be compared with this
      iPhone application.

      The participants were asked to lie on the bed in supine position with shoulder to be measured
      at the edge of the bed. The measured shoulder was positioned at 90 degrees abduction, 90
      degrees elbow flexion and forearm at neutral position. The participant was asked to bring the
      wrist closer to the bed in the direction of the little finger, and was measured at the angle
      that the shoulder could not move without lifting the arm. In the measurement made with the
      application, the phone was held parallel to the ulna and the value displayed on the screen
      was recorded. The participant were asked to repeat the movement if his/her shoulder lift up
      of bed, straightened his/her elbow, or did anything that would disrupt her movement pattern.

      Each measurement was repeated 3 times and after 2 weeks the control measurements were made by
      repeating 3 times.

      Measurements were conducted separately in different cabinets without seeing each other for
      each participant by 1 physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist and 1 physiotherapist.
      The measurements were recorded in separate locations until all participants were completed.
