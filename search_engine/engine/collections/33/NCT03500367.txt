      in uterine fibroids, which can be used as a target molecule for interventional therapy and
      can provide a new cut-in point for nonoperative treatment. However, the application of mTOR
      inhibitor (sirolimus) in the treatment of uterine fibroids remains blank. Our study was
      designed as a prospective non-randomized open label clinical trial to research its efficacy
      and safety.
