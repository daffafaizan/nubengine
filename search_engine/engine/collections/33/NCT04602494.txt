      smoke, and want to quit. The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study of varenicline up to 1 mg bid for 12 weeks added to 12 weeks of group behavioral and
      texting support specifically designed for teen vaping cessation. The study consists of one
      enrollment visit, one baseline visit, twelve weekly group treatment sessions, and two
      bi-monthly follow up visits at 14 and 16 weeks. At the enrollment visit, participants will
      complete interviews, questionnaires and diagnostic assessments, as well as urine sample and
      vitals. At the baseline visit, participants will complete several interviews, questionnaires,
      provide a saliva sample for cotinine measurement, and be randomized to the varenicline
      treatment group or placebo treatment group. Study staff will distribute varenicline or
      identically appearing placebo with instructions on how to take the study medication at weeks
      0, 2, 4 and 8. Participants will be instructed to all empty and unused study medication at
      each study visit through Week 12. At the weekly treatment meetings, participants will
      participate in cognitive behavioral therapy and complete questionnaires. Follow up visits
      will consist of interviews, questionnaires and a saliva sample.
