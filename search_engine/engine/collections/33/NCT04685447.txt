      patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. After diagnosis, the patients are randomized to
      two different dialysis modalities, expanded HD (HDx), performed by use of a medium cut-off
      membrane, and standard treatment based on the use of a protein-leaking dialyzer (PLD).

      The investigators collect clinical and laboratory data, including circulating pre and
      post-dialysis levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10),
      soluble TLR4 (sTLR4), and interferon-gamma (IFN-g). Samples are collected at diagnosis (T0),
      and one and two weeks after the diagnosis (T7 and T14, respectively). Moreover, lymphocyte
      and immune cell profiles are evaluated.
