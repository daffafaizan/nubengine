      The overarching goal of this patient-centred, mixed-methods, randomized, innovative pragmatic
      trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the WECARE intervention for children aged 3-8 years
      with motor difficulties living in Quebec. The primary objective is to evaluate, in comparison
      to usual care management, the effectiveness of the WECARE program for improving the child's
      performance on parent-identified motor functioning targets. Secondary objective is to
      evaluate the effect of the intervention on children's functioning, parental self-efficacy,
      parental stress, as well as the quality of life of both the parent and child.

      Detailed design: A patient-centred innovative pragmatic randomized controlled trial
      documenting real-world effectiveness of the WECARE intervention, offered to families of
      children with motor difficulties living in Quebec and receiving no public rehabilitation
      services. A primary respondent (i.e., parent or legal guardian) will be identified but the
      whole family will have access to the WECARE intervention.

      This trial was designed according to the latest guidelines on pragmatic trials, using the
      gold-standard CONSORT guidelines, and the TElehealth in CHronic Disease (TECH) conceptual
      framework.
