      of this study is to investigate the immediate effects of sole session of foot medial arch'
      NMES on foot strength, arch stability, static plantar pressure distribution and dynamic
      postural balance. This is the 2nd study to investigate the effect one session as previous
      study showed immediate effect on plantar pressure distribution on the midfoot and durable
      effect at 2 months follow-up. However, no studies investigated the effects on others
      parameters than plantar pressure.The general objective of our study is to question electrical
      stimulation as a modality for foot strengthening to enhance dynamic postural balance and foot
      functions.
