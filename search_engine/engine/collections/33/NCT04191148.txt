    
      Approximately 30 patients 18 years of age or older with a history of urinary tract infection
      or colonization caused by E. coli who have indwelling urinary catheters, or who require
      intermittent catheterization, and/or patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria caused by E. coli
      colonization (≥10^3 CFU/mL) on microbiological diagnosis, without clinical signs or symptoms
      of infection requiring antibiotic treatment will be enrolled. Patients will be screened for
      presence of E. coli colonization (≥10^3 CFU/mL) prior to randomization and evaluated for
      potential bacterial susceptibility to LBP-EC01.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of LBP-EC01. Exploratory
      Objective: To explore the influence of LBP-EC01 on the urinary tract microbiota.
