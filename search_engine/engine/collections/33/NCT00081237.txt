      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of OSI-7904L and oxaliplatin in patients with
           refractory or recurrent advanced colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine a safe dose for this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed by OSI-7904L IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of OSI-7904L and oxaliplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A maximum of 12 patients receive
      treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
