      of 60 refractory ITP adult patients from medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive rituximab (given intravenously at a dose of
      375mg/m(2) weekly for 2 weeks, i.e. Day 1, 8; the others are selected to receive standard
      rituximab treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 cycles, i.e.
      Day 1, 8, 15, 22). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and
      after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report
      the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy compared to conventional rituximab therapy
      for the treatment of adults with steroid-resistant/relapsed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).
