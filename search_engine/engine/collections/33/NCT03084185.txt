      gradient.

      After randomization, patient will be seen at follow up every 3 months to do blood sample and
      every 12 months to undergo hepatic vein pressure gradient , according to the guidelines.

      In addition, metabolomics analysis will be performed at screening and every 3 months. The
      results will be analyzed in relation to emergence of decompensation during follow up period,
      in order to identify specific metabolomics characteristics that may be able to predict
      decompensation.
