      and longitudinal analyses, with the primary study aims of: evaluating how the immune
      deficiency associated with HIV infection influences the lung microbiome and lung function,
      and evaluating changes in lung microbiota over time. The study also aims to characterize the
      microbiome of the lower respiratory tract, determine the relationship between the lower
      respiratory Microbiome and the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract microbiomes,
      evaluate the influence of smoking on the microbiome compared with the influence of smoking on
      pulmonary function and respiratory systems, and to evaluate how Pneumocystis infection
