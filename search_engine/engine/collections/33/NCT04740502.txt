    
      This is an unicentric, retrospective study on patients who underwent surgery for PHP from
      January 2004 to June 2020 at our Department of General and Endocrine surgery, which is a
      tertiary referral centre for parathyroid disease. Ethical approval was released from our
      Local Independent Ethical Committee. Patients involved in the study subjects gave informed
      consent to the work.

      In our study, we included only patients who underwent both US and MIBI preoperatively. The
      exclusion criteria were the association of total or partial thyroidectomy planned
      preoperatively for thyroid disease, reoperative surgery for persistent or recurrent PHP, and
      incomplete data or follow-up.

      The primary aims of this study were:

        -  To identify predictive factors of unclear preoperative localisation studies.

        -  To evaluate if a mini-invasive approach is feasible in this kind of patients,
           considering the incidence of persistent PHP as the main outcome.

      The secondary outcomes were:

        -  To assess the role of IOPTH assay in patients with unclear localisation studies.

        -  To evaluate the accuracy of preoperative localisation studies in our series,
           particularly in patients with discordant or negative US and MIBI scan.
