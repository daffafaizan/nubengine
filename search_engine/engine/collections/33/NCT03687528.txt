      represent between 5% and 10% of patients treated in emergencies. Among them, 90% are minor
      head injury traumas. NICE criteria has been defined to establish patients who need a
      CT-scanner because of a risk of cerebral haemorrhage.

      NICE criteria include several conditions including taking antiplatelet inhibitors. However,
      the real risk of cerebral haemorrhage for theses cases is controversial in litterature. In
      parallel, more and more patients undergoing antiplatelet inhibitor's treatment are seen in
      emergencies after a head injury trauma.

      In routine protocol at the emergency rooms, these patients are seen for a clinical exam and
      next submitted to a CT-scanner. If the clinician can't detect a cerebral haemorrage, the
      patient will return at home.

      This study aims to determine that the absence of no other NICE criteria than antiplatelet
      inhibitors treatment is a sufficient condition to eliminate a cerebral haemorrhage for
      patients with head injury traumas, and conversely, that antiplatelet inhibitors treatment
      would not be by itself an indication for a CT-scanner.

      This is a diagnostic, case-only, prospective, multicenter study with a blinded primary
      outcome measure assessment.

      As described in routine protocol, in this study antiplatelet inhibitor's patients with head
      injury trauma will be seen for a clinical exam and next submitted to a CT-scanner. After a
      month, patient will be called by the clinical center to ask about morbidity and mortality.
      Especially, clinicans will report on the emergence of a cerebral haemorrhage during this
      month.
