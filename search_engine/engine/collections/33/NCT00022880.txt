    
      The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Iodine-131 Anti-B1
      Antibody in patients with CLL. Secondary endpoints include assessment of response rate,
      duration of response, relapse free survival, time to treatment failure, safety, and survival.

      The dose escalation will be started at 35cGy for patients with platelet counts > 100,000
      cells/mm3 (Cohort A) and increased by groups in 10cGy increments until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. Subsequently, patients with platelet counts from 75,000-100,000
      cells/mm3 (Cohort B) will be enrolled starting at 10cGy below the MTD reached in Cohort A and
      the dose will be escalated in 10cGy increments up to the MTD.
