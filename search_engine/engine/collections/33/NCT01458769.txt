      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 sequences, in groups of 4 subjects each. All study drug
      doses, including the comparator, Reyataz, will be administered as single, open-labeled doses
      to subjects after a light meal. There will be a 7-day washout between individual subjects
      doses; that is, dosing will occur on the same day each week.

      Part B evaluations are based on the results of Part A. Part B will further consist of two
      subparts. In the first subpart, low single doses of 2 new isotopologs will be dosed to two
      groups of 4 subjects each, B1 and B2, respectively. Following assessment of safety and
      pharmacokinetics in the first subpart, the second subpart, which consists of three groups of
      8 subjects (B3, B4, B5) each will be dosed. Subjects enrolled in B3, B4, and B5 will
      participate in a 3-way partial crossover study design.

      The objectives will be to compare the PK properties, in healthy male subjects after a light
      meal, of single oral doses of single agent ATV isotopologs or as combinations of two ATV
      isotopologs with the PK properties in the same subjects, after a light meal, of a single dose
      of either 400 mg or 600 mg Reyataz. The safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected. Actual dosing and sampling
      times will be used for analysis.
