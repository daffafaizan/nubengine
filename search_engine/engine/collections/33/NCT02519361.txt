    
      1. Blood samples of elderly patients diagnosed with acute infection (fever and
           leukocytosis) will be collected twice - at admittance to Meir hospital and after
           recovery (24-48 hours without fever and leukocytosis). evidence of infection (chest x
           ray, urine and blood samples) will be collected. participants will be divided to two age
           groups: 65-80 yrs and very old patient >85 yrs, and will be compared to younger patients
           aged 50-65.

        2. Peripheral blood samples will be separated to subpopulations of lymphocytes, monocytes
           and polymorphonuclears, and protein will be extracted.

        3. protein lysates will be separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted for
           phosphorylated and total eIF4E and eIF4G; their regulators: Mnk 1/2, 4EBP1, mTOR and
           targets: cyclin D1, c-Myc, survivin, BCL2, VEGFA, etc.

        4. Paired samples (within each age group) will be analyzed and correlated with clinical
           response of the patients. The source of the infection will also be considered.

        5. Comparison between age groups at admittance and upon recovery will be made (Unpaired).
