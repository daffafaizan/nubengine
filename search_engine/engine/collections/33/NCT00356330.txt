      contraindication to being a relative contraindication for MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla, depending
      on a patient-per-patient risk-benefit-evaluation, which includes an urgent clinical need for
      MR imaging (other imaging modalities non-conclusive) and co-morbidities (especially cardiac
      co-morbidities). At the same time, MR imaging at 3 Tesla is evolving from a research
      application only to an important imaging modality today.

      Using the improved signal-to-noise-ratio, high field MR-Systems with a field strength of 3
      Tesla offer a variety of diagnostic advantages to 1.5 Tesla systems. These advantages lead to
      a higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing, foremost neurological, disorders.

      In this study, we evaluate the safety of MR imaging of the brain in patients with cardiac
      pacemakers at 3T.
