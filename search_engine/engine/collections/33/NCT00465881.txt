      Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System (Abbott Diabetes Care) to obtain
      sufficient longitudinal data in order to develop a method for reporting CGM data in a manner
      that provides clinical information that is not available using conventional SMBG. The
      long-term goad is to determine the manner and degree to which CGM contributes to clinical
      decision-making. Because of the evidence that glucose regulation may be indirectly related to
      blood pressure levels, a second purpose of the study is to monitor variation in BP control by
      means of self-monitored BP.
