      Typical treatments for anxiety in children are SSRI antidepressants. However, these
      medications may accelerate the onset of mania or hypomania in children with a family history
      of bipolar disorder or cause suicidal thinking in children. Studies trying alternative
      treatments to anxiety and possible bipolar disorder in children are needed, to establish
      other methods for treating childhood mental health. These studies can also help with early
      intervention and possible future prevention strategies for bipolar disorder. This study
      involves treating anxious children with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy. They will have
      12 weeks of mindfulness therapy in a group with other children where they will be led by a
      trained group leader, how to pay attention to anxiety cues and react differently.
