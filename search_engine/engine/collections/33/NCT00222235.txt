    
      A double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to examine whether adjunctive treatment
      with glycine or d-cycloserine, compared to placebo, will improve negative symptoms and
      cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia who remain on their normal antipsychotic
      regimen.

      Multicenter, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled parallel-groups clinical trial
      designed to test the hypothesis that interventions (glycine or d-cycloserine) intended to
      increase glutamatergic activity by action at the NMDA receptor will reduce persistant
      negative symptoms and cognitive impairments of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder. After an initial screening phase to establish clinical stability and eligibility,
      patients were assigned to one of three adjunctive treatments (placebo, d-cycloserine or
      glycine)for 16 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients remained on a stable dose of
      antipsychotic therapy (other than clozapine) throughout the study.
