      drugs called steroids may lessen the pain associated from this surgery. This study uses
      Dexamethasone (a corticosteroid), to see if it will help reduce pain, decrease the amount of
      time until the patient can begin to eat or return to normal activity, or increase their
      satisfaction with pain management. In this study the patients will be randomized (computer
      chosen) to receive either the study drug (dexamethasone), or a placebo. The patient will
      start the day before surgery with a single pill. They will then receive the dexamethasone or
      a placebo twice daily for the next four days and then once daily for the next two days for a
      total of seven days. Afterward, they will be asked to complete a questionnaire. The five
      questions ask patients to access the amount of pain they have, how much of their normal diet
      or activity they have returned to, and how much pain medication they have taken. At the next
      follow-up visit they will be asked to complete another questionaire (9 questions) about the
      patient's satisfaction with pain management.
