           breastfeeding medicine curriculum that includes an online unfolding case scenario along
           with telemedicine simulation with a standardized patient (SP) will provide timely,
           skilled lactation support more frequently than residents randomized to an online
           unfolding case scenario followed by traditional didactic breastfeeding case-presentation
           via videoconference.

        2. Establish that online learning via unfolding case scenario and telemedicine simulation
           with a SP will be feasible for family medicine and pediatric residents to complete
           during their newborn nursery rotation.

      Intern and third year residents completing their newborn nursery rotation at UC Davis Medical
      Center will be cluster-randomized by rotation month to receipt of breastfeeding education via
      telesimulation with standardized patient or traditional case-based learning via
      videoconferencing with pediatric faculty. The primary outcome of this study will be the
      translation of clinical lactation skills to the care of breastfeeding mothers and newborns. I
      hypothesize that pediatric and family medicine residents randomized to complete the
      telesimulation with SP will translate their acquired clinical lactation skills to the care of
      breastfeeding mothers and newborns at a greater rate than residents who complete a
      videoconference case-based traditional curriculum discussion with a newborn nursery
      pediatrician.
