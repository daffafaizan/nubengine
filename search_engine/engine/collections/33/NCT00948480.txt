      treatment (usually because of surgical resection of metastases), or whether they had
      objectively measurable disease (OMD) by physical examination or radiologic scans per response
      evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST criteria). Key endpoints were the results of
      delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing to their own irradiated tumor cells,
      event-free survival [death or disease progression], overall survival, and objective tumor
      regression in patients who have measurable disease at the time vaccine therapy was initiated.
      This study was activated in the fall of 2000, and closed to accrual in June 2007.
