      efficiency of three different methods protecting skin deficiencies using adhesive products
      for 4-6 weeks infants. The universe of the study consisted of 4-6 weeks infants in neonatal
      and infants clinics of Giresun Women's and Children's Hospital between the dates of October
      2020-2021. Power analysis was performed through G*Power (v3.1.7) programme in order to
      determine the number of the sample. At the beginning of the study, a pilot study was carried
      out with 15 participants from each of the groups and the effect size was calculated as
      d=0.672 regarding the assessment of skin condition scores and 108 participants in total
      should be included in the study as 36 participants for each groups in order to obtain 80%
      power in the level of Î±=0.05. Block randomization technique is applied in the study as a
      randomization method. "As for data collection "Infant desciption form" and "Neonatal Skin
      Condition Score Scale" is used. The scale is filled by two independent observer via
