      College of Cardiology are expected to raise the prevalence of hypertension in America from
      ~33% to ~46%. A single bout of aerobic exercise produces a prolonged period (up to 24 hours)
      of lowered blood pressure (post-exercise hypotension; PEH). Repeated bouts of aerobic
      exercise results in maintenance of lowered blood pressure, leading to recommendations of
      aerobic exercise for improvement of blood pressure status. However, more than 90% of
      Americans consume more sodium in their diets than is recommended. This is alarming, as excess
      dietary sodium intake expands plasma fluid volume, which may in turn attenuate the reduction
      in BP following exercise. Therefore, the objective of this project is to determine the
      effects of high dietary sodium intake on PEH. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to
      a recommended sodium diet, a high salt diet will attenuate post-exercise hypotension.
