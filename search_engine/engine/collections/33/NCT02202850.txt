      dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 6 independent variables as ASAS
      partial remission, ASAS 5/6, ASAS60, ASAS40, BASDAI50 and ASDAS inactive disease status.

      This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both
      patient groups.

      In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total
      approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50
      completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a
      drop-out rate of 30% over 1 year period.
