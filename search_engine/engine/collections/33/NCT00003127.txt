      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic or recurrent
      epithelial endometrial carcinoma not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy. II. Evaluate
      response (confirmed and unconfirmed partial response and complete response) rate to this
      regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the nature and degree of toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, then amifostine IV over 10 minutes,
      followed fifteen minutes later by carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 28 days. Treatment continues for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 to 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
