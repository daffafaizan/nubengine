      I. Compare the objective response rate and progression-free survival in patients with
      metastatic malignant melanoma treated with bevacizumab with or without low- or high-dose
      interferon alpha.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients
      also receive low-dose interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. Patients also receive high-dose IFN-alpha
      SC on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12. In all arms, treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      restaging at the completion of course 12. Patients with stable disease or a clinical response
      may continue treatment according to their assigned treatment arm for up to 1 year. Patients
      with stable disease after 1 year of treatment with bevacizumab and IFN-alpha (arms I and III)
      may continue to receive bevacizumab alone every 21 days (as in arm II) in the absence of
      disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
