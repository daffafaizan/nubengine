        1. brief medical history and vital signs,

        2. full pulmonary function tests,

        3. proton MRI,

        4. spin-density and/or diffusion weighted Helium-3 MRI.

      Full pulmonary function tests including spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Airwave Oscillometry (AO) will be
      performed according to ATS guidelines. MedGraphics Elite Series, MedGraphics Corporation. St.
      Paul, MN USA and/or nDD EasyOne Spirometer, nDD Medical Technologies Inc. Andover, MA USA
