      a non-pharmacological intervention designed to prevent the incidence of aggression. The
      investigators have created a manual based on prior work and expert input. Recruitment for
      pilot patients is now ready to begin. The purpose of the pilot will be to further adapt the
      intervention, assess feasibility, and examine recruitment options.
