        -  To assess the incidence of clinical malaria meeting the primary case definition in
           children aged 1.5 to 12 years living in the study area over the main transmission season

        -  To assess the occurrence of reinfection following the radical cure of existing
           parasitemia.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the incidence of clinical malaria meeting various secondary cases definition
           in children aged 1.5 to 12 years living in the study area over the main transmission
           season

        -  To measure the immune responses (humoral and cell-mediated) to a panel of malaria
           vaccine candidate antigens

        -  To assess the molecular force of infection

        -  To pilot and standardize malaria morbidity assessment in three phase 2 malaria vaccine
           testing sites.
