      disability, morbidity and dependency in the elderly. This is associated with increased falls,
      fractures, loss of mobility, restricted activities of daily living and increased utilisation
      of healthcare resources. It is well known that serum testosterone levels fall with advancing
      age and this may be an important cause for muscle wasting and weakness (sarcopenia).
      Testosterone replacement increases muscle mass and improves muscle strength in young
      hypogonadal men. In relatively healthy elderly men, some short-term studies have also shown
      that testosterone can improve muscle strength. The potential beneficial effects of
      testosterone supplementation on muscle strength and functional capacity of frail elderly men
      has so far not been studies and forms the basis of this research. We hypothesise that
      testosterone supplementation is an effective, safe and economic anabolic intervention in
      frail elderly men with low circulating testosterone.
