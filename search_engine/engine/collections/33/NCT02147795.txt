      increased morbidity and mortality due to infectious, immunological, pulmonary and
      thromboembolic complications. However, transfusion practice currently varies significantly
      between hospitals and even between physicians and Patient Blood Management programs have not
      been implemented nationwide in Germany yet. Patient Blood Management (PBM) concepts aim to
      identify and optimize patients at risk of allogeneic blood transfusions, to promote
      blood-sparing techniques and restrictive transfusion practices. A rational use of red blood
      cell concentrates and safe clinical transfusion practice is mandatory. The purpose of the
      German PBM network is to evaluate the safety of a standardized, evidence-based Patient Blood
      management concept.

      Study Design and Methods: This epidemiological study is a follow-up of a study that is
      already being carried out in four German university hospitals. This new prospective,
      multi-centre trial comprises approximately 20 different hospitals of varying size and levels
      of patient care. A patient-centred, evidence-based Patient Blood Management program will be
      enrolled in each of these hospitals reforming the care of adult patients undergoing any type
      of surgery. This PBM program includes the following three main pillars: 1) preoperative
      optimization of hemoglobin levels in high-risk patients with anaemia, 2) standardization of
      transfusion practice and transfusion triggers according to evidence-based guidelines and 3)
      alternatives to transfusion of allogeneic RBC concentrates and blood-sparing techniques (like
      routine use of cell saver systems, point-of-care diagnostics, optimized coagulation
      management, restrictive blood sampling).
