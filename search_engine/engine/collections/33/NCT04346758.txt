      plexus is going to be investigated, in elderly trauma patients undergoing procedures of the
      lower extremities. The technique is going to be assessed as for its safety and its accuracy
      in localization of the plexus, by multiple measurements of the imaging time and needling
      time, In addition, efficacy and complications will be recorded and assessed during the
      immediate postoperative period.
