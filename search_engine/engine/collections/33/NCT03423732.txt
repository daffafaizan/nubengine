      (CardioCell) therapy and sham procedure/placebo administration with 2:1 ratio.

      The primary research question of this project is to check if the administration of CardioCell
      could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with N-O CLI.

      There are several secondary questions, defined by secondary endpoints, e.g.: if the
      investigated treatment is possible to administered, if the investigated treatment is safe in
      each studied indication and way of CardioCell administration, if it is possible to define any
      selected subgroup in which the treatment results are significantly different than in whole
      group.
