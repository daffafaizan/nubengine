      to Beijing Tiantan Hospital between Jan 2015 and July 2016, all patients underwent brain CTA
      / MRA/DSA. Investigators determined the number of the patients with intracranial aneurysms,
      calculated overall prevalence of the coexistence of atherosclerotic ICA stenosis with
      aneurysms and analyzed the clinical features.
