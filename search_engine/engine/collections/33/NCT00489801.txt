      increase health related quality of life. However, participation rate are low among elderly
      cardiac patients with coronary heart disease. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation could be an
      attractive alternative to the centre-based programmes but studies investigating the effect of
      these programmes are limited and even less is known about the effect among the elderly.
