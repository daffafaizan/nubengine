      coordination between muscle groups, postural changes, poor balance and altered muscle tone.
      Walking aids improve efficiency, stability and posture.Posterior walkers were developed in
      the mid 1980's. There is evidence of their advantages over more traditional anterior walkers,
      however there is no evidence relating to setting handle height, and little information about
      bio-mechanics during use.

      This is a quantitative pilot study with a cross over design. A purposive sample of
      approximately 15 children will be recruited from Birmingham Community Healthcare National
      Health Service (NHS) Trust. Assessments will be carried out at 3 different handle heights,
      determined by measuring elbow flexion when the participant is standing holding the handles of
      their walker. Participants will attend two assessments. One at their school, and a second at
      the University of Birmingham. Forces going through the walker and the participant's feet,
      range of motion at the trunk, hip and knee, velocity, step and stride length, double support
      time, physiological cost index, pain, gross motor function, hip abductor strength and ease of
      turning will be measured.

      Analysis of variance with repeated measures will be used to analyse changes across handle
      heights and multiple linear regression to show associations between the dependent variables
      studied and identify potential confounding factors. p<0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant. Effect sizes needed for clinical significance will be considered.
