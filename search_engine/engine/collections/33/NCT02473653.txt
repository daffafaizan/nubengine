      results in strong immunologic responses as well as clinical responses during a brief 4 or 6
      week neoadjuvant vaccination. In subsets of patients with cancer HER-2 is over-expressed
      including subsets of breast, gastric, pancreatic, brain, lung, and colon cancer. This trial
      is designed for compassionate use of a HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 in patients with metastatic HER-2
      positive cancer, who have no longer standard options to eliminate disease.
