    
      This is a pilot randomised controlled trial

      Hypotheses -

      Following colorectal surgery, spinal anaesthesia combined with a continuous infusion of local
      anaesthetic into the surgical wound provides

        1. better pain relief

        2. a reduced stress response

      when compared to the use of continuous infusion of local anaesthetic into the surgical wound
      alone.

      Patients undergoing surgical resection for colorectal cancer will be randomised to receive
      either

        1. A single shot of spinal anaesthesia plus a continuous infusion of local anaesthetic into
           the surgical wound or

        2. Continuous infusion of local anaesthetic into the surgical wound

      Spinal Anaesthesia

      The spinal anaesthetic (SA) with be placed after commencement of general anaesthesia this
      will ensure the patients remain blinded to the intervention. SA will be performed in the
      lateral position using a midline approach. L3/4 interspace will be identified using Tuffier's
      as the anatomical landmark. After confirmation of correct placement using a 25G Whitacre
      needle, 12.5 mg of hyperbaric Bupivacaine in a mixture with 500mcg Diamorphine will be
      injected intrathecally.

      Infusion of local anaesthetic

      The catheter through which the infusion of local anaesthetic will be given, will be placed by
      the surgeon at the end of the procedure in a location determined by the surgical approach. A
      bolus dose of 20ml 0.25% L-Bupivacaine will be injected down the catheters prior to the
      connection of the elastomeric pump which will also contain 270ml 0.25% L-Bupivacaine

      General anaesthesia will be managed in the same way for both groups
