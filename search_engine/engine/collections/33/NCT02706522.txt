      delirium in high risk patients. Preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate reduces
      insulin resistance. The investigators aimed to investigate the influence of carbohydrate
      loading on the serum level of S-100Î², a surrogate marker of delirium, and the incidence of
      postoperative delirium in elderly patients.
