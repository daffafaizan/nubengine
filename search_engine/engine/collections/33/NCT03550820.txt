      significantly poorer prognosis than those of normal weight. Emaciation in such patients is
      thought to be caused by destruction of lung structure from disease progression and an
      increased resting metabolic rate caused by the increased load from breathing; however, causes
      of emaciation and details of energy metabolism in these patients have not been studied.

      Elucidating details of energy metabolism and causes of emaciation in patients with pulmonary
      MAC could provide the basis for improvement in nutritional status and activities of daily
      living through early nutrition therapy and rehabilitation. We propose to clarify the
      following:

      Energy metabolism in patients with pulmonary MAC, including resting metabolic rate, calorie
      intake and consumption, and hormonal secretions.

      Relation between energy metabolism and degree of pulmonary MAC progression.
