      ingested two different prebiotic compounds/one placebo for a total of 6 weeks.

      The primary outcome was intestinal permeability which was measured before/after indomethacin
      intake before starting with the prebiotic supplementation and repeated 6 weeks afterwards.

      Indomethacin is an NSAID known to artificially increase the intestinal permeability. The
      prebiotic fibers arabinoxylan and oat-derived beta-glucan have not been investigated for
      their effect on intestinal permeability in older adults.

      Intestinal permeability was investigated using the multi-sugar permeability test.
      Participants ingested a water solution containing 5 sugar probes that are taken up in
      different parts of the gut. These sugars are later recovered in the urine at two different
      time points, reflecting gastroduodenal, small intestinal and colonic permeability.
