      to vocalize sounds or words by using the stimulus-stimulus pairing (SSP) procedure. The
      investigators will use SSP, an intervention based in behavior analysis, to try to help the
      child vocalize sounds. A vocal recorder will also be sent home so that the caregiver can
      record the child's vocalization at home. The caregiver will then be asked to return this so
      that the investigators can listen to it. By doing this, the investigators hope to learn if
      the treatment helps increase the child's vocalizations at home. Some children in the study
      will receive treatment immediately. Some children may enroll in the study now but not receive
      intervention until a later date. All children in the study will receive treatment within one
      year of enrolling in the study.
