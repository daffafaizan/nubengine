      subjective or objective. .

      Despite numerous researches,no effective treatment for people who suffer from tinnitus has
      yet been stablished.

      As there are many evidences suggesting that loss of inhibition in the central nervous system
      may be responsible for many aspects of auditory dysfunction,including tinnitus; and as
      Gabapentin (Neurontin), a gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue, is an effective medication
      in conditions where inhibition in the CNS is impaired; we guess that Gabapentin might be
      useful for treating idiopathic subjective tinnitus.
