      early, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC), because they produce improved survival
      rates compared with tamoxifen. Progressive bone loss and subsequent fractures are associated
      with adjuvant AIs, administered either alone or sequentially after tamoxifen in
      postmenopausal women with early BC. Recent findings of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
      Bowel Project (NSABP) B-34 also suggest that bisphosphonates might have anticancer benefits
      for older postmenopausal women. "BONADIUV" trial is a single-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the impact of bisphosphonate treatment on bone
      mineral density (BMD) in women taking AIs.

      Patients undergo a baseline BMD and if they result osteopenic (lumbar spine and/or trochanter
      -1< T-score <2.5), they are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or oral
      ibandronate. All patients receive oral supplementation of calcium and Vitamin D3, once daily
      for two years. Study duration is 2 year, with planned six-months evaluation.

      A total of 72 patients per arm of treatment are needed to obtain a 85% statistical power in
      order to detect a 2% BMD mean difference between the two arms. Considering a 15% dropout,
      around 82 patients per arm are planned to be enrolled.
