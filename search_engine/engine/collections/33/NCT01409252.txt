      one series. Of patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage in the United States during 2002,
      only 20% are expected to be functionally independently at 6 months. Although case series
      established the value of selected timely hematoma evacuation, long term clinical outcome,
      especially on cognition, is not well described in the literature. With these in mind, we
      carried out this study.
