      data at baseline (T1) and 4 months later (T2) among 50 patients completing initial treatment
      for localized prostate cancer and their partners. First, the investigators will assess the
      feasibility of ESCP by recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates, program satisfaction
      with the ESCP, and perceived ease of use of the ESCP. To achieve the secondary aim, the ESCP
      users will be compared with the standardized SCP users and assess their primary outcomes of
      QOL (overall, physical, emotional, and social QOL), secondary outcomes (reduction in negative
      appraisals and improvement in self-efficacy, social support, and health behaviors to manage
      symptoms), and number of visits to post-treatment care services at T1 and T2. The primary and
      secondary outcomes are assessed using measurements with sound psychometrical properties. The
      investigators will use a qualitative and quantitative mixed methods approach to achieve the
      research aims.

      Conclusions: The results from this study will help design a definitive randomized trial to
      test the efficacy of the ESCPs, a potentially scalable program, to enhance supportive care
      for prostate cancer patients and their families.
