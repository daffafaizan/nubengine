      become inflamed. There is no official database which gives accurate figures but it is thought
      that at least 20,000 people are living with IBD in Ireland. Males and females are affected
      equally and patients can be diagnosed at any age, including babies and children. The peak age
      of incidence is between the ages of 15 and 35, with a second (smaller) peak from the 50s to
      70s.

      GLM is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody produced by a murine hybridoma cell line with
      recombinant DNA technology. It is part of the immunosuppressants pharmacotherapeutic group of
      TNF-α inhibitors. It is licensed for use in several chronic inflammatory conditions including
      UC, Psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis.

      The design of GOAL-ARC aims to address the impact of dose escalation of GLM immediately
      following induction and during the subsequent maintenance phase in response to suboptimal
      drugs levels or persisting inflammatory burden as represented by raised faecal calprotectin
      (FCP). FCP has been shown to correlate closely to endoscopic disease activity6.
