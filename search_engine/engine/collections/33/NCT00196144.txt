      source for inappropriate mode switch from the DDD mode to the DDI or VDI mode. Inappropriate
      loss of atrioventricular synchrony due to false positive mode switch is hemodynamically
      disadvantageous, may induce atrial tachyarrhythmias, can lead to pacemaker syndrome, and
      impairs the reliability of pacemaker Holter data. The aim of the study is to determine
      whether individual adjustment of the postventricular atrial blanking period (PVAB) based on
      an additional test is effective in avoiding inappropriate mode switch due to FFS when
      compared to standard programming of the PVAB
