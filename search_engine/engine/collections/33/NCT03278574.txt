      Semirigid rings combine flexibility and stability; however, their clinical benefit has not
      been completely clarified. The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of mitral valve
      repair with a flexible posterior annuloplasty band versus complete semirigid ring in patients
      with degenerative mitral valve disease.
