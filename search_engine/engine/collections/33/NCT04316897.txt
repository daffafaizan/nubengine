      over the past 4 to 6 decades, the disease remains one of the most important causes of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially in the developing countries that are home
      to the majority of the world's population(1), Incidence rates in these countries still reach
      epidemic levels(2).

      In general, most patients with RHD do not have documented histories of ARF, and they present
      with late complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, endocarditis, or
      pregnancy-related complications(3).

      Echocardiographic screening according to revised jones criteria (2015) (1) is the most
      reliable way of detecting RHD in asymptomatic people, and it can identify large numbers of
      previously undetected cases(4-6).

      People with RHD detected by screening can receive appropriate cardiac care, including
      guideline-recommended secondary prophylaxis(7). This may be a cost-effective approach to
      managing RHD in groups at high risk in Assiut Governate(8). Nevertheless, large scale
      screening has not been undertaken, and studies are underway to determine the best models for
      sustainable targeted screening and to evaluate the impact of screening and treatment on
      clinical outcomes(9).

      In this study, we aimed to determine the role of echocardiographic screening for detecting
      undiagnosed RHD, and to estimate the prevalence of RHD in Assiut Governate.
