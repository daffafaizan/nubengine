      weight heparins, pentasaccharides and vitamin K antagonists, all of which have inherent
      limitations(1-3).

      Improved anticoagulant agents are therefore required(4). A novel antithrombotic agent
      requires demonstration of both efficacy and safety in relevant populations. Phase II studies
      are frequently performed in patients undergoing total hip replacement and/or total knee
      replacement because of the high and well documented incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the
      absence of adequate thromboprophylaxis(5-7).

      In this study, we assess the safety and efficacy of TB-402, a novel antithrombotic agent that
      partially inhibits factor VIII, in the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total knee
      replacement surgery.
