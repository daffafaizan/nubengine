      individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some
      patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each
      unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This
      raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment
      may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or
      classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as
      pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned
      stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a
      conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of
      placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects
      (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated
      exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant
      treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive
      courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific
      hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential
      confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would
      suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects
      who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical
      conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of
      antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant
      treatment.
