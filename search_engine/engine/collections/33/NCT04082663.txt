      Parkinson disease recruited from the community. Participants will attend one in-person visit
      and be custom fitted with a dental mouthpiece. Participants will be asked to wear the
      mouthpiece as much as possible for one month including while sleeping and during the day,
      except while eating.

      Participants will be asked to return for a second in-person visit to repeat gait and balance
      (motor) measures.
