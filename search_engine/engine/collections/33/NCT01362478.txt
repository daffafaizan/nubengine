      recruiting patients. We will recruit 60 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy control
      subjects after explaining the study goal and getting the informed consents.

      We will evaluate the performance of continuous performance test (CPT) and working memory
      subset in Chinese version of WAIS-III in both case and control subjects. We will assay
      reelin, GAD, and MB-COMT gene promoter DNA methylation using methylation specific PCR (MSP)
      and quantify these gene expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR).

      Patients will be followed in one year and receive the same evaluation.
