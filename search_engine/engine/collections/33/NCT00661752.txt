    
      Standard full-time SPECT will be processed using FBP and compared to 3-minute stress and
      5-minute rest scans processed with WBR. The following scan parameters will be evaluated:
      image quality; perfusion defect extent, severity, and reversibility; transient ischemic
      dilatation; left ventricular end-diastolic volume; left ventricular end-systolic volume; left
      ventricular ejection fraction; and regional wall motion and wall thickening abnormalities.
      These parameters will be assessed visually by experienced Nuclear physicians (at least 2
      blinded readers) and quantitatively using several different commercially available software
      programs.
