      malignant melanoma (CMM). With regards to a rapidly growing number of newly discovered miRNA
      sequences, the availability of up-to-date miRNA expression profiles for primary cutaneous
      malignant melanoma (PCMM), cutaneous malignant melanoma metastases (CMMM) and benign
      melanocytic naevi (BMN) is limited. Patients with PCMM, CMMM and BMN are included in the
      study to perform an exploratory analysis by miRNA expression profiling using microarrays.
      Expression levels of miRNA candidates will be validated by TaqMan real-time quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
