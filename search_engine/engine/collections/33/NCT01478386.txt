    
      A randomized prospective study to assess the effectiveness of treating knee osteoarthritis
      with either a series of three viscosupplementation injections, an off-loading knee brace, or
      a combination of viscosupplementation and an off-loading knee brace. The viscosupplementation
      and off-loading knee brace are being used in accordance with their FDA approval. Subjects
      will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The control group will receive a series of
      weekly (3 consecutive weeks) intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. The second group
      will receive a series of weekly (3 consecutive weeks) intra-articular hyaluronic acid
      injections and an off loading knee brace. The third group will use the off loading knee brace
      alone. Subjects will complete the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (pain, stiffness,
      function) and VAS pain scale (measuring pain on movement) at baseline, day 7, day 14, 6 weeks
      and 3 months. Subjects in group 2 and 3 will be given a brace diary to record compliance.
