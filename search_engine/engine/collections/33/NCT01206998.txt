      in obstetric and pediatric care, the incidence of preterm birth has increased by more than
      20% in the last two decades. Approximately 12.8% of births are preterm, however these account
      for more than 75% of all perinatal morbidity and mortality. Currently prophylactic
      progesterone administration is the most effective method available for the prevention of
      recurrent preterm birth. Prior studies have examined the impact of progesterone in women with
      recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening. The possible use of progesterone in women
      experiencing active preterm labor may address the highest risk condition, however, there have
      not been any clinical trials to date examining this use of vaginal progesterone. Inflammation
      and decidual hemorrhage are among the proposed mechanisms that appear to be related to
      preterm labor.We will use a double blinded randomized drug placebo design to study the
      proposed outcomes in women diagnosed with preterm labor and planned to have standard of care
      tocolytic therapy. Women will be randomized to daily vaginal progesterone gel or placebo and
      will be maintained on the drug or placebo until delivery or 36 6/7 weeks.
