      detachment were recognized entities for a long time. On the other hand vitreo-papillary
      adhesion/ traction is a fairly new concept in ophthalmology that became known after the use
      of OCT in ophthalmology imaging. Reasons, effects and ways of treatment of vitreo-papillary
      traction will take some time to evolve. The case study in which this traction was documented
      was initiated by an observation of a persistent, tiny single retinal hemorrhage above the
      optic disc of an eye. The patient was completely asymptomatic because of the vitreo-papillary
      traction but the OCT documentation of the case was so clear and striking.
