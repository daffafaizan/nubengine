      Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH)), diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) and polypoid choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) remains unknown. Although
      immunosuppressants, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, and pars plana
      vitrectomy (PPV) have been widely used for treatment, the current therapeutic options are
      limited. In addition, there is a lack of biomarkers to indicate the prognosis and treatment
      response of these diseases. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers and to provide a
      new target for individualized diagnosis and treatment of common eye diseases based on single
      cell sequencing technology.
