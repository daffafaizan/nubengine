      history of intradialytic hypotension, IDH will be randomized to receive either standard
      hemodialysis or hemodialysis with blood pressure guided biofeedback (BioLogics RR Comfort, B
      braun). After the initial period of 8 weeks patients will cross over to the other group for
      the final 8 weeks of the study.

      The primary outcome is the reduction in the number of IDH episodes associated with patient
      symptoms or nursing symptoms.
