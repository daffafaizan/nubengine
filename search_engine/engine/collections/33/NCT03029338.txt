      total of 10 relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients will be
      enrolled. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv
      TCRÎ¶:4-1BB, will be administered by i.v. injection in a three-day split-dose regimen: 10% on
      day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be
      monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell
      lymphoma.
