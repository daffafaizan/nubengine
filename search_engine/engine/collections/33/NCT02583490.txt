    
      Lower amplitude ECT (LAP) has been shown to induce seizures of adequate duration in a single
      titration session. This current study is hypothesized to increase stimulation focality, thus
      hypothetically minimizing cognitive side effects.

      The central hypothesis is that LAP has significantly less cognitive adverse effects compared
      to conventional Right Unilateral (RUL) ECT.

      The study will enroll 10 patients recruited from Medical College of Georgia. Patients
      referred to ECT service in the Medical College of Georgia usually occurs from clinical
      services and private physicians and the study will recruit patients who are clinically
      indicated to do ECT. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a
      course of either RUL LAP ECT, or conventional RUL ECT.
