        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of S-3304 in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Estimate the starting dose of this drug for subsequent phase II efficacy studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral S-3304 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6-8 patients receive escalating doses of S-3304 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 3 of 8
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
