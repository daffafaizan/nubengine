        -  Compare the efficacy of administering ice chips vs room temperature normal saline oral
           rinse before, during, and after melphalan administration, in terms of reducing or
           eliminating grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis, in patients undergoing autologous peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for multiple myeloma.

        -  Compare the number of days that IV narcotic therapy is required for oral mucositis pain
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the use of IV hydration and/or total parenteral nutrition after autologous PBSCT
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall quality of life, in terms of ability to eat food and drink liquids, in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to age (less
      than 60 years vs 60 years and over). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral ice chips 15 minutes before, during, and for 8 hours after
           melphalan infusion* on day -2.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive room temperature normal saline oral rinses over 30 seconds 15
           minutes before, during, and for 8 hours after melphalan infusion* on day -2.

      All patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT)* on day 0.

      NOTE: *Patients receive melphalan infusion and undergo autologous PBSCT on protocol
      FHCRC-1137.00.

      Quality of life is assessed 3 days a week for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days and then periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
