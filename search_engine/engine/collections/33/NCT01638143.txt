      and powder. To ensure bioequivalence of different vitamin K2 sources, the investigators are
      interested to compare the bioavailability of three different vitamin K2 formulations that are
      already commercially available. Two different oils and one powder product will be compared in
      this randomized cross-over trial. The investigators hypothesize that different vitamin K2
      sources give no differences in bioavailability of vitamin K2.
