    
      Patients will be divided into two groups. Se-group who received selenium supplementation
      during hospitalization in the form of sodium selenite pentahydrate at 750 mg/day for 6 days
      immediately after admission to our department (1000 mg of sodium selenite pentahydrate = 333
      micrograms of selenium) (Selenase, Vivax; selenium hereinafter).

      The placebo group will receive continuous saline NaCl 50 ml/day for 6 days as a continuous
      infusion (excluding additional infusion therapy). Patients will be further divided into
      subgroups according to OI on the day of admission to ICU. The oxygenation index (OI)
      PaO2/FiO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/ fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio
      in patients will be calculated daily.

      The determination of biochemical and hematological parameters of blood samples will be as a
      part of the routine diagnostic methods. Data collection for the Se-AOX study will be
      performed at two-day intervals: T1 (1st-2nd day), T2 (3rd-4th day) and T3 (5th-6th day).
      Kinetic methods for estimating the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx, E.C. 1.11.1.9),
      glutathione reductase (GR, E.C.1.6.4.2) will be performed using a kit (Sigma-Aldrich,
      Germany) and that of superoxide dismutase (SOD, E.C. 1.15.1.1) by means of the SOD-Assay
      Kit-WST (Fluka, Japan) following the user manual provided.
