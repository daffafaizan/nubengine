    
      This is an open label exploratory study of the immunologic efficacy and safety of an
      FDA-approved Hepatitis B vaccine called Heplisav-B. It will be used in patients treated with
      long term immunosuppressive drug therapy. The patients will be given two doses of Heplisav-B,
      the first delivered at the baseline visit and the second at week 4. Antibody levels against
      the Hepatitis B virus will be measured at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 60. The
      proportion of those patients with protective antibody levels will be compared with non-immune
      compromised patients receiving the same dosing schedule. Patients who fail to demonstrate
      protective levels of antibodies at week 8 will be given a third booster dose at week 12, and
      all patients will be followed to week 60.

      This research is being done because current alternative hepatitis B vaccines produce lower
      levels of antibody to hepatitis B, and the level of antibody can be important in the
      prevention of the virus coming back. However, administration of Heplisav-B has been
      associated with higher levels of protective antibody in healthy individuals, people with
      diabetes, and people with kidney disease. It is hoped that the same beneficial effect of
      higher antibody level will also occur in patients who take an immune suppressing medicine to
      treat underlying inflammatory disorder (either arthritis, colitis, or chronic skin
      inflammation), chemotherapy for cancer, or anti-rejection therapy for liver transplantation.
