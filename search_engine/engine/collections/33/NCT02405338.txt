    
      20 patients with AML who are in remission (ELN criteria by DÃ¶hner et al 2017) receive
      WT1/PRAME autologous DC vaccine by intradermal injection once per week during the first 4
      weeks and 1 per month thereafter for 23 consecutive months.

      Primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of the DC vaccine in the
      aforementioned population and the feasibility.

      Secondary objectives include evaluation of clinical response and exploratory immune
      monitoring assessments.
