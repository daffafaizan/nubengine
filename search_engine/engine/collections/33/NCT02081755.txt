      Tacrolimus and 112 Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil/Azathioprine).
      Initial screening criteria will include the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients
      18 years or older who are candidates to receive a primary orthotopic liver transplant (from
      deceased or living donor). Within 7 - 12 days post-transplant, patients will be re-evaluated
      for eligibility for randomization. The criteria include: pre-transplant imaging that shows
      HCC disease exceeding Milan criteria; pathology review for tumor burden and/or presence of
      microvascular invasion; AFP >200IU/mL; pre-transplant ablation or resection with HCC
      recurrence; progression or new tumors; evaluation to rule out any hepatic vessel
      complication.

      Subjects will remain in study treatment until Month 12 at which time the subject and
      investigator will determine the preferred immunosuppressive regimen. Subjects will be
      followed for an additional 24 months for outcome data as described above.
