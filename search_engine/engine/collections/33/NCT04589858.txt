      from osteoarthritis (OA) that progressively lead to chronic pain, joint stiffness, reduced
      mobility, muscle atrophy, poor balance, and ultimately, physical disability. Other
      physiological changes such as reduction in quadriceps' muscle strength and range of motion
      (ROM) in sagittal plane, and shortening of soft tissues around the joints collectively yield
      the distinctive clinical features such as articular pain; worsening on weight -bearing
      activities, resting/morning joint stiffness, progressive decline in physical activities and
      increasing to deformities/disabilities.Researchers observed the effectiveness of a structured
      exercise programs including an aerobic exercise program, a resistance exercise program, and a
      health education program in improving functional outcomes (self-reported disability) and
      decreasing the knee pain among older adults with knee OA at short-term and long term.the
      manual therapy along with supervised exercise protocol revealed a significant reduction in
      joint stiffness and knee pain and improvement in functional status of the patients with knee
      OA for short-term and long-term (1-year follow-up) than the placebo therapy (sub-therapeutic
      dose of ultrasound).

      The study based on a randomized, pretest-posttest experimental group design, included a total
      of 32-participants with knee osteoarthritis randomly divided into groups A and B. Group A
      received a supervised exercise protocol, however group B received specified manual therapies
      in a combination of a supervised exercise protocol. Pain and functional disability measured
      with NPRS and WOMAC index respectively. Data collected on day-1st pre-intervention
      (baseline), day-14th posttest, and day-28th follow-up and analyzed using t-test and one-way
      ANOVA by keeping the level of significance at p<0.05.
