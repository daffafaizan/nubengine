      suggests that in those people who have thinking difficulties, effective treatment and
      improvement of depression can also result in improved thinking skills. Therefore, a test of
      thinking skills is included in this study.

      This study will also evaluate three other potential indicators of treatment response:
      cortisol, cytokines, and grip strength.
