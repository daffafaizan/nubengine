      important factor that delays the course of standard treatments in patients. Recombinant human
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is an effective drug for the treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, for patients with neutropenia, multiple rhG-CSF
      treatments are usually required. This is likely to extend the antitumor treatment period and
      increase physical and mental stress in patients. Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) is rhG-CSF chemically modified by a single methoxy
      polyethylene glycol group; it is able to alleviate neutropenia with a single dose. The aim of
      the present study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of preventive treatment with
      pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) on concurrent
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to provide a rational basis for its clinical
      application. Therefore, the investigators designed the multi-center, open-label,randomized
      controlled clinical study and aimed to compare the efficacy and safety between PEG-rhG-CSF
      and rhG-CSF in non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving chemotherapy.
