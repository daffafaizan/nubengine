      compression on the spinal cord or nerve roots caused by degenerating cervical discs. Discs
      sit between the bones of the spine to provide cushioning, shock absorption, mobility, and
      load-bearing. When the discs break down, the space between the bones gets smaller and
      squeezes on the spinal cord or nerve roots causing radiating pain down the neck, shoulders,
      or arms.

      A surgical approach to address cervical (neck) DDD is to fuse the bones together to prevent
      further compression. This can be done with or without removing the disc material itself. The
      most common way to perform a cervical spinal (neck) fusion to address DDD is to come in from
      the front of the neck, decompress the spine to relieve pain, and fuse the bones together to
      prevent further pain in a procedure called Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF).
      Another option is to come in from the back of the neck in a procedure called Posterior
      Cervical Fusion (PCF). Sometimes these procedures are combined to provide further
      decompression and stability in the bones of the neck to promote fusion leading to quicker
      pain relief and return to function.
