      which cannot be removed by polishing or vacuuming during cataract surgery. The surgeon may
      have to decide on primary posterior capsulorhexis or early neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum
      garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy in these cases. The aim of this study is to compare the
      visual acuity, visual quality, operative complications and the satisfaction of patients
      between primary posterior capsulorhexis group and laser capsulotomy group of cataract
      patients combined with primary posterior capsular opacification (PPCO).
