      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with
           temsirolimus (TEM) in patients with metastatic refractory solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Measure the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Tertiary

        -  Establish a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for HCQ and its metabolites in
           combination with TEM.

        -  Use the population PK model to estimate the exposure of HCQ in individual patients.

        -  Compare PK parameters for this regimen to data from published single agent studies.

        -  Measure the change in median number of autophagic vesicles/cell in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells with TEM alone and with TEM and HCQ and correlate these changes with
           HCQ exposure.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes once a week beginning in week 1 and oral
      hydroxychloroquine twice daily beginning in week 2. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies and measurement of autophagy inhibition. Samples are analyzed via
      HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry, immunoblotting assays, and electron microscopy.
