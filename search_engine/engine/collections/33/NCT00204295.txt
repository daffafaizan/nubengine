      and for the early detection of tumor recurrence. Positron emission tomography studies
      indicate that the extent of amino acid uptake correlates to the true histological extent of
      gliomas. Recently a fluorine-18 labelled amino acid has been introduced
      (O-(2-[F-18]Fluorethyl)-L-tyrosin (FET)), which is suitable for routine use in brain tumor
      patients. There is evidence that this amino acid is transported into brain and brain tumors
      by the amino acid transport of the L-type. The cDNA of this L-transporter has recently been
      cloned and has been shown to be identical to the light chain of the 4F2-antigen (CD98), which
      has previously been described as marker of cell growth and proliferation.

      The heavy chain of this heterodimer is known to modulate integrins which are thought to play
      a fundamental role in glioma invasion.

      Besides the evaluation of the diagnostic capability of FET in brain tumors, a comparison of
      FET uptake in vivo and CD98 expression ex-vivo is performed with tissue slices as available
      after routine surgery in glioma patients.
