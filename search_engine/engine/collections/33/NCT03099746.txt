      to evaluate the efficacy of two electronic decision-support interventions, Interactive
      Virtual Decision Support for End-of-Life and Palliative Care (INVOLVE) and Informational
      Support (IS), compared to each other and to usual care (UC) among 270 SDMs of cognitively
      impaired CCI patients. This design will allow the investigators to prospectively compare the
      efficacy of the experiential avatar-based decision support tool (INVOLVE) with both an
      information-only condition and UC. Subjects assigned to an experimental condition (INVOLVE or
      IS) will receive two doses of the intervention, at enrollment and 1 day later. After the
      second dose, these subjects will have access to their assigned condition for subsequent
      self-administered doses, which will be electronically captured until the patient's ICU
      discharge or death. Data will be collected at (T1) baseline (Day 3 or 4 of the patient's ICU
      stay), and then on Days 1, 3, 7 and 90 post-baseline

      .

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Identify the essential elements of the graphical user interface and educational content
           needed to revise the INVOLVE prototype for a set of common end-of-life decisions that
           occur in the ICU.

        2. Evaluate if there are differences in the decision making readiness and decision making
           quality between subjects exposed to INVOLVE, IS, or UC on Days 1, 3, and 7 days
           post-baseline while accounting for covariates (prior SDM experience, SDM knowledge of
           the patient's preferences, and SDM's religious beliefs).

        3. Determine if there are differences in the post-decision outcomes of SDMs and their CCI
           patient by study condition while accounting for covariates at 90 days post-baseline.
