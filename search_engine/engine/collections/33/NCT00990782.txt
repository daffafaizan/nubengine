      sometimes experience insult or injury to the esophagus, due to the proximity of the esophagus
      to the RFA treatment area. This study utilizes a disposable capsule endoscope (Pillcam ESO)
      to assess the condition of a patient's esophagus before and after the RFA procedure, as the
      injury rate to the esophagus has not been established.
