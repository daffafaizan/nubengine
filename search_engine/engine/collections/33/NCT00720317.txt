      trait and the progression of diabetic retinopathy. People with diabetes have high blood sugar
      that damages small blood vessels. Damage to the blood vessels that supply the retina in the
      back of the eye is called diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is worse in
      African-Americans with diabetes, with earlier and more severe disease progression and common
      complications including vitreous hemorrhage - where these blood vessels in the eye leak - and
      retinal detachment - the separation of the nerves of the retina from the back of the eye
      which may lead to blindness. One explanation for this increased severity of diabetes in
      African-Americans is the presence of sickle cell disease, or even just sickle trait, which
      causes damage to red blood cells and blood vessels under conditions of stress; like low
      oxygen levels, or hyperglycemic acidosis.
