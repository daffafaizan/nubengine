      patients included in the clinics stress rehabilitation program are asked to participate in
      the study and are recruited consecutively from October 2017 throughout December 2018. An
      estimate of 400 patients will be included. The treatment program is a 24-week
      Multiprofessional standardized CBT-rehabilitation consisting of a nine-session CBT group
      treatment (stress management) followed by a seven-session group treatment in applied
      relaxation. Parallel to the group treatments patients receives nine sessions of individual
      CBT, three visits to an MD (for medication, follow-up, and sick-listing), two individual
      sessions to a physiotherapist and a three session-exercise group. Also, vocational measures
      are taken through rehabilitation meetings together with the patient's employer (if an
      employer exists). Primary treatment outcomes will be return-to-work (RTW) and symptoms of ED,
      anxiety, and depression. Secondary treatment outcomes will be quality of life, pathological
      worry, psychological flexibility, clinical perfectionism, insomnia, burnout, and symptoms.

      pain, negative effects of psychotherapy and treatment credibility will be investigated.
