    
      To compare two approaches for surfactant administration during CPAP in preterm infants, the
      INSURE and the LISA technique, using premedication intubation protocols, and investigate
      aspects of safety, stress and pain, timely administration of the drug, response in
      oxygenation and pulmonary outcome.

      Our study asks whether (P) among infants born <32 weeks' gestation with RDS (I) does
      surfactant administration with LISA and analgesia premedication (C) versus surfactant
      administration according to the INSURE protocol (O) improve oxygenation and reduce the rate
      of respiratory failure and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation (T) within 48 hours
      of the procedure

      Primary outcomes:

        1. Positive effect: Oxygenation measured as arterial to alveolar ratio (a/A ratio) at 24
           hours post-procedure.

        2. Negative effect: Need for mechanical ventilation (MV) within 48 hours post-procedure.

      Safety outcomes:

        1. Time from meeting the FiO2 or a/A ratio criteria for surfactant treatment until
           surfactant administration

        2. Number of tries before successful intubation/placement of catheter

        3. Positive pressure ventilation during the procedure - yes/no/duration (minutes)

        4. Stress and pain (changes in heart rate, blood pressure and BIIP-scale)
