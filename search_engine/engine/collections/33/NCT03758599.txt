      three arms. The efficacy of a climbing exercise program, an aerobic exercise program and a
      social contact control group on primary and secondary study outcome will be investigated (see
      Figure 1). Patients will be first screened by the outpatient-unit of the Department of
      Psychosomatics at the Medical University of Innsbruck or remitted through the treating staff
      network community. When assessed as eligible for the study, a group of up to ten out-patients
      will be randomly selected and invited to an informative meeting. Patients receive study
      information and time tables for their group attendances. The intervention will start within
      the following week and will end four weeks after beginning. Follow-up assessments will take
      place three and six months after intervention.

      In addition to the AD/PTSD symptom screening, secondary study outcomes will be assessed:

        -  at study inclusion (t1)

        -  at the end of the intervention (t2)

        -  three months after the intervention (t3)

        -  six months after the intervention (t4)
