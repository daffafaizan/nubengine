      Los Angeles (UCLA) staff or at the Matrix Institute on Addiction to determine whether they
      may have social anxiety and alcohol use disorder symptoms. If they screen positive for these
      symptoms, they will be invited to come in for a comprehensive baseline assessment consisting
      of interviews, questionnaires, and a behavioral assessment. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to either receive standard Matrix treatment consisting of a 9-hour per week
      Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) lasting approximate 2-3 months; or FIT, an Intensive
      Outpatient Program (also 9 hours per week for approximately 2-3 months) consisting of
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder that is woven into the alcohol
      recovery program. After treatment, participants will complete another assessment, and then
      will complete one several months later.
