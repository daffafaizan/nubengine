      two cardioplegic solutions, HTK Cardioplegic Solution (Custodiol) and Custodiol-N in patients
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass surgery. The study design is a
      prospective, double blind, multicenter, randomized, Phase III comparison study intended to
      demonstrate non-inferiority in surgical outcome between Custodiol and Custodiol-N as
      determined by CK-MB area under the curve (primary endpoint), catecholamine
      requirement(cumulative dose) and cardiac Troponin T, occurrence of comorbid events
      postoperatively (e.g., myocardial infarction).
