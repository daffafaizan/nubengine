      (or processes) is as follows: It is known that increases in brain neuronal activity are
      associated with local increases in energy metabolism. Under normal circumstances, increases
      in brain metabolism lead to local changes in blood oxygenation in venules and larger veins.
      This change in blood oxygenation can be detected imaging methods which are sensitive to the
      differences in magnetic state between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

      The ultimate benefit of this research is to better understand how changes in both performance
      and the brain organization underlying that performance are affected by aging.
