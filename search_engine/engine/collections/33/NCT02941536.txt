      a ratio of 10: 1 relative to primary tumors. In breast cancer, BM are becoming more frequent
      due to longer life expectancy. Patients with HER2-positive metastatic disease are prone to
      develop BM more often and they occur in 20 - 40% of cases. Circulating tumor cells (CTC)
      originate from the primary tumor and can migrate to distant organs. The possible correlation
      between CTC and the incidence of brain metastases could help define radiotherapy in patients
      with oligometastatic or not so widespread disease in the brain. However, there are few
      studies that evaluate these scenarios. Purpose: To assess the number of CTC before and 4-5
      weeks after focal stereotactic radiotherapy in single (SRS) or fractionated (SFRT) dose and
      correlate with the local and distant brain progression free survival in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. Potential invasion markers in these cells will be evaluated and
      correlated with clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Prospective, single-center research
      which will be developed at the Radiation Oncology Department of AC Camargo Cancer Center.
      Patients with diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer to the brain with an indication of focal
      radiotherapy, SRS or SFRT, will be recruited. The blood will be collected and processed for
      analysis of CTC by the ISET method (Rarecells, France). The invasion markers (HER-2, COX-2,
      EGFR, Notch 1 and ST6GALNAC5) will be analyzed on CTC by immunocytochemistry. Expected
      Results: If our hypothesis is proven, we may include the analysis and quantification of CTC
      in clinical practice as early indicator of local or distant recurrence in the brain.
