      continue on standard dosing schedule of secukinumab (i.e. subcutaneous injections once a week
      for 5 weeks (300 mg) followed by subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks). During each study
      visit blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies towards
      secukinumab. In addition, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the Dermatology
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each visit.
