    
      Rationale: This is a Phase 1b, single-cohort study of FolateImmune in combination with
      low-doses of the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha).
      FolateImmune treatment consists of subcutaneous vaccinations with EC90, a compound designed
      to elicit an immune response (antibodies) to a dye called fluorescein (FITC), in combination
      with GPI-0100 adjuvant (a drug intended to improve antibody production). Vaccination is
      followed by treatment with EC17, a drug made by linking folate (a vitamin) with FITC.
      Experimental evidence has shown that the folate vitamin receptor is over-expressed in many
      human cancers. It is expected that EC17 will attach to cancer cells through the folate
      vitamin receptor and that antibodies to FITC will recognize the cancer cell and mark it for
      destruction by the body's immune system. Two drugs, IL-2 and IFN-alpha, will be administered
      at low doses in combination with EC17 in order to boost the immune response.

      Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC90 vaccine with GPI-0100 adjuvant.

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC17 concurrent with IL-2 and IFN-alpha
