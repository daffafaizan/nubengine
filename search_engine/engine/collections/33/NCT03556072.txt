      occurring within a radius of 2-3 cm from the ampulla of Vater or hepatopancreatic ampulla.
      More PAD cases have been identified over recent years, and it's generally believed that up to
      27% of elderly cases may have PAD. Several classifications of PAD have been proposed, and the
      most commonly used distinguishes intraluminal and extraluminal diverticula. Recent studies
      suggest that PAD is a risk factor for the development of bile duct diseases, and it may cause
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures to fail, but some other
      studies have come to the opposite conclusion.

      During ERCP procedures, the investigators found that different types of PAD seem to have some
      differences in the size of the diverticulum, difficulty in intubation, and complications. The
      investigators plan to this retrospectively study collecting 4 years of cases to evaluate the
      clinical features of different types of PAD in terms of difficult cannulation and
      complications.
