      most commonly used lung isolation techniques are double lumen tubes or single lumen tubes
      with additional use of bronchial blockers. In both cases fiberoptic bronchoscopy is used for
      proper placement and maintenance during operation. Recently double lumen video endotracheal
      tubes were proposed as a new alternative for lung isolation techniques. The double lumen
      video endotracheal tube differs significantly in size and physical characteristics from
      standard single lumen endotracheal tube and intubation may prove to be challenging even for
      an experienced practitioner. Therefore proper prediction of difficult intubation play a
      crucial role in a clinical setting. Sensitivity and specificity of existing anthropometric
      scales and tests used for prediction of difficult intubation seem lacking so new methods such
      as Thyromental Height Test (TMHT) are being introduced. It is based on the height between the
      anterior border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of the mentum, measured
      while the patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth. The main objective of the
      trial is to assess the clinical usefulness of TMHT in prediction of difficult intubation
      using double lumen video endotracheal tubes in patients scheduled for elective thoracic
      surgical procedures. The secondary aim is to evaluate the utility of double lumen video
      endotracheal tubes as a novel method of lung separation.
