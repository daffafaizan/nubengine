      some fat molecules that can be tracked based on how heavy they are. These molecules are not
      dangerous. By collecting several urine samples throughout a 24-hour window (about 7 urine
      samples or more) after drinking the fat molecules, we will be able to measure how fast your
      toddler is sending out (excreting) these samples in the urine. This will tell us how fast
      your toddler is using fat for energy. This will also help determine the best urine collection
      schedule for studies using this technology.
