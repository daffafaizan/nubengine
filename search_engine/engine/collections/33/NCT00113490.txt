      palivizumab was administered to children who previously participated in MI-CP104. Children
      who received at least 3 doses of motavizumab in MI-CP104 were eligible for enrollment.
      Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive motavizumab or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM
      injection every 30 days for a total of 4-5 injections during the 2004-05 RSV season
      subsequent to the season in which they were participants of MI-CP104. All subjects were
      evaluated prior to and 30 minutes after each injection of study drug with 2 follow-up
      evaluations, one at 30 days and the other at 90-120 days after the last dose.
