      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of subjects
      over a period of 1-20 years. Hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver
      transplantation in the United States. infection occurs in one-third of all HIV-infected
      individuals, and the natural history among HIV-1 infected individuals demonstrates higher
      levels of HCV viremia, faster rates of progression and cirrhosis. There have been very few
      studies addressing the lower therapeutic response rates in minorities outside of African
      Americans. A recent study showed that Latino white subjects respond less effectively (34%)
      than non Latino white subjects (49%) given the same treatment even after adjusting for
      various important factors. As the current landscape for treatment of HCV changes, it would be
      important to evaluate factors responsible for therapeutic response in Latino patients.

      This is a study to address the genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic expression during therapy
      for chronic hepatitis C in Latino participants with and without HIV co-infection. One hundred
      Latino participants who have evidence of chronic hepatitis C with and without HIV who are
      receiving treatment for HCV will be enrolled. The results of this study will enable us to
      explore reasons for the differential therapeutic response rates with Hepatitis C treatment in
      Latino participants with and without HIV coinfection.
