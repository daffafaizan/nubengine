      SARS-CoV-2 with mild to moderate symptoms who meet inclusion criteria as judged by physician
      evaluation.

      Following patient enrollment into the study, completion of informed consent and
      randomization, the patient will receive one unit of convalescent COVID plasma or standard of
      care. The plasma will be infused in an outpatient infusion center by highly trained and
      experienced staff. Vitalant will be providing the plasma as per their normal screening and
      distribution protocols. Patients will be monitored for safety during the infusion and per
      protocol following the infusion for a period of 28 days. Primary efficacy and safety
      endpoints will be statistically analyzed and compared between the two groups.
