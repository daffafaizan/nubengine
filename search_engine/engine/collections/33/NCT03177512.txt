      highly interactive mobile app to promote accurate risk perception and increase HIV/STI
      testing and linkage to PrEP among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Key components of
      the app include Sex Pro (a personalized HIV risk score), a sex diary to facilitate accurate
      data collection; HIV/STI testing information and reminders; access to home HIV/STI testing
      options; a geospatial-based locator of HIV/STI testing sites and PrEP clinics; PrEP
      information and videos; and online PrEP navigation.

      This study is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative
      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
