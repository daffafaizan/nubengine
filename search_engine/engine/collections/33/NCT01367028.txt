    
      The target study population consists of male and female pre- and postmenopausal patients with
      HER2-positive, adenocarcinoma of the breast (except inflammatory breast cancer, T4d)
      scheduled to receive neoadjuvant cytotoxic treatment.

      Patients must have pathologically confirmed breast cancer with histologically confirmed HER2
      over-expression. At screening, patients must have an adequate left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF); an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; adequate liver, renal and bone marrow
      function; and be free of other serious diseases that could affect protocol compliance or
      interpretation of results.

      Patients should not be at increased risk of GI perforation, hypertension, proteinuria, wound
      healing complications, thromboembolism or hemorrhage. Patients must not have had another
      primary malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of
      results. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded. Pregnant or
      lactating females are excluded. Patients with hypertension (>150 mmHG systolic or >100 mmHG
      diastolic) and patients with a history of GI perforation, abdominal fistula or
      intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months of study entry are excluded.

      Full anticoagulation therapy at study entry is allowed as long as the patient has been on a
      stable level of anticoagulants for at least 2 weeks at the time of study treatment start.
