      underlined as important parts of the care. The investigators developed an Internet-based
      educational program in close collaboration with patients, specialists in the field, both
      physicians and nurses, and a phycologist, specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate this program in comparison to "care as usual" with
      reduction in symptom burden as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints being improvement in
      health-related quality of life and reduction in health-care costs.
