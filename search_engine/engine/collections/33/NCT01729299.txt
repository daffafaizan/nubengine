      ghrelin+Ex-9, Ex-9 or saline infusion after an overnight fast in a randomized order; Ex-9
      will be used to block GLP-1 action. A 240-minute meal tolerance test (MTT) using a dual
      glucose tracer method will serve as the foundation of each study visit. One tracer,
      [6,6-2H2]glucose will be infused intravenously before and during the test meal to quantify
      fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP), and glucose disappearance during the meal. A
      second tracer, [U-13C]glucose, will be included in the meal to trace the appearance of oral
      glucose. The systemic appearance rates of both ingested tracer and total (i.e., ingested and
      endogenously produced) glucose will be calculated. Using this protocol, we will be able to
      evaluate a) insulin secretion in response to mixed-meal ingestion, b) glucose appearance and
      glucose disappearance during meal ingestion, c) the ghrelin effect on these parameters
      without GLP-1, and d) the effect of GLP-1 in the response based on the effects with and
      without Ex-9.

      This dual-tracer method has been used to assess the ability of an individual to dispose of an
      oral glucose load, and accurately fractionates the appearance of ingested glucose in plasma
      (Ra meal), EGP, and peripheral glucose disposal (Rd) in this setting 41-42. The
      [6,6-2H2]glucose and [U-13C]glucose are stable-isotope tracers and are different from
      radioactive-isotope tracers in that they do not emit radiation.

      All procedures will be performed at the CTRC at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
      Center (CCHMC).
