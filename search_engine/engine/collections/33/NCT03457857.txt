      are many types of cleansing and moisturizing routines that have been shown to have different
      effects on the skin barrier such as reducing sebum and exogenous contaminants, controlling
      odors, and affecting the skin microbiome.1 A previous study in an adult population showed
      that use of a mild surfactant cleanser had less of an impact on the skin barrier than a
      liquid castile soap (data on file ).2 Because infant skin differs from an adult's in
      structure, function, and composition3, cleanser and/or lotion regimens may impact the skin
      barrier of infants differently.

      There is very little information in the literature on how the use of product regimens impacts
      the cutaneous microbiome and skin physiology of adults1 and even less about how it impacts
      the skin of children.

      This study will explore the impact that the use of two regimens - one cleansing and the other
      cleansing and moisturizing - has on the holistic skin barrier of infants ages 3-6 months.

      The IPs are a baby wash and a baby lotion, which are both cosmetic body products. The
      auxiliary product is a commercially available, cosmetic baby body wash.
