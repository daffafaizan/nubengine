      Charge: Managing Hemophilia Online" Internet intervention that will help adolescents with
      hemophilia to better understand and manage their disease independently. This program is
      modeled after Dr. Stinson's similar successful internet self-management program developed for
      youth with arthritis.

      This program is being developed and evaluated using a sequential, phased approach. The first
      phase of this project has determined the self-management and transitional care needs of
      adolescents with hemophilia. Currently, in Phase 2A, we are developing the website with the
      content based on the findings from the Phase 1 needs assessment. We propose the current study
      to conduct usability testing (Phase 2B) to make sure it is easy to use and understand, and is
      efficient and satisfying to complete. Subsequently, we will assess the feasibility of the
      program and the outcomes from the use of the site in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      pilot study (Phase 3). This will enable us to determine an appropriate sample size for the
      future mixed controlled trial. Phases 2B and 3 are the focus of this proposal. Phase 4 will
      be a multicentre randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes for teens that complete the
      intervention as compared to those of an attention control group. This randomized controlled
      trial controlled trial will include all interested pediatric hemophilia treatment centres
      across Canada.

      We hypothesize that adolescents with hemophilia who complete the "Teens Taking Charge:
      Managing Hemophilia Online" Internet intervention will demonstrate: increased hemophilia
      specific knowledge, increased self-efficacy, improved health-related quality of life (HRQL)
      and decreased stress prior to transition to adult health care.
