      demonstrated via numerous preclinical studies. Two of masitinib's main cellular targets are
      the mast cell and microglia cell. It is well-established that mast cells play a prominent
      role in neuroinflammatory processes. Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous
      system (CNS), also constitute an important source of neuroinflammatory mediators and may have
      fundamental roles in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. The development of masitinib in
      ALS is therefore based on the pharmacological action of masitinib in microglia cells and mast
      cells, thereby slowing microglial-related disease progression, reducing neuro-inflammation,
      and modulating the neuronal microenvironment in both central and peripheral nervous systems.
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group (two
      ascending dose titrations of masitinib and matching placebo), comparative study of oral
      masitinib in the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
