      patients with obesity/diabetes as well as in trained athletes. Despite similar metabolic
      storage, patients and athletes have opposite insulin sensitivity phenotypes and an
      explanation for this is lacking. The investigators' objective is to understand how these fat
      compartments can be beneficially modulated to improve insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic
      risk. The investigators will investigate if either structural differences (saturated versus
      unsaturated balance of TG and DAG side-chains) or different handling abilities (fast versus
      slow lipid pool turnover) will be induced by exercise capacity interventions in athletes and
      in diabetic patients. In a longitudinal study pre- and post-exercise, the investigators will
      use novel, non-invasive 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to benchmark the
      saturated/unsaturated compartments against skeletal muscle biopsies for the first time and
      stable isotope analysis for fat compartments' rate of turnover.
