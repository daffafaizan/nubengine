      To evaluate the interpretation of cystoscopy images in different SPIES modalities a tablet
      program was developed. Images of 20 bladder areas were captured in 4 different SPIES
      modalities; white light, Clara&Chroma, Spectra A and Spectra B. Of each bladder area, one
      extra image was added to the program, so that a total of 100 images were interpreted.

      Every image is shown 45 seconds on the tablet screen. Participants are asked to delineate
      with a stylus on the tablet the precise area they suspect to be malignant and would resect or
      treat. After they are done they go to the next slide and the time is stopped.After each
      image, participants are asked to judge the quality of the image on a scale of zero to ten,
      with zero being the worst and ten the best.After this judgement, the next image for
      interpretation is presented.
