      minimize the future risk of asthma exacerbations (AEs). Asthma is a heterogeneous disease
      with various responses to treatment and clinical outcomes. AEs are a prominent feature of
      severe asthmatics; however, frequent AEs have also been reported in mild asthmatics.

      This is a prospectively designed observational study to identify predictors for patients with
      frequent AEs among adult asthmatics by analyzing medical big data of electronic medical
      records (EMR), which will provide an insight in the long-term management of adult asthmatics
      in real-world practice.
