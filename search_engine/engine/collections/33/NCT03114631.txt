      with pancreatic cancer. Dendritic cells are obtained from blood monocytes using standard
      protocol.

      Two options for dendritic cell priming are used: MUC-1/WT-1 peptides for the patients with
      unresectable tumor and/or tumor lysates for the patients undergoing tumor resection.

      The dendritic cells are them matured and injected subcutaneous (all patients) and
      intratumorally (when possible).
