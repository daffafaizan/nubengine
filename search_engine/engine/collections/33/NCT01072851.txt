      cancer, as many as half of eligible adults remain unscreened. Poor and under served
      populations, particularly African American and Latino/Hispanic adults, are at greatest risk
      for noncompliance with recommended tests. Health education strategies developed to date have
      led to relatively minimal gains, resulting in little translation to routine clinical
      practice. This is especially true in more difficult, resource-strained practice settings,
      such as community health centers.

      The interventions in the proposed study draw on communication science to optimize message
      design, use communication technology to optimize message delivery and include parallel
      content in both print and multimedia versions to allow comparison of format-related effects
      on both knowledge and screening rates.The multimedia and print tools are based on patient
      education programs that we developed with extensive attention to theory as well as community
      member input.
