      double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) placement in patients who are scheduled to have
      thoracic surgery in which lung isolation is required. The investigators want to evaluate the
      technique of placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) using an included stylet
      that has been radically bent (ZU-bend) as compared to a commercial GlideRite stylet with the
      GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. A double-lumen
      endobronchial tube (DLT) is a breathing tube utilized to manage the airway when lung
      separation is needed for a surgical procedure. The investigator wants to evaluate how long it
      takes for successful placement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) and assess the
      difficulty of the procedure experienced by the physician performing the intubation.
