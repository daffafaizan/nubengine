      and neck previously treated with platinum-based therapy.

      The study design is a non comparative randomized phase II trial: ARM 1: cabazitaxel (20
      mg/m2, every 3 weeks) versus ARM 2 methotrexate (40 mg/m2, weekly). Cabazitaxel dose will be
      increased to 25mg/m2 for the second and subsequent cycles, in the absence of
      non-hematological AE > grade 2 and hematological AE > grade 3 during the first cycle.
      (maximum 10 cycles). The aim of the randomization is to offer a valid internal control group
      by avoiding possible selection bias. However, results obtained in the two treatment group
      will not be formally compared as this is not the objective of a phase II study.

      Tumor check-up will be performed every 9 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicities according to the patient or the investigator. A
      maximum of 10 cycles of cabazitaxel will be given.
