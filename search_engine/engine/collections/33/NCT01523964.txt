    
      Healthy subjects and subjects with DMD will be screened during Visit 1. Screening evaluations
      will establish eligibility and will include a medical history, abbreviated physical
      examination, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respirations), and weight.
      Eligible subjects will provide assent, as stipulated by Institutional Review Board (IRB)
      requirements, and a parent/guardian will sign an informed consent, after which the subject
      will be considered enrolled.

      Subjects will be enrolled into 4 study cohorts for a total of approximately 90 subjects.
      Allocation into these cohorts is planned due to considerations regarding the effect of age on
      outcomes.

      Visit 2, Study Assessments, may take place on the day of Visit 1 screening evaluations. If
      the subject cannot complete study assessments on the same day, the subject may return and
      complete Visit 2 evaluations within approximately 24 hours of the end of Visit 1.

      Visit 2 assessments will include morphological testing of muscle length and girth, skin fat
      measurement, Clinical Assessments (6-Minute Walk Test [6MWT], North Star Ambulatory
      Assessment, timed function tests, dynamometry), and 3 phases of Device Performance testing.
      Phase 1 Device Performance testing will be done by each of 2 trained raters (Rater A and
      Rater B) from the research site, designated to perform the Device Performance testing on all
      subjects at their respective site. At least 10 minutes after completion of the first
      assessments, Phase 2 Device Performance testing will be repeated by Rater A. Upon completion
      of the Phase 2 Device Performance testing, the subjects will proceed with Clinical
      Assessments performed by a physical therapist. Following Clinical Assessments, Phase 3 Device
      Performance testing will be performed by Rater B.
