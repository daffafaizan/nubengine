      This method, although sufficient in its interventional success, provides only haptic control
      and often requires wire guidance or X-ray imaging for monitoring the position of the
      stenosis, the dilator and the dilation process.

      To guarantee the missing optical feedback and enhance the intraprocedural control a conical,
      clear cap was developed. This single use device is attachable to the front end of an
      endoscope and provides direct visual evaluation of the mucosal damage and progress of the
      Bougienage, making x-ray imaging obsolete while resulting in an effective dilation. For the
      bougienage treatment, the endoscope with the cap on top is inserted into the patient's GI
      tract and aimed at the stenosis. By pushing the endoscope forward the cone shaped cap expands
      the mucosal diameter by conversion of longitudinal to radial force vectors. Lateral and
      frontal openings allow suction and flush during procedure.

      The clear tapering cap is now to be tested for ist technical feasibility and ability to
      improve patients' quality of life following treatment. Therefore a quality of life
      questionnaire (Swal QoL) evaluating the patients' dysphagia is done right before and two
      weeks after the bougienage and an effective dilation is proved by being able to pass the
      stenosis with the endoscope after the treatment.
