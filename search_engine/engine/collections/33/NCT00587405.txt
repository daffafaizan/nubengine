      angioectasias involving primarily the antrum, and causes transfusion-dependent anemia in the
      majority of patients. Current endoscopic treatment options, including argon plasma
      coagulation (APC) Endoscopic cryotherapy is a novel technique that has the potential to
      safely and more effectively treat WS by virtue of its mechanism of injury and mode of
      application.
