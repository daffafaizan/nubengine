      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on in daily routines. In this
      trial, the MC2-01 cream will be compared to a marketed product CAL/BDP combination and
      vehicle. The purpose of the trial is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and
      convenience of this cream to the marketed product. The trial will include a 8-week treatment
      period.
