        -  To identify a potential novel marker of prostate cancer in the blood and urine,
           11-dh-TXB2, to be used as a screening tool for prostate cancer as well as in detection
           of early relapse in patients previously treated for early-stage prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Blood and urine samples are collected and analyzed for plasma and urinary 11-dh-TXB2
      levels by HPLC and tandem-mass spectrometry.
