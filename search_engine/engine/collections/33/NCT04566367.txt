      tumor are at high risk for a second cancer or another precancerous lesion. Before or during
      cancer treatment a PEG is needed to maintain a sufficient calories intake. PEG is established
      by performing a standard gastroscopy.

      This randomised study wants to compare the detection rates of standard white light endoscopy
      compared to the additional use of blue laser imaging for second cancers or precancerous
      lesions in participants presenting for PEG establishment.
