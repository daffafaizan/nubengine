      cardiovascular conditions. However, many private physician practices lack the resources to
      implement team-based care with pharmacists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether
      a centralized, remote, clinical pharmacy service could improve guideline adherence and
      secondary measures of cardiovascular risk in primary care offices in rural and small
      communities.

      This study was a prospective trial in 12 family medicine offices cluster randomized to either
      the intervention or usual care. The intervention was delivered for 12 months, and subjects
      had research visits at baseline and 12 months. The primary outcome was adherence to
      guidelines, and secondary outcomes included changes in key cardiovascular risk factors and
      preventative health measures. We enrolled 302 subjects.
