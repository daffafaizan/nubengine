      with normal lung growth early in life We hypothesize that during the first two years of life
      that parenchymal surface area and alveolar volume increase with somatic growth; however, the
      ratio of surface area to volume remains constant, while ventilation within the lung becomes
      more homogenous.

      SPECIFIC AIM # 2: Determine the pulmonary sequelae of premature birth and assess the
      effectiveness of early treatment strategies upon the pulmonary sequelae.

      We hypothesize that premature birth impedes growth and development of the lung parenchyma and
      the airways at a corrected-age of 1-year. In addition, initiating continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) and a permissive ventilatory strategy in very premature infants at birth will
      improve lung growth and lung function compared to treatment with early surfactant and
      conventional ventilation.
