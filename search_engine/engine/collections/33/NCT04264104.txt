      or 8x10 (n=30) repetitions of neural mobilization .

      Data on flexibility (knee extension test) and lower limb strength and motor control (hop
      tests and vertical jump test) will be collected at baseline and after the neural
      mobilization.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
