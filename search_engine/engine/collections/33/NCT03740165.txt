    
      Following a lead-in period during which all participants receive a single 3-week cycle of
      carboplatin/paclitaxel*, participants will be randomly assigned in to one of three treatment
      arms:

        -  Pembrolizumab + Olaparib,

        -  Pembrolizumab + Placebo for Olaparib

        -  Placebo for Pembrolizumab + Placebo for Olaparib

             -  At Investigator's discretion and prior to participant randomization, one of the
                following carboplatin/paclitaxel regimens is to be selected:

                  1. up to 5 cycles of carboplatin Area Under the Curve (AUC)5 or AUC6 AND
                     paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle

                  2. up to 5 cycles of carboplatin AUC5 or AUC6 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle AND
                     paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 3-week cycle; or

                  3. up to 5 cycles of carboplatin AUC2 or AUC2.7 AND paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 on Days
                     1, 8 and 15 of each 3-week cycle.

      Docetaxel may be considered for participants who experience either a severe hypersensitivity
      reaction to paclitaxel or an AE requiring discontinuation of paclitaxel only after
      consultation with the Sponsor. The recommended dose as determined by the Scottish
      Gynaecological Cancer Trials Group is Docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 Q3W plus carboplatin AUC 5 Q3W.
