      self-efficacy during the first three weeks of engaging in lifestyle physical activity.
      Randomization will place participants into one of two groups: (1) Social Cognitive
      Theory-guided video chat or (2) time-matched video chat comparison group. Video chats will be
      delivered via the Google Duo smartphone app.

      Baseline and follow-up assessments will consist of psycho-social questionnaires assessing
      constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory, affect, stress, and work-life balance.
      Physiological measures including heart rate will be assessed during a baseline treadmill
      assessment (to be completed in lab). All participants, regardless of group, will be asked to
      wear an activity tracker for the entirety of the study for assessing lifestyle physical
      activity. The comparison group will be asked to complete all baseline and follow-up
      assessments but will not receive information relative to lifestyle physical activity. The
      baseline assessments will take place with an academic research laboratory and weeks 2-7 will
      take place off outside of the lab.
