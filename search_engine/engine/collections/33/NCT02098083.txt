      information on physical therapy interventions including gait training, balance training,
      group therapy, manual therapy, exercise, transfer training, stairs, family training,
      wheelchair training, modalities, discharge planning, seated and supine exercises. Other data
      will be collected including tone, motor control, sensation, gait endurance, falls, wounds,
      restraints, deep vein thrombosis, tracheostomy, feeding tubes and blood pressure. Additional
      data collection will include age, gender, race, length of time post stroke, time in
      rehabilitation, Functional Independence Measure scores, case mix group, discharge
      destination. In addition, physician history and physical as well as discharge summary will be
      collected, as will evaluation and discharge notes from therapies (physical, occupation,
