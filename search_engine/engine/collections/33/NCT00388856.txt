      developed and developing world. Despite of intensive research, the underlying pathologic
      mechanisms of this disease remain elusive. It has been agreed that incomplete or absent
      transformation of spiral arteries by replacing endothelial cells and mural vascular smooth
      muscle cells has been observed in the placental bed of preeclamptic patients and severe cases
      of intrauterine growth restriction. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a link between
      these mechanisms. However, it has been demonstrated by two large studies that antioxidant
      supplementation does not reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Our initial study has been shown
      that antioxidant supplementation may be reduce the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women
      with low antioxidant status.

      Comparison(s): adverse pregnancy outcome between vitamin C and E given and placebo given to
      pregnant women with low antioxidant status at 10-12 weeks gestation age
