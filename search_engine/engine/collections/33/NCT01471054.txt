      melanomas. Macular edema is one of the most common causes of visual loss after plaque
      radiotherapy and has been reported in up to 70% of patients with posterior uveal melanoma.
      Different methods have been proposed for treatment of post-radiation macular edema and
      include periocular steroid, intravitreal steroid, intravitreal vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) inhibitors, photodynamic therapy, and macular laser photocoagulation.

      Injection of intravitreal triamcinolone (a form of steroid) has been found to be useful for
      treatment of different forms of macular edema but is associated with considerable rates of
      increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma). Dexamethasone is more potent than triamcinolone
      and can be safely injected directly into the vitreous cavity (intravitreal injection) but
      unfortunately its use in the form of intravitreal injection is not practical due to the short
      half-life of intraocular dexamethasone (about 3 hours).

      Within the past several years, tiny drug delivery systems have been developed that allow
      sustained release of minute amounts of steroid into the back part (vitreous cavity) of the
      eye, when they are implanted into the vitreous cavity. Ozurdex is a biodegradable
      dexamethasone intravitreal implant that has been shown to be well-tolerated and effective for
      up to 6 months in reducing vision loss and improving visual outcome in eyes with different
      types of macular edema including those secondary to diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein
      occlusion.

      In this study the investigators would like to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      Ozurdex (dexamethasone intravitreal implant) for treatment of macular edema developing after
      plaque radiotherapy of uveal melanoma.
