      Patients undergo blood draw. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth
      factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) are measured. Patients whose IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels are
      average or above are tested for the presence of mutation in the insulin-like growth factor-I
      receptor.
