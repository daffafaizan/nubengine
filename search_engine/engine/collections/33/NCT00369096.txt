      peritoneal dialysis. This peritoneal dysfunction is defined by an elevated creatinine
      transport and lowered standardized ultrafiltration capacity. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of the addition of bemiparin to icodextrin solution in patients in
      peritoneal dialysis with peritoneal transport disorders. The eligible patients are randomly
      assigned to receive the icodextrin solution with bemiparin or icodextrin solution without
      bemiparin.
