      because tuberculosis patients are usually excluded from (phase II or III) clinical trials for
      drug registration although they are not prohibited from prescription of COPD drugs.

      This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150„éç o.d.) in patients
      with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.
