    
      Single-blind, single-centre, fixed-order study to evaluate the PD effects of a single oral
      dose and multiple oral doses of ESL (BIA 2-093) in healthy volunteers. A single dose of oral
      ESL 900 mg was followed by consecutive 7-day periods of: Placebo, ESL 800 mg, and ESL 1200 mg
      each given QD. The single dose was chosen to assess the ESL acute response relationship with
      respect to cognitive and motor skill performance, and the multiple doses were chosen to
      further characterize the ESL dose response relationship with respect to cognitive and motor
      skill performance.
