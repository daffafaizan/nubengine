      mechanisms, pathogenesis, and treatment of disease. Patients with known or suspected
      cardiovascular diseases are referred to NHLBI cardiologists for consideration of
      participation in clinical research protocols. However, eligibility for participation is often
      uncertain from referral information or even after an outpatient evaluation. The purpose of
      this protocol is to permit inpatient evaluation of patients for whom participation in
      clinical research protocols is under consideration in order to determine protocol eligibility
      by means of conventional laboratory and cardiovascular testing.
