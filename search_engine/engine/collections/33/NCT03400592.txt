      4 or more out of 19 patients to have a confirmed partial or complete response (assuming P1 =
      0.30, P0 = 0.10, with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2) before proceeding to the second stage, in
      which additional 36 patients were needed. If a total of 15 or more patients achieve a
      confirmed objective response, then the primary end-point would have been met. The predicted
      response rate in this study is at least 30%. Blood and tissue samples are required to collect
      at baseline, response and disease progression.
