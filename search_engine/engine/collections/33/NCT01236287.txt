    
      Voclosporin is an investigational medication previously studied to prevent acute rejection in
      patients who receive a kidney transplant. This study is a compassionate release program where
      subjects previously participating in the study entitled A Phase 2B, Randomized, Multicenter,
      Open-Label, Concentration Controlled, Safety Study of ISA247 and Tacrolimus (PrografÂ®) in
      denovo Renal Transplant Patients (ISA05-01)" may be eligible to continue to receive
      voclosporin despite the Phase 2B study being terminated by the sponsor. Under the
      compassionate release program, subjects previously taking voclosporin may continue to receive
      the study medication until the drug is FDA-approved and commercially available in the United
      States.

      Subjects will receive voclosporin and will be followed in an outpatient setting. After their
      initial visit, patients will return for follow-up at least every 3 months (through month 24)
      and then every 6 months (beginning at month 24). Safety and efficacy measurements will be
      taken at appropriate time points as outlined in the table below. Trough voclosporin
      measurements will be collected at least every 3 months (through month 24) and then every 6
      months (beginning at month 24) or more frequently at clinic visits as appropriate (as
      indicated by clinical events (such as rejection, infection, adverse event) or concomitant
      administration of an interacting medication. Patient and graft survival data will be
      collected on an annual basis for safety reporting.
