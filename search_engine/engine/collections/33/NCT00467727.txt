      this imaging modality for screening of breast cancer. Screening mammography has been proven
      to decrease mortality from breast cancer. Radiologists identify abnormal breast tissue in the
      form of microcalcifications, masses, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density by
      careful assessment of the characteristics of these types of lesions using the Breast Imaging
      Reporting and Diagnostic System (BIRADS). BIRADS was developed to provide standardization of
      reporting of mammographic exams. In screening mammography, while it is possible to detect
      lesions, often more detailed diagnostic imaging is necessary to improve the visibility of
      margins and edges of lesions through magnification and compression views of the lesion of
      interest due to spatial resolution limitations which causes geometric blurring of edges in
      x-ray mammography.

      If the ability to clearly see margins and edges of lesions is possible at screening
      mammography, this would potentially decrease the overall radiation exposure currently needed
      to allow radiologists to be confident of their characterizations for the majority of patients
      using x-ray mammography. Digital mammography was developed to improve the visibility of
      lesions primarily in dense breasts. The reasoning was that the improved contrast range would
      allow for wider range of gray level differentiation but with digital mammography comes a
      spatial resolution limitation that blurred edges of lesions. Phase contrast mammography (PCM)
      was developed to improve digital mammography by providing improvement in sharpness of edges
      utilizing the x-ray properties of refraction.
