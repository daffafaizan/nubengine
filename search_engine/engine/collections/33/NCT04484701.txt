    
      This is a prospective registry study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 68Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT to stage patients with high risk prostate cancer, localize sites of biochemical
      recurrence of prostate cancer, and restage patients with advanced prostate cancer before and
      after onset of new therapy.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at the British Columbia Cancer (BCC) -
      Vancouver. Each subject will receive a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at the BCC - Vancouver, as
      part of this research study. Each study subject will receive a bolus intravenous dose of
      68Ga-PSMA-11. The subject will rest in a comfortable chair for 60 minutes and will then be
      taken to the PET/CT scanner for images. The PET/CT scan will take approximately 2.5 hours of
      patient time above and beyond the time needed for standard of care.

      Medical History Questionnaire: Demographic and medical history data will be collected either
      in person before the PET scan appointment or by mail or phone, whichever is the most
      convenient to the subject.

      Follow-up assessments: All subjects will be contacted by phone the day after the injection of
      68Ga-PSMA-11. The subjects will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects during
      the 12 hours after the administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. The local site attending nuclear
      medicine physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects are likely
      related to 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration.

      All subjects will be followed for 5 years following the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT exam to assess
      the presence of recurrence. The evaluation will include a chart review of available imaging,
      laboratory tests, and treatment. The data required can be obtained from a review of the
      patient's paper and electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact as needed to
      complete the information.
