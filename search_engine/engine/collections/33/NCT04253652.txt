    
      This study is a pre-post interventional, two armed prospective cohort study where patients
      who are newly diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia are prescribed iron therapy (either oral
      iron supplements, 200mg capsules containing 65mg of iron 2-3 times daily, or intravenous iron
      1000-1500mg) as part of their standard care. Participants will be asked to provide breath
      samples and complete the IBS-SSS questionnaire at baseline and after 4 weeks of taking the
      iron therapy as part of their standard care. A diary including stool consistency and
      frequency will also be completed by participants on a daily basis. For further exploratory
      research, some participants from each the oral and IV iron arm will be asked to provide stool
      samples at baseline and 4-weeks post iron therapy to assess any microbiome changes in
      response to iron therapy.
