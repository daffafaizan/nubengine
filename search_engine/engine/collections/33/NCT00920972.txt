      cell engraftment without exposure to radiation or high dose chemotherapy in children with
      non-malignant disorders. The intent is to minimize early and late regimen related toxicities
      in the context of a reduced intensity regimen.

      In addition to maximizing opportunity for donor cell engraftment, the trial seeks to minimize
      toxicities associated with transplant such as graft versus host disease and employs GVHD
      prophylaxis that seeks to decrease rates of acute and chronic GVHD in the setting of matched
      and mismatched donor stem cell transplants from marrow and cord blood sources.
