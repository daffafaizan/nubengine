    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable unrelated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts can be
      safely established using nonmyeloablative pretransplant conditioning with intensified
      post-grafting immunosuppression and with every (q) 8 hours (hr) and possibly q 6 hr
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosing in patients with hematologic malignancies and renal cell
      carcinoma.

      II. To determine if the incidence and severity of acute grades II-IV graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) can be reduced in patients with sustained engraftment with the use of q 8 hr
      MMF dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if engraftment can be maintained in patients with low chimerism and high risk
      of rejection with the use of a single dose of fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) followed by
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on continued MMF/cyclosporine (CSP).

      II. To compare survival and disease free survival to those achieved under protocol 1463.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on
      days -4, -3, and -2 and undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      100 with taper to day 177 and mycophenolate mofetil PO every 8 hours on days 0-40 with taper
      to day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years,
      2 years, and then annually thereafter.
