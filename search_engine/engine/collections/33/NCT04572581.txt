    
      In late preterm infants and term neonates in the NICU whose mothers intend to breastfeed,
      this pilot study seeks to 1. determine study feasibility (consent rate, study completion
      rate, and rate of adherence to study diet), and 2. determine whether a dietary
      supplementation with donor human milk vs. formula improves: a. the percentage of maternal
      milk consumption at time of discharge from the NICU, or 7 days of age, whichever is later, b.
      breastfeeding rates and intent to breastfeed at 6-8 weeks chronological age, and c. breast
      feeding duration.
