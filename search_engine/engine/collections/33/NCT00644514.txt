      Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, is
      ubiquitous in the environment, and is often present in high concentrations in organic dusts,
      as well as in air pollution, and household dusts. There is convincing evidence that endotoxin
      exacerbates airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics. Additional
      findings indicate that allergic airways can enhance the response to inhaled endotoxin, and
      that endotoxin can enhance the airway response to allergens. However, when considering the
      interaction between endotoxin and allergens, the timing of the exposure appears to be
      critical. Emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to endotoxin, a potent inducer of
      Th1 type cytokines (IFN-g and IL-12), may minimize the risk of allergen sensitization which
      could has profound effects on reducing the risk of developing asthma in children. Independent
      of its effect in allergic asthma, several studies demonstrate that inhalation of air
      contaminated with endotoxin is associated with the classical features of asthma (reversible
      airflow obstruction and airway inflammation, and persistent airway hyperreactivity and airway
      remodeling). Epidemiological studies have shown that the concentration of inhaled endotoxin
      in the bioaerosol is strongly and consistently associated with reversible airflow obstruction
      among cotton workers, agricultural workers, and fiberglass workers. Importantly, the
      concentration of endotoxin in the bioaerosol is the most important occupational exposure
      associated with the development and progression of airway disease in agricultural workers.
      Experimentally, inhalation of endotoxin can cause reversible airflow obstruction and airway
      inflammation in previously unexposed healthy study subjects. The ability of the host to
      respond to endotoxin is highly variable, and is influenced in part by genetic factors.:

      The rationale for this investigation is based on the following points:

        -  asthma is caused in large part by both genetic susceptibility and environmental
           exposure,

        -  a variety of immune and non-immune mechanisms can function independently or
           interactively to cause airway hyper-reactivity, airflow obstruction, airway
           inflammation, and airway remodeling,

        -  environmental challenges can be used to "narrow the asthma phenotype" and allow one to
           investigate unique gene-environment interactions that are involved in the development of
           biologically specific forms of asthma,

        -  genes that are over or under stimulated in the airway epithelia of asthmatics following
           inhalation challenge are important in the pathogenesis of asthma
