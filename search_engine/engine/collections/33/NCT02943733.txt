      screening period of 14 days or less, a treatment period, and a safety follow-up period 30
      days after treatment discontinuation.

      Part 1 is a dose finding phase with the objective to assess the safety and tolerability of
      the proposed drug combination and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a
      recommended phase 2 dose.

      Part 2 is an open-label expansion study, which will enroll patients with metastatic pNETs who
      have not been previously treated with chemotherapy. Part 2 will obtain further safety data of
      the proposed drug combination.
