    
      A randomized clinical trial performed at five (5) centers (Montreal, Laval, Quebec City,
      (Quebec); Markham, London (Ontario), Canada). One hundred (100) patients are enrolled in the
      study. Subjects and parent(s) or guardian are asked to present to the clinic for five (5)
      visits (Screening, D0, D7, D42, D56). Formulation 609580 20 or 609209 is applied twice a day
      (morning and evening) to the whole body for a total of 42 days and then there is a crossover
      between the two formulations.

      Efficacy is evaluated at D0, D7 and D42 measured by SCORAD (scoring atopic dermatitis).
      Tolerance is evaluated by the investigator at D7, D42 and D56. Global efficacy is measured by
      parents and investigator at D7 and D42. Medical photographs (optional) of lesions are taken
      with patients consent at D0 and D42. A crossover between the two products occurs at day 42 so
      that cosmetic acceptability can be compared at D42 and D56. Skin examinations are performed
      at all visits. A quality of life questionnaire is filled out by the parent(s) at D0 and D42.
