      during chest tube placement, talc instillation or pleural biopsy. This study intends to use
      combined IV, intradermal and intrapleural anesthesia during pleuroscopy procedures.
      Intrapleural atomized lidocaine will be applied directly to the parital pleura. This study
      will evaluate intravenous anesthesia reduction in subjects treated with intrapleural
      lidocaine, reduction in total procedure timeby minimizing interruptions due to poor pain
      control, reduce perioperative pain scores and improve patient comfort nad to determine safety
      of fixed dosage of 3 mg/kg intrapleural lidocaine given during pleuroscopy.
