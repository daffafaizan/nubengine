      may amplify isolation and loneliness due to the requirement to limit in-person interactions
      with loved ones, friends, community members, healthcare providers, etc. Social isolation
      increases susceptibility to illness, stress, hypertension, depression, and mortality and
      decreases engagement in self-management and physical activity. People living with HIV (PLWH)
      are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are particularly vulnerable to the
      stress and social isolation caused by the public health measures to combat COVID-19. Using
      mixed-methods and a human-centered design approach, the investigators will adapt a nurse-led
      intervention to EXtend the HIV/AIDS TReatment cAscade for CVD prevention (EXTRA-CVD) so that
      it is better suited to a post-COVID healthcare environment. This hybrid type 3 implementation
      study will evaluate the implementation of a virtually enhanced EXTRA-CVD intervention to
      improve BP control in PLWH from 3 HIV-specialty clinics in the United States [University
      Hospitals, MetroHealth (both Cleveland, OH) and Duke Health (Durham, NC)]. The study will
      enroll adult PLWH participants (n=75) on suppressive ART with high blood pressure whom are
      otherwise ineligible for the parent trial (EXTRA-CVD; NCT03643705) because they do not also
      have high cholesterol or because they are unwilling or unable to participate in the in-person
      trial. Primary outcomes will be: reach (% agreeing to participate), effectiveness (change in
      home systolic BP), and adoption (frequency of home BP use). Additional implementation
      measures including feasibility, acceptability, and intention to maintain blood pressure
      self-monitoring will be assessed qualitatively. This study will increase the impact and
      scalability of the EXTRA-CVD intervention without compromising the integrity or feasibility
      of the parent trial.
