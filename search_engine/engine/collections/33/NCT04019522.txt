      worldwide. Despite the spontaneous recovery that occurs following a hemispheric stroke, more
      than half of stroke patients show substantial residual impairments, imposing a significant
      human and economic burden. This burden is likely to increase in coming decades, due to a
      rapidly aging population, and the associated progression of cardiovascular risk factors.
      Accordingly, new interventions to alleviate impairment in stroke survivors are urgently
      needed. The development and testing of one such novel intervention, termed Acute Intermittent
      Hypoxia (AIH), is the primary focus of this AHA Innovative Project Award.

      The aim is to answer questions related to safety and preliminary efficacy of AIH in stroke
      survivors. First, the Investigators will establish whether brief reductions in inhaled oxygen
      concentration can be safely tolerated in stroke survivors. A clinician will closely monitor
      subjects for any adverse events.

      The second aim is to establish the effects of AIH on elbow flexion/extension strength, and on
      hand grip and pinch strength. Subjects will be monitored closely for any adverse events
      during these experiments. Data will be analyzed to determine if there is an improvement in
      key outcomes at any dose level.
