      flap (SCPF) and the conventional coronally advanced flap (CAF) after applying modification in
      both techniques to treat class I Miller gingival recession. Coronally repositioned gingival
      margin will be stabilized by coronally anchored suture with composite stops on the buccal
      surface of tooth using flowable composite for the treatment of gingival recession. Ten
      patients who have bilateral maxillary buccal Miller Class I gingival recession defects will
      be enrolled in this study. These defects will be distributed randomly into two groups: the
      test group (SCPF) and control group (CAF). Clinical parameters will be evaluated: visible
      plaque index (VPI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession
      height (GRH), gingival recession width (GRW), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of
      keratinized tissue (WKT), thickness of keratinized tissue (TKT), change in the position of
      muco-gingival junction, vestibular depth, wound healing index (WHI), the percentage of root
      coverage (RC) and root coverage esthetic score (RES) system. A questionnaire will be given to
      each patient, which includes evaluation of the pain intensity, root sensitivity, and
      satisfaction with aesthetic by using the visual analog scale (VAS) and questions about the
      number of analgesic pills consumed per day.
