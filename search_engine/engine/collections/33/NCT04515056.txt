      problems, such us the impossibility of standardizing the amount of the spicules inserted in
      the skin and the difficulty of obtaining the substance. These aspects bring us the necessity
      to find a new and more standardized model of non-histaminergic itch.

      Papain is a cysteine protease extracted from papaya plant that is known to cause itch if
      applied to the skin. For these reasons the investigators would like to test a new new human
      itch model based on papain, and to characterize the sensory quality and temporary aspects of
      papain skin prick test (SPT) in comparison to the inactivated-cowhage delivery system.
