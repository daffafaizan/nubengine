      surgery during regional anesthesia combined or not with general anesthesia . These measures
      were learned to the entire anesthesia team (nurse, resident and anesthesiologist) during
      conventional meetings. An initial evaluation of the application of these measures will be
      carried out before the introduction of e-learning. This assessment will be conducted by
      nurses without the knowledge of the anesthetic team evaluated. After this initial evaluation,
      e-learning will be broadcast on the hospital intranet. Then a second evaluation of the
      application of the preventive measures will be carried out 6 month and 1 year after the
      introduction of e-learning.
