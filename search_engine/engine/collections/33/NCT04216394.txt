      urgent/emergent treatment needs being the common denominator.(1) A characteristic feature of
      EGS is its limitation in patient preparation. It is difficult and often impossible to
      eliminate certain patient dependent factors to reduce the operative risk. It has been
      reported that the annual case rate in the EGS population is (1,290 per 100,000) higher than
      the sum of all cancer diagnoses.1 The EGS burden is substantial and continues to increase.
      The elderly patient population represents 48% of the overall EGS population. With the
      increase in the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease in the elderly there has been an
      increase in the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants.(2,3)
