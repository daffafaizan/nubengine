      (LT). Factor V is a coagulation cofactor that is primarily produced by the liver. Factor V
      has a short half-life and its production does not depend on vitamin K, relying mainly on
      liver function. These singular characteristics make Factor V plasmatic levels strictly linked
      to liver function. Previous data has suggested a correlation between factor V levels and
      graft dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize that Factor V may predict graft dysfunction
      after LT, and become a reliable biomarker for hepatic function after LT. Therefore, the aim
      is to validate the use of Factor V as a predictor of graft dysfunction after LT. This is a
      single-center prospective validation study. Participants (patients undergoing LT at the
      University Health Network) will have plasmatic Factor V levels measured on postoperative days
      (POD) 1º, 2º, 3º, 5º and 7º. Participants will be followed up to 12 months. The study primary
      outcome will be early graft dysfunction as defined by Olthoff et al. Secondary outcomes will
      be 3-, 6- and 12-months graft and patient survival. Graft loss will be defined as need for
      retransplantation in the study period. Potential confounders will be assessed in a
      multivariate regression model. No other intervention will be done to the patients. The
      results of this study may validate the use of this biomarker for graft dysfunction and
      mortality after LT. These results will impact LT research and direct patient care.
