    
      This study is the second phase of work in Zambezi and Ohangwena Regions, Namibia, building
      off a formative phase of work that characterized the risk behaviors migratory patterns,
      health-seeking behaviors, intervention strategies and social networks of agricultural workers
      and cattle herders, who are previously identified malaria high-risk populations (HRPs). This
      phase of the study now aims to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,
      acceptability, and feasibility of targeted delivery of a package of malaria interventions for
      improving effective coverage and reducing Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in these
      regions among these populations.

      The study will specifically assess the coverage and impact of interventions delivered at
      worksites to HRPs, including presumptive treatment administered alongside vector control
      interventions (indoor residual spraying [IRS], long-lasting insecticidal nets [LLINs], and
      topical repellents). The effectiveness of these interventions will be compared against areas
      with no study interventions (standard of care) over the course of implementation (November
      2019 - May 2020). Primary outcomes will include the coverage of each intervention at
      worksites over the study period and PCR-based P. falciparum prevalence measured at endline.
      Following a baseline cross-sectional survey in November/December 2019, the interventions will
      consist of 2 rounds of presumptive treatment spaced at least one month apart between January
      and March, and delivery of vector control interventions at worksites and key access points
      with support from employers, with the primary evaluation to be conducted through an endline
      cross-sectional survey in April/May 2020. Secondary outcomes around effectiveness will be
      assessed through incident case data providing measures of incidence in HRP and non-HRP
      populations, odds of infection associated with each intervention in cases compared to
      controls and entomological data collection. In addition, operational and feasibility outcomes
      will be assessed through qualitative data collection, population size estimation of HRP
      groups and a global positioning system (GPS) logger study.
