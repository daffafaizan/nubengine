      suffer. One of the mechanisms suspected to contribute to phantom pain is abnormal plasticity
      and reorganization of the cortex.

      Mirror therapy is a behavioral technique that proven useful for the treatment of phantom
      pain, yet the analgesic effects are unfortunately moderate and not long lasting. The assumed
      underlying mechanism of mirror therapy treatment is the induction of neuronal plasticity in
      the opposite direction than the abnormal reorganization of the cortex (due to the
      amputation), and by that relive pain.

      tDCS is a non-invasive technique that allow the administration of low currents directly to
      the scalp. The currents affect the cortex, and result in changes to the membrane potential of
      neurons in the stimulated area. This in turn affects the tendency of those neurons to
      generate action potentials.

      It was hypothesize that combination of mirror therapy and tDCS treatment could result in
      additive effects. According to this hypothesis, the effects of the mirror therapy could be
      enhanced by the tDCS treatment. The aim of the current study is to investigate this
      hypothesis.
