    
      This is a single-blinded randomized trial aiming to examine the outcomes associated with
      minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD), including robotic or laparoscopic, versus
      open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Adult patients with symptomatic benign, premalignant, or
      resectable malignant pathologies recommended for resection after a multidisciplinary review
      will be evaluated for inclusion into the study.

      Patients recruited will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MIPD or open
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. A specialized abdominal dressing (40x40cm) will be applied to blind
      the patient from the intervention. The primary outcome(time to functional recovery) and
      secondary outcomes(including rates of post-surgery complications and sequential quality of
      life) will be recorded in detail and analyzed.
