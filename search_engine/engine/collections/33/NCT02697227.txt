      I. To determine the comparative effectiveness of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Smoking
      (BATS) plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus standard cessation treatment plus NRT
      on high reward sensitivity smokers (IRS+) and low reward sensitivity (IRS-) smokers.

      II. To identify mediators of the BATS plus NRT treatment effect in IRS- smokers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (STANDARD CESSATION): Patients receive NRT patch daily for 8 weeks. Patients receive
      individual behavioral treatment sessions consisting of behavioral treatment strategies for
      smoking cessation and health education information over 45 minutes for 8 sessions.

      GROUP II (BATS): Patients receive NRT patch daily for 8 weeks. Patients receive individual
      treatment sessions consisting of standard cessation (SC) strategies and behavioral activation
      (BA) strategies over 45 minutes for 8 sessions.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months.
