        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with
           unresectable stage IV melanoma treated with temozolomide followed by sargramostim
           (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and interferon alfa.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the changes in quality of life over time in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5, and sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and
      interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-8 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at least stable
      or responsive disease after 8 courses of therapy may receive additional therapy at
      investigators discretion.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 1 month
      after study.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
