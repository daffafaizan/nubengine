      measure resting and contracted thickness of the transversus abdominis muscle. Following the
      pre-intervention measurement, patients will receive one of two physical therapy interventions
      (side lying thrust joint manipulation or side lying non-thrust oscillations into slight
      rotation) which will have been randomly assigned. Immediately after intervention, ultrasound
      imaging will be repeated on the resting and contracted thickness of the transversus
      abdominis.
