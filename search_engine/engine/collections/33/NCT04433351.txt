      rehabilitation program, based on illustration of speech articulators, to improve speech in
      patients with non-fluent aphasia. The instigators' method is based on the reinforcement of
      the interaction between perceptual and motor representations, thanks to the innovative
      Ultraspeech device. The investigators will exploit a fundamental psycholinguistic principle,
      which postulates that speech is based both on the activation of the system controlling the
      motricity of effectors related to word articulation (action) and on the auditory or visual
      representation of words (perception). The sensory-motor interaction method that the
      investigators propose allows the patient to perceive phonemes and visualize on a computer
      screen the movements of the tongue and lips previously recorded by a healthy speaker,
      typically a speech therapist. Through repeated exercises, the patient is trained to produce
      sounds correctly, using the correct pronunciation and articulatory movements of the reference
      speaker as a model. The investigators will compare patients who will follow a classical
      speech and language therapy rehabilitation program followed by an 'enriched' rehabilitation
      program including rehabilitation based on sensory-motor interaction associated with speech
      and language therapy, and vice versa. In order to judge the favorable effect of the
      rehabilitation program including sensory-motor integration, the following measures will be
      considered: (a) language skills, (b) phonemic quality, (c) inner speech abilities and (d)
      cognitive function. Brain language networks will be evaluated with neuroimaging.
