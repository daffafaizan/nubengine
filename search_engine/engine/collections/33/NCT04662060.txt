      shedding (Virology Domain); and COVID-19 related Clinical Outcomes (Clinical Domain).

      The primary objective for investigational products within the Viral Domain is:

      A. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in addition to standard
      supportive care (SSC) compared with SSC in reducing viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in
      outpatients with COVID-19 disease.

      The primary objective for investigational products within for the Clinical Domain is:

      B. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in addition to SSC as compared
      to SSC in improving sustained clinical outcomes in outpatients with COVID-19 disease.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. The objective of the non-assigned domain an investigational product is under.

             1. If under Clinical Domain, reduction in viral shedding.

             2. If under Viral Domain, time to resolution of symptoms.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in reducing SARS-CoV-2 related
           hospitalizations, ED visits, or death in outpatients with COVID-19 disease.

        3. To assess the development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

        4. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of each therapeutic intervention compared with
           placebo (supportive care).
