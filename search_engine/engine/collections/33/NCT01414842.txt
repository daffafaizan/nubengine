      in comparison with standard hemodialysis in some large observational studies (Canaud et al,
      KI, 2006; Vilar et al, CJASN , 2009) supporting the hypothesis that convection can improve
      patients outcomes. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials
      (Locatelli et al, Journal American Society of Nephrology, 2010) that OL-HDF significantly
      reduced the frequency of intradialytic hypotension. Nonetheless, the associated comorbidities
      and ageing of dialysis population require further devices able to improve treatment
      tolerance. Among these tools, the sodium profiling and biofeedback system seem to be
      promising to accomplish this task. But the correct intradialytic sodium balance is still far
      away today to be easily achieved. The use of an automated adaptive system dialysis to the
      sodium profiling has been investigated in a feasibility trial (Col√¨ et al International
      Journal Artificial Organs, 2003). They also investigated the impact of such a device on
      treatment tolerance.

      The aim of this randomized multinational multicenter controlled trial is to evaluate the
      impact of sodium profiling applied to a endogenous hemodiafiltration technique on the
      intradialytic cardiovascular stability in comparison to standard no profiled endogenous
      hemodiafiltration.
