      using a client-centered, multidisciplinary model that combines expert care in five domains:
      (a) antiviral pharmacotherapy for HCV infection; (b) substance abuse treatment; (c)
      psychiatric evaluation and treatment; (d) primary medical care; and (e) intensive,
      client-centered, case management. The Weill Cornell Medical College Center for the Study of
      Hepatitis C collaborates with community-based organizations providing services to injection
      drug users to provide multidisciplinary, integrated care using a model that combines the
      resources of culturally appropriate community-based agencies with those of a state-of-the-art
      tertiary care center.
