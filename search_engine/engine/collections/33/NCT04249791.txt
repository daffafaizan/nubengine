      assisted robotic access pathways. This is a clinical trial with 6 participants (3 donors and
      3 recipients) to investigate the feasibility of an assisted laparoscopic-robotic surgical
      access route for uterine removal in the donor patient in uterine transplants. In the
      receiving patient, conventional surgery (midline incision) will be performed for uterine
      transplantation and vascular anastomoses.
