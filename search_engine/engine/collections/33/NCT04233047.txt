      attachment inhibitor being developed as a potential treatment of HIV-1 infection.
      Investigational FTR is being made available on a compassionate use named patient basis for
      the treatment of HIV infection in individuals with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection who
      are experiencing virologic failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA â‰¥1000 c/mL) and are unable to
      comprise a suppressive regimen with currently available antiretrovirals. Such patients, who
      are often heavily treatment experienced (HTE), represent a small and highly vulnerable
      subgroup within the overall HIV patient population. The care of HTE patients is difficult and
      often complicated by the presence of complex comorbidities, extensive concomitant medication
      profiles, and advanced HIV disease.
