      miscarriages (60%) than from induced abortions (20%). HPV-infection in the extravillous
      trophoblasts in the placenta has furthermore been shown to induce cell death and cause
      dysfunction of the placenta, which can lead to adverse outcome of the pregnancy, e.g. preterm
      birth and hereby related neonatal mortality and morbidity. Spontaneous abortion and preterm
      birth are adverse events of the pregnancy, with for the biggest part unknown aetilogy, an
      area worth trying to elucidate by means of research.

      Method 6 groups of each 91 women will be included:

        -  A group of early pregnant women at the nuchal translucency scan around gestational week
           12 and a similar group undergoing chorion villous sampling in relation to prenatal
           diagnostics of the fetus

        -  A group of women with spontaneous abortion before gestational week 22 and a group with
           preterm birth gestational week 22-32

        -  A group delivering spontaneously at term and a group undergoing elective cesarean at
           term

      The women will be examined by cervical swab to analyze for and do a genotyping of HPV if
      present. A vaginal swab will be done for the purpose of vaginal microbiome examination later.
      Furthermore analysis for HPV in placental tissue from chorion villous sampling or evacuation
      of the uterus after miscarriage. Cervical swabs and placental tissue will be analyzed by
      means of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for the 35 types of HPV most frequently found in the
      anogenital area. Blood samples will be collected from all the patients and analyzed for
      HPV-antibodies.
