    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish success benchmarks of CALM Breathing and to
      test feasibility of:

        1. recruiting a target group of adults with COPD and concurrent anxiety, including building
           a partnership with the NYU Pulmonary department; ensuring adequacy of recruitment and
           study referral procedures;

        2. ASI-16 anxiety sensitivity cut-point for eligibility;

        3. randomizing participants to CALM Breathing and Wait-List;

        4. assessment procedures; confirming our estimates of time needed to administer
           assessments; evaluating participant ratings of assessment burden; and testing that
           target timelines and blinding are achievable;

        5. facilitating timely PR intake assessment initiation (to limit wait);

        6. implementing manualized CALM Breathing, including adequacy of dose (timing, frequency,
           and session duration), fidelity procedures, and transportation funds; attention will be
           given to additional considerations and tailoring needs of patients with significant
           anxiety sensitivity and/or anxiety disorders;

        7. implementing home-based breathing exercise component (e.g., new RR device fidelity
           checks and new distribution of therapist-guided audio exercises using an MP3 player to
           improve adherence rate)

        8. retaining participants at 3-month follow-up post-PR, including ensuring adequacy of
           retention strategies.
