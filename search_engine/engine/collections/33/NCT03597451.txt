      and healthy individuals of similar age and sex to patients will be included in the study. The
      strength of the extremity and core muscles, walking capacity, and sit-to-stand performance
      will be evaluated once.

      Investigators will use descriptive statistics and t-tests to compare variables between
      groups. Investigators will examine the correlations between variables using Pearson bivariate
      correlations. The significance level is set at p<0,05
