    
      Our study proposes two groups of 25 patients undergoing similar VATS surgery with a single
      surgeon, Dr. R. McKenna, who will receive interoperatively placed intercostal nerve blocks at
      the same levels. Each group will receive intercostals nerve blocks with one of two different
      solutions: group one will receive intercostal nerve blocks with only 0.46% bupivacaine (19.5
      ml of 0.5% bupivacaine + .5 cc saline), group 2 will receive intercostal blocks with 0.46%
      bupivacaine and dexamethasone(19.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine + .5ml .4% dexamethasone). The
      patients will have pulmonary lung function objectively assessed by portable spirometry and
      clinical factors both preoperatively and postoperatively. Our study objective is to examine
      and quantify the potentially beneficial effects of intercostal nerve blockade prolongation
      with dexamethasone on postoperative pulmonary function and postoperative recovery.
