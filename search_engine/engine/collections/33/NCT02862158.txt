    
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible and preventable blindness world-wide.
      Insufficient evidence exists to support routine screening for glaucoma in a primary care
      setting due to the relatively low prevalence of the disease (Guirguis-Blake, 2005 and Moyer,
      2013). Frequency doubling technology (FDT)-based perimetry is a relatively inexpensive and
      portable visual field testing device with a short testing time that has shown reasonable
      efficacy, sensitivity and specificity in screening for glaucoma in clinic- and
      community-based settings (Mansberger, 2005 and Nomoto 2009).

      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and reproducibility of FDT perimetry
      platforms compared with Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) perimetry (which is the gold clinical
      standard in clinics and hospitals) in detecting glaucomatous visual field defects.
