      (10.2 per 100 000 inhabitants). The Poitou-Charentes region is in a situation of excess
      mortality by suicide compared to France (+ 25%). While the ratio of suicide attempts per
      suicide is about 200/1 before 25 years, it is estimated to be 4/1 after 65 years, or even 1/1
      in elderly men. In France, suicide attempts are not systematically recorded and the frequency
      of suicidal ideation is poorly understood. The consensus conference on suicidal crisis
      highlights a number of clinical points specific to the elderly population (suicidal ideas are
      not always clearly expressed or unidentified, there are various manifestations of the psychic
      crisis, greater vulnerability of this population), but the complexity of interactions between
      suicidal risk factors limits our predictive capabilities of suicidal intention in an elderly
      person. Analysis of the literature reveals two types of major interventions in order to
      reduce the suicide rate: those aimed at reducing risk factors and those aimed at increasing
      protective factors. The objective of our research is to determine the effect of protective
      factor methodical search on post-crisis patient care.
