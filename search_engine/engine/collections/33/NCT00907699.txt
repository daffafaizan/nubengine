      Primary

        -  Identify mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung
           cancer specimens from clinical trial CASE-2507.

        -  Investigate EGFR DNA copy-number changes.

        -  Determine abnormalities of other pathways, such as the c-MET and PI3K pathways as
           potential mechanisms of resistance.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA and RNA are extracted from tumor samples. Genomic DNA is analyzed using real-time PCR/
      reverse transcriptase PCR analysis and/or FISH analysis in order to study resistance
      mechanisms such as secondary EGFR mutations and the c-MET and PI3K pathways. RNA is analyzed
      using TaqMan quantitative PCR in order to determine the copy number of EGFR expressed in
      these tissues. Peripheral blood samples are used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells positive for epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).
