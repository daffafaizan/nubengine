    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and feasibility of adding tremelimumab 75 mg intravenously (IV) plus
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg administered once pre-operatively and 4 cycles of durvalumab
      1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 cycles post-operatively in patients who are candidates for
      resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the changes in various immune parameters, including programmed cell death-1 ligand
      1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death1 (PD-1) expression in the tumor, over treatment and
      correlate with response and survival with goal of biomarker discovery.

      II. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) in all enrolled subjects.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 4 hours during week 11.
      Between weeks 15 and 17, patients undergo liver surgery. Patients then receive durvalumab IV
      over 1 hour during weeks 21, 25, 29, and 33.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice a year for 5 years.
