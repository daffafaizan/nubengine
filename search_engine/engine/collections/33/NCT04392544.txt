    
      The aim is to determine the prevalence of intestinal inflammation by measurement of fecal
      calprotectin and/or histological evaluation of intestinal tissue biopsies in both pediatric
      and adult CF populations.

      Pediatric CF population (Age 10-18 years):

        1. Determine the prevalence of intestinal inflammation in a cohort of pediatric CF patients
           based on fecal calprotectin levels in stool samples.

        2. Assess the correlation between fecal calprotectin and abdominal symptoms/QOL.

      Adult CF population (Age â‰¥ 18 years):

        1. Determine the prevalence of intestinal inflammation in a cohort of adult CF patients
           based on histological evaluation of intestinal tissues biopsies and fecal calprotectin
           levels in stool samples

             1. in adult CF patients who have not undergone lung or liver transplantation.

             2. in adult CF patients who have undergone lung or liver transplantation.

        2. Assess the correlation between fecal calprotectin and histological-proven intestinal
           inflammation in adult CF patients.

        3. Assess the correlation between histological-proven intestinal inflammation and abdominal
           symptoms/QOL as well as the correlation between fecal calprotectin and abdominal
           symptoms/QOL.
