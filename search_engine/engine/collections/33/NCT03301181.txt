      will receive a single dose of BGB-3111 before and during consecutive daily doses of strong
      cytochrome P450 CYP3A inducer, rifampin, to investigate its effect on the pharmacokinetics of
      BGB-3111. Following an interim data analysis, subjects in Part B will receive a single dose
      of BGB-3111 before and during consecutive daily doses of strong CYP3A inhibitor,
      itraconazole, to investigate its effect on the pharmacokinetics of BGB-3111.
