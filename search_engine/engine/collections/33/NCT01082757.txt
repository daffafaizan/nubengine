      label, multi-centric, multi-stage study to record the prevalence of KRAS mutations in the
      Argentine mCRC population. The study is planned to be conducted in 150 centres (50 in each of
      3 stages of four months each, enrolling 500 subjects in each stage). Total of subjects: 1500.
      Demographic information, complete medical history and tumour history related data will be
      captured in the first visit and if any information is missing, then only another visit will
      be scheduled. Data captured will be analysed and presented using statistical tools.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objective:

        -  To record the prevalence of KRAS mutations in the Argentine mCRC population.

           KRAS mutational status (country, gender, age, performance status, body mass index (BMI),
