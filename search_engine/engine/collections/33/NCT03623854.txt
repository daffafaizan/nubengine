      I. To assess the clinical benefit of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab in patients
      with advanced chordomas by objective response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Ascertain the safety of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab in subjects with
      metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable chordoma by the frequency of adverse events
      (AEs).

      II. Assess the clinical benefit of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab in patients
      with advanced chordomas by progression free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare response rate (RR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients whose tumors are
      PD-L1+ and PD-L1- at baseline.

      II. Compare RR and CBR in patients whose tumors are LAG-3+ and LAG-3- at baseline.

      III. In the patients who are PD-L1 positive, compare RR and CBR in patients with 1% and 5%
      tumor membrane staining.

      III. Determine the response to treatment based on the baseline mutation load. IV. Determine
      the ORR and CBR via Choi criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and relatlimab via infusion
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 100 days.
