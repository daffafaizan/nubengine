      mass index) will be recorded.

      Randomization

      Patients will be randomized into two matched groups:

      A) PRP-Injection Group - Patients in this group will receive three ultrasound guided PRP
      injections in the supraspinatus tendon with one week interval (Ilhanli et al., 2015). After
      the injection, patients will be instructed to limit the use of shoulder for at least 24 hours
      and to use cold therapy for pain. After the third injection, ROM, and stretching exercises
      will be allowed and one month after the end of injections, patients will be recommended to
      begin the strengthening program as tolerated. Exercise is performed with 10 repeats five
      sessions per week.

      B) Physical Therapy Group - Patients in this group will be treated with hot pack for 15
      minutes, ultrasound in continuous mode (1.5 watt/cm2 for five minutes), trans-cutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation in brief-intense mode for 15 minutes, range of motion (ROM),
      followed by stretching and strengthening exercises with 10 repeats 15 sessions (five sessions
      per week for three weeks). After the physical therapy, the exercise program will be continued
      as homework during the follow-up period.
