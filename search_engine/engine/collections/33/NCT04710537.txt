      postoperative outcomes when using DermACELL or AlloDerm, two acellular dermal matrix
      products, in breast reconstruction. Patients who are undergoing bilateral mastectomies with
      tissue expanders and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with one of the investigators' two
      surgeons, Dr. Steven Davison or Dr. Ximena Pinell, are eligible to be enrolled. Patients'
      breasts will be randomized to receive either AlloDerm or DermACELL so that each patient had
      AlloDerm placed in one breast and DermACELL placed in the other on the day of surgery. Then,
      the following data for each breast will be recorded: time until drain removal, total drain
      output, time until first expander fill, and occurrences of infection and seroma.
