    
      Specific Aim 1: Define the clinical impact of gram negative bacterial (GNB) bloodstream
      infections (BSI). In this objective, the investigators will describe the prevalence, source
      of bacteremia, and location of acquisition (i.e., community-acquired, healthcare-associated,
      hospital-acquired) of GNB BSI. The investigators will also examine the outcomes associated
      with GNB BSI including length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, in-house mortality, and
      hospital costs.

      Specific Aim 2: Describe antibiotic resistance patterns in GNB BSI, and explore associations
      between antibiotic resistance and clinical and economic outcomes. In this objective, the
      investigators will describe the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of
      multidrug resistant phenotypes including MDR bacteria, which are defined by resistance to
      three or more drug classes, ESBL-producers, and CRE. The investigators will examine the
      differences in mortality, resource use (length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay), and
      direct medical costs between cases with and without antibiotic resistance.
