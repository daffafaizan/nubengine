      performance and clinical benefits of the G7 Freedom Constrained Liners when used for primary
      and revision total hip arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation) at 5 years follow-up.
      Since G7 Acetabular Cup System has only been on the market since 2015, a prospective
      follow-up will be necessary to obtain data for the 5 year post-surgery time-point for each
      patient.

      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).
