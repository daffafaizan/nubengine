      affected patients will require lifelong care to not only manage their medical condition, but
      also to offer support and guidance on living with their specific heart condition. Exercise
      and physical activity is one such area where patients often require support and advice.
      Recommendations are in place for health care providers to promote physical activity for this
      patient population. However, many health care providers find it difficult to know what level
      of exercise is reasonable or how to escalate current exercise programmes.

      The benefits of regular exercise are well known and evidence suggests that even a modest
      increase in physical activity can reduce morbidity, improve psychological wellbeing and
      protect against cardiovascular disease.

      This pilot study will determine the feasibility of introducing a supported exercise programme
      to clinical practice. The investigators aim to assess if improvements can be made in both
      physical and psychological well-being for adults with CHD who are living in Scotland. After
      initial assessment and baseline measurements are obtained, participants will follow a twelve
      week individualised programme. The investigators will keep in regular contact with the
      participant throughout and arrange interval and final assessments. The baseline measurements
      will be repeated during the final assessment at 12 weeks. Investigators anticipate that the
      study will also help to establish a programme that will help to improve the way adults who
      were born with a heart condition can be supported with physical activity on a long term
      basis.
