      as schizophrenia. In the majority of patients, these AH respond well to antipsychotic
      medication. Yet, a significant minority continues to experience frequent AH despite optimal
      pharmacotherapy and AH severely decrease quality of life in these patients. The number of
      alternative treatment options for this medication resistant group is currently low and most
      of them focus on coping with the hallucinations. Transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS), in contrast, is a safe, non-invasive technique that is able to directly influence
      cortical excitability through the application of very low electric currents. This technique
      has only a few transient side-effects and is cheap and portable. To date, only one randomized
      controlled trial has been published, suggesting high efficacy of tDCS for the treatment of
      medication-resistant AH in a relatively small sample. We aim to replicate and extend these
      findings by investigating the efficacy of this technique in a larger sample.
