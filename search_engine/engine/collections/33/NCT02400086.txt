      ventilation check-up, patients with a long-term tracheostomy and suffering from a
      neurological or neuromuscular disease will be included in the study if they have no sign of
      pneumonia and no contact with a hospital structure within a month. These exclusion criteria
      allow to focus on non-decompensating patient with a respiratory flora not hospital-acquired
      and not modified by antibiotics.

      The doctor in charge of the patient will fill a questionnaire with the help of the patients
      or the patient's family with several items as date of tracheostomy, history of respiratory
      infections, history of hospitalization, characteristics of ventilation (presence of a
      cannula, frequency of change of filter, type of water use in the humidifier…). Beside, a
      tracheal aspirate will be collected and send to the microbiology laboratory for bacterial
      culture. The tracheal aspirate will be supported as a usual clinical tracheal aspirate but
      each bacterial specie will be quantify and identify by mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing will be performed only for potential pathogenic species with a cut-off
      at 105.
