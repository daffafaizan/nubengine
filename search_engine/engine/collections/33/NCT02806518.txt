      the DIEP flap is reestablished by anastomosing the perforator to the internal mammary
      vessels. The selected perforator is crucial for flap survival as it is the only source of
      blood supply to the flap. CTA allows for precise anatomical description of the origin of
      perforators, their intramuscular course and point of fascia penetration but expose the
      patient to ionizing radiation and an intravenous contrast medium.

      DIRT is an imaging method that does not require ionizing radiation or contrast injection. The
      study evaluates if DIRT can be an alternative to CTA in perforator mapping. The study is
      performed in a hospital where DIRT and CTA have been established preoperative imaging methods
      that have been used for several years as routine examinations for all DIEP breast
      reconstruction patients.

      25 patients scheduled for secondary breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap are included.
      Preoperatively, the lower abdomen is examined with hand-held Doppler, DIRT and CTA. Arterial
      Doppler sound locations are marked on the skin.

      DIRT examination involves rewarming of the abdominal skin after a mild cold challenge. The
      locations of hot spots on DIRT are compared with the arterial Doppler sound locations. The
      rate and pattern of rewarming of the hot spots are analyzed. Multiplanar CT reconstructions
      are used to see if hot spots are related to perforators on CTA and intraoperative findings.

      When intraoperative findings confirm that a useful perforator is located at the same
      localization as indicated with DIRT, this perforator is used for DIEP breast reconstruction.
      Postoperatively the surgical outcome and possible complications related to the selected
      perforator are evaluated.
