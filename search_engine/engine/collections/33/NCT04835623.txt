      consent will have an eye exam and will be asked about their medical history to determine
      eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will continue to the second visit the same
      day or up to 10 days later. During the second visit participants will answer questionnaires
      about their eyes and have their vision, eyes, and tears examined. All participants will be
      given CEQUA to use over the duration of the study. The same procedures will be repeated every
      four weeks for 3 months total.
