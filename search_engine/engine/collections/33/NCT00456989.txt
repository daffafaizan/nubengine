      intravenously (in a vein). Doxil is given on the first day of each cycle. Taxotere is given
      once a week for the first 3 weeks of each cycle. This is followed by a week of rest until the
      next cycle starts. Treatment is given on an outpatient basis and hospitalization is not
      anticipated.

      Prior to entry on this study, "screening" tests are performed to determine eligibility to
      participate. This will involve a complete history and physical examination, vital signs, pain
      assessment, blood tests including CBC (complete blood count), serum chemistry, and PSA
      (prostate specific antigen), x-rays (chest x-ray, possible plain films of bones if there are
      abnormal findings on bone scan for clarification), computerized tomography (CT) scans of the
      abdomen and pelvis, bone scans, a MUGA scan or 2-D echocardiogram, and a quality of life
      questionnaire.

      After treatment starts the following tests are done to regularly monitor for beneficial and
      toxic effect of the treatment:

      Every week: blood tests.

      Every month: physical examination, weight, vital signs (blood pressure, respiration,
      temperature and heart rate) and PSA test.

      Every 2 months: pain assessment, quality of life questionnaire, x-rays (chest x-ray and
      possible pain films of bones if positive findings are seen on bone scan), computerized
      tomography (CT) scans (abdomen and pelvis) and bone scans.

      Participants may continue with any procedures that are part of their regular cancer care. It
      is anticipated that participants will be in the study for a minimum of 2 months and as long
      as they are benefiting from the treatment.
