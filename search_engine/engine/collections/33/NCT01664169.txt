        -  To determine whether the observed predictive value of plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 for
           overall survival (OS) in study BO17706 can be replicated in study CALGB-80303 using the
           same Immunological Multiparameter Chip Technology (IMPACT) assay.

        -  To determine whether the observed predictive value of plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 for
           progression-free survival (PFS), and other circulating biomarkers in study BO17706, can
           be replicated in study CALGB-80303 using the same IMPACT assay.

        -  To explore the relationship between efficacy and other biomarkers measured in the plasma
           samples.

      OUTLINE: The samples required for this study are stored in the CALGB Pathology Coordinating
      Office at The Ohio State University from patients enrolled on protocol CALGB-80303. No
      additional samples are required from patients.

      The following markers are analyzed in EDTA plasma samples using the Immunological
      MultiParameter Chip Technology (IMPACT) a Roche proprietary multiplex enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform: VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, E-selectin, VEGF-R3,
      IL-8, bFGF, PDGF-C, ICAM-1, and PlGF.
