      Prostate cancer treatment emulating HDR brachytherapy:

      Feasibility trial of twice high dose radiotherapy using Tomotherapy in patients with organ
      confined Prostate Cancer histologically proven. The study involves 2 steps:

      A) Assessment of safety as proportion of patients with acute â‰¥G3 Genito-urinary (GU) and
      Gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects on the first 16 enrolled patients; B) evaluation of
      primary and secondary objectives on overall patients. Thirty-one patients will be enrolled,
      with histologically confirmed very low , low and intermediate risk prostate cancer following
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories guidelines. Patient should
      not be eligible to prostatectomy or patient's should refuse to undergo surgery.
