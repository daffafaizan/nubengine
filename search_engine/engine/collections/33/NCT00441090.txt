    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging,
      parallel-group study. The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
      relationship of avatrombopag will also be studied. Approximately 65 eligible participants
      will be randomized in a 3:3:3:3:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion into one of five parallel
      treatment groups to receive daily doses of either avatrombopag 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg or placebo
      for 28 days, respectively. Each avatrombopag dosing group will consist of 15 participants
      while the placebo group will consist of 5 participants. All study participants will be
      evaluated weekly (Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28) for safety, efficacy, and (Days 7, 14, 21, and
      28) avatrombopag PK while receiving study treatment with a final assessment for safety and
      effectiveness to be done 2 weeks after the last study dose (Day 42).

      At the completion of Visit Day 28±1, participants who complete 28±1 days of study dosing will
      be assessed for eligibility to enroll into the rollover Study 501-CL-004 (NCT00625443) based
      on this visit.
