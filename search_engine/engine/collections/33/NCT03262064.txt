      ongoing damage, is essential but often fruitless, and the focus of therapy rapidly turns to
      empiric treatments to prevent infective exacerbations and retard disease progression. The
      British Thoracic Society Bronchiectasis management guidelines provide an in-depth summary of
      the available literature and are an excellent tool for guiding treatment decision making.
      However, they do not provide guidance on which patients are most likely to benefit from
      specific interventions.Disease severity in bronchiectasis is hard to define. Radiological
      severity grading scores exist; however, there is often a disconnect between radiological
      severity, symptom burden and disease progressionIn 2014, competing bronchiectasis severity
      scores were published (FACED and the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI).

      In each of these, a combination of patient demographics, symptom scores, comorbidities, and
      clinical, radiological and microbiological parameters were used to construct scoring systems.

      In case of the BSI, it predicted future mortality, and in the case of FACED, extended to
      prediction of future exacerbation frequency, hospitalisation and quality of life.These
      severity scores have utility in identifying an individual's risk of disease progression to a
      predefined outcome and aid in sub classifying this heterogeneous group of patients in a
      manner that may pave the way to future mechanistic studies, which explain how these different
      disease phenotypes arise and inform the development of targeted therapeutics.
