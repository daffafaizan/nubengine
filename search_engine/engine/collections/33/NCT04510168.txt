      lack of high-resolution arterial wall imaging, the preponderance of research focused on
      intracranial large artery atherosclerosis (ILAA) and the lack of mechanistic studies. This
      study aims to address these shortcomings. By using high-resolution brain arterial wall
      imaging in participants in the NOMAS cohort, the investigators will derive a wall-based
      measure of non-atherosclerotic BAA and relate it to pre-MRI cognitive trajectories, AD risk,
      and ipsilateral markers of neurodegeneration including AÎ²/tau PET imaging.
