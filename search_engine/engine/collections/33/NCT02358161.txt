      prevent efficient delivery of various anticancer therapies to the tumor, but also constitutes
      a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumors that is critically involved in tumor formation,
      progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting both tumor stroma and cancer cells could be a
      lucrative strategy to increase the efficacy of our therapeutic approach.

      In the present study we want to explore the safety and activity of the chemotherapy
      combination: Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + LDE225. LDE225 is a hedgehog inhibitor with
      promising antitumor activity in several cancer models, including pancreatic cancer. One of
      the main activities is also the degradation of the tumor matrix.

      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with fixed
      doses of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, the same doses used in the recently presented phase
      III study (von Hoff American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013). In the phase I part of
      the study LDE225 will be added according to standard dose escalation strategy for phase I
      studies, and at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) patients will be treated in the phase II
      part of the study.
