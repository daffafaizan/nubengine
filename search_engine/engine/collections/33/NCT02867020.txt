      the appropriate active therapy for the patient population planned for this study. Recent data
      showed that chemotherapy also benefit patients in this setting. Even though, there is a clear
      unmet medical need for alternative treatment option in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate
      cancer (mHSPC). Treatments that can delay disease progression, and are associated with less
      comorbidities would be of significant clinical benefit in this patient population. The study
      is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of abiraterone plus APALUTAMIDE (a
      second-generation antiandrogen) or APALUTAMIDE alone without castration side effects and the
      other arm a combination of ADT and abiraterone; this last arm is to reflect an Abiraterone
      ongoing pivotal trial (LATITUDE), that assess the efficacy of adding abiraterone to
      castration in this setting of patients. Abiraterone had already showed clinical benefit in
      CRPC patients without prior chemotherapy.
