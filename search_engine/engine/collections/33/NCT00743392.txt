      infections from new sex partners is largely unknown. This is a longitudinal study of
      predictors of HR HPV infections in two populations of women aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 65 who
      have used internet dating websites in the past year. 300 women will be recruited and mailed
      kits for self-collecting vaginal specimens for HPV DNA testing. Women will self-collect four
      sets of vaginal specimens four months apart, and complete sexual behavior questionnaires at
      the time of each self-collection. We will identify behavioral and health predictors of
      type-specific HR HPV infections, predictors of repeatedly-detected HR HPV infections, and
      evaluate study participants' experiences with self-collecting vaginal specimens and attitudes
      towards HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. This information is important for
      developing guidelines for HPV vaccine implementation and cervical cancer screening guidelines
      in populations of older women.
