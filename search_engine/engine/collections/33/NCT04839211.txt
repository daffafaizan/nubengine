      catabolism, and prolonged immobilization, causing inspiratory muscle weakness. Cardiac
      rehabilitation is a well-known treatment approach in heart failure however, the participation
      rate in cardiac rehabilitation is low. Therefore, inspiratory muscle training may serve as an
      alternative approach in patients with heart failure.

      Patients will be randomly allocated into the inspiratory muscle training group and control
      group. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group will carry out IMT sessions three days per
      week for 8 weeks by using an inspiratory threshold loading device. Each session will consist
      of seven cycles including 2 min of breathing on an inspiratory loading device followed by 1
      min of rest and will last 21 min. IMT will be performed at the tolerable maximum load for
      each 2-min work interval and will be progressively increased over the 8 weeks. The control
      group will perform unloaded IMT by using an inspiratory threshold loading device during all
      training sessions. Data will be collected before and after the treatment by a masked outcome
      assessor.
