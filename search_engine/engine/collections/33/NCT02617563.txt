    
      In this Prospective, Global (multi center), Post Market Release (PMR) Study, Patients will be
      submitted to a single or double level instrumented fusion procedure using a PLIF, TLIF, ALIF,
      OLIF, DLIF or MIDLF technique via a minimally invasive procedure and will receive the same
      medical treatment as if they would not participate in this study.

        -  The study will be monitored with visits conducted at the start, during and at the
           closure of the clinical study.

        -  MedDRA coding will be used to classify the Adverse Event.

        -  The study will be conducted according to Medtronic SOPs

        -  Sample size calculation: Assuming that the standard deviation for ODI improvement at 3
           months is 20 for both groups (anterolateral and posterior) and there is no difference in
           the mean ODI improvement at 3 months, with 80% power and 5% alpha level, the sample size
           for the primary endpoint (DDD patients operated for spondylolisthesis) is as follows in
           order to claim equivalence between two groups with equivalent margin (-10, 10):

        -  Estimated sample size per group (anterolateral procedures versus posterior procedures):
           70

        -  Estimated total sample size for spondylolisthesis patients: 140

        -  From the MASTERS-D study it is know that approximately 50% of the patients with
           degenerative disc disease have spondylolisthesis ≥ grade I. Hence the required total
           sample size is 140/0.5 = 280. The study is anticipated to enroll 350 patients.

        -  In addition to a final statistical analysis, 3 months and annual interim analyses are
           anticipated.

        -  The study hypothesis for the primary objective is to verify whether patients operated
           for spondylolisthesis (≥ grade I) have equivalent mean improvement of ODI at 3 months
           regardless of the minimally invasive surgical procedure (anterolateral or posterior)
           used.

        -  The null-hypothesis: Ho: Δ ODI_Anterolateral ≠ Δ ODI_posterior

        -  will be tested against the alternative hypothesis: HA: Δ ODI_Anterolateral = Δ
           ODI_posterior Where Δ ODI_Anterolateral is the average improvement in ODI score
           (baseline - 3 months) in spondylolisthesis subjects treated with the anterolateral
           approach and Δ ODI_posterior is the average improvement in ODI score (baseline - 3
           months) in spondylolisthesis subjects treated with the posterior approach.
