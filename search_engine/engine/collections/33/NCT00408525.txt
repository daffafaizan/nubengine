        1. Cognitively intact individuals with normal brain morphology at genetic risk for
           developing Alzheimer's' Disease (AD) show alterations in brain activation patterns
           during tasks that require memory compared to similar individuals with lower risk for
           developing AD.

        2. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, can normalize such brain activation patterns in
           subjects at risk for AD.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To replicate a recent study1, and compare brain activation in subjects genetically at
           risk for AD (carriers of the є4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE)) with
           subjects at lower risk for AD (lacking the є4 allele) during tasks that require memory,
           via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

        2. To determine if administration of a drug currently indicated in the treatment of AD,
           donepezil, can reverse fMRI brain activation patterns of at risk subjects to patterns
           similar to those of subjects at lower genetic risk for AD.
