    
      Primary objective

      To demonstrate non-futility of domperidone for reducing progression of disability, as
      measured with the timed 25 foot walk (T25FW), in secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis
      (SPMS).

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the safety of domperidone in the study population for the duration of the
           study.

        -  To assess the effect of domperidone on hand dexterity as measured with the 9HPT

        -  To assess the effect of domperidone on cognition, as measured with the SDMT

        -  To assess the effect of domperidone on health related quality of life, as measured with
           the MSQOL-54

        -  To assess the effect of domperidone on fatigue, as measured with the MFIS

        -  To establish the Simon-2-stage model as a study model in MS research. The application of
           this methodology to studies in progressive MS will have important consequences for the
           design and conduct of clinical and translational research in progressive MS, in
           particular for phase II trials in progressive MS
