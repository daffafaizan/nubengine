      impact of AKI, up to 40-50% of patients. Postoperative increased serum creatinine is a late
      marker for the AKI. Furthermore, perioperative hemodilution and serum creatinine kinetic
      delay the postoperative peak of serum creatinine from 48 to 72 h.

      NephrocheckÂ® test combines the urinary dosage of 2 proteins (TIMP2 and IGFBP7). These 2
      proteins are excreted by the tubular cell in case of suffering whatever the origin, for
      example tissue hypoxia by low renal blood flow or a systemic inflammatory response. In a
      medical ICU, the test performed within 4 to 12 hours after kidney aggression can predict the
      onset of persistent AKI beyond 4 weeks.

      Until randomization, all patients are treated according to the standard of care for the
      center. This includes a blood test upon arrival in the intensive care unit and continuous
      monitoring of vital parameters.
