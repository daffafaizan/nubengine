      hundred and forty AMI patients (according to all the inclusion criteria and did not meet any
      exclusion criteria) who were enrolled in the culprit who had a lesion stenosis ≤70% and who
      had TIMI blood flow grade 3 or residual stenosis ≤70% after thrombus aspiration and TIMI
      grade 3 were randomized Enter the OCT guidance group or the imaging guide group. For the OCT
      guidance group, if the OCT examination indicates that the patient's lesion features a plaque
      rupture, dissection, and severe calcification, the stent is implanted. If the lesion is
      characterized by plaque erosion, conservative treatment with drugs is used. For the contrast
      guide group, the surgeon judges the lesion according to the current treatment standard and
      decides whether to implant the stent. All subjects underwent outpatient follow-up in January
      after discharge from the hospital. Exercise stress test was needed to assess whether any
      recurrent ischemic events occurred. At 3, 6 and 9 months, telephone or outpatient visits were
      used. Follow-up visits were performed at the 12th month of follow-up and coronary angiography
      was performed. At each follow-up, general conditions, uncomfortable complaints, oral
      medications, recent related test results, and adverse events were required.
