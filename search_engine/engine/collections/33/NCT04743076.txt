    
      At least seven randomized controlled trials have consistently shown that endovascular
      treatment can improve the functional outcome of stroke patients with acute anterior large
      vessel occlusion. However, these trials did not include patients with large vessel occlusion
      in the posterior circulation.

      The hypothesis of this trial: Compared with standard medical treatment alone, standard
      medical treatment combined with endovascular treatment can significantly improve the 90-day
      functional outcome of acute large vessel occlusion in the posterior circulation.
