    
      Competitive swimmers, competitive indoor athletes and control individuals performing sports
      at a recreational level will be recruited for the study.

      They will perform a sport-specific training (swimmers and controls: swimming for 90 minutes,
      indoor athletes: basketball or volleyball for 90 minutes)

      Baseline measurements:

        -  Airway inflammation upper and lower airways will be assessed by collection of nasal
           fluid (nasal sponge will be inserted in nostril for 5 minutes), Fraction of exhaled
           Nitric Oxide measurement and sputum induction.

        -  Upper and lower airway symptoms will be assessed by questionnaires (SinoNasal Outcome
           Measure-22, Visual Analogue Score, Asthma Symptom Score and Juniper Score)

        -  Allergy will be assessed by skin prick test (on skin) and immunocap test (in blood, 1
           tube of 10 ml).

        -  Lung function and nasal patency will be measured by spirometry and Peak Nasal
           Inspiratory Flow measurement.

        -  Exercise induced bronchoconstriction will be assessed by eucapnic voluntary
           hyperventilation test.

      Measurements immediately after training:

        -  Collection of nasal fluid

        -  Assessment of upper airway symptoms (Visual Analogue Score)

        -  Spirometry and Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide measurement

        -  Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow measurement

      Measurements 24 hours after training:

        -  Collection of nasal fluid

        -  Assessment of upper airway symptoms (Visual Analogue Score)

        -  Spirometry and Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide measurement

        -  Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow measurement

        -  Sputum induction

        -  Venous puncture (1 tube of 10 ml)
