      include patients who require dermatological advice and for whom their doctor sends us
      photographs.

      Doctors contact us by telephone, describe the symptoms and send photographs according to the
      secure procedure.

      Patients are admitted for consultation and the diagnosis by photography is compared with the
      clinical diagnosis
