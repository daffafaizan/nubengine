    
      This is a multicenter study in the treatment of NVP that will actively recruit pregnant
      adolescents from approximately 14-16 study sites in the United States. After obtaining
      informed consent on Day 1, a medical examination will be conducted to ensure eligibility.
      Participants will be randomized to receive Diclegis or placebo. On Day 1, all participants
      will take 2 tablets of study drug at bedtime. On Days 2 to 14, participants will take 2
      tablets of study drug at bedtime. The minimum dosage will be 2 tablets daily at bedtime,
      increasing, when indicated, to the maximal dosage of 4 tablets per day on Days 3 to 14.
      Participants will be required to complete a diary daily to assess the severity of their NVP
      by using the validated Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) and to record any AEs
      experienced; the Global Assessment of Well being scale will be completed only on Days 1, 8
      and 15. Participants will receive telephone calls daily to assess whether the current dosing
      regimen is sufficient at relieving NVP symptoms, to review study procedures, and to address
      her questions/concerns. Participants will return to the clinic for evaluation on Day 4 (±1
      day) and Day 15 (±1 day) for an end of study visit.

      Eligible participants are those between 12 and 17 years of age, pregnant with a gestational
      age of 7 to 15 weeks + 0 days, suffering from NVP, with a PUQE score ≥6, and who have not
      responded to conservative management consisting of dietary/lifestyle advice according to the
      2004 American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) Practice Bulletin.
