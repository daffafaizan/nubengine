      the risk of 2-year stroke recurrence was as high as 22.7%. Ipsilateral stroke and hemodynamic
      decline are independent risk factors for stroke recurrence in patients with carotid artery
      occlusion. In addition, long-term cerebral hypoperfusion and decreased cerebrovascular
      reactivity in patients with carotid artery occlusion may lead to cognitive impairment.

      At present, the recanalization time window of anterior circulation large vessel occlusive
      stroke has been extended to 24 hours under certain evaluation approaches. In order to
      distinguish from the emergency treatment within 24 hours, patients with carotid artery
      occlusion over 24 hours are collectively referred as non-acute occlusion.

      With the maturity of endovascular technique and the advances of interventional devices,
      endovascular treatment has become a hotspot of clinical research in this field. Case reports
      have emerged and prospective studies suggest that recanalization of chronic carotid occlusion
      may improve the cognitive functions. However, the clinical benefit of endovascular treatment
      for symptomatic non-acute carotid artery occlusion remained controversial.

      The purpose of this study is to establish and verify the efficacy of a multi-dimensional
      evaluation system of endovascular treatment and recanalization of symptomatic non-acute
      carotid occlusion.
