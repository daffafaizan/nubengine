      patients who fail to improve oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 increase over 20%) in the first 24h or 8h
      after diagnosis will be enrolled. A salvage package of 10^6/kg suspended UCMSCs in 100ml
      normal saline or only 100ml normal saline will be infused through central venous catheter.
      Infusion associated events (IAEs) in 24 hours will be closely monitored. Compared with
      propensity score matched controls, mortality in 28 days as the primary outcomes. oxygenation
      index, ventilator parameters, lung injury biomarkers and clinical outcomes as secondary
      outcomes will be analyzed.

      This is a revised trail from its previous registered pilot RCT, approved by Ethic Committe of
      Stem Cells Trails (ECSCT) of 3rd affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-Sen university
