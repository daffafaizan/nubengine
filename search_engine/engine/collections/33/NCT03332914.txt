      of microcurrent therapy on pain and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the
      knee. The secondary objective was to compare the effects of different currents. (group 1 - 4)
      After receiving 10 sessions of microcurrent therapy the statistical calculation showed a
      slightly significant difference in the verum-group A (Parameters Channel A: Channel B,
      Frequency ...) After a wash-out-phase we are now trying to evaluate and possibly confirm the
      positive effect of the previous trial. Therefore the control - and sham group from the
      previous study will now receive microcurrent therapy of apparatus A.

      The whole procedure (Number of session, duration of the treatments, main outcome
      measurements, secondary outcome measurements) of the following study is identical with the
      previous pilot study. Assessments four the group will be at the first day of treatment (T1)
      and at the end of Treatment (T2).
