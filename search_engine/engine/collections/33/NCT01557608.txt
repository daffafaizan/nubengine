      evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of chemotherapy induced
      neuropathy(CIN)in a sample of oncology patients who have completed their chemotherapy and
      did(n=400)and did not (n=200) develop CIN. Patients with and without CIN will be matched, in
      a 2 to 1 ratio, on their cancer diagnosis and CTX agents administered (i.e., only a platinum
      compound, only a taxane, or both). Patients will be recruited in cohorts of 30 to 40 to
      insure that the matching criteria are met and the 2:1 ratio is achieved.

      In a single study visit, to take place at the outpatient CTSI CRC (CCRC) at Mt.
      Zion,participants will be enrolled, complete a battery of sensorimotor tests and
      questionnaires, and provide a single blood specimen for genomic analysis.

      Part 2 will be a pilot study of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      (RDBPCT) of photon stimulation in a sample of patients (n=142) with CIN who participated in
      Part 1. Participants will be randomized to receive the active treatment or the placebo in a
      series of 8 treatments, lasting 7 minutes each, across a 14-day period. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline and after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th treatments with sensory, motor,
      balance, pain intensity and pain quality measures, mood, and quality of life measures. Blood
      specimens will be drawn on treatment days 1, 4, 5, and 8 for gene expression.
