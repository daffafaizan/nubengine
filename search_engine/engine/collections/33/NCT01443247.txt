      emergency medical opd / medicine opd were screened and all dengue serology positive patients
      were evaluated for enrolment into the study. We had proposed to enroll 30 patients with

      clinical history ,general physical examination and the lab tests : thrombocytopenia (
      platelet count ≤ 20,000 ) ,and a positive dengue serology.

      intervention group ) received platelet support along with injection anti-d in a dose of 50
      µg/kg (250IU/kg) intravenously while the other group of 15 ( control group) received platelet
      support only . a base line platelet count of all the participant of both the study groups was
      taken and then the level of platelets at 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48hr post treatment initiation
      was noted. The patients were followed till the time of discharge .
