      treatment- resistant hypertensive patients to restore more normal blood pressure control,
      which will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. This strategy
      will increase the number of therapeutic options available to many patients and their
      physicians as well as offering the potential of normal blood pressure to those patients in
      whom blood pressure remains elevated despite vigorous, drug or device based therapies.
