      bupivacaine which allows for prolonged release of bupivacaine over a 72-hour period.
      Bupivacaine is a medium acting local anesthetic which provides between 6 and 24 hours of
      analgesia when used in a peripheral nerve block. Both medications are standard of care for
      use in interscalene blocks here at the U of MN.

      LB has not been adequately studied in peripheral nerve blocks and has yet to be studied for
      use in interscalene blocks for Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) patients. It has been
      studied in Rotator Cuff Repairs (RCR) surgery and showed superior analgesia compared to
      bupivacaine.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if LB plus bupivacaine provides superior pain
      control compared to bupivacaine alone when injected in an interscalene block for patients
      undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty surgery.
