      experience decisional conflict when weighing options regarding place of care. Community Case
      Managers and Nurses are well positioned to identify decisional needs and provide decision
      support; however, they generally lack skills and confidence in doing so. This study aims to
      determine whether the quality of case managers' and nurses' decision support can be improved
      with a theory-based skills-building intervention.

      In phase one a needs assessment will be conducted with about 20 key informants. In phase two,
      nurses will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The intervention,
      informed by the needs assessment, is comprised of: an auto-tutorial; an interactive skills
      building workshop; a decision support protocol; performance feedback, and educational
      outreach.

      Participants will be assessed: a) at baseline (quality of decision support); b) after the
      auto-tutorial (knowledge); and six to eight weeks after the other interventions (quality of
      decision support; confidence and intention to integrate decision support into practice).
      Between group differences in the primary outcome (quality of decision support scores) will be
      analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA.
