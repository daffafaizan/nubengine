    
      A placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-arm Phase Ib clinical trial assessing two doses of
      a commercially available curcuminoid formulation with enhanced bioavailability vs. placebo in
      a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population is proposed. The primary aim of this clinical planning
      study is to determine the dose-dependent tolerability of an enhanced bioavailability
      curcuminoid formulation in an RA population, including pharmacokinetic analyses, to inform
      the design of a future Phase II trial assessing the anti-inflammatory efficacy of
      curcuminoids in the treatment of RA. Secondarily, estimates of effect size for changes in
      known biomarkers of inflammation in RA will be determined.
