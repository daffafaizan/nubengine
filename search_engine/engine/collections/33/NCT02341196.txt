      compared to carotid patches in polyester including death, any stroke, carotid thrombosis at
      30 days and long-term results including stroke and recurrent carotid stenosis at 10 years.

      598 patients were considered for randomisation between January 1995 and January 2004. The
      following patients were excluded for randomisation (Redo carotid surgery: N=34, radiation
      induced carotid stenosis:N=45, indication for carotid bypass: N=65, Refusal of randomisation:
      N=4).

      In total, 450 patients were randomized in two groups, 225 received a polyester patch and 225
      received a polyurethane patch.

      All patients were operated under general anaesthesia and all received an intraoperative
      angiography. A shunt was selectively used in patients with a recent stroke (<15 days) or with
      a contralateral carotid occlusion
