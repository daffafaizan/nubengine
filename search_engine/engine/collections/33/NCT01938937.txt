      the study, subjects have to get at least seven points in BAI(Becks Anxiety Inventory). At the
      beginning of the study subject will be randomly assigned to 12 minutes of acute transcranial
      bright light or placebo exposure group. Anxiety symptoms will be measured using Spielberger
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, form Y1)self-rating questionnaire just before and 10 and
      110 minutes after the experiment.
