    
      This is an open-label, dose-ranging trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an
      orally administered adenoviral-vector based vaccine (VXA-COV2-1) expressing a SARS-CoV-2
      antigen and dsRNA adjuvant. Post screening activities, healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 54
      yrs old, inclusive, will be enrolled into the study. Participants will receive an oral dose
      of vaccine at Days 1 and a subject will also receive a second dose at Day 29; total study
      period will last ~ 2 months during the active phase, with a total 12 month safety follow-up
      period post last vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments will be
      performed at set times during the study active and follow-up periods. Subjects will be
      monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the duration of the study follow-up period.
