      growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), Fas Ligand (FasL),
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) in serum and aqueous humor between type 2
      diabetes mellitus patients, without clinically evident diabetic retinopathy or diabetic
      macular edema, and nondiabetic cataract patients.

      Investigators also investigated whether concentrations of immunoregulatory molecules
      significantly correlated with intraoperative and postoperative parameters. Particularly,
      investigators focused on the development of corneal edema as one of the main causes of low
      visual acuity in the immediate postoperative period after intraocular lens implantation.

      Since disturbed cytokine and growth factor microenvironment in diabetic eye may contribute to
      an increased frequency of intraoperative and postoperative intraocular lens (IOL) surgery
      complications, the findings may be relevant for the development of therapeutic strategies
      aimed to restore protein profile of immunoregulatory factors in parallel to cataract
      treatment.
