    
      Phase 1: To assess the safety and tolerability of Nab-paclitaxel added to oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine at their currently optimal doses.

      Phase 2: To determine the anti-tumor activity of Nab-paclitaxel when co-administered with
      oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with irresectable or metastasized oesophagogastric
      cancer in terms of progression free survival.

      Study design This is a single-center, open label, dose finding, phase I/II study.

      Intervention In the phase I part of the study, the dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination of
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin will be escalated in fixed increments according to the dose
      escalation scheme outlined below

      Dose level Nab-paclitaxel Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Minimum Day 1 and 8 14 days Day 1 and 8
      number of patients -1 40 mg/m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 -

        1. (starting) 60 mg/m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        2. 80 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        3. 100 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        4. 120 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

      In the phase II part of the study the maximum tolerated dose from the phase I part of the
      study will be used in combination with fixed dosages of capecitabine and oxaliplatin;
      nab-paclitaxel day 1 and 8 according to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the phase 1 part
      of the study combined with capecitabine for 14 days at 1000mg/m2 twice daily and oxaliplatin
      day 1 and 8 65mg/m2.
