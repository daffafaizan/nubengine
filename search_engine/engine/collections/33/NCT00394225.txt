      walking test (6MWT) distance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) subjects.

      This was a blinded, randomized crossover study. At Visit 1 we assessed pulmonary function,
      exercise capacity and 6MWT distance. Visits 2 and 3 consisted of four 6MWT with different
      inspired gases: room air by mask (RA), 100% O2 by mask (Mask O2), 100% O2 by nasal prongs
      (Nasal O2), and 70% He/30% O2 by mask (HeO2). Walking distance, shortness of breath, leg
      fatigue, O2 saturation and heart rate (HR) were assessed
