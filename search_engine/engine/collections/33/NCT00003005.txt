      of cordycepin, given 1 hour following a fixed dose of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor
      pentostatin, in patients with refractory TdT positive leukemia. II. Determine the single and
      multiple dose pharmacokinetics of cordycepin given 1 hour following a fixed dose of
      pentostatin. III. Characterize selected whole blood and blast cell metabolic parameters
      serially in relation to cordycepin/pentostatin administration. IV. Measure and quantify any
      clinical responses in refractory TdT positive leukemia patients following
      cordycepin/pentostatin administration.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Each treatment course is 28 days in length. On days
      1-3 pentostatin is administered over 5 minutes by IV bolus and followed 1 hour later by a 1
      hour infusion of cordycepin IV. An escalating dose of pentostatin is given with a fixed dose
      of cordycepin until the desired level of adenosine deaminase inhibition is observed. After
      this is determined, a dose escalation schedule for cordycepin is initiated to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when given in combination with pentostatin. The MTD is
      determined by the number of patients who exhibit dose limiting toxicity and the severity of
      the toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued.
