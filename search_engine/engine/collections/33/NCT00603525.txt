    
      This study consist of a double-blind, placebo controlled, and parallel group part with
      eligible patients enrolled into a 24 week Double-Blind Period, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive either ofatumumab or placebo in addition to their background methotrexate
      treatment. Patients who complete the 24 week Double-blind Period without receiving rescue
      DMARD treatment will then be eligible to proceed into the 120 week Open-label Period to
      receive repeat treatment courses with ofatumumab. In the Open-label Period ofatumumab
      treatment courses will be given at individualized time intervals only if a clinical response
      has been achieved following the previous treatment course, and followed by a subsequent
      worsening in disease activity.

      Patients who have completed the Open-label Period or have been withdrawn will then enter a
      maximum 2 year Follow-up Period, or until there B-cells return to normal or to baseline
      levels, whichever occurs earlier
