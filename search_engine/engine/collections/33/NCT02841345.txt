      similarities and distinctions between bipolar and schizophrenic patients in emotional
      information processing.

      Specifically, these are:

        1. better understand what level of emotional information processing both conditions differ
           or are comparable and in what direction

        2. assess specifically in both pathologies, emotional regulation deficits through the
           realization of different cognitive tasks when processing emotional information.

      To answer these questions, the investigators developed an original protocol imaging
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to specifically target different information processing
      channels playing on the nature of the spatial frequency content of emotional natural scenes
      (see Methods). emotional regulation deficits in both disorders will be addressed in part
      through here 3 types of tasks: 1) a simple task perception and 2) -3) two tasks
      categorization of which centered on the emotional feelings of the individual (task affective)
      and the tendency to action (motivational task). Both tasks categorization should involve more
      specifically the Prefrontal Cortex-Ventro Median (CPFVM) and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex-Dorso
      (DLPFC), respectively, distinguishing between the two categories of patients. All patient
      data will be compared to healthy control participants.

      This project will also allow us to improve our knowledge in bipolar and schizophrenic
      patients compared with control subjects, i) on the brain structures of networks involved in
      emotional information processing and emotional regulation, ii) functional relationships still
      unclear between neural structures involved in both processes and iii) the nature of the
      information passing through these networks.
