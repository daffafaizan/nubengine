    
      Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) is one of the main non pharmacologic treatments for patients
      with severe lung disease. This continuous or sub-continuous oxygen supplementation is
      generally introduced at home in patients who have chronic cardio respiratory failure and
      severe resting hypoxemia to maintain sufficient blood oxygenation and therefore preserve
      vital organ function.

      LTOT effectiveness has mainly been evaluated and documented in patients with COPD, which also
      accounts for most of its prescriptions. In these patients, LTOT has been shown to have a
      beneficial impact on haemodynamics, exercise capacity, lung mechanics and mental state. Its
      implementation was furthermore associated with reduced yearly hospitalisation days and
      increased survival Measuring adherence is an extremely important and under-evaluated
      component of oxygen therapy. NOWOX, medical device has been designed,developed and
      manufactured to measure adherence to LTOT and additionally to measure patient's respiration
