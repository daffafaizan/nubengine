      I. To determine the self-reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) specific psychological
      distress in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors diagnosed between the ages of
      15 to 39 and are currently between the ages of 18 to 39.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the COVID-19 specific health care utilization, health behavior, financial and
      social disruptions, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

      II. To determine associations between patient demographic and treatment-related variables
      with COVID-19 specific psychological distress, healthcare utilization, health behavior,
      financial and social disruptions, and HRQoL.

      III. To determine associations between resilience factors (i.e., social support, perceived
      benefits under times of stress, and the ability to manage stress) with self-reported COVID-19
      specific psychological distress, healthcare utilization, health behavior, financial and
      social disruptions, and HRQoL.

      IV. To determine the changes in COVID-19 specific psychosocial distress, healthcare
      utilization, health behavior, financial, and social disruptions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and survivors complete a survey online over 20-30 minutes at baseline about COVID-19
      specific psychological distress, health care utilization, health behavior, social and
      financial disruptions, HRQoL, their social support, perceived benefits under times of stress,
      and the ability to manage stress. Patients and survivors may be contacted again at 6 months
      and 1 year for COVID-19 research.
