      receiving low dose vaccination and two receiving the higher dose, both intranasally. The
      first group per dose will be the safety lead-in. All volunteers will be consented for receipt
      of a booster vaccine (5x10^10vp ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 IN) at approximately 4 weeks post first
      vaccine. Volunteers in Group 1 (1a and 1b, n=6) and Groups 2 (2a and 2b, n=24) will be
      randomly allocated 1:1 to receive booster vaccine or not, stratified by first dose level.
