      day's 3 meals to establish baseline insulin requirements. Patients will be dosed with
      exogenous insulin according to their normal sliding scale and each patient's daily insulin
      requirement will be documented. The average daily insulin requirements during the 3 day
      run-in period will constitute the patient's baseline insulin level.

      Following the 3 day run-in, the CGM device will be detached, its data download, and the
      patient refitted with the CGM with a fresh cannula for continued monitoring during the 7-day
      treatment period.

      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive ORMD-0801 or placebo for the 7-day double-blind
      treatment period.
