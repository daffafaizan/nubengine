    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) and observational study. Patients selected for the proposed study are patients
      complaining of cancer pain who visit or are hospitalized at the research centers during the
      study, who are not being treated with strong continuous opioid (narcotic medication used
      against the pain), and who require cancer pain control with hydromorphone, at the
      investigator's discretion. The study will evaluate the changes in pain relief, level of sleep
      deprivation, and the patients' quality of life before and after administration of
      hydromorphone.
