      melanosomal antigen tyrosinase by in vivo electroporation in patients with malignant
      melanoma. The objectives of the study are to characterize the safety and immunogenicity of a
      DNA vaccine encoding the murine tyrosinase gene delivered administered intramuscularly using
      the electroporation based TriGrid Delivery System (Ichor Medical Systems). We will assess the
      nature, frequency, and severity of any toxicity associated with vaccination at escalating
      pINGmuTyr doses and then expand enrollment at then expand enrollment at the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose to assess immunologic responses to the tyrosinase antigen.

      The hypotheses being tested are that the procedure is feasible and safe and that it induces
      immune responses specific for tyrosinase in patients with stage IIB-IV malignant melanoma.
