    
      In this prospective observational study, paediatric and adult outpatients presenting with
      influenza-like illness will be enrolled at the emergency departments of the University
      Hospital Basel (USB), the paediatric University Hospital of both Basel (UKBB), or a network
      of family doctors (associated with Center of Primary Health Care).

      The Clinical Trial Unit at the University Hospital Basel will coordinated the recruitment
      process, collect data and sample all patients during the influenza season 2016/17. Samples
      will be collected such as whole blood, serum and DNA, nasopharyngeal swamps to diagnose
      influenza by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and to determine colonization rates with
      Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia. All samples except the first
      naso-pharyngeal swab for influenza diagnostics will be stored in a biobank and analysed in
      batches. Each influenza virus isolate will be sequenced using a "whole genome sequencing"
      approach. The viral transmission and evolution will be analysed using whole genome data for a
      detailed molecular and phylogenetic tree analysis, respectively. The epidemiological and
      geographical data will be incorporated into the phylogenetic model.

      Specific aims are:

      (i) to determine the impact of the most important epidemiological parameters, first focusing
      on the age profile, followed by children per house hold, and population density, on influenza
      transmission at an individual and population level, drawing on an analysis of baseline
      humoral immunity and whole genome sequencing data, (ii) to understand the viral evolution
      during seasonal epidemics, (iii) to develop dynamic mathematical models that are able to
      predict viral transmission and evolution based on the retrospective results from (i) and (ii)
      and to validate this model in future influenza seasons.

      To realize the interdisciplinary approach, the investigators will rely on the expertise in
      mathematical modelling of viral epidemiology and evolution and established geographical
      expertise, next generation sequencing, clinical epidemiology, and immunologic diagnostic
      techniques.
