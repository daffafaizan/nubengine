    
      -  According to preassigned 1:1 randomization of 40 patients assigend to intervention group
           and other 40 patients assign to control group as follow.

        -  Get documented agreement from the caregiver if the patient meets the criteria.

        -  While the a nurse attaches a kismo to a patient, the researcher at the bedside measures
           the patient's bladder size as an maximal anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (T)
           diameter(cm)

        -  If the measured diameters (AP x T) is 2 X 2 or more, the research assistant check the
           assigned group of the patient.

        -  If the patient assigned to the intervention group, a pressure stimulus is applied once
           using an ultrasonic probe to the anteroposterior wall of the bladder until the anterior
           & posterior wall meet.

        -  If the AP X T was less than 2 X 2, excluded from the study enrollment.

        -  During the study, caregivers and the assigned nurse will be blinded
