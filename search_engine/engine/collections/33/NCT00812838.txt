      is to reduce pain and maintain sexual function. Oral medicines that prevent plaque formation
      and promote plaque breakdown have not been effective. Many patients with the disease will
      require injections of medicines directly into the plaque. These injections have been used for
      over 50 years in the treatment of major Peyronie's disease. The disease often resolves on its
      own without treatment. Surgery may be performed to remove hardened tissue in the penis.
      However, surgery is not done during the first 12 months of the disease.

      There are 2 phases of the disease: the active phase and the inactive phase. The active phase
      usually occurs during the first 12 months of the disease. The stabilization of the plaque is
      known as the inactive phase. We are inviting men with stable disease to take part in this
      study which will test BOTOX® versus a placebo (a placebo contains no medicine).

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, single-center trial. The placebo
      group has the option to cross over to the treatment arm (ARM 1) of the study at the end of
      their 16 weeks of placebo arm (ARM 2). Study drug is Botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX®).
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be randomized to either the
      treatment or placebo arm.

        -  Treatment: Injection solution will consist of 100 units of BOTOX® in 10 cc of
           preservative free normal saline, or

        -  Placebo: Injection solution will consist of 10 cc preservative free normal saline.
