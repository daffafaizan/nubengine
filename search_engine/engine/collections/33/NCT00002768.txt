      filgrastim (G-CSF), conditioning using busulfan and etoposide, and autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation to generate a 2-year disease-free survival rate in at least
      30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in second complete remission. II. Determine
      whether the treatment-related mortality can be limited to less than 20% in patients treated
      with this regimen. III. Determine whether adequate numbers of PBSC can be collected in these
      patients. IV. Determine the engraftment kinetics of primed PBSC obtained from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Mobilization/harvest: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours every 12 hours and
      etoposide IV continuously on days 1-4. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC)
      beginning on day 14 and continuing until peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested.
      When blood counts recover, PBSC are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. Conditioning:
      Beginning at least 4 weeks after hospital discharge for mobilization and harvest and when
      blood counts recover, patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and
      etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -3. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. G-CSF is administered SC
      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients with documented CNS
      disease at first relapse receive methotrexate intrathecally at intervals of 1 week or greater
      before and/or after PBSC transplantation for a total of 6 doses. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-48 patients will be accrued within 2 years.
