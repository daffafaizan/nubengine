    
      This prospective multicenter phase II study evaluates multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI), radiomics
      and MR-guided biopsies for Active Surveillance (AS) of men with low- and intermediate-risk
      prostate cancer (PCA) with the primary endpoint of reducing the rate of discontinuation of AS
      based on histologic reclassification in an observation period of 24 months.

      Men with low- or intermediate-risk PCA diagnosed by mp-MRI followed by an MR/ultrasound
      fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) plus systematic ultrasound-guided biopsy (SB) will be included
      in this study.

      During the study observation period PSA values will be obtained every 3 months. After having
      obtained three values PSA doubling times (PSA-DT) will be calculated at every visit. In case
      of PSA-DT <3 years patients will get a repeat mp-MRI and in case of MRI progression a repeat
      targeted FUS-GB plus SB will be performed. In case of a Gleason score upgrading by the
      targeted biopsy the patient will discontinue AS and get treatment. In cases of stable MRI or
      stable Gleason score the patient will continue with PSA controls every 3 months.

      In addition all patients with stable PSA values will undergo a mp-MRI after 12 months. If
      this MRI demonstrates progression the protocol proceeds as mentioned above for patients with
      PSA-increase. At the end of study (24 months after enrollment), all patients will receive
      another mp-MRI and FUS-GB+SB.
