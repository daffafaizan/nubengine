      it is listed as a partial-crossover design in the IRB-approved protocol because subjects
      randomized to the SMT group are given the option of entering 12-weeks of CBT sessions after
      all of their SMT data collection. To understand brain changes that occur with CBT compared to
      SMT in both age groups, the investigators will collect fMRI data before and after therapy.
      Some limited data will be collected in patients who are initially randomized to SMT but then
      opt to crossover to CBT. fMRI data will also be collected in healthy teens and adults before
      and after 12 weeks (but without intervening therapy) to allow the investigators to control
      for the simple effects of time that may cause brain changes that are not related to therapy.
