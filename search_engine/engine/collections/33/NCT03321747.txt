    
      1. Primary Objectives During Phase I study - Determine the safety and maximum tolerated
           radiation dose for five fraction SABR for squamous cell cancer of the lung.

           During Phase II study - Determine 2 year local control of dose escalated five fraction
           SABR vs. institutional historical control standard dose SABR in squamous cell cancer of
           the lung.

        2. Phase II Secondary Objectives

             -  Determine overall survival, progression free survival and patterns of failure after
                SABR.

             -  Determine tolerability of dose escalated SABR.
