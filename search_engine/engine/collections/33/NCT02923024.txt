      physicians to improve their engagement and relationships with patients. The goal will be to
      test and refine patient pings as a provider engagement tool, with an eye toward using it
      within the broader approach to high-risk patients as well. The Penn team is helping to design
      the intervention, which includes helping with determining what the three arms will be and
      randomizing physicians and practice sites. They will implement a three-arm trial with the
      first arm being usual care (no pings), the second arm being the intervention of information,
      and the third arm being the intervention of information and financial incentives. In the two
      intervention groups, providers will be sent patient pings after a patient experiences a
      trigger event. This trigger event could be an emergency room visit, admission to a hospital,
      or a hospital discharge event. The patient ping will be sent to the patients doctors
      including primary care physicians and specialists. If the patient does not have a doctor, a
      ping will not be sent. In the third arm, physicians will be incentivized to see patients
      immediately via phone call or in office visit. Physicians will receive an incentive for
      calling the member within 48 hours of trigger event and will receive a larger financial
      incentive for seeing the patient for an office visit within 7 days of trigger event. This
      bonus payment will be paid to physicians uncoupled from usual reimbursement as a separate
      bonus check to increase salience. No pings will be sent to the physicians for the patients
      randomized to arm 1: usual care.
