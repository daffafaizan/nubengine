      important contributor to their enhanced cardiovascular risk and higher rates of
      cardiovascular events following acute coronary syndrome, despite dual antiplatelet therapy
      with aspirin and clopidogrel. We have earlier demonstrated high thrombogenicity in
      individuals with T2DM and CAD in the absence of acute ischaemic events, despite therapeutic
      doses of aspirin.We hypothesise that patients with T2DM will have increased thrombogenicity
      after acute coronary syndrome despite optimal secondary prevention medication.Measuring ex
      vivo thrombus area using an arterial injury model simulates plaque rupture and reflects the
      summative effect of all haemostatic abnormalities. The thrombus area of patients with ACS and
      T2DM will be compared to the controls without T2DM.
