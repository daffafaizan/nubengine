      doxycycline for pleurodesis as treatments for malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

      OUTLINE: Patients choose 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo IPC placement and receive doxycycline via IPC 5 days later.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo IPC placement.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 10-14 days and then monthly
      for up to a year.
