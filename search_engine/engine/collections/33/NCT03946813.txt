      several studies after using autologous PRP in a reproductive field. Ovarian rejuvenation,
      stimulating the ovaries to produce new eggs after injecting PRP, can offer hope for renewed
      fertility to women with poor reserve volume, advanced maternal age, or either naturally
      occurring or premature menopause. But, these encouraging results should be supported by
      several new studies.

      This study aimed to estimate the efficacy of trans-vaginal ovarian injection with PRP in
      rejuvenates ovaries in woman with poor ovarian reserve, and to assess any association of some
      women variables (age, menstrual status, parity, BMI) as predicting factors in success of
      ovarian injection with PRP.
