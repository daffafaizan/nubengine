    
      Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) as a result of injuries resulting from penetrating or
      non-penetrating trauma who are intubated and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation will
      be randomized to either usual care or usual care with the addition of sigh breaths given once
      every 6 minutes. Patients will be randomized to one of the two study arms as soon as
      possible, but not longer than 24 hours after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation.
      Patients will be followed for 28 days to assess ventilator-free days (VFDs), mortality,
      ICU-free days, and the occurrence of complications.
