      in the prefrontal cortex during the encoding process. However, a cause-effect link between
      prefrontal activity and encoding has not been demonstrated. The purpose of this protocol is
      to test the hypothesis that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      over left prefrontal cortex interferes with encoding of verbal items (words) into episodic
      memory, thereby identifying this region as a substrate mediating verbal encoding.
      Identification of the role of the prefrontal cortex in verbal memory encoding is the first
      step to try to develop strategies to enhance such encoding processes in patients with memory
      impairments, an issue of relevance in neurorehabilitation.

      We plan to apply rTMS over left prefrontal cortex and over two control sites, during encoding
      of verbal and nonverbal items into episodic memory. Normal, healthy volunteers will be
      studied. The outcome measure will be performance on a subsequent memory test for words
      presented during left prefrontal rTMS, as compared to performance for words presented during
      rTMS over the control sites or without rTMS. This measure will indicate if left prefrontal
      stimulation can disrupt memory encoding of words relative to other stimulation sites or to no
      stimulation.

      A secondary outcome measure will be performance on a subsequent memory test for words
      presented during left prefrontal rTMS, as compared to performance for pictures presented
      during left prefrontal rTMS. This measure will indicate if disruption of left prefrontal
      function with TMS affects verbal and more than non-verbal memory encoding.
