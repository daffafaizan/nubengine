      application. Due to medical reasons (e.g. anticoagulant therapy, adipositas) intra-muscular
      application is not always possible. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate whether
      a comparably good immunogenicity can be achieved via the subcutaneous vaccination route. Thus
      humoral and cellular immune responses after intramuscular and subcutaneous TBE vaccination in
      healthy volunteers will be compared.
