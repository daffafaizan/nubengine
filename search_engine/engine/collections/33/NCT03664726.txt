      healthier lifestyle. The rational approach for someone with prediabetes would be to eat
      healthier, be more active, lose weight, and manage their comorbidities. However, preliminary
      research suggests that individuals with Type 2 diabetes discount the future and engage in
      behaviors that maximize current pleasure and short-term gain; thus, daily choices needed to
      improve future health are rare in this population. Delay discounting (DD) describes the
      choice of smaller immediate versus larger delayed rewards. This behavioral process is related
      to a wide variety of health choices, ranging from preventive health to behavioral and medical
      regimen adherence, including regimens used for Type 2 diabetes. The investigators believe
      that DD provides a target for one type of self-regulation that can improve a wide variety of
      health behaviors and medical adherence.

      Research from our laboratories has shown that episodic future thinking (EFT), a form of
      prospection which reduces the bias towards immediate gratification, activates brain regions
      involved in planning and prospection such that future rewards have increased value and the
      extent of delay discounting is reduced. Cueing individuals to think about future events
      during inter-temporal decision-making reduces the rate of DD, eating in and outside of the
      laboratory, and smoking behavior. The overarching goal of this research is to use an
      experimental medicine approach to translate basic research on DD and EFT into clinical
      interventions to prevent the transition from prediabetes to a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.
