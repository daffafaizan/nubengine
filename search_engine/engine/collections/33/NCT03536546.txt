      efficacy of an alcohol peer-mentor intervention starting in the ED, combined with a
      continuing 6-session program of post-ED strengths-based peer mentorship to facilitate
      reduction in hazardous drinking, and linkage and engagement in primary and/or specialty
      alcohol treatment services and mental health care, if needed. Project Methods: The study will
      screen Veterans Affairs (VA) ED patients for hazardous drinking. Those screening positive and
      who enroll in the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) Alcohol Peer-Mentor
      (APM) intervention (n=225), or 2) Brief Advice (BA) comparison condition (n=225). Stratified
      random assignment to conditions will be by sex and presence of AUD (yes/no) defined as a
      score of 14 for men and 10 for women on the AUDIT. Randomization will proceed in blocks of
      10. All participants will also receive written community resource information. Participants
      randomized to the APM condition will receive peer support to reduce hazardous drinking, and
      those who meet alcohol use disorder criteria will be coached by the peer and will assist in a
      warm handoff linkage to addiction treatment.
