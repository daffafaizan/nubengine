      intubation and to improve surgical working conditions. Several investigations have shown that
      a deep neuromuscular block (NMB) (post tetanic count (PTC) 1-2 twitches) improves the
      surgical working conditions over a moderate NMB (TOF count 1-3 twitches) and effectively
      precludes sudden deterioration of the surgical field. However, whether the improvement of
      surgical working conditions translates into less intra- and postoperative complications
      remains uncertain. A recent retrospective analysis of neuromuscular management during
      laparoscopic retroperitoneal surgery showed a reduced rate of unplanned 30 day readmissions
      when a deep NMB over a moderate NMB was applied (3.8% vs. 12.7%).In addition, a pooled
      analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials comparing different levels of intra-abdominal
      pressure and neuromuscular blockade during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, showed a
      significant reduction in the incidence of intra-operative surgical complications from 12.6%
      with moderate NMB to 4.8% with deep NMB.

      These previous observations were made in small prospective or retrospective studies. There is
      a need to confirm these outcome data prospectively, in a larger prospective trial for a
      variety of surgical procedures. We therefore propose a multi-center, randomized controlled
      trial, to study the effect of a deep NMB (PTC 1-2 twitches) versus standard NMB (single
      induction dose rocuronium) in a variety of laparoscopic surgical procedures on the incidence
      of intraoperative adverse events and postoperative outcome data.

      In this study the effect of deep neuromuscular block compared to standard neuromuscular block
      on intra-operative adverse events during laparoscopic surgery using the CLASSIC score system
      is evaluated.
