      disease and related dementias, and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence
      of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on
      subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

      This is a trial designed to assess the ongoing safety of subjects with agitation associated
      with dementia of the Alzheimer's type after completing a 12-week double-blind trial of
      brexpiprazole or placebo; drug and placebo are discontinued prior to subjects enrolling in
      the safety follow-up trial. The trial consists of a continuous 2 month observation period.
      The trial population will include male and female subjects with a diagnosis of probable
      Alzheimer's disease.
