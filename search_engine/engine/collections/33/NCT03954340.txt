      clinical investigation will show improvement in working memory, executive functions and
      general improvement in daily life based on standard accepted cognitive tests such as the
      Neurotrax and Kielhfner questionnaire. This hypothesis will be accepted or rejected based on
      the statistical analysis of the data collected .

      Subjects will be randomized either to the treatment or placebo groups. Each subject will
      undergo an initial and final assessment using NeuroTrax and specified questionnaires prior to
      and after 20 treatments. The first sessions will be dedicated to subject evaluation. Each
      subject will undergo either a neurofeedback (NFB) or sham treatment.
