      look at the body in different ways. Standard scan settings are usually good enough for a
      radiologist to review. The best settings often change with the age of the patient and their
      health, and are time consuming to determine. Quantified imaging is an alternative to
      contrast-based imaging which explicitly measures tissue properties and can be used to create
      almost any contrast. This method of imaging has been held back by a lack of the right
      software. Synthetic MR Technologies has created a quantified imaging solution - SyMRI - to
      enable radiologists to acquire quantified images and always obtain the best contrast images.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate SyMRI in a pediatric population to determine if
      Sickkids would be interested in purchasing this product / support Health Canada approval.
      Specifically, the investigators are interested in determining if SyMRI is clinically useful:

        -  Is synthetic imaging quality comparable / better than conventional imaging?

             -  Qualitative - Are radiologists more confident using synthetic MR vs conventional

             -  Quantitative - Signal-to-noise (SNR) and Contrast-to-noise (CNR)

        -  To what extent can total exam times be reduced?

        -  Is the software user friendly and would investigators use it?
