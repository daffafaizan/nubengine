    
      Endoscopic bariatric therapies such as intragastric balloons, space occupying EBTs,
      endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), primary obesity surgery endolumenal (POSE), and small
      bowel interventions including gastrointestinal bypass sleeves, etc. are recommended alone or
      in conjunction with other weight loss treatment modules for patients who cannot or do not
      want to undergo conventional bariatric surgery or other therapies for obesity (with BMI â‰¥30
      kg/m2) or BMI >27 with comorbidities.

      This research is being done in order to find out if endoscopic bariatric therapies work as
      well as, or better or worse than, other currently available treatment modules to achieve
      weight loss.

      Laboratory data, patient characteristics, imaging, histology will be collected. In certain
      patients - after specific consent extra blood may be collected for research purposes.
