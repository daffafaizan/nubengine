      and slow down unintentional weight loss. The participants will be randomly divided into two
      groups and receive 8 sessions of acupuncture (two groups will receive different acupuncture
      points) for 8 weeks. During the study period, participants will be asked various questions
      about appetite, physical functioning, cancer-related symptoms and quality of life to
      understand changes related to body weight, as well as blood samples. The research team
      members will collect data regarding changes in appetite, body weight, body composition, and
      physical functioning.
