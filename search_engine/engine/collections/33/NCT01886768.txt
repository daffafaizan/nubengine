      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) procedure. The investigator has proposed that a simple
      Endoscopic-Guided Gauze Pledgetting method (EGGP) is more tolerable than the "blind"
      cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for anesthetizing the nasal cavity.
      The initial idea of EGGP is to anesthetize only one single selected meatus. To compare
      patient tolerance, safety and adverse events between double pledget (DPNA, i.e. INM and MNM)
      versus single pledget (SPNA, i.e. INM or MNM) methods of nasal anesthesia, the investigator
      is going to conduct a prospective randomized-controlled trial. The rationale for using double
      pledget is threefold: (1) the middle meatus is bounded by the INT and MNT; (2) the inserting
      and exserting meatuses may be different; (3) erective spongy tissue is mainly distributed in
      the inferior and middle turbinates and the nasal septum. Therefore, the primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate whether DPNA is more tolerable and safer than DPNA before UT-EGD.
