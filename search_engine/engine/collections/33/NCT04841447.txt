      treatment. Collecting specimen from the blood and bone marrow will increase understanding of
      effect of DPP4 inhibitors on human AML-SCP to develop individualized therapies. We will test
      the effect of DPP4 inhibitors on human AML-SCP in vitro and in vivo and whether addition of
      DPP4 inhibitors can prevent AML relapse once the disease is in the remission stage.
