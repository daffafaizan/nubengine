      of metastatic sites would determine the choice of subsequent management. In the search of
      malignancy in patients with BCR, standard of care tests include Pelvic CT or MRI (to look for
      recurrence and/or pelvic nodal metastases) and a planar bone scan to look for skeletal
      metastases. However, standard of care testing has a low diagnostic yield of only 11% of
      patients for visualizing sites of disease (5). Thus, there is a clear need for better imaging
      approaches. 18F-Fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid PET tracer approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration in June of 2016 for the detection of sites of recurrence in men with
      rising prostate-specific antigen levels after prior primary treatment of prostate cancer (6),
      based on its diagnostic performance (7,8). However, there is a gap in the literature
      regarding prospective studies evaluation of detection rate of 18F-Fluciclovine compared to
      current standard of care imaging techniques. Therefore, 18F-Fluciclovine has already been
      approved by the FDA and covered CMS and insurance companies but is yet to be included in the
      NCCN guidelines in the work up of PCa patients with BCR.
