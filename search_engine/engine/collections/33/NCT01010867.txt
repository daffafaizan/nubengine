      are associated with prolonged periods of cachexia/anorexia, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, and
      compromised gut integrity (CGI). The toxicities associated with HSCT often lead to prolonged
      periods of poor oral intake and may result in overt malnutrition. CGI decreases oral
      tolerance to foods, reduces Quality of Life (QOL) and functional status, delays the
      transition from the hospital to home setting, and increases the risk of the development of
      gut-derived infections. Probiotics are nutritional supplements that contain a defined amount
      of viable microorganisms and upon administration confer a benefit to the host. Clinical
      trials in adults receiving organ transplants have found probiotics decrease the incidence of
      infection, the duration of antibiotic use, the incidence of multiorgan failure and systemic
      inflammation. Children and adolescents undergoing HSCT, experience similar clinical
      challenges suggesting probiotics may have a therapeutic value in the setting of HSCT. This
      study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering probiotics to children and
      adolescents undergoing HSCT.
