      system of about 30,000 children and adults in the United States (70,000 worldwide). The lungs
      of a person with cystic fibrosis often contain thick sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and
      lead to life-threatening lung infections. A major milestone in the treatment of CF was the
      development of an inhaled form of an antibiotic drug called tobramycin. For an inhaled
      antibiotic to work it must be delivered to all infected parts of the lung. Many studies have
      shown that blockages in the lungs, like those found in CF patients, can prevent inhaled
      medicines from reaching all parts of the lungs.

      Usually aerosolized medications are dissolved in saline or water. Most of these medications
      could be dissolved in surfactant solutions and aerosolized. Soaps are common examples of
      surfactants. Surfactants may have the ability to spread medication over the inside surface of
      the lungs similar to the way dish soap spreads over water. We think that inhaling medication
      that is in a surfactant-based liquid will result in more medication reaching partially
      blocked parts of the lung. We further believe that the normal movements of the lung
      associated with breathing will further spread surfactant-based aerosol medications, and
      contribute to even more even drug distribution over longer periods of time.

      A surfactant-based inhaled antibiotic would have the potential to reach more sites of
      infection in the lung, possibly getting rid of infection all together. This study will use a
      special test called an aerosol deposition scan to compare how a drug spreads in the lung
      using a surfactant-based aerosol compared to a saline-based aerosol. The study includes one
      screening and two testing visits.
