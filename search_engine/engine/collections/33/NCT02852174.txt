      Caring for a disabled adult, particularly those with long-lasting impairment, has been
      associated with elevated levels of stress, depression and anxiety among caregivers. Veteran
      caregivers are especially vulnerable because of competing demands. For instance, Post 9/11
      veteran caregivers are more likely to be the spouse of a veteran, and have experienced the
      stress of multiple deployments, have a young child in their care, and work outside the home.
      Recent studies show that veteran caregivers experience higher levels of psychological
      distress than caregivers in the general population, highlighting the psychological needs of
      this population. One effective approach at reducing stress, depression and anxiety has been
      the use of mindfulness training, which has been shown to effectively reduce mood symptoms
      among professional caregivers. The Veteran Caregiver Reducing Stress Time (VetCareReST) is a
      randomized control trial designed to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness at reducing
      stress, depression and anxiety in veteran caregivers in Champaign and Danville County. This
      study builds on Dr. Lara-Cinisomo's (PI) experience with military spouses. The findings from
      this trial will serve as pilot data for a large-scale study.
