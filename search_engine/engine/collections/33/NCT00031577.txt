        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with involved-field
           radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brain stem glioma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of paclitaxel.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once
      weekly and involved-field radiotherapy (after paclitaxel infusion) once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 6 weeks.

      Beginning 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients may receive maintenance
      therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once every 3 weeks for a total of 8 courses.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
