      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the tolerability of cinacalcet in
      individuals with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-mediated hypophosphatemia, using an
      open-label, dose-titration study of once-daily dosing. Secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet in this subject population and to explore the efficacy of
      cinacalcet by comparing a) level of oral phosphate required at baseline to the level required
      at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and b) change in renal phosphate handling from baseline to
      MTD. Tertiary objectives are to evaluate tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of
      twice daily dosing of each subject s MTD of cinacalcet after completion of the once-daily
      dose-titration phase. A final objective is to determine the length of time it takes for
      subjects to return to their pre-treatment steady state once treatment is complete.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 17 subjects with FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia will be treated.

      DESIGN:

      This study is an open-label, dose-titration study of once-daily dosing of cinacalcet, with up
      to 4 escalating doses given at approximately 3 week intervals. After an initial standard of
      care optimization period of 2-9 weeks, subjects will proceed to the cinacalcet dose-titration
      period. Subjects who experience extended toxicity or study drug related serious adverse
      events or other related, intolerable adverse events will be down titrated to a lower dose of
      study medication. After subjects have achieved their own maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      completed the once-daily dosing phase, they will continue the study medication for
      approximately 3 additional weeks with twice daily dosing at their MTD. At the end of the
      cinacalcet treatment phase of the study, cinacalcet will be discontinued and standard of care
      (SOC) medications will be adjusted/restarted on an individualized basis. Subjects will
      continue in this final SOC safety follow-up period for up to 4 weeks until their SOC
      medications have been re-equilibrated.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Primary safety:
