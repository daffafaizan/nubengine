      investigated. The purpose of this Phase I/II clinical research study is to examine the
      baseline safety and efficacy of an experimental study drug to treat a complication of the
      disease which leads to vision loss. The name of the study drug is rAAV.sFlt-1.

      This experimental study uses a non-pathogenic virus to express a therapeutic protein within
      the eye. The therapeutic diminishes the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina.
      The duration of effect is thought to be long-term (years) following a single administration.

      The clinical research study will look at the baseline safety and efficacy of a single
      injection of rAAV.sFlt-1 injected directly into the eye.

      Approximately forty (40) subjects will participate in Australia. The primary endpoint of the
      study is at one month, with extended follow up for 3 years.
