      upright posture, which might reflect a blunted adrenal response to stimulation upon assuming
      upright posture. In this AIM, we propose to assess the adrenal response to aldosterone
      stimulation with intravenous adrenocorticotropin hormone.

      For this protocol, subjects enrolled in the parent study will be approached about this
      sub-study. Subjects will be assured that they are not required to participate in this study
      even if they choose to participate in the parent study.

      There will be no randomization for this specific sub-study. The order of diets (low sodium
      vs. high sodium) will be performed as a part of the parent study, and not as a part of this
      sub-study. This sub-study will only be performed in the LOW dietary salt phase.

      All subjects will be previously screened and evaluated as a part of the parent study. No
      further screening will be performed exclusively for this study. Women of childbearing
      potential will have had a serum pregnancy test as a part of the parent study. Pregnant women
      will not be allowed to participate.
