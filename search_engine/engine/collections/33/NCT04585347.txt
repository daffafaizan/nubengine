    
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, sequential, single-dose, 4-period study
      in 12 healthy adult subjects. Subjects are to receive a single oral dose of ALZ-801 in each
      of the 4 study periods (Regimens A, B, C and D) in a non-randomized, sequential manner,
      separated by a minimum washout period of 7 days. The washout period is expected to last
      approximately 14 days to permit interim decisions to take place and to allow for the
      selection of the formulation of the subsequent regimen. Periods of interim analysis will take
      place following dosing with prototype formulations Regimens A, B, and C, during which the PK
      and safety data are reviewed to determine the dose to be administered in the subsequent
      treatment period. Interim decisions aim to identify a prototype ALZ-801 immediate release
      tablet formulation that provides a similar tramiprosate AUC and Cmax to that of historical
      values after administration of a 100 mg loose-filled tramiprosate capsule in the fasted
      state.

      Optimization of the required tramiprosate exposure will be made by adjusting the dose of
      ALZ-801 in the prototype tablets using a formulation design space with a target dose range,
      per tablet, of 171 to 514 mg ALZ-801 (equivalent to 100 mg to 300 mg tramiprosate). Dose
      selection will be made after a complete review of all data collected from the previous dose
      group. For dose selection to occur, data is required to be available from a minimum of 8
      evaluable subjects with complete safety assessments up to 24 h post-dose, and required safety
      and PK data (AEs, plasma concentrations of ALZ-801, tramiprosate and NRM5074, and Tmax, Cmax
      and AUC estimates for ALZ-801 and tramiprosate).
