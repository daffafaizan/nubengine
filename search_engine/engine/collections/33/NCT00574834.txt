      and/or weight can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, angiotensin converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) also result in reduction in
      the onset of type 2 DM. The most striking effect was found with Ramipril in the HOPE study.
      The onset of new type 2 DM was reduced by 34% (p<0.001) as compared to placebo. Furthermore,
      the results of the DREAM trial demonstrate that Ramipril at a dose of 15 mg can significantly
      reverse impaired glucose tolerance. However, the mechanisms underlying Ramipril effects to
      delay type 2 diabetes are not known.

      The proposal will be focused on determining the integrated in-vivo mechanisms responsible for
      Ramipril's effects on delaying type 2 DM and restoring normal glycemia in patients with
      impaired glucose tolerance.

      The specific aims of the project are:

        -  to determine the effect of Ramipril on insulin resistance at the level of the liver and
           peripheral tissues,

        -  to determine the effect of Ramipril on endothelial function,

        -  to determine the effects of Ramipril on insulin secretion, and

        -  to determine the effects of Ramipril on substrate flux, lipolysis and inflammatory
           cytokines.
