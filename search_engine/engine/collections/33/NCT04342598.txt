      expanded prevention efforts are critical. Although vitamin D supplementation shows promise in
      both of these areas, additional observational evidence is needed to support future randomized
      clinical trials. This case-control study in Mumbai, India will clarify associations between
      vitamin D status, active MDR-TB disease and TB infection to expand the evidence-base and
      inform the design of future trials of vitamin D supplementation for use in MDR-TB infection.
      This study will assess vitamin D status, diet, and anthropometry among adult outpatient
      MDR-TB cases and controls in Mumbai, India and assess TB infection among controls. The
      specific aims are: 1) evaluate the association between vitamin D status and active MDR-TB
      infection; 2) evaluate the association between vitamin D status and TB infection among
      controls; 3) collect formative data to inform the design of future randomized clinical trials
      evaluating vitamin D supplementation and other interventions in MDR-TB treatment and
      prevention. To fulfill the first aim, a case-control study will be conducted comparing
      vitamin D status between pulmonary MDR-TB cases (including extensively drug-resistant (XDR)
      and pre-XDR cases) and two sets of controls: 1) household controls (recruited from the cases'
      household contacts) and 2) non-household controls (recruited from non-respiratory departments
      of local hospitals). The second aim will involve a cross-sectional study among controls
      assessing the association between vitamin D status and TB infection using QuantiFERON-TB
      (QFT-TB) interferon-gamma release assays.
