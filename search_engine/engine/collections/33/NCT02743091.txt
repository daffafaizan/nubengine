      features. PH is classified into the 5 groups, and the prevalence of group 1 pulmonary
      arterial hypertension, including idiopathic and heritable, is 5 to 15 cases per one million
      adults and a median survival was reportedly three years. PH found in patients with end-stage
      kidney disease (ESKD) is classified into group 5, because the pathogenesis and clinical
      characteristics have not been clarified. The prevalence of PH in patients with ESKD was
      reportedly around 17~56% based on echocardiographic studies. In this study, we evaluated the
      incidence of idiopathic pre-capillary PH of ESKD patients by right heart catheterization, and
      examined the prognosis by following the occurrence of heart failure death.
