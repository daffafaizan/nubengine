      tool will improve the accuracy and efficiency of HSIL diagnoses.

      Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that the sensitivity (SN) specificity (SP),
      positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as the receiver
      operating curve for the identification of neoplasia on a per biopsy and per patient basis
      will be high.The investigators will first compare the HRA-directed biopsy (as the gold
      standard) to the results of the mHRME HSIL diagnosis. The SN of mHRME diagnosis in detection
      of HSIL will be estimated with the binomial proportion of study participants who are positive
      for HSIL on HRA-guided biopsy at two thresholds of histology thresholds which are: 1) AIN
      (Anal intraepithelial neoplasia) 2+ threshold, and 2) AIN3+ threshold. SP will be estimated
      as the proportion of study participants who are negative for HSIL on HRA-guided biopsy at
      both thresholds. Positive and negative predictive values will be estimated using the binomial
      proportion and its 95% confidence interval (CI). In addition, the Cohens kappa statistic, and
      receiver operator characteristic curves will be generated if patient characteristics such as
      low CD4 count, cART (combined antiretroviral treatment) utilization, or high HIV viral load
      impact the determination of SN and SP. SN and SP of mHRME-based HSIL diagnosis will be
      estimated on a per lesion and per patient basis with 95% CI and compared by McNemar's test. A
      generalized linear model for logistic regression with multiple correlated outcomes will
      compare SN and SP of each method on a per biopsy and per patient basis.

      Primary Objective To determine if the mHRME plus 3D mapping improves the accuracy of anal
      HSIL diagnosis compared to the gold standard of histologic diagnosis of HSIL by high
      resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided biopsy

      Secondary Objectives

      Determination whether HRME changes the decision to perform biopsy
