      cycles over a period of four years.

      This protocol summary has been updated according to the Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 10 Sept
      2014).

      There will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion
      of the treatment. The study will end 30 days after the last dose will be administered, so the
      patients will not be further exposed to unnecessary study related procedures.. In addition,
      no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For each
      biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing
      will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant. Blood
      sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.
