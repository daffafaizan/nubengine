      hepatic lipid content and mitochondrial flux in humans. Before and after a low carbohydrate
      diet intervention, rates of hepatic mitochondrial flux will be assessed using positional
      isotopomer analysis of 3-13C-lactate during a 3 hour basal period. Rates of whole body
      ketogenesis will be determined using [13C4]Î²-hydroxybutyrate, and whole body glucose
      metabolism will be measured using [2H7]glucose. Body composition will be determined with
      bioelectrical impedance; hepatic lipid content will be measured with MRS. Whole-body
      oxidation of lipids, carbohydrates and protein will be determined using indirect calorimetry.
