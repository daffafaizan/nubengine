      the effects of a reduction in 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity in
      animal models. We therefore aimed to investigate whether rosiglitazone-induced insulin
      sensitivity is associated with changes in 11β-HSD1 activity in different tissues in subjects
      suffering from impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore the metabolic and hormonal effects of
      PPAR gamma stimulation by rosiglitazone will be analysed in those tissue samples.
