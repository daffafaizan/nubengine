      many disorders. Assessment of body iron stores by measurement of serum ferritin
      concentrations has poor specificity and the most reliable method is histological or
      biochemical assessment from a liver biopsy. Because liver biopsy is an invasive procedure,
      imaging methods have been developed to detect and quantify hepatic iron content.

      The aim of the study is to use a simplified magnetic resonance imaging technique to quantify
      simultaneously iron and fat contents in the liver and to compare the results to the
      quantification obtained biochemically.

      Patients who need a liver biopsy will be proposed to be enrolled in the study. A magnetic
      resonance (MR) study will be performed using breath-hold gradient echo sequences with a
      single echo and a new multiple-echo gradient-echo sequence. Liver and muscle MR signal will
      be quantitatively determined and compared to biochemical assessment of liver iron
      concentration and steatosis quantification.
