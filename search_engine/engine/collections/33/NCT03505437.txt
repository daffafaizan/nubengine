      investigating whether stress (administered prior to exposure with the socially evaluated cold
      pressor test) augments exposure therapy outcome in patients with specific phobia (spider
      phobia). Furthermore, the effects of stress on the generalization of exposure-induced symptom
      reduction towards untreated fear stimuli (i.e. cockroaches) will be explored.

      Participants are randomly assigned to the cold or warm water condition of the socially
      evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT; Schwabe et al., 2008). Thereafter, participants of both
      conditions receive 45 minutes of in-vivo exposure to spiders. The effects of stress on
      exposure-based anxiety reductions toward spiders (treated fear stimulus) and cockroaches
      (untreated fear stimulus to assess generalization of treatment outcome) are assessed on the
      behavioral, subjective and physiological level at pretreatment, posttreatment (24 hours after
      exposure) and follow-up (4 weeks after exposure).
