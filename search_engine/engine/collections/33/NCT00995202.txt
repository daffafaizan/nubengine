        -  Evaluate the efficacy of reinforced versus standard follow-up care and the utility of
           follow-up CEA assessments in patients with fully resected stage II or III colorectal
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multinational/multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      follow-up arms.

        -  Standard follow-up: Patients undergo clinical assessments every 3 months until year 3
           and every 6 months until year 5. They are then assessed at least yearly thereafter.
           Patients undergo abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until year 3 and then every 6
           months until year 5; chest x-ray every 6 months until year 3 and then annually until
           year 5; and colonoscopy at 3 years after surgery then every 3 to 6 years thereafter.

        -  Reinforced follow-up: Patients undergo clinical assessments every 3 months until year 3
           and every 6 months until year 5. They are then assessed at least yearly thereafter.
           Patients undergo alternate assessments every 3 months comprising thoraco-abdomino-pelvic
           CT scan or abdominal ultrasound until year 3 and then every 6 months until year 5. They
           also undergo colonoscopy at 3 years after surgery then every 3 to 6 years thereafter.

      Patients undergo a second randomization to 1 of 2 follow-up arms at the beginning of the
      study.

        -  CEA measurement: Patients undergo measurement of CEA levels every 3 months until year 3,
           every 6 months until year 5, and at least yearly thereafter.

        -  No CEA measurement: Patients do not undergo CEA measurement. Blood and tissue blocks of
           normal and tumor tissues are collected for the validation of protein serum, genetics, or
           immunologic markers predictive for relapse.
