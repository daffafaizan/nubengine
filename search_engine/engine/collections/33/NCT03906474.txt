      and receive a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) at the CCVTM, Oxford. Of
      these volunteers, three will be newly recruited, malaria-na√Øve volunteers, who will receive a
      primary CHMI.

      The remaining volunteers will be invited to be involved in this study, following previous
      participation in the VAC063 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02927145). VAC063 was a
      study to assess the safety, immune responses and efficacy of the new malaria vaccine
      RH5.1/AS01. As part of this study, control volunteers, who did not receive a vaccine,
      received a blood-stage CHMI, or "challenge", in order to compare to the vaccinated
      volunteers. Some control (unvaccinated) participants received two challenges and some
      received just one challenge, therefore, in this study, participants who previously took part
      in VAC063 will receive either a third or second malaria challenge.

      Volunteers will be challenged with malaria by administering a small amount of P. falciparum
      infected blood intravenously. Blood will then be taken at regular intervals to measure the
      parasite growth, quantify the sexual parasite forms and assess the immune response to
      primary, secondary or tertiary P. falciparum CHMI.

      When volunteers are diagnosed with malaria, treatment with a standard antimalarial course of
      oral artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet) will be given over 3 days.

      Volunteers who take part in this study will be involved in the trial for approximately 3
      months.
