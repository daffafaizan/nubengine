      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of a conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte globulin
           comprising total body irradiation, thiotepa, and fludarabine followed by
           CD34-positive-selected haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation in young patients with life-threatening hematologic malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the risk for severe graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the kinetics of immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the risk for life-threatening infections in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients 7 years of age and under undergo total body irradiation
           twice daily on days -9 to -7. Patients over 7 years of age undergo total body
           irradiation once on day -7. All patients receive fludarabine IV once daily on days -6 to
           -2 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours twice on day -5.

        -  CD34-positive (CD34+)-selected haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo CD34+-selected allogeneic PBSCT on days 0 and
           2.

      Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or CNS disease also receive methotrexate
      intrathecally twice before transplantation and 4 times after day 35 post-transplantation.
      Male patients with lymphoid malignancies undergo additional radiotherapy to the testes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 100 days, at 1 year,
      and then periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 patients â‰¤ 7 years of age and 10 patients > 7
      years of age) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
