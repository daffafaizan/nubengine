      patients, each having 2 dental implants in the same quadrant. Abutments with standard silver
      collars will be divided into two groups: Group 1 (test group) will undergo anodic oxidation
      of the abutment collar changing it into pink color. Group 2 (control group) untreated
      abutments.
