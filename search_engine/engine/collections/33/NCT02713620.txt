      cells/mm3, undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, and negative for all HBV markers were randomly
      assigned to receive one of three recombinant vaccine (Hepavax-Gene® Berna, Korea) regimens:
      20 μg IM at months 0, 1, and 6 (Standard doses group, n=44), 20 μg IM at months 0, 1, 2, 6
      (four doses group, n=44), or 40 μg IM at months 0, 1, 2, and 6 (four double doses group,
      n=44). There was another group of healthy individuals received standard dose of 20 μg IM at
      months 0, 1, and 6 recruited during the same time and under the same protocol. In brief, at
      months 7 and 12, the percentages of responders (anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL) were 88.6% and 70.4% in
      the Standard doses group, 93.2% and 86.4% in the four doses group, (P=0.713 and 0.119), and
      95.4% and 88.6% in the four double doses group, (P=0.434 and 0.062), respectively.

      This current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the different HBV vaccination regimens
      at 36 months after vaccination. In addition to compare the group using four standard doses or
      four double doses with the current standard regimen of three doses in HIV-infected adults in
      northern Thailand, the investigators also compare the efficacy of the current standard
      regimen of 3 doses between HIV-infected and healthy individuals.
