      oral anticoagulation undergoing PCI-S is unknown. The randomized trials to assess the best
      antithrombotic regimen in this setting and the management of this population are challenging.
      It poses imperative demands for future prospective randomized studies to define the optimal
      antithrombotic regimen in patients requiring chronic anticoagulation undergoing coronary
      stenting. Additionally, the vast majority of current clinical studies about antithrombotic
      therapy for atrial fibrillation together with PCI were retrospectively analysis to date
      ,whereas the prospective studies are rare and urgently needed
