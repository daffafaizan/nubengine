      hypothesizing that US examination is a useful tool to detect unsuccessful release and
      defining which technique shows the best outcome in the first year postoperatively.

      The measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) as a diagnostic tool to detect entrapments
      syndrome in upper limbs has already been described. US typically demonstrates an abrupt
      narrowing and displacement of the nerve within the tunnel, possibly in association with a
      thickened retinaculum or a space-occupying lesions. Previous studies prospectively compared
      sonographic outcomes after decompression of the median nerve at the wrist.
