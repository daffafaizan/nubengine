      termed diffusion kurtosis imaging, multi-echo T2 mapping, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI
      using a motion-robust high-temporal and high-resolution radial acquisition scheme employing
      compressed sensing, and simultaneously acquired 18-fluoro (18F)- fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)
      data. Preliminary data demonstrates the investigators ability to execute and evaluate all of
      these techniques at the investigators center. The investigators hypothesize that these
      techniques will be sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of
      bladder cancer cases and will improve upon the performance of current imaging protocols in
      bladder cancer characterization. Moreover, the investigators believe that these techniques
      will provide complementary information, such that they may be combined in a synergistic
      fashion for bladder cancer evaluation.
