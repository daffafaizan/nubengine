      brain noninvasively through the scalp and skull. It has proven effective in producing
      localized effects on brain function and has opened many areas of human brain function to
      direct investigation. Preliminary data also suggest potential therapeutic applications in
      neuropsychiatric illness. We plan to further investigate the possible therapeutic use of rTMS
      in depression under conditions of high frequency (20 Hz), low (1Hz) frequency, and sham and
      to also examine possible cognitive or endocrine effects. Among the priorities of this
      protocol will be to further evaluate the risks of the technique.
