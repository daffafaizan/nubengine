      the surgical treatment for chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy in the investigators'
      center. In this study the investigators re-evaluate the patients undergoing percutaneous
      surgery since then in order to compare the outcome with the excellent results cited in
      literature. The patients will be contacted and asked to participate completing a VAS-score, a
      VISA-A score and agreeing with a clinical examination.

      Approving by the Ethical Committee of UZLeuven is pending.
