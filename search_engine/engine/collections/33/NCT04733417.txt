      trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR6390 combined
      with famitinib in the treatment of HR+/HER2 advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients who
      have progressed during or after 1-2 line endocrine therapy. Subjects will be treated until
      disease progression, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and
      investigators determine that medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data
      will be collected.
