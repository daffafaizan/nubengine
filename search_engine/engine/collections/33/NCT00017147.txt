        -  Compare the overall survival, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of
           patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma treated with
           radiotherapy and carmustine with or without O6-benzylguanine.

        -  Compare the frequency and severity of toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Correlate the survival of these patients with the expression of O6-alkylguanine-DNA
           alkyltransferase.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50 vs 50
      and over), prior surgery (biopsy only vs resection), and Zubrod performance status (0-1 vs
      2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week over 7 weeks for a total of 34
           fractions. Patients also receive chemotherapy comprising O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour
           followed 6 hours later by carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1 of radiotherapy.
           Chemotherapy repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 7 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV as in
           arm I.

      Patients are followed at week 48, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
