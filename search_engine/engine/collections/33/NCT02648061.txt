      during the acute phase of post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), and analyze the details in
      clinical transitions related to circulatory failure. The study will also analyze the
      relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and circulatory failure in PCAS and kinetics of
      hemodynamics associated with standard interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU).
