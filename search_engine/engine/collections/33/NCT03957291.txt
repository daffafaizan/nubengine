      surface irritation with PI (povidine iodine) and AC (aqueous chlorhexidine). . Prior to
      sugery patients who meet inclusion criteria will be identified and informed consent will be
      obtained. Study personnel will obtain two samples one from conjunctival sac and th other from
      skin around the eye. Topical antisepsis will then be applied, the first eye will be
      randomized to one drop of either PI 5% - 2.5% or AC 0.1%- 0.05% and the second eye will
      receive the other agent. One minute after instillation of the eye drop to each eye, patients
      will rate their pain in each eye using the Wong-Baker (smiley face) rating scale. After 15
      minutes the second swabs will be taken in the same manner as the first swabs. . On
      post-operative day three, study personnel will meet the patient and ask to rate the pain in
      each eye using the same verbal numerical rating scale and to perform slit lamb examination
      for any complication.
