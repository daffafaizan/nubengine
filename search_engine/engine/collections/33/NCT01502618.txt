      guide the selection of the intervention content areas and the development of the intervention
      manual. The intervention aims to increase participation in health promoting behaviors and
      improve self-worth and self-concept among HIV-positive B-YMSM. Specifically, the intervention
      aims to address the following health promoting behaviors: 1) increasing engagement in HIV
      treatment; 2) improving medication adherence; 3) reducing sexual risk behaviors; 4) reducing
      substance use behaviors; and 5) increasing HIV status disclosure.

      Based on reviews of ATN 070 data and existing related interventions (ATN 068, ATN 073, Young
      Warriors, HLS), draft components of the intervention curriculum for B-YMSM will be developed.
      Four focus groups will then be convened (two per AMTU) with HIV-positive B-YMSM to a) obtain
      input on the draft intervention curriculum, b) refine intervention components, and c) examine
      psychosocial factors that may mediate or moderate the intervention effect. The focus groups
      will be implemented using a "Rapid Approach" which allows for a focus on key areas of inquiry
      by asking fewer questions and focusing on targeted responses of focus group participants. All
      focus groups will be digitally recorded and transcribed. The transcripts will be reviewed and
      data analyzed using a phenomenological approach; protocol team members and members of two
      Youth Advisory Boards (YABs), which will include youth who are existing members of ATN site
      CABs as well as youth recruited from other local agencies and organizations), will work on
      the analysis of the data.
