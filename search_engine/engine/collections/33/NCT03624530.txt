      remission improves the long-term outcomes for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure even
      after allo-HSCT. Overall, patients experiencing relapse have a dismal prognosis despite
      salvage treatment with TKIs. The prevention of relapse is essential for improving the outcome
      of Ph+ ALL. Strategies to prevent relapse include tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) use, donor
      lymphocyte infusions (DLI), CAR-T and so on. At present, the utility of TKIs administration
      post-transplants is controversial. Our previous clinical trial (ID: NCT01883219) demonstrated
      that pre-emptive TKI administration based on minimal residual disease (MRD) and BCR-ABL
      mutation after allo-HSCT might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve survival for
      patients with Ph+ ALL. Moreover, we found that 58% Ph+ ALL with MRD positive pre-transplants
      would MRD positive post-transplants, whereas only 11.4% Ph+ ALL with MRD negative
      pre-transplants would MRD positive post-transplants, suggesting that Ph+ ALL with MRD
      positive pre-transplants had the higher rate of molecular biology relapse. In this study, we
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic TKI therapy post-transplants on Ph+ ALL
      undergoing allo-HSCT with MRD positive pre-transplants.
