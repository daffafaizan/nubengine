      patients with primary biliary cholangitis and determining the recommended dose.

      The subjects are patients diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis and diagnosed as
      progress of fibrosis (Scheuer stage III or higher) as a result of liver tissue examination.
      As a dosing schedule, OP-724 is intravenously administered twice a week (4 hours) for 12
      weeks. However, once 7 days prior to the first cycle of administration, a dose scheduled for
      the first cycle will be administered once by continuous intravenous administration for 4
      hours, and safety and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated on the day of administration to the
      next day after administration. The dose level shall be 3 doses (140 mg/m2/4hrs, 280
      mg/m2/4hrs [starting dose], 380 mg/m2/4hrs), of which 2 doses shall be registered for up to 6
      patients each. The safety and pharmacokinetic data after OP-724 administration will be
      decided comprehensively to determine the recommended dose in the next phase.
