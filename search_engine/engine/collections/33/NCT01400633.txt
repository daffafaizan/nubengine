    
      This study is a prospective (the study follows a group of individuals over time), open label
      (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), multicenter, single arm (one
      group of patients receiving the same treatment), observational study to observe the response
      rate and safety of decitabine when treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with
      decitabine. Decitabine is to be administered as long as there is evidence of clinical
      benefit. It will be assessed if the treatment duration could be prolonged by appropriate
      toxicity management such as an active antibiotic prophylaxis or dose and schedule
      modification, and whether this leads to potentially increased clinical benefits such as
      higher response rate, longer time to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and prolonged overall survival.
      For safety evaluation, adverse events and peripheral blood findings will be collected. The
      patient will receive decitabine intravenous injection 20mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive
      days every 4 weeks.
