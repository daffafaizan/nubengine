      prevalent and where the majority of deaths involve decisions to withhold or withdraw
      life-sustaining therapies. There is substantial data to suggest that the quality of
      end-of-life care in the ICU is poor. Many patients die with moderate to severe pain,
      physicians are often unaware of patients' wishes regarding end-of-life care, and the care
      patients' receive is often not consistent with their treatment preferences. Our study aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to improve the quality of care for
      patients dying in, or shortly after a stay in, the ICU using a randomized controlled study of
      12 hospitals. In addition we plan to examine the variability in, and predictors of, the
      quality of dying and end-of-life care in community hospital ICUs with the purpose of
      identifying the current quality of end-of-life care and the institutional, clinician, and
      patient factors associated with the quality of this care. We will evaluate the successful and
      unsuccessful components of the intervention and describe the institutional and clinician
      facilitators and barriers to the intervention's implementation, with a focus on identifying
      interventions to improve care for the dying at other sites.
