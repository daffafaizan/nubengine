    
      We plan a randomized controlled trial with 3 different arms, in ICU patients requiring NIV
      for acute respiratory failure : "usual care", "sensory isolation" and "sensory isolation and
      musical intervention".At the onset of respiratory failure, each patient will be randomized in
      one of the 3 arms. "Usual care" assigned patients will receive NIV according to each unit
      protocol; "sensory isolation" assigned patients will receive NIV associated with a mask
      obscuring the eyes and a noise-reducing headset."musical intervention patients" will receive
      a 30 minutes musical intervention during each NIV session. Respiratory discomfort will be
      blindly assessed before, immediately after NIV is correctly set (5 minutes), at 30 minutes,
      and at hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 according to NIV session length, and at the end
      of NIV session during each NIV session.
