      apply to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of hip and back pain, aged between 18-60 years.
      Participants have diagnosed as Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction according to The International
      Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria. These participants will be
      divided into two groups randomly (Treatment group n:26, control group n:26). Because the
      therapeutic effect may be seen with unsealed banding in Kinesio taping and the placebo effect
      may not be evaluated, After the last evaluation, participants in both groups will be given
      the necessary treatment and since there is no study on this subject in the literature, no
      treatment was given to the control group due to the fact that the actual effect of banding
      was desired. The treated group received Kinesio taping 3 times at 5-day intervals, one of the
      fan-shaped cut bands, 2-3 inches above the SIJ, and the other below 2-3 inches below the SIJ,
      and crossed each other by 90 degrees. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and on the 15th
      day by physical examination of the sacroiliac joint, visual analog scale, Modified Oswestry
      Pain Inquiry Form. The kinesiological taping group was also evaluated with VAS and positive
      SIJ pain provocation tests, 20 minutes after the first banding, to assess the acute effect.
