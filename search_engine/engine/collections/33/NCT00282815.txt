      treatments that improve stroke outcome. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)--frequent upper airway
      blockage that occurs during sleep--is common after stroke, affecting more than half of stroke
      patients. The most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in the general population is
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied through a nasal mask during the
      hours of sleep. Positive air pressure holds the naso-oro-pharyngeal airway open during sleep.

      The objective of this single-center, prospective, randomized study is to evaluate CPAP
      treatment in post-stroke patients. Participants will go through a medical interview, a brief
      neurological examination, and a sleep study to screen them for OSA. Those with OSA will be
      eligible for the second phase of the study during which participants will be randomly
      selected to receive either treatment with CPAP or with sham CPAP (placebo).

      This project promises to establish feasibility, develop design and identify suitable outcome
      measures (e.g. hours of CPAP treatment per week, functional outcome, depression, fatigue, and
      impaired alertness) for a large-scale clinical trial of CPAP in stroke patients with OSA. If
      the larger trial shows benefits of CPAP, a new treatment for more than half of all stroke
      patients will become available.
