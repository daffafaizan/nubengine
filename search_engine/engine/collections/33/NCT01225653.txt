      retinal arterioles can be obtained. Retinal arteriolar diameter and the diameter response to
      increased blood pressure is studied using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (Imedos, Germany.

      The secondary objective is to study whether the intervention can halt the development of
      diabetic retinopathy, which is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning and
      fundus photography.
