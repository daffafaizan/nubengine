      Objectives of the study:

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate and compare the clinical marginal bone level change (MBL) around the
      NobelReplaceTM CC implants supporting NobelProceraTM Implant Bar Overdenture
      (fixed-removable) in the mandible with the clinical marginal bone level change (MBL) of the
      NobelReplaceTM CC implants supporting NobelProceraTM Implant Bar Overdenture
      (fixed-removable) in the maxilla for a period of 5 years.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate and compare the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of the NobelReplaceTM CC
           implants supporting NobelProceraTM Implant Bar Overdenture (fixed-removable) in the
           mandible with the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of the NobelReplaceTM CC implants
           supporting NobelProceraTM Implant Bar Overdenture (fixed-removable) in the maxilla for a
           period of 5 years.

        2. To evaluate and compare the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of NobelProceraTM Implant Bar
           Overdenture (fixed-removable) on four (4) NobelReplace CC implants in the mandible with
           the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of NobelProceraTM Implant Bar Overdenture
           (fixed-removable) on four (4) NobelReplace CC implants in the maxilla after 5 years.

        3. To evaluate the clinical behaviour (soft tissue behavior, clinical function, patient
           satisfaction, Quality of Life and prosthetic maintenance needs such as wear, chipping of
           denture teeth, need for exchange of attachment components) of NobelProceraTM Implant Bar
           Overdenture (fixed-removable) in the mandible and maxilla over 5 years of clinical
           function.

      Study design 5-year, open, prospective, clinical multi-center study.

      Number of subjects 76 (in total), 7-9 per center

      Patient population Adult female or male, at least 18 (or age of consent) and not older than
      70 years, suitable for treatment with implant supported bar overdentures in the edentulous
      mandible or maxilla.
