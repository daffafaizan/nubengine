      hypoxia in patients with localized prostate cancer randomized to one single acute I) High
      Intensity Interval Training bout compared to (II) usual care and no training prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      In addition to this the aim is to investigate the effect of one exercise bout on tumor vessel
      morphology and to investigate the effect of one acute exercise bout on intratumoral immune
      cell infiltration and to investigate the modulation of tumor-metabolism, -biology and
      signaling in patients randomized to either one acute High Intensity Interval Training bout
      compared to usual care and no training, the day prior to surgery.

      Moreover this study will explore the acute response in immune cells, hormones and cytokines
      in blood samples taken before, during and after a single exercise session, and will collect
      physiological (metabolic profile and metabolic inflammatory markers) and psycho-social (e.g.
      fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) information regarding patients randomized to either
      one acute High Intensity Interval Training bout compared to usual care and no training, the
      day prior to surgery.
