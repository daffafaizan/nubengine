    
      Aims: The Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP) aims to implement and
      evaluate in a controlled, randomized trial the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and
      sustainability of a culturally appropriate, low-cost, and sustainable lifestyle intervention
      for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in India.

      Methods: D-CLIP, a translational research project adapted from the methods and curriculum
      developed and tested for efficacy in the Diabetes Prevention Program, utilizes innovated
      methods (a step-wise model of diabetes prevention with lifestyle and metformin added when
      needed; inclusion of individuals with isolated impaired glucose tolerance, isolated impaired
      fasting glucose, and both; classes team-taught by professionals and trained community
      educators) with the goals of increasing diabetes prevention, community acceptability, and
      long-term dissemination and sustainability of the program. The primary outcome is, diabetes
      incidence, and secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness, changes in anthropometric measures,
      plasma lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, and HbA1c, and program acceptability and
      sustainability assessed using a mixed methods approach.

      Conclusion: D-CLIP, a low-cost, community-based, research program, addresses the key
      components of translational research and can be used as a model for prevention of chronic
      diseases in other low- and middle-income country settings.
