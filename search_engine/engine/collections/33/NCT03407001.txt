      I. Determine the accuracy of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) utilizing contrast agent
      sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres compared to B-mode non-contrast enhanced
      ultrasound for liver lesion detection, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in cirrhotic
      ultrasound (US) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the concordance of CEUS vs. contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (CE-MRI) Liver Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (Li-Rads).

      OUTLINE:

      Within 30 days of routine MRI, participants undergo non-contrast ultrasound of the abdomen.
      Participants then receive Lumason intravenously (IV) and undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      of the abdomen over 1 hour.
