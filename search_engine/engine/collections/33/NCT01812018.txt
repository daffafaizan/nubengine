      Endostar at a dosage of 7.5 mg/m2 will be administered on Day 1-14 of each cycle. Gemcitabine
      (1000 mg/m2) will be administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) will
      be administered on Day 2 of each cycle. An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as a
      3-week (21-day) period. Cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks. Multiple cycles may be
      administered until the subject is PD or until a maximum of 6 cycles. Time-to-progression
      (TTP) will be assessed using the Kaplan Meier method. Overall response rate (ORR) as well as
      individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be determined using RECIST
      (v1.1). Evaluation of 1- and 2-year overall survival will also be performed. Safety measures
      will be recorded using the NCI-CTCAE (v4.0).
