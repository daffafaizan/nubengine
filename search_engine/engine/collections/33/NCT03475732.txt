    
      XueBiJing injection, a five-herb combination approved by Chinese FDA in 2004, has been widely
      used as an add-on therapy in routine sepsis care in Chinese clinics. A comprehensive
      pharmacokinetic research on this herbal injection has been conducted in healthy human
      subjects, and the major circulating XueBiJing compounds, as well as their systemic exposure
      levels and forms and pharmacokinetic characteristics, have been identified. However, it is
      known that sepsis may induce hepatic, renal and cardiac dysfunction, alter drug metabolizing
      enzymes and transporters activities, increase capillary permeability, and induce various
      pathophysiological changes. All these will affect the concentrations at the action sites and
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of XueBiJing compounds, which contribute to the injection's
      overall therapeutic action, thus influencing the anti-septic efficacy of the injection. The
      purpose of this prospective, open label study is to identify the circulating XueBiJing
      compounds in patients with sepsis after intravenously dosing XueBiJing injection and their
      systemic exposure forms and levels, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the associated
      inter-patient differences of these XueBiJing compounds.
