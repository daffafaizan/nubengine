    
      The study will include volunteers of both sexes, aged 18-55 years inclusive. The study will
      involve 268 (will receive the vaccine or placebo) healthy volunteers.

      At the first stage, it is planned:

        -  study the safety of component 1 - 40 volunteers and 4 spares *

        -  study the safety of prime-boost vaccination with component 1 and component 2 with an
           interval of 21 days in half and full dose - 40 volunteers and 4 spares * At the second
           phase, it is planned to study the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine as part of a
           placebo-controlled randomized trial - 188 people, of whom 138 will receive the vaccine,
           and 50 will make up the control group of observation - they will be given a placebo.
           Data from 20 volunteers from the first phase who received the drug in selected dose will
           be included in the analysis of safety and immunogenicity of the second phase.

             -  Volunteers are replaced by spares before the introduction of the drug, if the
                volunteer took the drug, then the replacement is not performed.

      Any volunteer who received a dose of the vaccine will be considered as included in the study,
      the data available on it will be used in assessing the safety and tolerability of the drug.
