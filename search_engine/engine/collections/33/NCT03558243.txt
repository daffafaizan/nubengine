      although clinically silent in most cases, has been associated with critical hand ischemia,
      more importantly it limits the radial approach for future coronary interventions, and limits
      the use of this conduit for coronary revascularization surgery and arteriovenous fistulas.

      Factors that prevent occlusion of the radial artery have been identified, including the use
      of several hemostatic techniques at the conclusion of cardiac catheterization.

      The patent hemostasis defined as a technique that allows permeability of the radial artery
      and at the same time ensures the absence of bleeding was the first hemostatic method that
      showed a decrease in the incidence of radial artery occlusion, it is currently the quality
      standard for hemostasis in transradial access worldwide. Recently, the patent hemostasis plus
      ulnar compression was described, which proved in a randomized clinical trial to be superior
      to conventional patent haemostasis, decreasing the incidence of radial artery occlusion to
      0.8% at 30 days. These hemostatic methods are a subject of current research worldwide. And
      more clinical trials are expected to confirm the superiority of patent hemostasis plus ulnar
      compression.

      The hemostatic discs used at the beginning as an attempt to reduce the times for the
      hemostasis of the radial access and therefore the recovery times in units of high volume have
      attracted attention for their effectiveness and their low incidence of radial artery
      occlusion, there are few reports who place it as a potential strategy to reduce the incidence
      of radial artery occlusion. Its effectiveness should be validated in dedicated trials with an
      adequate sample size.
