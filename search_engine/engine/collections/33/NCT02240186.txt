      Each subject will be tested using their current NMPK, fit and tested with a MPK, and then
      tested again with their NMPK. MPK prostheses from all manufacturers will be considered
      appropriate for testing. Each MPK to be used in this study is FDA approved. The foot will be
      in the L5981 class, e.g. flex foot or equivalent. The same socket, suspension, and foot will
      be used throughout the study in order to eliminate these confounding variables. All
      prosthesis fittings will be performed by the subject's own certified prosthetist according to
      manufacturers' fitting guidelines.
