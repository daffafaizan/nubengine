    
      Specific aims include exploration of possible mechanisms of adverse events that have been
      observed in iron supplementation trials in infants in malaria endemic regions by:

        1. Characterizing the impact of enteral iron administration on the evolution of the
           intestinal microbiome in infants from 6 to 9 months of age.

        2. Characterizing iron administration-associated inflammatory responses and correlate these
           with changes in the intestinal microbiome in infants from 6 to 9 months of age.
           Specifically, changes in the microbiome will be correlated with biomarkers reflecting:

             1. Intestinal inflammation;

             2. Systemic inflammation, bacterial translocation, and oxidant stress;

             3. Iron status and homeostasis

        3. Quantify to what degree Fe interferes with Zn absorption (TAZ) and how it affects the
           size of the infant's exchangeable zinc pool (EZP).
