    
      In this post-market study, the population will include real-world subjects who are intended
      to be treated, with SLENDER IDS as standard therapy. Follow-up contacts post procedure will
      be made for clinical assessments at hospital discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months.

      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, observational all-comers
      clinical study to collect ongoing safety and efficacy of SLENDER IDS and to determine the
      feasibility of a direct stenting strategy in an all-comers population. A minimum of two
      hundred fifty (250) subjects will be treated at up to 20 sites in Europe.

      Review of safety data and risks to subjects will be monitored by an independent Clinical
      Events Committee (CEC) at pre-specified enrollment milestones.
