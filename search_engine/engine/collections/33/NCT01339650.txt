      pharmacodynamics of ABT-767 in subjects with advanced BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated solid tumors and
      high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. ABT-767 is a potent
      oral inhibitor of the enzymes poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP-1 and PARP-2).
      Malignancies with deficiencies in homologous repair, such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 deficient
      tumors, are more dependent on PARP for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair than normal cells
      and, thus, are thought to be more sensitive to PARP inhibition. The study design is a
      single-arm dose escalation study to determine dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated
      dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of orally administered ABT-767 in subjects with
      BRCA mutations and malignancies. In order to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-767 at the RPTD, 20 additional subjects will be enrolled in an expanded safety cohort
      consisting of BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated Breast cancer and Ovarian cancer.
