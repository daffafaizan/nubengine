      of Washington were invited to participate in the study. Given the high prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this population, no screen for OSA was performed. Enrolled
      patients were assigned randomly to active-CPAP with auto-titrating pressures or to sham-CPAP
      with an otherwise identical device but with pressures â‰¤ 1 cm water. Subjects used active or
      sham-CPAP for the duration of inpatient rehabilitation, but no longer than 28 days. CPAP
      compliance was assessed by memory card that recorded mask-on time. Other information on
      download, such as apnea-hypopnea index, was only available on active-CPAP and not assessed by
      investigators in real time. In this study, the investigators defined tolerance as any
      continued use of CPAP at night and adherence as mean hours of CPAP use per night in those who
      were CPAP tolerant.
