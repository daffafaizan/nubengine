      reduce immune inhibitory factors in participants with chronic hepatitis B. This study will
      also examine if antiviral therapy has a durable effect in host immune phenotype and define
      the immunological effect of interferon-alpha (IFNÎ±) therapy in chronic HBV participants.

      Aim 2. Antiviral immune effector and regulatory responses before, during and/or after therapy
      can predict long term therapeutic response.
