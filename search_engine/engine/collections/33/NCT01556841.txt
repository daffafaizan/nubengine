      without clinical symptoms and with a low volume disease on the CT scan. For this group of
      patients, no survival benefit has been demonstrated from early chemotherapy treatment and, on
      average, the time to start of chemotherapy is 5 months. Such patients could benefit from
      immunotherapy and the time to chemotherapy could potentially be prolonged. Multiple
      immunotherapy agents, such as anti-CA-125 antibodies and various vaccines, have been tested
      and, although there is plenty of evidence of immune response, this has not translated to a
      definitive clinical benefit and is not recommended in clinical practice

      5T4 appears to be highly expressed in ovarian cancer and correlates with more advanced stage
      of disease and poorly differentiated tumours. TroVax®, the vaccine targeting 5T4, has an
      extensive record of safety and efficacy in humans and vaccination in patients with
      colorectal, renal, and prostate cancer resulted in immune cellular and humoral responses and
      signs of clinical benefit.

      We propose a trial of TroVax® vaccination in patients with CA-125-relapsed asymptomatic
      ovarian cancer to assess the clinical efficacy and immunological responses as outlined in
      this protocol. To allow for capture of any delayed response to immunotherapy, patients who
      progress on RECIST 1.1 criteria and who do not experience toxicity from treatment will
      continue on the vaccine/placebo injection until repeat imaging at 8 weeks in order for
      immune-related response criteria (irRC) to be evaluated in addition to RECIST 1.1 criteria
      (these patients as a standard of care would not receive any other therapeutic intervention).
