    
      Background:

        -  The dimethane sulfonates are a group of agents that were identified as active against
           renal cell carcinoma in the NCI anticancer drug screen.

        -  In vitro studies showed that dimethane sulfonates have properties in common with
           alkylating agents, but are unlike conventional alkylators (such as nitrogen mustards,
           BCNU, or busulfan) in that they are active against renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Objective:

      Primary:

      -To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), MTD and recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of
      dimethane sulfonate (DMS612, NSC 281612) when administered by intravenous (IV) bolus on day 1
      and 2 of a 21-day cycle.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is
           metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not
           exist or are no longer effective.

        -  Any prior chemotherapy therapy is allowed in this protocol. No more than 2 prior
           cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are allowed.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
           currently available on the use of Dimethane sulfonate in patients less than 18 years of
           age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric
           phase 1 single-agent trials.

        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%,).

        -  Life expectancy of 3 months or greater.

        -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes
           greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL, absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to
           1,500/mm(3), platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/, mm(3) total bilirubin within
           normal institutional limits, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT), less than or equal to 2.5 times the
           institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine within normal institutional limits or
           creatinine clearance greater than 50mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above
           institutional normal.

      Design:

      This is a Phase I study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor
      activity of IV DMS612, NSC 281612, designed as an open-label, dose-escalation study to
      determine the RPTD of DMS612, NSC 281612 based on safety and pharmacokinetics. With the
      02/09/2015 amendment and change in schedule to evaluate a day 1 and 2 dosing every 6 weeks
      the following schema will be used:

      Dose Level Dose of NSC 281612 Escalation (%)

        -  1 3.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 -33

           4A 4.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 ---

           5A 6 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

           6A 8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 67

           7A 10.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

           7B 10.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 q 6 weeks ---

           8A 14 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

           8B 14 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 q 6 weeks --
