      infection in the feet of patients with diabetes from bone samples obtained by biopsies
      performed in usaual care practice.

      Bone biopsies will be performed in patients diagnosed for osteomyelitis from clinical,
      biological and MRI signs. Bone samples will be collected in Ultra-TurraxÂ® tubes in the
      operating theater before being transferred to the department of bacteriology. Time of
      registration at the bacteriology lab will be considered as Time 0 (T0).

      Samples will be processed simultaneously using the usual culture method and by PCR Multiplex
      tests.

      The time of identification of causative bacteria for bone infection (time 1, T1) and the time
      of identification of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (time 2, T2) by the two different
      methods will be recorded.

      Identified germs and their sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics according to the two methods
      will be compared.

      If the results are similar, the time that could be gained for the prescription of specific
      antibiotics from PCR multiplex tests' results will be computed in comparison to the
      prescription performed from the results of usual cultures.
