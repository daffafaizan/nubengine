    
      Rationale:

      Survivors of critical illness frequently develop long-term mental, cognitive, and/or physical
      impairments summarized as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). On the national society level,
      Germany uses 10 core QIs that are evidence-based to improve treatment quality at ICUs.

      Objective:

      To investigate whether a tele-medical intervention delivered at ICU improves the adherence to
      established evidence-based QIs in intensive care medicine compared to the adherence at ICUs
      delivering usual care.

      Study design:

      ERIC is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled quality improvement trial with
      participating ICUs crossing over from usual care to a multifaceted e-health intervention.
      After the rollout, all recruiting sites will have implemented the experimental intervention
      for at least 4 months. Follow-up assessments on the patient-level at month 3 and 6 after ICU
      discharge (index stay) will be conducted in the outpatient or inpatient setting (dependent on
      the patient's health status).

      Study population:

      Critically ill patients covered by statutory health insurance treated at participating ICUs
      in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany. It is planned to recruit 1431 study patients within 16
      months.

      Intervention:

      Complex telemedicine-based intervention incorporating the use of e-health technologies
      (virtual care), supported by blended learning of ICU staff prior to the site's crossover.

      Comparison:

      Intensive care according to current practice.

      Endpoints:

      Eight co-primary endpoints will be specified. A primary efficacy endpoint is the adherence to
      a single QI in intensive care medicine (definition according to Kumpf O. et al., 2017)
      measured on a daily basis, on a patient-level.
