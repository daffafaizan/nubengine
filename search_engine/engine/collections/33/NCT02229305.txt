      clinics for problems related to disruptive behaviors, depression, anxiety, traumatic stress,
      and any combination of these problems. Using a randomized block design, therapists were
      randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment procedures (usual care, or UC) in their clinics
      or an evidence-based, modularized treatment (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with
      Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems, or MATCH-ADTC). MATCH-ADTC was supported by
      training and supervision procedures designed to fit providers and their clinic contexts.
      Assessments were carried out at pre-treatment, at post-treatment, and at 3-,6-,9-,12,18-,and
      24-month follow-ups. Assessments carried out at pre-treatment included (a) individual youth
      problems and disorders; (b) individual youth functioning at home and school; and (c) clinic
      staff beliefs and attitudes toward evidence-based treatments. Assessments carried out at
      post-treatment and follow-ups included measures of (1) youth, caregiver, and therapist
      satisfaction with treatment; (b) youth, caregiver, and therapist views on the quality of the
      therapeutic relationship; and (c) treatment costs. Assessments carried out at follow-up only
      included measures of (a) caregiver reports of any mental health service use following project
      treatment; (b) therapist reports on the extent to which the treatment procedures they used in
      the project are continued after project termination. Analyses will address critical questions
      about deployment of evidence-based youth practices to clinical settings.
