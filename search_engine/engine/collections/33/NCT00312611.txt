      in a population of patients with a BMI between 35 and 55. Initially, a maximum of 150
      patients will be followed for 12 months in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      multi-center study to evaluate efficacy and safety of the IGS. All patients will be implanted
      with the IGS System and randomized to a control group (IGS OFF) or a treatment group (IGS
      ON). Both groups will follow a 500kcal/day-deficit diet (Appendix A) and participate in
      monthly support group meetings (Appendix E). The study will last for 24 months after
      randomization. The sponsor plans to submit a PreMarket Approval (PMA) application when all
      patients have completed 12 months of post-randomization follow-up. After 12 months from
      randomization, patients will continue to be followed monthly for another year, during which
      all patients will receive gastric electrical stimulation and the long-term efficacy and
      safety and maintenance of weight loss will be evaluated. After 24 months from randomization,
      all remaining patients will have the option to enter an extension study for an additional
      four years, during which the long-term efficacy and safety and maintenance of weight loss
      will continue to be evaluated.
