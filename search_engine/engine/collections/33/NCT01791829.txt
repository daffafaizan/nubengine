      retrospective analyses of prospective trials and suggests that luminal A combined with other
      known clinical prognostic factors could be used to select patients treated with BCS at very
      low risk for IBTR who could avoid BI. Given that using intrinsic subtyping combined with
      other clinical factors to identify women who could avoid BI would be a major change in
      clinical practice, we propose that a prospective study is necessary to confirm that such an
      approach can accurately identify a group of women at very low risk for IBTR following BCS.

      We anticipate that the risk of IBTR in the low risk group is likely to be lower than that
      observed in previous trials (predicted to be < 5% at 5 years and < 10% at 10 years) for
      several reasons: first, our selection criteria (node negative, luminal A, > or = 55 years,
      tumours < or = 2cm, excision margin > or = 1mm post-BCS, absence of lobular cancers,
      extensive intraductal component and lymphovascular invasion) are more restrictive than in
      previous trials and second, the risks of IBTR are steadily decreasing over time due to
      improvements in mammographic screening, pre-op staging, tumour localization, and surgical
      practice. The expected low failure rates are unlikely to warrant the use of radiation.

      A prospective cohort study was identified as the most appropriate and efficient design as our
      primary hypothesis is that a group of patients at very low risk of IBTR can be identified. A
      randomized trial could address the effectiveness of radiation in such a cohort of patients,
      but would require a much larger sample size to detect very small differences, which would not
      be clinically meaningful. During the conduct of this trial it is anticipated that patients
      who do not meet study criteria or who decline study enrollment, will continue to receive BI
      after BCS.
