      studies thus far have focused mostly on the acute phase of treatment rather than long-term
      management and have not offered alternative treatment strategies when patients do not respond
      to an initial course of naltrexone. For these initial non-responders to naltrexone, it is
      unclear what adjustments to treatment should be made to increase the likelihood of treatment
      success. We are unaware of previous research focused specifically on naltrexone non-response.
      Pilot data from ongoing trials at our center, however, suggest that up to a third of patients
      fail to respond to naltrexone. Moreover, these non-responsive patients go on to have the
      worst outcomes during the next 6 months of treatment if maintained on the same combination of
      naltrexone and medication management (MM). We propose to augment medication management with a
      combination of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (combined
      behavioral intervention - CBI) and to test the benefits of continued/discontinued treatment
      with naltrexone in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Clinical strategies for second line
      treatments often favor switching treatments rather than augmentation. However, there may be
      synergies between naltrexone and CBI that were not apparent with medication management.
      Specifically, CBI may have advantages in motivating patients to greater medication adherence
      (a leading cause of naltrexone treatment failure) and CBI may address psychosocial factors
      that limited or attenuated the effects of naltrexone.
