      consented to participate will be randomized at time of ICU discharge in either follow-up or
      not follow-up arm. The medical, psychological and social follow-up consists of
      multidisciplinary consultation at time of ICU discharge (i.e. inclusion), at three, six and
      12 months afterward. Patients of the "non follow-up group" will be seen only at one year.
      Medical consultation will be focused on evaluation of pre-existing co-morbidities, detection
      of new ones and of physical disorders related to critical illness (i.e. ICU-acquired paresis,
      pain, functional disability, cognitive dysfunctionâ€¦). Psychological assessment will be
      focused on detection of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Social
      follow-up will assess the social need of the patient in the professional and private domains.
      Each assessment will be standardized by using validated or appropriate scores. At the end of
      each multidisciplinary consultation, a report will be sent to the patient and his general
      practitioner. When necessary, a consultation with a specialist will be organized. At one
      year, an observer blinded from randomization will call all the patients to assess their
      quality of life with help of EQ5D questionnaire. Economical cost of multidisciplinary
      follow-up will be assessed.

      To our knowledge, there is no follow-up studies that have combined a medical, psychological
      and social cares. For instance, the PracTical study has not evidenced an improvement of
      quality of life in patients who had beneficiated from nurse consultations at 3 and 9 months.
