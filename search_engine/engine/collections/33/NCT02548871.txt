      (CPS) with equal number of schools randomized to intervention and comparison groups for two
      cohort years. Students were administered a scannable paper survey at three time points:
      baseline, post-program and 1-year post program. The primary impact analysis used an
      intent-to-treat approach. Implementation of TOP® was assessed by conducting classroom
      observations. TOP® was delivered in a variety of classroom settings over the school year by
      facilitators from CPS and partner organizations.
