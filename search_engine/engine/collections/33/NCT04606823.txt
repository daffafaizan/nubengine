      across Europe (UK, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands). In total, 50 adult patients with a
      hearing loss that are already planned for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin)
      bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will be included in the study.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after implantation
      of the Ponto implant system using a minimally invasive surgical technique. The implant,
      coupled to a skin-penetrating abutment, is implanted in the bone behind the ear and is later
      loaded with a sound processor which transforms sound waves to sound vibrations that can be
      sent directly to the inner ear via the skull bone. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate the proportion of implant/abutment complexes providing a reliable anchorage for a
      sound processor three months after implantation/surgery.
