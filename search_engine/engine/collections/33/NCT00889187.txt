      Primary

        -  Phase I: To determine the feasibility and tolerability of radiation therapy for
           pancreatic cancer delivered with high dose external beam radiation in a one week
           accelerated schedule with concurrent capecitabine

        -  Phase II: To demonstrate a grade 3 or greater (any) toxicity rate of less than 20%

      Secondary

        -  To determine local control and recurrence patterns of pancreatic cancer relative to a
           standard regimen of 50.4 Gy as seen in historical controls

        -  To determine the pathologic response rate

        -  To determine the progression-free survival

        -  To determine the surgical morbidity

        -  To determine 30-day post-operative mortality after pancreatic resection
