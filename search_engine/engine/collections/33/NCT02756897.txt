    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate therapeutic activity (best response [complete response (CR)/complete response
      with incomplete recovery (CRi)]) of combined ibrutinib and venetoclax in patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of this combination strategy. II. To estimate the time to best
      response with this combination. III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).

      IV. To test pharmacodynamic endpoints and molecular interactions between these two drugs.

      V. To assess the therapeutic activity (best response [CR/CRi]) in subgroups of patients
      defined by immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) mutation or fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) subtype.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To study immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow
      in response to ibrutinib and venetoclax.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Beginning on day 1 of
      cycle 4, patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with residual disease or who are positive for minimal residual disease (MRD) after cycle 27
      may continue treatment with ibrutinib.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
