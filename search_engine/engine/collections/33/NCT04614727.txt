      apply, painless, not changing the dental color, fast onset, and maintain a long-term effect
      gives a highlight to the patented formula of the polymeric nano calcium fluoride which newly
      introduced into the practice .

      OliNano SEAL is an innovative "varnish-like" protector based on a patented silicone polymer
      with a true nano technology that provides an exceptional adhesion to enamel and dentin
      without prior etching for approximately 12 months (other available products max. 2-3 months).

      It consists of four components Silicone polymer provides excellent adhesion to enamel and
      dentine, with transparent formula. NANO-fluoroapatite flows into enamel micro cracks & seals
      it, penetrating into the dentinal tubules closing them eventually. As for the NANO-calcium
      fluoride it behaves as a fluoride reservoir, provides gradual and long-term fluoride release.
      The fourth component Amine fluoride (Olaflur) provides immediate fluoride ion release and
      accelerates natural remineralization.
