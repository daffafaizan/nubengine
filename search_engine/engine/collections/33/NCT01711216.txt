    
      The program is designed as a prospective, multicentre, observational, non-interventional,
      non-randomized, non-controlled, single arm, post-marketing program. Being an observational
      program, the assignment of patients to dydrogesterone therapy will not be decided with an
      intention to include patients in the program, but will be guided as per standard clinical
      practice of the treating physician. Hence the prescribing of dydrogesterone will be clearly
      separate from the decision to include patients in this program. All dydrogesterone
      prescriptions will be made in accordance with locally approved package insert for
      dydrogesterone.
