      an antagonist of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, SR141716, decreases food intake in animals as
      well as in humans and decreases alcohol consumption in rodent models of voluntary ethanol
      consumption. In this protocol, individuals consuming between 20 and 40 alcohol drinks per
      week, and who are not seeking alcohol treatment, will be recruited from the community.
      Following a one week baseline evaluation, participants will be randomized according to a
      double-blind design to receive either placebo or SR141716 for two additional weeks prior to
      being admitted to the hospital to participate in an alcohol self-administration experiment.
      The design of this experiment has been previously shown by O'Malley et al. (1) to be an
      effective paradigm to study the effects of medication on alcohol consumption. Following
      baseline psychological and endocrine measures, participants will receive a priming dose of
      ethanol designed to raise the breath alcohol levels (BAL) to 0.03 g/dl and then have the
      opportunity to consume up to eight drinks or to receive $3 dollars for each drink not
      consumed over a two hour period. It is hypothesized that participants receiving SR141716,
      compared to those receiving placebo, will have decreased alcohol consumption. Following the
      study, each participant will be carefully counseled about their alcohol consumption and
      provided referrals for alcohol treatment.
