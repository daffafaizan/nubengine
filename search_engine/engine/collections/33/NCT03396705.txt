      inadequate. The human liver is quite different and needs to be studied directly. The cell
      expression of human liver cells during regeneration has many implications for treatment of
      patients with cirrhosis and cancer.

      This study will characterize the role of the different liver cell types in the regeneration
      process and will examine gene expression changes in the various liver cell types. We
      hypothesize that there is significant crosstalk among hepatocytes, macrophages, and T-cell
      subsets in the human liver, stimulating the regenerative process.

      Tissue will be obtained from serial biopsies of "healthy" liver that is regenerating in
      patients who undergo liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. All participants must
      first provide written informed consent and meet study eligibility criteria. The first tissue
      sample will be collected intraoperatively, then serial fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB)
      will be performed approx. 1 week following surgery, and 1 month following surgery. Liver
      regeneration will also be assessed using routine imaging of the liver at approx. 3 months.

      Retrospective (previously collected diagnostic or biobanked) tissue is also being included
      for study, given lower than anticipated enrollment.
