      subject (or, when necessary, the parent or legal guardian if the subject is younger than 18
      years of age or under guardianship) will be read the approved protocol consent form. Patients
      who have given informed consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of
      the two study arms one day before the procedure. The study team present will open the sealed
      envelopes provided by the Indus Hospital Research Center's Clinical Research Unit (CRU) that
      provides the study arm allocation. The envelopes will follow the SNOSE protocol.
