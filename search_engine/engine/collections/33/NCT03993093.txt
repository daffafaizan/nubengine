      who remain untreated due to lack of knowledge of existing HIV infections, often get OIs. HIV
      patients with AIDS defining OIs fall into stage 3 of HIV illness. Prevalence of OIs in
      resource poor settings are tuberculosis (pulmonary and extra pulmonary), toxoplasmosis,
      cryptococcosis, and oesophageal candidiasis. There are a few data to show AIDS defining OIs
      in treatment na√Øve HIV patients. Incidence of OIs among HIV patients in United States, and
      Canada between 2000 to 2019 was 9%. Leading OIs were peumocystis Jiroveci, oesophageal
      candidiasis and disseminated MAC or M. kansassi.

      Minimal diagnoses at poor settings can be made by observation of symptoms, use of microscope,
      imaging and diagnostic therapy.
