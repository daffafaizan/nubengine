    
      This is a participatory research study which will enroll women (n of up to 56) with
      experience of menopause to help identify preferred strategies (modalities) for weight loss,
      which will combine calorie (dietary) restriction and exercise tactics.

      Aim 1: Explore attitudes and perceptions about weight gain during the menopause transition,
      and identify weight loss strategies from the patient (peer) perspective.

      - The investigators will apply these learnings: 1) to understand barriers for weight
      management during menopause; 2) to establish strategies to guide retention; 3) to finalize
      the intervention structure, including feedback on the frequency and duration of the study
      visits; and 4) to gather feedback on menopause-specific education resources set to be
      provided throughout the intervention.

      Aim 2: Engage the Community Advisory Board (CAB) of the Louisiana Clinical and Translational
      Center (LA CaTS) to understand scalability and community-based implementation of an
      intervention tailored for women in perimenopause.

      - The investigators will then utilize the Louisiana Clinical & Translational Science Center
      (LA CaTS) Community Advisory Board (CAB) to help us tailor a lifestyle intervention in
      perimenopausal women with emphasis on scalability and community-based implementation using
      learnings obtained from the focus groups.
