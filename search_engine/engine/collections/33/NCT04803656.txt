      obstruction against harmful particles and gases in the airway and lungs, and is progressive,
      treatable and preventable.

      The severity of the disease in COPD is determined according to the GOLD (Global Initiative
      for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines (2). While determining the severity of
      airway obstruction with the patient's spirometric values in COPD; Combined COPD assessment is
      made with symptomatic evaluation, number of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Airway
      restriction is numerically (GOLD 1-4), symptom evaluation and exacerbation risk combined with
      letter grouping (Group A-D).

      There is a loss of respiratory and peripheral muscle strength in COPD patients. A mixture of
      various local and systemic causes was responsible for respiratory muscle dysfunction in COPD.
      Immobility, systemic inflammation, hypoxia of the tissue, oxidative stress and increased
      apoptosis of the skeletal muscle have been identified as possible pathogenic factors for loss
      of peripheral muscle strength in COPD patients.

      it was aimed to evaluate the respiratory functions, respiratory muscle strength and
      peripheral muscle strength of patients with different COPD groups clinically and to evaluate
      their correlation with the duration and prognosis of the disease.
