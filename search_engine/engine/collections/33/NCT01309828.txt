      (RAAS). Drugs that modulate the RAAS are used commonly worldwide for the treatment of
      hypertension. TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is a prodrug of TAK-536 (azilsartan), an
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Azilsartan medoxomil is being evaluated by Takeda to
      treat participants with essential hypertension.

      Chlorthalidone is an orally administered thiazide-like diuretic agent, and long-term outcomes
      trials show blood pressure reductions associated with chlorthalidone treatment reduce risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      Hypertensive patients with moderate renal impairment are a relatively more severe and
      resistant hypertension population, and may benefit from effective fixed-dose combination
      treatments such as an ARB plus a diuretic for blood pressure control.

      Participants will be randomized to receive azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone or
      olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 52 weeks to evaluate long term safety
      of azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone. A titration-to-target blood pressure approach
      will be used to guide the titration of study medication in this trial.
