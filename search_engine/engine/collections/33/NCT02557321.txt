      portion of the study (Main Cohort). Up to an additional 24 eligible subjects who have failed
      to achieve a complete or partial response to or progressed on prior checkpoint inhibition
      will be enrolled in a first expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 1). Up to an additional 24
      eligible subjects with Stage III unresectable, in-transit or satellite melanoma will be
      enrolled in a second expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 2). Each subject in each Phase 1b
      cohort will receive the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab.

      Phase 2. A total of an estimated 120 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      the two treatment arms (i.e., PV-10 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone) in the Phase 2
      portion of the study. This number of subjects may be modified based on emerging evidence of
      preliminary efficacy and effect size from the Phase 1b and initial Phase 2 portions of the
      study.

      Subjects assigned to receive PV-10 in Phase 1b and 2 will receive initial IL PV-10 to their
      injectable lesions commencing on study Day 1 for up to 12 weeks (i.e., investigational
      Treatment Phase of the study). PV-10 may be re-administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals
      during the Treatment Phase of the study to any remaining, uninjected injectable lesions until
      all injectable lesions have been injected. Lesions that fail to exhibit complete ablation may
      be re-injected on this schedule.

      Pembrolizumab will be administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals per prescribing information
      (label) commencing on study Day 1 for up to 24 months or until disease progression, toxicity
      requiring discontinuation of study treatment or study termination.
