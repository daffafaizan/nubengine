      have locally advanced-stage disease, including TNM stage cT3-4N1-2M0 and require a total
      laryngectomy as an initial therapy. Patients who achieved a CR or PR at the primary site
      after three cycles of TPF-regimen chemotherapy combined with immuotherapy will be referred
      for definitive RT and immuotherapy, while patients who received an evaluation of PD or SD at
      the primary site were referred for surgery followed by adjuvant RT/CRT.
