      if they have non-small cell lung cancer that could be removed surgically. If confirmed to
      have non-small cell lung cancer that can be surgically removed, he or she may be able to
      continue as a possible participant in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy that
      is given before surgery) will improve the amount of time a participant is free from disease
      in people with non-metastatic (has not spread from the original site) non-small cell lung
      cancer. The chemotherapy medications that will be used in this study are cisplatin and
      pemetrexed or cisplatin and gemcitabine and have been shown to be effective in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.
