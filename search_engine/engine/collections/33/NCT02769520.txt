    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open label, phase II study with a window of opportunity
      component in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
      treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab following salvage surgery. Forty-five (45) patients will
      participate in this study to determine disease-free survival probability at 12 months.
      Secondary objectives include assessments of disease-free survival probability at 2 years,
      overall survival, adverse events and toxicity, and immune and molecular correlatives. For the
      window of opportunity component, patients will be randomized 3:1 in favor of receiving
      pembrolizumab 200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every three weeks for a maximum of two
      doses, versus placebo prior to salvage surgery. Approximately three to six weeks following
      the first dose of pembrolizumab, patients will undergo salvage surgery. Tumor tissue and
      blood will be collected at the time of surgery for immune correlative studies.
