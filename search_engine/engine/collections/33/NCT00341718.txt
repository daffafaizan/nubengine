      their genetics exam. Patient response to serving as a teaching case has been studied only on
      a limited extent. This study proposes to qualitatively explore the ways in which taking on a
      teaching role in a genetics clinic is experienced by patients with visible differences.

      Qualitative telephone interviews with approximately 30 genetics patients with visible
      differences will be conducted. The interviews will be semi-structured and an interview guide
      will be loosely followed. Interviews will be recorded and transcripts of the interviews will
      be coded for analysis. A typology of common themes will be compiled and reported. Information
      collected through these interviews will improve understanding of the phenomenon of patients
      in educator roles, relate experiences to patient expectations and will fill a gap in the
      published literature. It is additionally hoped that results of this study may inform the
      development of new recommendations to enhance educational experiences in genetics clinics.
