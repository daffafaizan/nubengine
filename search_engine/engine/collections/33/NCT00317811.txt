      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (combined complete response [CR], near CR, partial
           response [PR], and minimal response [MR]) and time to progression of disease in patients
           with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib, ascorbic acid, and
           melphalan.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the time to response in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Assess time to disease progression among subjects who continue to maintenance treatment
           with bortezomib.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral
           melphalan and oral ascorbic acid on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days to maximum
           response [MR] or for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease receive an additional 2 courses
           of induction therapy beyond MR and proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients with stable
           disease or without a maximum reduction in their paraprotein after 8 courses of induction
           therapy are eligible to receive maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
