      patients with platinum-resistant advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer,
      or primary peritoneal cancer treated with TLK286. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in
      these patients. III. Determine the duration of objective response, time to tumor progression,
      and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive TLK286 IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12
      months.
