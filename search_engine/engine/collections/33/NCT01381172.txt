    
      The Impulse Dynamics FIX-HF-5C Study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signals delivered
      by the implantable OPTIMIZER System in patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure and
      an ejection fraction 25-45%. The study will involve the recruitment of 160 subjects at a
      total of up to 60 sites.

      Those subjects who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria based upon baseline test
      results will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the OPTIMIZER System plus optimal
      medical therapy (OMT) or to a control group receiving OMT alone. All randomized subjects will
      be followed for 24 weeks and shall receive the same study related assessments throughout the
      course of the study. In addition, all subjects will continue to receive OMT for the treatment
      of their heart failure. Mortality will be reported out to 2 years.
