      increasing the socio-economic problem. Depending on the reason for the dysfunction, various
      classifications describing the level of advancement are used. Literature on the subject
      commonly uses the division into protrusion and extrusion of the intervertebral disc, as
      approved by the American Society of Neuroradiology.

      Stabilizing training is one of the forms of conservative treatment of lumbar pain, alongside
      manual treatment or techniques from the field of chiropractics or physiotherapy. It is
      thought that the proper stabilization of this region of the body is crucial for coping with
      pain.

      Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of stabilizing training of
      deep core muscles in the lumbar spine in subjects in the age of 20-35 years, considering the
      progression level of degenerative disc disease: protrusion or extrusion, on the basis of the
      clinical condition.
