      oncological patients, where it is used for diagnosis, following up response to treatment and
      later for detection of possible recurrence. The main problem encountered with MRI is the long
      time required for completion of the imaging, during which the patient is required to lie
      still. Patients who are unable to lie still require sedation or general anesthesia (GA).
      Almost all pediatric patients are uncooperative, making GA, the standard of care for
      pediatric MRI.

      Several general anesthetic techniques including airway management by endotracheal tube &
      various supraglottic devices (LMA) have been described. Choice of technique by
      anesthesiologist is influenced by the patient's age, craniofacial and airway anatomy,
      procedure duration, & illness acuity.
