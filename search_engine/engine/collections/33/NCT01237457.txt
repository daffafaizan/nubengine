      Neoplasms

      First Annual Report on protocol IND# 78,256 at RITA Foundation in collaboration with Excel
      diagnostics and Nuclear Oncology center and Baylor College of Medicine

      Protocol number 78,256 calls for recruitment of sixty patients on this protocol. As of August
      15th, 2011, we have enrolled 23 patients on this study ages between 27 and 83 years old with
      average of 61.6. Among patients there were 22 Caucasians (95.7%) and 1 African American (4.3
      %). Eleven of the patients were female (48%) age between 46 and 83 years old with average of
      63.9 years old. Twelve male patients (52%) were treated with ages between 27 and 86 years old
      with average of 59.58 years old. 15 patients (65.2%) had Gastro-entero-pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumor (GEPNET), 7 had carcinoid tumors (30.4%) and 1 had bronchial carcinoid
      (4.3%). All patients had progressive disease with multiple distant metastases that poorly
      responded to prior surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemo-embolization or cold Octreotide
      treatments.

      Full phase I dosimetry evaluation, including dosimetric evaluation of multiple urine and
      blood sample collections, was performed on 6 patients and submitted to FDA. Ten patients
      received one therapy with an average dose of 199mCi/patient (188.52-208.15 mCi). Eight
      patients received two cycles of therapies with an average dose 390.29mCi/patient
      (363.49-413.26 mCi). Two patients received three therapies with an average dose
      592.11mCi/patient (587.52-596.7mCi) and three patients have received four therapies with an
      average dose of 787.62mCi/patient (784.21-794.28 mCi).

      Toxicity

      Patients were evaluated for any evidence of renal, hepatic or hematologic toxicity using NCI
      common toxicities criteria following each cycle of therapy. No significant acute toxicity was
      observed immediately following treatment, and no patients required supportive treatment
      during therapy. Of 23 evaluable patients, 6 patients (26%) had grade 2 or 3 hematological
      toxicity which no supportive therapy was required. Average duration of hematological
      toxicities grade 2 was 8.3 weeks (range 4-16 weeks) and 4.5 weeks (range 1-8 weeks) for
      toxicity grade 3. Grade 2 or 3 liver toxicity was observed in 2 patients (8.6%). In addition,
      2 patients (8.6%) had renal toxicity grade 2. 11 patients (47.8%) had moderate or severe
      nausea/vomiting after their treatment recovered between 1 to 3 days after completion of
      therapy. In one patient (4.3%), skin flushing, sweating and diarrhea developed after the
      therapy which recovered within 48 hours following the therapy.

      Response

      Among 13 patients who have received 2 or more cycles of therapy, 4 (30%) had a partial
      response to treatment and 9 patients (70%) exhibited stable disease. No disease progression
      was noted.

      4 patient deaths have been reported so far. None of these patients were able to complete all
      four cycles of the therapy. All patients died as a result of massive tumor burden. The
      average time interval between the death and the last treatment is 1.41 months (0.76-2.23
      months).
