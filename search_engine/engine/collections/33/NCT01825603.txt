      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of ADH-1 given twice weekly
      for 3 weeks in combination with cisplatin and fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) given on weeks 1 and 2 of the 3 week schedule for 3 cycles in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
      E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor (VEGFR) and basic fibroblast growth factor (B-FGF) during therapy with ADH-1,
      cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 3 cycles of chemotherapy with ADH-1,
      cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas treated with ADH-1 given with
      cisplatin and fixed dose rate gemcitabine for 3 cycles. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease after 3 cycles will continue on maintenance cisplatin and fixed dose rate
      gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ADH-1.

      Patients receive ADH-1 intravenously (IV) over 20-80 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18,
      cisplatin IV and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease may receive maintenance therapy with
      cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
