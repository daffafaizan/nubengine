    
      This is a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and
      active-controlled, four arm, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of Sativex on the
      QT/QTc interval.

      Within 30 days of screening, eligible subjects were randomized to one of four treatment
      groups. Baseline ECG measurements were recorded at specified times and the following day,
      subjects commenced five days treatment with Sativex or placebo. On Day 5, subjects then
      received either moxifloxacin 400 mg (Group 4) or moxifloxacin placebo (Groups 1, 2 and 3).
      Triplicate ECG measurements and pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 5. On days 1-5,
      Safety ECG measurements were also collected at pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose. Subjects
      returned to the study centre for an outpatient safety follow-up visit approximately 10-14
      days after their last dose of study medication.
