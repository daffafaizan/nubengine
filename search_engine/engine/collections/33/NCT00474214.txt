      been hospitalized for at least 5-7 days to monitor for serious complications, including heart
      failure, arrhythmias, re-infarction and death. With the advent of primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) as the treatment of choice for STEMI, fewer patients are
      completing their infarcts and the incidence of complications is decreasing. The Zwolle
      Primary PCI Index is one of several externally validated risk scores that can be used to
      identify low-risk primary PCI patients who can safely be discharged at 48-72 hours. Recent
      reviews have found that a majority of primary PCI patients with risk scores that deem them
      "low-risk" are kept in hospital longer than predicted by these scores.

      SAFE-DEPART is a trial where low-risk primary and rescue PCI patients will be randomized
      either to an intervention arm (early hospital discharge, early outpatient follow-up with a
      nurse practitioner) or to standard of care (no recommended discharge date, no outpatient
      follow-up with a nurse practitioner). At 6 weeks time, a blinded research assistant will
      contact patients and collect data on feasibility, safety, quality-of-life, and
      cost-effectiveness outcomes.
