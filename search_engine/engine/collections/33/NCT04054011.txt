      treatment options include liposuction and cryolipolysis (CoolSculpting, Allergan, Irvine,
      CA). Deoxycholic acid (Kybella, Allergan, Irvine, CA) is an FDA-approved injectable for the
      treatment of excess submental fat. At this time, it is not known if deoxycholic acid may be a
      safe and effective treatment for upper inner thigh fat. The proposed clinical trial will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of deoxycholic acid for reduction of upper inner thigh fat.

      In this single-arm, open-label safety and efficacy study, 15 subjects with excess upper inner
      thigh fat will receive 1-4 treatment sessions of subcutaneously injected deoxycholic acid.
      Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks after last treatment. Adverse events will be
      monitored. Efficacy will be objectively measured by change in thigh circumference; change in
      upper inner thigh skin fold thickness; increase in "thigh gap;" and percent accuracy by three
      blinded physicians in correctly identifying baseline photographs, upon independent review of
      before-and-after clinical photographs of the treatment area. Patient satisfaction related to
      the study treatment will be assessed with a Subject Self-Rating Scale throughout the study,
      and with a Post-Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire.
