      airway collapse during sleep and has been associated with worsened prognosis in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD). Moderate OSAS can be defined by an apnea hypopnea index (AHI)
      between 15 and 30 events/hour.

      Pathophysiologic processes are complex and it seems that oxidative stress play and important
      role. Studies showed that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) influence oxidative
      stress but the results are conflicting.

      Moreover there are uncertainties whether diagnosing and treating OSAS can inï¬‚uence the
      pathophysiological and clinical outcomes in patients with CAD.

      Therefore, we aim to test the effects of 3 months of CPAP on systemic redox balance evaluated
      by plasma GSH/GSSG ratio.

      Patients with moderate OSAS will be randomized for the intervention.

      Patients with AHI <15/h or >30/h will be included in an ancillary study (blood and urinary
      test, MIBG scintigraphy) to characterize the biological profile of coronary patients based on
      their AHI.

      For a alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 80%, the study should include 16 patients in
      each group. Taking in account a possible 20% of dropout the study will need to include 20
      patients by randomized arm to demonstrate an effect.
