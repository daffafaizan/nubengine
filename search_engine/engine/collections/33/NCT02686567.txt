      rectal cancer is still high. the transanal drainage tube (TDT) was thought to be useful for
      deduce the rate. There were several studies, but most of them were not randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) studies. There was only one RCT study with enough samples, but it was designed
      for open anterior resection, and the patients underwent diverting stoma were excluded, so
      there was the selection bias. LAR now is thought to been with the same effect, and it is safe
      and feasible. So a RCT investigation for the use of TDT for prevention of anastomotic leakage
      after LAR for medium & low rectal cancer is needed.

      we want to investigate the anastomotic leakage rate after the using of TDT after LAR
      finished. Then compare with the anastomotic leakage rate of these paitients who did not use
      the TDT.some other factors related to the anastomotic leakage will the checked all the same.
