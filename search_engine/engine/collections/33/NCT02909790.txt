      Laser therapy devices have grown in popularity due to increased scientific understanding of
      their mechanism of action, published research, and patients demand for more non-invasive
      procedures in body contour and fat reduction. LLL are widely used in health clinics, medical
      spas and in aesthetic medicine in the treatment of cellulite and for inflammatory conditions
      such as carpal tunnel syndrome. This study will further evaluate the effectiveness of
      low-level laser treatments without the extraction of adipose tissue using liposuction or in
      combination with other treatment modalities.
