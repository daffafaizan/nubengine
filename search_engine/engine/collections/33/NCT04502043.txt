      exercise therapy (study intervention). Exercise therapy is a semi-standardized intervention
      and will last 12 weeks (3 months). Hip pain, function and quality of life will be assessed
      using a patient-reported questionnaire at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months' follow-up. Hip joint
      contact pressure will be evaluated using motion analysis and modelling at baseline, 3 and 12
      months' follow-up. Hip morphology will be evaluated using imaging at baseline and hip surgery
      rate will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months' follow-up.
