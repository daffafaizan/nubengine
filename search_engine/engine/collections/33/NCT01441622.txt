      months, and requiring in-hospital night polygraphic record control.

      The medical device was developed to determine:

        -  the duration of use of CPAP by the patient,

        -  the persistence of any respiratory abnormalities during treatment.

      These two parameters are used to ensure that treatment is done correctly.

      The use of the AL539 is expected to improve the home-monitoring of ventilation with CPAP.
