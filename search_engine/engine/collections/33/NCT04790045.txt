    
      LN, PB and BM mononuclear cells collected from CLL patients at specified timepoints will be
      tested by:

        -  High-throughput ex vivo drug assay (2D platforms)

        -  Global transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing

        -  Flow cytometry including activation and adhesion/migration markers, e.g. CD69, CD80,
           CD86, HLA-DR, CD38, CD49d, CXCR4;

        -  Phospho-flow assays, to assess the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in BCR
           signaling transduction, e.g. AKT and ERK;

        -  Western blot of nuclear lysates and cytoplasmic protein fractions to validate the
           expression of relevant genes

        -  Targeted deep-sequencing by a previously validated panel

      Minimal residual disease evaluation will be performed by:

        -  6-color flow cytometry

        -  NGS CfDNA will be analysed by targeted NGS.

      The following features will be evaluated by tailored ultrasound:

      Superficial nodal sites (linear probe 7.5 MHz):

        -  Site

        -  Size: long and short diameter (sensitivity <5 mm)

        -  Shape

        -  Border

        -  echo-structure of the cortex; assessment of possible intranodal reticulation

        -  Echogenic description of the hilum: presence, absence and irregular echo-morphology

      Optional parameters:

        -  Doppler evaluation: vascular distribution, vascular resistance

        -  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): 7.5 MHz linear probe (optional);Quantitative
           assessment with dedicated software (wash-in and wash-out curves): optional

      Deep nodal sites (probe 3.5-5 MHz):

        -  Site

        -  Presence/absence of deep lymphoadenopathies

        -  Size (sensitivity <5 mm)

        -  Echo-structure of the cortex (only if superficial, e.g. external iliac LN)

      Optional parameters:

        -  Vascular pattern by: color doppler, two-dimensional power doppler and MicroV (only if
           superficial, e.g. external iliac LN)

        -  Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) (optional): vascular pattern present vs absent,
           intensity

      Spleen:

        -  Size (dedicated software to more precisely define the bipolar diameter) : in cm

        -  Cross sectional area in cm2

      Optional parameters:

        -  Splenic artery resistive index

        -  Portal vein flow (forward or non-forward portal flow): Vmax ("maximum velocity expressed
           in cm" and "mean Velocity expressed in cm")

        -  Splenic stiffness (with Fibroscan or point share wave or share wave 2D) expressed in kPa
