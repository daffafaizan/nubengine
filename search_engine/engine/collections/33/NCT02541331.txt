      paediatric population of asthmatic patients represent a leading clinical burden, particularly
      during the winter. Respiratory tract infections, mainly viral infection are important factors
      that exacerbate asthma course in children. Currently no clinical data demonstrated the
      benefit of oral or sublingual bacterial lysates on asthma clinical course in children apart
      from one trial with OM-85 BV (Bronchovaxom®) suggesting reduced number and duration of
      infection-related wheezing attacks in children with asthma wheezing.

      Therefore it was hypothesized that PMBL (Ismigen®) used in asthmatic children should
      significantly improve asthma course and control. A seasonal approach of active prevention,
      based on full-fledged antibacterial oral vaccination would be useful to show the potential
      benefit of this type of products.

      The Primary objective was to assess the benefit of Ismigen® versus Placebo on the mean ACT
      score after administration of a Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate (PMBL - Ismigen®) as
      add-on to routine asthma treatment.

      Secondary objectives investigated:

        -  the potential reduction (vs Placebo) of number of asthma exacerbations, time to first
           event with Ismigen®;

        -  the potential decrease in number of respiratory tract infections during the observation
           period (3-month treatment and 6-month follow-up) after treatment;

        -  the specific changes occurring in a panel of immunological markers as the result of
           Ismigen® effect (subset of 48 patients).
