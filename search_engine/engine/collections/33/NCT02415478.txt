      for the lung volume reduction by insertion of endobronchial valves. To address this question
      lung function diagnostics, 6-minutes-walk-test, blood withdrawal, CT of the thorax, lung
      perfusion scintigraphy and transthoracic echocardiography have to be performed.

      After confirmation of the suitability for the endoscopic lung volume reduction patients who
      fulfill all other eligibility criteria will be educated about the aim and performance of the
      study by an investigator.

      Following examination will be performed additional due to the study: determination of the
      strength of breathing muscles via sniff nasal pressure (PImax, PE max, P0.1), determination
      of the life quality index via St.-George-questionary and determination of the depression
      score via the Short Form 8 (SF-8) Health Survey.

      After that endobronchial valve will be implanted and a permanent post-operative examination
      will be performed for 24 hours.

      Three, respectively nine month after the implanting follow up exploration will be performed
      on the study patients. Once again the determination of the strength of breathing muscles, the
      life quality index via St.-George-questionary and the depression score via SF-8 will be
      performed to clarify an improvement of the physical capacity and the quality of life
