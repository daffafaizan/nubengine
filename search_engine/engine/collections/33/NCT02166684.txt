      do-it-yourself devices. Subjects are supplied with devices for measuring physical activity,
      food intake, body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose level and blood cholesterol level.
      These devices have to be used with varying frequencies, ranging from continuously to only a
      baseline- and endpoint measure.

      Subjects will have to upload data resulting from these self-measures to an encoded account on
      an online portal.

      At any time during the study, subjects can log-on to this portal, to gain insight in their
      own health parameters.

      Only encoded subject data can be exported from this portal for data analysis.
