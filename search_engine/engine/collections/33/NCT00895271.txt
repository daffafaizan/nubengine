      genetic testing, which may include those that are screening protocols for patients with rare
      primary immunodeficiency or immunodysregulation disorders. Patients deemed of sufficient
      research interest after review of outside medical records, clinical evaluation, and testing
      may be invited to participate in this study. Healthy volunteers will also be invited to
      participate as a source of control samples for research testing. After consent and enrollment
      into this study, skin punch biopsies will be obtained to establish dermal fibroblast cell
      lines for research studies directed at understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of
      these diseases. Cell lines will also be used to investigate the utility of induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPS) for lymphocyte derivation and targeted gene correction. The
      nasal epithelial scrapings will be used for research purposes to grow out primary nasal
      respiratory epithelial cell lines. These cell lines will be used for functional studies by
      testing virus replication in them. These functional studies will allow us to identify new
      primary immunodeficiencies that may present primarily as recurrent or persistent lower
      respiratory tract virus infections.Results with the potential to impact medical care will be
      relayed to the referring physicians and where applicable, patients will be referred to other
      appropriate NIH protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The study will
      enroll up to 200 patients and healthy volunteers over the next 5 years.
