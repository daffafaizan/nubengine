      study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two doses (50 and 100 mg) of
      NBI-98854 administered once daily for up to 2 weeks. The study will also allow for an
      evaluation of the efficacy of NBI-98854 50 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks and the safety and
      tolerability of NBI 98854 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

      The double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period the study has three arms:

        -  NBI-98854 50 mg once daily for 6 weeks

        -  NBI-98854 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by 50 mg once daily for the remaining 4
           weeks

        -  placebo

      At the end of the 6-week placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period, subjects will
      continue in the study for an additional 6-week open-label period where all subjects who have
      completed the double-blind treatment period will receive NBI-98854 50 mg once daily. Two and
      four weeks after the last dose of study drug, follow-up assessments will be performed.
