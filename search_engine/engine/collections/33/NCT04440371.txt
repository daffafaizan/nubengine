    
      Patients to be included in this randomized controlled study are adults with generalized
      vitiligo of surface area of at least 10% who are being followed in the outpatient dermatology
      clinics of King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) and are planned to start on phototherapy
      Narrow Band Ultraviolet light B (NB-UVB), regardless if they have previous treatment for
      their disease, one month wash off period will be given for patients who are already on
      phototherapy or other treatments for vitiligo. In our going study, adult patients will be
      enrolled into 2 groups ( around 20 patients per each) in which NBUVB will be given 2-3
      sessions per week in combination with one of the following randomly; one group will start on
      Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily, a second group will start on calcipotriol &
      betamethasone containing cream once daily, photos will be taken and the exact sites involved
      will be detected, efficacy of treatment will be assessed according to repigmentation
      percentages of vitiligo areas from baseline at 3 and 6 months. The improvement at 6 months
      compared to baseline will be classified into 5 groups according to the percentage of
      repigmentation as follow; excellent (76%-100%); moderate (51%-75%); mild (26%-50%); minimal
      (1%-25%); or no response.
