      intrathecally.edexmedetomidine and fentanyl with a low dose of bupivacaine and assess the
      adequacy of the block, side effect profile and postoperative analgesia. The two drugs have
      been studied separately but the comparative data is scarcely available both at national and
      international level. A particular agent is a dexmedetomidine that has been introduced in the
      investiagator's setup for the first time so this research will be of great importance in
      adding its multiple uses other than being used as ICU and procedural sedation agent.
