      tissues (surrogate tissues) that allow for the assessment of the molecular and biochemical
      effects of (targeted-therapies) drug action. The information obtained from surrogate tissues
      might help us validate previous preclinical studies with those agents and also dose them in a
      more rational way. Oral keratinocytes, which are accessible by non-invasive means, might be
      useful to assess drug action. The proposed study seeks to investigate the genetic, molecular,
      and biochemical effects of novel agents in oral buccal mucosal cells. Patients already
      enrolled in Phase I and II clinical trials for neoplastic diseases at the Clinical Center
      will undergo oral cytobrushing before and during therapy to determine the molecular and
      biochemical effects of novel agents in the oral mucosa cells. Similar studies will be
      performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In order to validate to compare and compare
      the oral cytobrush methodology, some of these subjects will undergo oral punch biopsy
      studies. Some of these subjects will also undergo tumor biopsy, if accessible or available.
