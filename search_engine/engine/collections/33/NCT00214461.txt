      countries. Hospital outbreaks of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are
      associated with substantial patient morbidity and mortality. Conventional therapy with
      antibiotics often results in secondary infection with resistant organisms or clinical relapse
      after discontinuation of the antimicrobial course. New strategies are needed to limit the
      impact of this opportunistic pathogen. Considerable evidence exists that immunity against C.
      difficile toxins may be effective in controlling CDAD. 48 subjects will be enrolled to
      receive one of three dose levels of modified C difficile vaccine or placebo administered on a
      3-dose schedule. The study consists of a 30-day screening period, a 70-day treatment period,
      one follow-up phone interview 2 months after the last vaccination, and one follow-up clinic
      visit 6 months after the last vaccination.
