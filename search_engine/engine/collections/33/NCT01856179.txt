      population, overfishing of the seas and generally low amounts of n-3 PUFA in major oil crops,
      there is a demand for new sources of n-3 PUFA.

      One approach involves searching for potential vegetable sources of n-3 PUFA; especially those
      rich in ALA and SDA. The conversion of ALA to SDA in humans depends on the rate-limiting
      âˆ†6-desaturation. Plant-derived SDA is therefore a promising precursor regarding endogenous
      synthesis of n-3 LC-PUFA in humans. The enrichment of n-3 LC-PUFA in human lipids during the
      supplementation of ALA- and SDA-rich Echium oil will be compared with SDA-rich soybean oil.

      Eighty volunteers will be recruited and allocated into four study groups depending on age and
      BMI. Three groups (each n=20) will receive daily ca. 20 g Echium oil ( group 1 and 2: mean
      BMI < 25, with mean age: 25 or 55 years; group 3: mean age 55 and BMI > 25). One group (n=20)
      will receive SDA soybean oil ( dose with comparable amount of SDA; BMI < 25; mean age 25 and
      55). The double-blind, randomized, parallel-designed study will start with a two-weeks run-in
      period, followed by an eight-weeks supplementation period. After the run-in period, one week
      and eight weeks of oil supplementation blood will be drawn and 24-h urine will be sampled.
