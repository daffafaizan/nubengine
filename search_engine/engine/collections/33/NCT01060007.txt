      followed by chemotherapy can maintain morbidity at or below levels reported with concurrent
      5FU (oral capecitabine if 5FU is unavailable), oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy, while
      maintaining response rates comparable to what would be expected with radiotherapy and
      concurrent chemotherapy. If we can establish a T stage downstaging rate that is significantly
      better than 50% and if acute tolerance is acceptable, then we would consider this study as
      having provided sufficient pilot data to support including this approach as an arm in a
      multi-institution phase III trial. The long-term goal is improved overall control of disease
      by delivering better chemotherapy earlier.
