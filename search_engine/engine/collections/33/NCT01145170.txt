    
      General Purpose

      1. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with nimotuzumab in combination
      with radiotherapy in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic of the brainstem
      glioma

      Specific Purposes

        1. To determine the efficacy regarding the event-free survival (EFS) rate by 6 months of
           treatment.

        2. To determine the overall survival time of the patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic
           tumors of the cerebral trunk treated with combined radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.

        3. To determine the antitumoral objective response of the patients treated with combined
           radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.

        4. To determine the duration time of the response in the cases of objective response
           reached (CR or PR) or disease stabilization.

        5. To assess the toxicity of the combination AcM h-R3-nimotuzumab and radiotherapy in the
           patients enrolled in the clinical study.
