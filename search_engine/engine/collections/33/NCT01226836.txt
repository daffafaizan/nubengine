      rehabilitation. International guidelines for COPD and pulmonary rehabilitation suggest
      numerous topics but do not provide specific information relating to the principal topics and
      how these should be delivered (BTS 2001, NICE 2004, ATS/ERS 2006). Recently this research
      team conducted focus groups of patients with COPD and established from their perspective the
      important education topics that should be covered in pulmonary rehabilitation, along with
      information on how these should be delivered (Wilson, O'Neill et al. 2008).

      The Living Well with COPD (LWWCOPD) programme mostly includes these topics (Bourbeau, Julien
      et al. 2003). LWWCOPD, which is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory, has been shown to
      significantly reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life (Bourbeau, Julien et
      al. 2003, Bandura 1986). With modification and reformatting, the LWWCOPD programme could be
      delivered within the structure of pulmonary rehabilitation.

      Although the LWWCOPD programme has been previously validated, it is important that the
      revised version is assessed for feasibility within the context of pulmonary rehabilitation.
      The practicality of delivering the programme and its acceptance by healthcare providers and
      patients should be assessed. Therefore, this study will involve a process evaluation to
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of using the revised LWWCOPD programme (LWWCOPD for
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation) to deliver the education component of pulmonary rehabilitation in
      Northern Ireland.
