    
      This is a single centre exploratory study in individuals suffering from chronic refractory
      pain to identify cellular, molecular and protein biomarkers within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      The investigators aim to identify any form of correlation between biological content of CSF
      and pain/ spinal cord stimulator (SCS) therapy success. '

      CSF will be sampled before and after SCS therapy, the samples will be analysed to explore and
      identify biomarkers that are potentially relevant to the chronic pain conditions

      . All eligible participants who are enrolled in the study will undergo screening assessment.
      Specifically, assessments will include pain scores assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
      quality of life as assessed by the EQ-5D, disability as assessed by the Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), quality of sleep as assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Pain
      sensation as assessed by Pain Map and neuropathic pain as assessed by Douleu Neuropathique 4
      (DN4).

      During trial implant participants will have CSF sample taken using lumbar puncture technique.

      Following collection CSF sample will be analysed to Identify potential biomarkers.

      All participants will return to the clinic 14 (Â± 7) days following the procedure to assess
      the outcome of their SCS trial and complete assessments which include Pain Map, Pain VAS, DN4
      , PSQI , ODI , EQ-5D and Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC).

      Following this participants will be followed up for end of study visit. The second CSF sample
      will be taken at this visit using lumbar puncture technique. At this visit participants will
      further be asked to complete assessments including Pain Map, Pain VAS, DN4 , PSQI , ODI
      ,EQ-5D and PGIC.
