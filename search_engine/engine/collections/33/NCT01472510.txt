      found in eyes with diabetic eye disease and which causes leakage from blood vessels. Several
      studies have suggested that eyes with DME may have very high levels of VEGF; therefore,
      Ranibizumab may be helpful in blocking VEGF and decreasing DME.

      Ranibizumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Retinal Vein Occlusion at the
      dose amount of 0.5 mg. Ranibizumab has not been approved for use in subjects with DME.
