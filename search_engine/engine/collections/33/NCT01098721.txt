    
      A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Following screening, eligible patients will be
      randomized on Day 0 into one of two treatment groups in a 1:2 ratio:

      Group 1: placebo (vehicle) cream, twice daily (BID). Group 2: 1.0% WBI-1001 cream, BID.
      Patients will be randomized to treat all treatable lesion areas except for the face, scalp,
      groin and genital areas, and will be instructed to apply the cream twice daily for 84 days,
      at the same time each day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

      During the study patients will visit the study centre for assessment of efficacy, safety and
      tolerability at 0, 14, 28, 56 and 84 days after initiation, and patients will be phoned at
      Day 112 for a follow-up safety assessment.

      Patients that withdraw from the study before Day 56 due to reasons other than adverse events
      will be replaced as necessary to ensure that there are at least 16 patients from the placebo
      and 32 from the active cream treated groups remaining in the study at Day 56.
