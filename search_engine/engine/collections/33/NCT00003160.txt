      infusion in patients with paclitaxel/platinum refractory stage III and IV ovarian cancer. II.
      Evaluate the safety of paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Assess the overall
      survival in these patients. IV. Assess quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study. Patients are administered
      paclitaxel as a one hour IV infusion every 7 days. Each cycle consists of four weeks.
      Treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks and there is no limit to the number of
      interruptions a patient may experience. Patients receive paclitaxel weekly until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment is assessed every 3 cycles for one year and
      then every 6 months thereafter during study. Quality of life is assessed every cycle for the
      first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter. Patients are followed every 3 months for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 100 patients accrued into this study.
