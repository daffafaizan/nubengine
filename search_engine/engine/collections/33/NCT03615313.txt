    
      This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the safety and
      efficacy of the PD-1 antibody expressing mesoCAR-T for patients with mesothelin positive,
      advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MesoCAR-T can specifically and
      effectively kill the mesothelin positive cancer cells, PD-1 antibody are secreted from the
      CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the
      advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method
      for advanced solid tumors.

      The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, and then activated and engineered
      to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting mesothelin and PD-1 antibody. Cells
      are proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion therapy. A
      total of 50 patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is
      expected to be approximately 24 months.
