      (RA), and among these patients, the prevalence of hypo-vitaminosis D is high. Low levels of
      vitamin D have been associated with elevated cardiovascular risk in healthy subjects. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events in patients having
      low 25OHD-total levels at baseline compared to patients with sufficient levels, in an
      aggressively treated closed cohort of early-diagnosed RA patients.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with any cardiovascular event,
      evaluated using systematic journal audits. Logistic regression models will be applied to test
      the hypothesis that there are more cardiovascular events in patients enrolled with a low
      level of vitamin D (< 50 nmol/l). Secondarily, Cox regression models, based on survival
      analysis, will be applied, to determine the extent to which independent variables (including
      different levels of vitamin D at baseline) predict not only whether a cardiovascular event
      occur, but also when it will occur.
