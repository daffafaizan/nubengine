      osteoarthritis.

      Design: This is a multicentre, randomised, single blinded, parallel-group design clinical
      trial. 138 eligible participants will be randomly allocated into 2 groups (moxibustion group
      or smoke-free moxibustion group) with a 1:1 allocation ratio, and receive 12 sessions of
      moxibustion treatment over a period of 4 weeks, three sessions per week. Each session will
      last 30 minutes. The whole study period is 13 weeks, with a 1 week run in period, 4 week
      treatment phase, and 8 week follow-up phase.The participants will receive moxibustion
      treatment at three acupoints (EX-LE04,ST35,ST36). In moxa-free smoke moxibustion group,
      investigators place a purification device(Shenzhen Conyson Electronic Technology Co, Ltd,C200
      moxa smoke purification device,Shenzhen,China) at the top of the moxibustion to remove the
      moxa smoke. The primary measurement outcomes are the mean change in the global scale value of
      the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index(WOMAC) pain and function
      scores from baseline to 4 weeks. The secondary outcomes are the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
      and the patient global assessment. Investigators will assess participants at the second visit
      (before starting moxibustion treatment) and at the 2, 4, 8, and 12 week respectively after
      the baseline.
