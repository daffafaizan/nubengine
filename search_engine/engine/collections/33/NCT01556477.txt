    
      This is an prospective open multi-center randomized phase II study of standard dose
      azacytidine with or without the addition of lenalidomide in high-risk myeloid disease
      (high-risk MDS and AML) with a karyotype including del(5q). Seventy-two patients, eligible
      for treatment with azacytidine (Intermedium/INT-2 and High-risk MDS and AML with 20-30 %
      marrow blasts according to label) will be included.

      Azacytidine will be given in a modified standard dose, azacytidine 5+2 (75 mg/m2/ d
      subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by a 2-day weekend break, followed by azacytidine 75
      mg/m2/ d for 2 days every 28 days, no individual dose exceeding 200 mg) for 6 cycles. Cycle
      interval may be prolonged if toxicity according to predefined criteria occurs. Patients will
      be randomized to azacytidine (Arm A) or azacytidine + lenalidomide (Arm B). The initial dose
      of lenalidomide is 10 mg 21/28 days, starting day 1 in each azacytidine cycle and leaving the
      last week before start of next azacytidine cycle free. The dose should be increased to 20 mg
      day 1 in cycle 4 if no toxicity according to predefined criteria occurs. The total study
      period is 24 weeks + additional weeks caused by prolonged cycle interval. Patients, who
      following a response may be eligible for allo-SCT may exit the study after cycle 3, 4 or 5
      and then be subject to end-of-study assessment. Patients who at start of treatment, or any
      time during study have a neutrophil count <0,5 x 109/l will be treated with
      Granulocyte-ColonyStimulatingFactor (G-CSF).
