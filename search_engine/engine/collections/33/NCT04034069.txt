      (M1) appears to enhance the brain response to rehabilitative intervention in patients with
      stroke. However, its clinical utility is highly affected by the response variability. New
      evidence has reported that preceding iTBS with a priming session of continuous theta burst
      stimulation (cTBS), may stabilize and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the
      stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      iTBS primed with cTBS, on top of a standard robot-assisted training (RAT) on improving the
      upper limb motor functions of patients with chronic stroke and to explore potential
      sensorimotor neuroplasticity with electroencephalography (EEG). A three-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) will be performed with an estimated total of 36 patients with subacute
      or chronic stroke. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10-session
      intervention of different TBS protocols (i.e., cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham
      iTBS), delivered for 3-5 sessions per week, lasting for 2-3 weeks. All participants will
      receive a 60-minute standard RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcome will be
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores (FMA-UE). Secondary outcomes will be Action
      Research Arm Test (ARAT), kinematic outcomes generated during RAT as well as and EEG.
