      measures and will fail to find some of the infected MSM, researchers propose a preventive
      measures before they meet together. For MSM who are seeking potential sexual partners through
      Internet, researchers will encourage them to query health status before they decide to meet
      each other in order to promote their healthy self-responsibility consciousnes including
      avoiding HIV and other STDs infection, which will form a real ,digital MSM cohort.
      Researchers designed a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the effect of an intervention paradigm that provides HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and
      hepatitis C status partner notification based on the existing HIV and STDs control methods
      through an mHealth application (app), to reduce HIV and STDs incidences among MSM in China.
      More than 6000 MSM of 16 districts in Beijing, China will be grouped into four arms, each arm
      will cover four indepednent districts of Beijing randomly. The four arms will be randomized
      to sequentially initiate partner notification intervention through the app at 6-month
      intervals. All participants will be provided informed consent in the app after a full
      explanation of the protocol design. Researchers expect that the HIV incidence will be
      significantly lower and the secondary outcomes will also be better after partner notification
      intervention. The feasible and affordable public health management paradigm will have
      implications for HIV and STDs prevention and control among MSM and other key populations.
