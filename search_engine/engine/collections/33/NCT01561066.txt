      emotionally devastating experience for both patients and surgeons. An enterocutaneous
      fistulas (ECF) is an abnormal communication between the bowel lumen and skin, often
      associated with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, malnutrition, and sepsis. It is reported
      that spontaneous fistula closure rates vary from 15% to 71% after conservative treatment with
      wound care, control of infection, and nutritional support. Sufficient time should be allotted
      for the ECF to heal with conservative treatment, which also results in long-term discomfort.

      Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract may promote healing in low-output ECF.
      Containing high concentrations of human fibrinogen and thrombin, FG have been used
      extensively in many surgical fields as a biological adhesive system for tissue adhesion or
      hemostasis. Different types of FG are now employed: commercially produced and homemade
      autologous adhesives. Currently available FDA-approved commercial products such as Tisseel,
      Artiss (Baxter, Westlake Village, CA, USA), and Evicel (Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ,
      USA) are widely used in clinical applications. Risks of infection transmission, allergic
      reactions, and also the high cost, however, still make autologous FG attractive.
      Additionally, in comparison with other adhesives, autologous compounds have several
      advantages in terms of biocompatibility and biodegradation.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich
      fibrin glue (PRFG) in the treatment of low-output digestive fistulas and compare them with
      conservative management without the use of adjuvant application of FG into the fistulous
      tract.
