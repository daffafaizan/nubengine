      patients with diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphoma or L3 acute lymphocytic leukemia when
      treated with high intensity, brief duration combination chemotherapy: alternating courses of
      ifosfamide/cytarabine/etoposide and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin, each with
      methotrexate/vincristine/dexamethasone. II. Determine the toxicity of these regimens in HIV
      negative patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by participating institution and disease type (diffuse small
      noncleaved cell lymphoma vs L3 ALL). Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 5-10 minutes
      on days 1 through 5 and oral prednisone on days 1 through 7, followed by alternating courses
      of: 2) ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 8 through 12, methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day
      8; leucovorin calcium IV over 36 hours after initiation of methotrexate, then IV (or orally
      as tolerated, after the first 24 hours) every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is
      below 5 x 10 to the minus eighth M; vincristine IV on day 8; cytarabine IV over 48 hours and
      etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 11 and 12; and oral dexamethasone on days 8 through 12,
      plus triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) with methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone on
      days 8 and 12, and 3) cyclophosphamide IV over 5-10 minutes on days 29 through 33;
      methotrexate IV over 24 hours and vincristine IV on day 29; leucovorin calcium IV over 36
      hours after initiation of methotrexate, then IV (or orally as tolerated, after the first 24
      hours) every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 to the minus eighth
      M; doxorubicin IV on days 32 and 33; and oral dexamethasone on days 29 through 33, plus TIT
      on day 29, with doses as above. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis continue TIT once
      weekly until the CSF clears, then weekly for 4 more weeks. TIT must be completed prior to
      initiation of radiotherapy. All patients must complete at least the first 3 courses of
      chemotherapy. Courses 2 and 3 each repeat 3 times in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. On days 134-139, patients who have had prior bone marrow involvement
      receive cranial radiation therapy. Patients who achieve less than a complete response and who
      have an HLA-matched sibling should undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant on protocol
      CLB-9113. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 18 months, every 6
      months for 2 years, and thereafter for survival.
