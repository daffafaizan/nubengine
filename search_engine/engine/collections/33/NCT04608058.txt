      selected based on a convenient sampling method. Next, the participants were randomly
      allocated into two parallel groups: intervention (training with digital storytelling method,
      n=30) or control (training with conventional) n=30) groups. Before and three months after the
      intervention the patients' levels of self-management behaviors according to Self-Management
      of TID amongst adolescents (SMOD-A); in addition to the Glycated Hemoglobin test (HbA1c) were
