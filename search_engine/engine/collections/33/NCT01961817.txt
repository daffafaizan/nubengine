      now, there have bee no clinical investigations comparing the intubation method via the
      retromolar route (RM), with the conventional intubation route (CM).

      For the present clinical investigation, 100 patients undergoing elective surgery will be
      investigated in the General Hospital of Vienna when for the anaesthesia intubation is
      required. In both intubation methods (RM and CM) the anaesthesiologist will visually
      determine the Cormack & Lehane score in a randomly assigned sequence with and without a
      BURP-manoeuvre (= backwards, upwards and rightwards pressure). Thereafter intubation is
      performed in all patients by the CM method and if intubation fails the RM technique will be
      used. Of course, as per usual, every intubation trial is interrupted by a 20 second
      100%-oxygen-ventilation period to reach a pulse oximetry oxygen saturation of at least 97%
      SpO2. Thereafter, if intubation fails again every other intubation technique will be applied,
      as necessary and called for.
