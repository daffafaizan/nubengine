      chance of participation, randomization will be guided by table of random numbers All women
      recruited in the study will be given 100 mg mebendazole tablets twice daily for 3 days for
      de-worming and 500 micro gram folic acid daily till the end of the study The required dose
      will be individually adapted according to the total iron deficit which is dependent on the
      patient's body weight and hemoglobin status Total iron dose (mg) = weight (kg) X hemoglobin
      deficit {target hemoglobin (g/l)- Actual hemoglobin (g/l)} X 0.24 + 500 mg The total iron
      dose needed will be calculated by formula rounded to nearest multiple of 100 Group I includes
      pregnant women taking 60 mg elemental iron twice per day (120 mg/day) using iron tablets
