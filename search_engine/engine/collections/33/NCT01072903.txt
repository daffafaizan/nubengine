      sub-clinical mucosal inflammation occurs in patients with D-IBS by identifying alterations in
      mucosal markers for inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related mediators).
      The second aim is to investigate whether the identifiable alterations in inflammatory markers
      are associated with specific abnormalities in intestinal motor and sensory functions that are
      relevant to the pathophysiology of IBS.
