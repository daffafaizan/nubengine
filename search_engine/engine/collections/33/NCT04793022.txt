      with Propofol (TIVA-P sedation) with a regional nerve block will decrease the time to meet
      discharge criteria. This will be done with patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic
      procedures at the Roanoke Ambulatory Surgical Center. Currently, inhaled general anesthesia
      (GA) with a regional nerve block is utilized for these outpatient arthroscopic procedures.
      This involves the patient receiving Propofol through an IV to put a patient to sleep,
      followed by intubation (breathing tube in throat) and the administration of inhaled
      anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. Another approach for anesthesia in these
      procedures is TIVA-P sedation. In this protocol the patient receives the same initial amount
      of Propofol through the IV as they would if they were getting general anesthesia. Once they
      are asleep, it is maintained with a continuous intravenous administration of Propofol. With
      this approach, the patient is not intubated and exposed to the same anesthetic agents as
      general anesthesia. As a result, the patient may not experience the potential side effects
      associated with general anesthesia. We believe that this will lead to a faster time to meet
      discharge criteria and also fewer of anesthetic side effects.
