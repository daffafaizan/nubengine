      a 15 mg MK-5442 treatment arm. Amendment 1 of the protocol eliminated the 2nd year of the
      study as well the 15-mg arm. Enrollment into the 15-mg MK-5442 arm was stopped as a result of
      the amendment and all participants who had been randomly assigned to the MK-5442 15-mg
      treatment arm were discontinued from the study.
