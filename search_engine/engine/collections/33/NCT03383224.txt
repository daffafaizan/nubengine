      genotype-guided therapy into post-MI smoking cessation therapy and/or smoking cessation
      therapy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) using the CHRNA5 rs16969968 variant as
      the pilot case. The investigators propose to genotype ½ of PRISM-GENOMICs patients who are
      active smokers within 48 hours of admission and to guide their smoking cessation therapy
      based on CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotype (A allele carriers will be given pharmacologic therapy
      and GG homozygotes will be given counseling). The investigators will use the other ½ as
      controls. The participants will be followed and the investigators will test whether the
      genotype-guided group has better rates of smoking cessation compared to the control group.
      This pilot study will lay the foundation for personalized, genotype-guided, post-MI therapy
      and/or therapy in patients with CAD.
