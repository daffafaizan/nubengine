    
      Objective: To contrast the efficacy of three exercise programs, segmental stabilization and
      strengthening of abdominal and trunk muscle and lumbar stretching on pain, functional
      impairment, and activation of the transversus abdominis muscle (TrA), in individuals with
      chronic low back pain.

      Design: Forty-five patients were randomized into three groups namely: Segmental stabilization
      group (ES)(transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus) (n=15, mean age 42,02 ± 8,15),
      superficial strengthening group (FS)(rectus abdominis, oblique abdominal muscles and erector
      spinae muscles) (n=15, mean age 41,71±6,41) and stretching group (AL) (erector spinae,
      posterior connective tissues and ischiotibials muscles) (n=15 mean age 41,53 ± 4,41). Groups
      were contrasted regarding pain (visual analogical scale and McGill pain questionnaire),
      functional disability (Oswestry disability questionnaire) and TrA muscle activation capacity
      (Pressure Biofeedback Unit = PBU). The program lasted 6 weeks, and sessions happened twice a
      week, with duration of 30 minutes each. Analysis of variance was used for inter and
      intragroup comparisons. Significance level was established at 5%.

      Patients attended two weekly sessions during six weeks and were evaluated for pain (visual
      analogue scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire), functional disability (Oswestry disability
      index), and ability to contract the TrA (Pressure biofeedback unit) before and after the
      treatment. The treatment program consisted of 30 minutes sessions. The Anova one-way and
      Tukey´s Post Hoc were used to compare groups. The significance level adopted was 5%.
