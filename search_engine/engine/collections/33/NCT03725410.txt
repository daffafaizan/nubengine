    
      Multicenter, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study of multi-polar radio-frequency
      (RF) and pulsed electro-magnetic field (PEMF) technologies for the treatment of symptoms
      associated with vulvovaginal atrophy. The study will enroll up to 106 subjects requesting
      treatment of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication during
      sexual activity, decreased elasticity, irritation, discomfort during intercourse and
      discomfort of the vaginal and vulvar tissues in general) in order to have 88 subjects
      complete the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either multi-polar RF and
      PEMF technologies or sham treatment and will receive a total of three internal and external
      treatments with the Venus Fiore™ (MP)2 device at four-week intervals. Study treatment will be
      administered as per the parameter recommendations as set out in the Venus Fiore™ (MP)2 user
      manual. Subjects will be followed up at three and six months after their initial treatment.
      Analysis will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment. Three- and
      six-month outcomes from the active arm will be compared to data from the sham arm.
