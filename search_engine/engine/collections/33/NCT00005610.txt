      terms of progression free survival at 2 months and median survival rate in patients with
      metastatic melanoma to the lung. II. Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this treatment
      regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the quality of life in terms of physical and
      personal concerns of these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive aerosolized sargramostim (GM-CSF) over 10-15 minutes twice daily
      for 7 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to
      course 5. Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 1.5 years.
