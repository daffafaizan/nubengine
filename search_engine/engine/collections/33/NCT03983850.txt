    
      Background:

        -  Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) reduces rates of severe acute and chronic
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
           (HCT) and safely facilitates human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical HCT

        -  When clinically translated, the dose (50 mg/kg) and timing (days +3 and +4) of PTCy used
           were partly extrapolated from murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched skin
           allografting models and were partly empirical

        -  In both MHC-haploidentical and MHC-disparate murine HCT models, a dose of 25 mg/kg/day
           was superior to 50 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4 in terms of GVHD severity and mortality

        -  In the MHC-haploidentical HCT model, a dose of 25 mg/kg on day +4 was equivalent to 25
           mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4

        -  In addition to better GVHD prevention, lower dosing of PTCy is associated with less
           broad reduction of T-cell numbers after PTCy

      Objective:

      -Determine whether a dose of PTCy 25 mg/kg on day +3 and +4 or on day +4 only can maintain
      adequate protection against grade III-IV acute GVHD.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed hematologic malignancy with standard
           indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation including one of the
           following:

             -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of intermediate or adverse risk disease by the 2017
                European LeukemiaNet criteria in first morphologic complete remission

             -  AML of any risk in second or subsequent morphologic complete remission

             -  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or subsequent complete remission

             -  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimal residual disease detected after
                first line therapy and/or adverse genetics

             -  Myelodysplastic syndrome of intermediate or higher score by the Revised
                International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)

             -  Primary myelofibrosis of intermediate-2 or higher risk by the Dynamic International
                Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)

             -  Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia

             -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to or intolerant of greater than or equal to
                3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with prior history of accelerated phase or blast
                crisis

             -  B-cell lymphoma including Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed within 1 year of
                completion of primary treatment

             -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 17p deletion and/or unmutated IgHV or refractory
                to or intolerant of both BTK and PI3K inhibitors

             -  Mature T or NK neoplasms as defined in the WHO guidelines of sufficient type and
                severity for allogeneic HCT based on the Prognostic Index for T- cell lymphoma
                (PIT) score of low-intermediate risk or higher or on recently published clinical
                practice guidelines

             -  Hematologic malignancy of dendritic cell or histiocytic cell type

             -  Multiple myeloma, stage III, relapsing after therapy with both a proteasome
                inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)

        -  Age 15-65.

        -  At least one potentially suitable HLA-haploidentical donor.

        -  Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 60

        -  Adequate organ function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized, phase I/II study

        -  All patients will receive myeloablative conditioning, HLA-haploidentical bone marrow
           HCT, and GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy, MMF, and sirolimus.

        -  A small pilot of 5 evaluable patients will receive the standard PTCy 50 mg/kg on days
           +3/+4 to obtain a limited amount of comparative pharmacokinetic and T-cell
           immunophenotyping and repertoire data

        -  Then the study will proceed to a small, two-level [1) 25 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4, 2)
           25 mg/kg on day +4 only] phase I dose de-escalation study based on the standard 3+3
           approach

        -  Patients will be evaluated for development of grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) at day +60
           as the dose-limiting toxicity and then phase II will proceed with the shorter duration
           of the days of treatment (+3/+4 or +4) which is associated with 0-1 of 6 patients with
           grade III- IV aGVHD at day +60 and with the least amount of toxicity

        -  Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design, to rule out excess grade III-IV acute
           GVHD with this decreased PTCy exposure, will be used in the phase II portion of the
           study which will enroll an additional 14 patients to see if this lower PTCy exposure is
           associated with a similar rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD as is expected with 50 mg/kg
           on days +3/+4
