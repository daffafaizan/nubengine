      virologic suppression among HIV-infected cocaine (including crack) users by using a two-group
      randomized, prospective trial.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) "Retention Clinic" group and 2)
      Treatment as Usual. The intervention content of these groups is briefly described below:

      Retention Clinic (RC) Group: This group will receive comprehensive and integrated services
      from a Retention Clinic. Services include HIV primary care, substance abuse treatment and
      mental health services, as needed. Participants in this group will also receive hands-on
      assistance with navigating through the clinic and accessing these services from a patient
      navigator.

      Treatment as Usual (TAU) Group: This group will receive no protocol directed intervention.
      They will get the standard retention services from their local clinic.

      All participants will provide informed consent and will complete a baseline audio
      computer-assisted self-interview or ACASI focusing on drug use, mental health, demographics
      and socio-economic factors, HIV care, and drug treatment history as well as blood draws for
      viral load and CD4 count. Follow-up assessments consisting of both ACASI and blood draws in
      all groups will be collected at 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Medical records will be
      reviewed to document use of HIV care, drug treatment and mental health services during the
      study period.
