        1. To determine the factors of cam deformities, including morphological, functional and
           bone quality, that are associated with cartilage degeneration through shape analysis,
           kinematic analysis, MRI imaging and bone densitometry.

        2. To determine whether subchondral bone changes occur before detectable cartilage
           degeneration by examining magnetic resonance images of asymptomatic subjects who have an
           identifiable deformity.

        3. To use 3D motion and finite element analysis to examine differences in mechanical
           stimuli in the subchondral bone and cartilage that are associated with FAI, thus
           expanding our understanding of the pathomechanisms of associated degeneration.

      Three subject cohorts will be recruited: subjects with bilateral cam deformity and unilateral
      symptoms (Group I, 'active cartilage damage stage'), asymptomatic subjects with cam deformity
      (Group II, 'early stage') and asymptomatic control subjects with no deformity (Group III).
