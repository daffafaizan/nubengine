      pressure. Each subject will receive two injections in randomized order during right heart
      catheterization: one administration of SonoVue and one administration of placebo, either
      SonoVue followed by Placebo or Placebo followed by SonoVue. The purpose is to provide direct
      evidence on the presence or absence of pulmonary hemodynamic effect following IV
      administration of SonoVue versus any effects following IV administration of the same volume
      of placebo.
