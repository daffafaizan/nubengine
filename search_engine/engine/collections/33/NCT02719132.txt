    
      The study will comprise the following phases: Screening, Treatment Period 1 and Treatment
      Period 2.

      After screening examinations and assessments, all patients enrolled will be randomly assigned
      in equal proportion (1:1) to either study arm:

      Arm 1:

        -  Patients will take dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin ≤ 1,500 mg (daily
           dose) for 24 weeks during Treatment Period 1

        -  Patients will be on metformin monotherapy with dose titrated up to 2,500 mg/day for
           further 24 weeks during Treatment Period 2

      Arm 2 (the same treatment phases in reverse order):

        -  Patients will be on metformin monotherapy with dose titrated up to 2,500 mg/day for 24
           weeks during Treatment Period 1

        -  Patients will take dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin ≤ 1,500 mg (daily
           dose) for further 24 weeks during Treatment Period 2 Following the randomisation
           procedure, patients will receive investigational products at each visit as scheduled by
           Treatment Period 1. After the Randomisation Visit (Visit 2), the patient should attend
           the study centre for Visits 3, 4, and 5 (Day 28, Day 86, and Day 168, respectively) for
           efficacy and safety assessments. At Visit 5 (Day 168), the patient will receive
           investigational products as required by Treatment Period 2. Further Visits 6, 7 and 8
           will be scheduled on Day 196, Day 252, Day 336, respectively.
