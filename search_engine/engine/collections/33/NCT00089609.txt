    
      This is a Phase II study of docetaxel, bevacizumab, prednisone and thalidomide in patients
      with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer who are previously untreated with
      chemotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to determine if the combination of
      docetaxel, thalidomide and bevacizumab is able to be associated with a sufficiently high
      proportion of patients with a PSA response to be worthy of further investigation in
      metastatic prostate cancer. We will also be looking at multiple secondary endpoints. These
      will include possible pharmacokinetic interactions among the study agents, potential
      correlation between patient genotype and efficacy of treatment. We will also be looking for
      circulating endothelial cells in blood before and after treatment. Additionally we will be
      monitoring the tolerability of the regimen, time to disease progression, and survival
      duration as endpoints as well. We hope to use this trial to build on the promising results
      seen in our thalidomide/docetaxel protocol where there was a significant PSA decline and a
      trend toward survival benefit.
