      observation of gastrointestinal mucosa.In our pilot study we found that the contrast agent
      fluorescein sodium shew differences of leakage into intercellular spaces and crypt lumen
      among different patients of FD.

      This study is aimed to determine if there is microscopic changes detectable in the gastric
      mucosal epithelium through confocal endomicroscopy of FD patients, and to evaluate the
      relationship among minimal changes(transmission electron microscopy and Confocal laser
      endomicrosopy ), FD symptoms(symptom index form) , neuropeptides and immune
      responses(immunohistochemistry).
