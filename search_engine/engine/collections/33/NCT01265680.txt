      prognosis as regarding heart surgery population. Moreover blood has become a scarce resource,
      thus often delaying intervention due to lack of availability.

      Previous studies at our Hospital have shown that high dose Human Recombinant Erythropoietin
      (HRE)effectively spares transfusions even when administered two days before surgery. The
      previous protocol was fragmented into 5 administration which proved to be unpractical even if
      effective.

      After multidisciplinal discussion with nephrologists and transfusionists a new protocol was
      established: 80.000 UI in a single dose at time of arrival at the hospital. There are no
      exclusion criteria planned.

      Our primary end point is the amount of transfused blood. Our secondary end point is the
      Hemoglobin level in the patient on postoperative day four.

      Ancillary analysis regarding safety at 45 days and cost effectiveness are planned as well.
