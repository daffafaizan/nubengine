      had completed by Dr. Bik Liang Lau and Dr. Albert Sii Hieng Wong in year 2017 with good
      accuracy. The phantom study result is going to be submitted for publication by early 2019.

      With the good accuracy of AW frame in the phantom study, the frame has been approved by the
      Medical Research & ethic committee (MREC) for human use in a research setting.

      In the study, patient with intracranial lesion which required biopsy, whom fulfilled the
      criteria will be recruited. All these patient will underwent standard biopsy procedure either
      under local or general anaesthesia with AW frame mounted.

      A localisation CT scanning will be perform with localiser fixed onto the head frame. Target
      of the intracranial lesion is selected. The coordinates of the localizing points and the
      selected target inserted into the AW stereo-calculator to generate the AW frame setting up
      measurements.

      Burr hole will be performed and biopsy taken by using NasholdÂ® biopsy needle. An immediate
      post-biopsy CT imaging will be performed to confirm the site of the biopsy. Patient will be
      monitored in the neurosurgery ward for any complications.

      Histopathologic analysis of the biopsies will be done using usual procedure.
