    
      This study will assess the comparative safety of MP-376 (Aeroquin) and Tobramycin Inhalation
      solution (TIS) [TOBI® Novartis Pharmaceuticals] over three consecutive cycles of 28-days
      treatment followed by 28-days off in stable CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa lung
      infection. Efficacy data for MP-376 and TIS at the end of the first 28-day treatment period
      will also be compared, as well as explored over multiple treatment cycles.

      Study patients participating in Mpex 209 will be given the option to participate in a
      six-month open label extension phase of the Mpex 209 protocol. The open label extension will
      allow enrolled patients to receive three additional courses of MP-376 (levofloxacin
      inhalation solution, Aeroquin™).
