      charts and electronic charts and data tracking system. This data will be obtained from OTTR
      /EPIC as well as paper charts if needed. Those charts will be accessed to obtain demographic
      data (age, gender, income, employment status, marital/relationship status, insurance payer);
      transplant specific data (primary diagnosis, transplant year, tacrolimus blood levels,
      rejection episodes (yes/ no and number of), graft loss (yes/no), re-transplantation (yes/no);
      related medical data (creatinine levels, dialysis dependence (yes/no), ICD diagnoses; and
      psychosocial variables (social worker risk assessment before transplant, presence of social
      and family support, conviction history (yes/no), psychiatric history (diagnoses yes/no).

      Variables will be obtained from the psychosocial pretransplant evaluation write-up (which in
      different years was attached to OTTR or EPIC datasets, or may be present in paper form, and
      from electronic datasets (OTTR / EPIC).

      The data extraction as well as dataset building and data entry will be performed in office
      spaces at ISMMS. No patient contact is anticipated for this study. The predictive model will
      include evaluations of single variables as well as an evaluation of the predictive ability of
      a pre-defined scoring system (the SIPAT) which will be applied to existing data.
