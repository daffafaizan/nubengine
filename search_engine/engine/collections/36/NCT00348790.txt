      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of vatalanib, in terms of radiographic improvement and clinical
           improvement, in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  Describe the response rate and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of vatalanib in these patients.

        -  Correlate the response rates with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor,
           epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor, and HER2.

        -  Develop exploratory data concerning surrogate markers of angiogenic activity in vivo
           using magnetic resonance perfusion.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
