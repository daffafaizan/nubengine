    
      This is a four-year study involving longitudinal data collection for 800 men and women
      recruited from four clinics in Brooklyn, NY. Participants were eligible for enrollment at any
      of the study sites if diagnosed as having C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae genital infection or
      if they have an STD syndrome likely to be related to either of these pathogens (i.e., males
      with NGU). Consenting patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard-of-care
      patient referral for partner notification (N = 350), a social-cognitive intervention geared
      toward increasing patient referral (N = 350), or the social-cognitive intervention with an
      option of patient-delivered medication (N = 100). Evaluation activities include an
      interviewer administered measure provided at baseline, one month, and six months, a screen
      for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis using urine-based ligase chain reaction screening (Abbott
      LCx) at baseline and six months, and medical chart abstraction at one and six months.
