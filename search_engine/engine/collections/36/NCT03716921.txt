      controlled trial comparing two treatment durations, 3 versus 6 weeks, in septic arthritis of
      native joints. Patients who fulfill inclusion criteria will be randomized between day0 and
      day5. Day 0 is the time when effective intravenous antibiotic treatment is started. Effective
      treatment is defined by active antibiotics on the identified bacteria according to the
      susceptibility. The randomisation (1:1 ratio) will be stratified on early planned drainage.
      Follow-up will include 6 visits and will consist in clinical, biological, radiological,
      health quality of life (EQ-5D-3L score) and adverse events record. After collection,
      validation of data and population description, analysis will be conducted on the per-protocol
      population (patients receiving the planned duration of antibiotic +/-3days). This study will
      not be carried out blind for feasibility reasons. According to statistical considerations (by
      accounting for 5% of subjects lost to follow-up), the required sample size will be of 350
      patients overall.
