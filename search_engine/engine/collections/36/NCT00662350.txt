      (BPH) via a high temperature, liquid filled, balloon thermotherapy. The catheter is composed
      of a silicone positioning balloon which anchors the catheter against the bladder neck. The
      multi-layer silicone treatment balloon may be adjusted to fit short (20-35mm) and long
      (40-55mm) prostates and is inflated (to approximately 650-700 mmHg / 20-22mm diameter) to
      ensure tight tissue contact and reduced blood perfusion. The handle contains the heating
      element and the liquid circulation mechanisms
