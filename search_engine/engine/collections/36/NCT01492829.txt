      tablets with brief video-based educational messages and (2) 6 weekly peer-group sessions. The
      tablet will be programmed to analyze the data and to indicate incorrect HIV knowledge
      responses so the community health worker can immediately provide correct responses. This
      intervention involves 6 weekly women's health meetings that will cover a variety of issues
      pertinent to women's sexual health: HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, interpersonal
      relationships, communication and decision making, mental health and coping, creating social
      change.
