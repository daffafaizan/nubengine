      echocardiography and blood tests at baseline and at 3 months. The visit will be scheduled at
      baseline and at the 3rd month. The blood tests include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      high-sensitivity interleukin-1 beta, high-sensitivity interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, Dickkopf-related protein 3, galectin-3, ST2, fibroblast growth factor 23, xanthine
      oxidase activity, and thioredoxin.
