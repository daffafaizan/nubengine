      high as 40%if there is hemodynamic instability in patients .

      Because of the length of GI tract, the multitude of pathologic processes that can result in
      GI bleeding, imaging plays a primary role in the diagnosis .

      Multislice CT angiography (MSCTA) provides a relatively non-invasive and effective way of
      localising the source of bleeding, especially in patients with continuous bleeding .

      MSCTA is being increasingly used because it is a widely available, non-invasive and fast
      diagnostic technique that allows for the visualization of the entire intestinal tract and its
      lesions, the identification of the vascularity and possible vascular abnormalities. In
      addition, this technique does not require preparation in patients with acute bleeding.
