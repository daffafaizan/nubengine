      disorders will be recruited at 7 months of age to participate in the longitudinal music
      intervention study that will last for about 4 months.

      At recruitment, infants with 3 or more ear infections and infants who have already been/ have
      had participated in infant music classes will be excluded.

      Infants will complete a pre-intervention brainstem measures at 7 months of age upon enrolling
      in the study: the frequency-following response measure (FFR). Participants will have to
      complete the measurement to proceed to the intervention phase. At 9 months of age, families
      will start the 12 - session intervention in a controlled laboratory space. In the initial
      session, caregivers will be given a brief orientation to intervention, including introducing
      them to the musical toys they will be using during the sessions with their infants and the
      lab environment. They will also be trained on techniques through which they can synchronize
      the infant's movements to the experimenter's movements, such as clapping hand, tapping feet.

      The remaining sessions will be scheduled in groups of 2-3 infant/parent dyads. In each
      session, a music CD with 15 minutes of selected children's music will be played and a
      musically trained experimenter will facilitate the sessions to engage the infants and parents
      to move to musical beats, using different musical toys, such as infant drums and maracas.
      Parents will be instructed to not to repeat any of these activities outside of the lab
      setting for the period of the study. Upon finishing the intervention, infants will repeat the
      FFR measurement at 11 months of age.
