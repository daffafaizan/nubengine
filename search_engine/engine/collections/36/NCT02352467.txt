    
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common problem in all patient care settings, especially long-term
      acute care facilities and nursing homes. Aurix is a platelet-rich plasma gel used in the
      treatment of non-healing chronic wounds. The results of Aurix to date when used to treat PUs
      have been promising. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of complete
      wound healing in a prospective, open-label, randomized trial in which pressure ulcers will be
      treated using Aurix and standard of care to determine time to heal at 16 weeks. Comparison
      will be made to patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care in a 1:1 manner.
