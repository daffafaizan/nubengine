    
      Trial Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/-
           pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.

        -  To observe the patterns of recurrence following the administration of the combination of
           Paclitaxel and Carboplatin +/- pelvic radiotherapy in the treatment of UPSC.

        -  To assess the QOL, overall survival and disease free survival.

      Treatment

      Surgery: Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, +/- pelvic and aortic
      node sampling, omentectomy, peritoneal cytology.

      Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy commences at the surgeon's and the medical oncologist's discretion
      and the time between surgery and start of chemotherapy will be recorded. One treatment cycle
      consists of 3 weeks.

      Paclitaxel and Carboplatin will be administered as follows:

      Day 1:

        -  Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or po or phenergan 12.5 - 25 mg IV

        -  Cimetidine 300 mg or ranitidine 50 mg IV

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg IV

        -  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2

        -  Carboplatin AUC 6

      Day 22: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the second cycle.

      Day 43: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the third cycle.

      Day 64: Repeat the cycle. This is Day 1 of the fourth cycle.

      Day 85: After the fourth cycle of chemotherapy patients

      Patients with stage 4 disease will continue with chemotherapy for a total of 6 cycles.

      Patients with surgical stage 1b to 3c disease will receive whole pelvis external beam
      radiotherapy (50.4 Gy RD over 5 and a half weeks +/- paraaortic boost +/- vaginal vault
      brachytherapy boost). Radiotherapy will start 4 to 6 weeks after commencement of chemotherapy
      when the haematological count has recovered.
