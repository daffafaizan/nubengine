      A new subtype of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of this condition. On
      February 11, 43,103 cases had already been described and on this day the World Health
      Organization (WHO) named this disease as COVID-19. With. The disease had spread out to
      several countries on different continents and on March 11, WHO declared a state of worldwide
      pandemic. Today (April 25, 2020) there are 2,719,897 cases and 187,705 deaths documented,
      with a global case-fatality ratio of 6.9%.

      To date, no treatment has been identified as effective in combating this disease which has
      been identified as with high mortality, therefore there are no specific therapeutic options.
      So far, efforts have been focused on the treatment of patients hospitalized with dyspnea and,
      although several promising drugs are being evaluated, none has demonstrated effectiveness in
      reducing morbidity and mortality at this stage of the disease, suggesting that perhaps the
      best time to use medications either before the onset of severe symptoms of respiratory
      distress.

      Thus, we propose the use of two drugs which experimentally have shown activity against
      SARS-CoV2 and being used in severely ill patients with COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that
      perhaps using such drugs before onset of complications will allow better outcomes on this
      patient population.
