      substantial impact on physical and emotional function. Chronic pain in HIV-infected patients
      is common, and associated with serious health consequences, including up to 10 times greater
      odds of impaired physical function. Many pharmacologic therapies, including opioids, often do
      not lead to improved pain and function, and carry significant risk. Evidence-based behavioral
      interventions are among the most effective and safe non-pharmacologic chronic pain treatments
      investigated in the general medical population. Therefore, behavioral interventions to
      improve pain, physical, and emotional function in HIV-infected patients are needed. There is
      much to be learned from existing interventions. However, the success of a behavioral
      intervention is heavily influenced by how well it is tailored to the target population's
      biological, psychological, and social environment. Therefore, in this study investigators
      will conduct a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of a recently-developed behavioral
      intervention compared to routine HIV and pain care, to determine feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary impact.
