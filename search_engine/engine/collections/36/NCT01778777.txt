      standard for treatment of degenerative arthropathy of the shoulder associated with an
      irreparable tear of the rotator cuff. The new Arthrex Univers® Revers Shoulder Prosthesis
      shows a large and narrow range of components, whether it is a stem, cup, spacer, inlay or
      glenosphere. Adjustment can be done in very small steps to match anatomic and biomechanic
      needs. The Arthrex Univers Revers Shoulder Prosthesis is the only device up to date that can
      be configured in two different inclination angles without any limitation in component use.

      This multicentre case-series has the goal to evaluate whether patients with rotator cuff tear
      arthropathy benefit from the Univers® Revers shoulder prosthesis in terms of low complication
      risk, as well as high function and quality of life.
