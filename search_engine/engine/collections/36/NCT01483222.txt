      industry and society. Prevention of low back pain is important both for the individual
      patient and from an economic perspective. Therefore, there are many measures available that
      claim to reduce low back pain and its recurrence. The most commonly used preventive
      strategies are fitness exercises, lumbar supports, education on back mechanics and lifting
      techniques, and ergonomic adjustments. However, their efficacy is still uncertain. The main
      objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of two different design
      characteristics of lumbar support for low back pain prevention in hospital nurses.
      Investigators hope that those two types of lumbar support will reduce the incidence of low
      back pain and sick leave days. In addition, Investigators hypothesize that there are some
      differences on outcome measures between those two types of lumbar support. Enrolled subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups. The first group will wear an
      inelastic lumbar support for 6 months. The second group will wear an elastic lumbar support
      for 6 months. The third group will receive no intervention. After the completion of 6-month
      intervention, a further 6 months fellow-up will be added.
