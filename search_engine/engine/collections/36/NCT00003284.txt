      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the treatment of lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stem cell harvesting. Patients receive radiation therapy to primary
      site and metastatic sites, if necessary. Patients receive a high dose of paclitaxel by 24
      hour continuous infusion, then stem cells are infused 72 hours later. After a 3-4 week
      recovery period, patients receive ifosfamide and carboplatin by daily continuous infusion on
      days -7, -6, -5, and -4. Etoposide is administered by continuous infusion twice daily on days
      -7, -6, -5, and -4. Stem cells are again infused on day 0. Filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) begins on day 0. Patients may receive radiotherapy
      following recovery from chemotherapy. Patients are followed weekly for the first 6 months,
      then periodically for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients in 3 years.
