        -  Determine the complete response rate in children with primary refractory or recurrent
           acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or secondary AML treated with idarubicin and cladribine.
           (Refractory AML stratum closed as of 4/3/01) (Secondary AML stratum closed as of
           04/02/02)

        -  Compare the remission reinduction rates in children who relapse at 1 year or earlier vs
           more than 1 year from time of initial remission.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics (primary or secondary
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with first untreated relapse vs primary refractory AML).
      (Refractory AML stratum closed as of 4/3/01) (Secondary AML stratum closed as of 04/02/02)

      Patients receive idarubicin IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over 2 hours on
      days 1-5, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood
      counts have recovered for 2 days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete
      response after completion of course 1 may proceed to other chemotherapy or bone marrow
      transplantation at the discretion of the protocol investigator. Patients with extramedullary
      disease may receive intrathecal chemotherapy or radiotherapy to symptomatic sites.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51-102 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
