      general anesthesia. Children were randomly grouped into Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) group
      (n=35) and nasotracheal intubation (NTI) groups (n=35). In LMA group LMA was inserted after
      anesthesia induction using 8% sevoflurane. In NTI group rocuronium and remifentanil were
      given intravenously during %8 sevoflurane induction and the patients were intubated by a
      nasotracheal tube. After completion of the dental treatments patients were transferred to the
      post anesthesia care unit (PACU). Duration of dental operation ,duration of anesthesia,
      recovery time, postoperative discomfort, emergence delirium, pediatric dentist's access were
      recorded.
