        -  To evaluate the distribution and depth of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) within different
           types of nonmelanoma skin cancers after topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
           administration.

        -  To obtain in vivo measurements of ALA-induced PpIX formation within different zones of
           the tumors as measured by fluorescence detection methods.

        -  To correlate the level of PpIX fluorescence detected by non-invasive optical
           measurements with morphological characteristics of the tumors.

        -  To establish a skin cancer tissue bank.

      OUTLINE: Topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is applied to the center of the tumor surface.
      Patients then undergo punch tumor biopsy of the area where the ALA is applied followed by
      surgery to remove the tumor. Tissue samples are assessed for protoporphyrin (PpIX) levels by
      fluorescence confocal microscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Excess tumor tissue may be stored
      in a skin cancer tissue bank. Surface measurements (from a total of 5 surface sites) of PpIX
      fluorescence are taken at baseline and at 2 hours after ALA application using an optical
      fiber-based hand-held dosimeter.
