      concentration can result from a variety of causes, such as during anaerobic metabolism in
      exercise. The measurement of blood lactate during exercise has been routinely used to
      determine individual anaerobic thresholds, and optimise training in athletes.

      The measurement of the lactate trend requires multiple blood tests, and this can be
      uncomfortable. The need for repeated procedures may therefore restrict the full utility of
      the biomarker. Although point-of-care lactate measurements are possible, the barriers to
      initiating testing may also limit its role in clinical decision-making.

      The aim of the study is the validation of the microneedle-based lactate biosensor for
      real-time continuous lactate measurement in healthy volunteers during exercise as
      proof-of-concept.
