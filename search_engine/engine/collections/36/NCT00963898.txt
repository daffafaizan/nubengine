      Mental Retardation and challenging behavior. However, it is very difficult to titrate the
      dose of propofol for maintaining the adequate sedative depth because of the difficulty of
      verbal communication with them. Therefore, the infusion of excessive propofol dose elicits
      the complications and delay of recovery.
