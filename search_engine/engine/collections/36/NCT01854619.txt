      treatment assignments and a control group. The study is expected to enroll a total of 48
      subjects. The intent of the study is to evaluate a single versus double treatment of
      photodisinfection in men and women suffering from chronic persistent rhinosinusitis with and
      without nasal polyposis. Each photodisinfection treatment group will be compared to a control
      group receiving saline irrigation.
