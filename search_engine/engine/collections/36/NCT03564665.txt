      perimenopause, menopause, and as a result of treatment of cancer such as breast cancer. Hot
      flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms (VMS) may decrease a woman's quality of life due to
      discomfort, disruption of daily life, interruption of sleep, and worsening of depression.
      Previously, estrogen-based therapy was the primary treatment choice for VMS. However, in
      recent years, this has been considered less favorable due to the increased risk of breast
      cancer associated with estrogen-based therapy.

      While medications such as certain antidepressants, gabapentin and clonidine are available as
      non-hormonal treatment options, they appear to be less effective in comparison to estrogen
      therapy with reported adverse effects.

      Magnesium supplementation has been found to have very promising results in alleviating VMS in
      patients with a history of breast cancer. The goal of this study is to further investigate
      the effects of administering magnesium supplementation in reducing the effects of hot flashes
      in this targeted population. Our aim is to create a controlled trial using different dosages
      of magnesium glycinate in the management of hot flashes. Participants will be asked to
      complete surveys for data collection and analysis.
