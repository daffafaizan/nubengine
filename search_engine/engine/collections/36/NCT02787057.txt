      IP vancomycin and conventional IP vancomycin plus ceftazidime, eligible PD patients were
      randomly assigned to study group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with oral
      moxifloxacin 400mg QD) and control group (IP vancomycin 1g every 5 days combined with IP
      ceftazidime 1g QD). Patients were followed for 3 months after the completion of the treatment
      period. Primary endpoint is complete cure, secondary endpoint are primary response and
      primary or secondary treatment failure.
