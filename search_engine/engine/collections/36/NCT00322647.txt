    
      Objective 1: All new cancer patients seen for a four month period at the University of New
      Mexico Cancer Research and Treatment Center (UNM CRTC) (academic population) and for a six
      month-period at the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA) (community setting). A careful
      screening log will be kept during this period with the research nurses cooperation in
      documenting 1) whether patients seen were accrued to a clinical trial, 2) what available
      trials the patient might possibly be eligible for, and 3) the reason for not registering on
      to a clinical trial.

      Objective 2: To compare the responses to questions on the entry forms of those women who were
      eligible and declined participation to those who participated by Hispanic versus non-Hispanic
      ethnicity, we will access, copy, and analyze all the risk assessment profiles otherwise known
      as entry or eligibility forms completed by women who considered participating in the study of
      Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR). Patterns of eligibility criteria and risk assessment will be
      described by ethnicity of women considered for entry into this chemopreventive randomized
      trial without the use of personal identifying data in accordance with the Health Insurance
      Portability Accountability Act of 1996 to maintain patient confidentiality
