    
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common, complex chronic condition marked by diffuse musculoskeletal
      pain, fatigue, functional impairment, disability, and psychological distress that affects
      6-10 million people in the United States (US). There are currently no satisfactory
      pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for FM. New cost-effective strategies that
      reduce musculoskeletal pain and improve emotional and physical functioning as well as quality
      of life in people with FM are urgently needed.

      Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that
      appears to benefit a variety of chronic conditions. The physical component provides exercise
      that is consistent with that recommended for FM (muscle conditioning and aerobic
      cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to improve
      psychological well-being. These effects are especially pertinent for the treatment of
      individuals with FM.

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi for fibromyalgia. We plan to enroll 60
      patients with fibromyalgia over a two year period. Participants are randomized to either a
      Tai Chi program or an attention control intervention. Assessments are performed at baseline,
      week 12 and week 24. This study will provide preliminary data on the potential acceptability
      and safety of Tai Chi for FM and will help guide the design of a future large-scale study of
      the efficacy of this alternative therapy.
