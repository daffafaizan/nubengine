      bladder retraining, medication and/or surgery. Thus, it is important for the results of
      urodynamics to be accurate and representative of the patient's symptoms outside of the
      clinic.

      Pre-test anxiety levels in women undergoing urodynamics will be measured using a validated
      questionnaire HADS (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). The patient, prior to their
      routine urodynamics test, will fill out this self-administered questionnaire.

      Reproducibility of patient symptoms will be measured using a non-validated quantitative
      bladder test assessment. The patient will fill out this self-administered quantitative
      bladder assessment after their urodynamics test.

      The pre-test anxiety and symptom reproducibility variables will be correlated against each
      other to assess whether there is correlation between the two. A Spearman Rho test will be
      used to assess the strength of the relationship.
