      million newborn death each year.

      The majority of these deaths usually occur in low income countries . On the other hand, the
      survivors of neonatal sepsis are vulnerable to short- and long term neurodevelopmental
      morbidity .

      Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection with
      or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It includes various systemic
      infections of the newborn such as septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis,
      osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections. Superficial infections like conjunctivitis and
      oral thrush are usually not included under neonatal sepsis.

      Diagnosis of sepsis in neonates is challenging due to nonspecific signs and symptoms. The
      salient clinical features include systemic signs of infection such as fever, hypothermia,
      tachycardia, failure to thrive, lethargy, irritability, restlessness In addition, laboratory
      diagnosis until recently was time-consuming. This, therefore, necessitates the initiation of
      empirical antibiotic therapy pending a definitive diagnosis .

      Neonatal sepsis is caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Candida. The
      diversity of organisms causing sepsis varies from region to another and changes over time
      even in the same place .
