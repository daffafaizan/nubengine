      medication history will be collected and a physical and neurological exam with vital signs
      will be performed. An ECG will be completed if one has not been completed in the previous 6
      months. Subjects will be administered a series of psychological tests to help the study
      doctor decide whether or not a subject is eligible. The Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine
      Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire will be completed at each visit. During a 30-day
      Baseline Period, subjects will treat with their usual medication and complete a daily Diary
      documenting headache symptoms and treatment. At Visits 2 and 3 subjects will complete the
      Mental Efficiency Workload Test and Migraine Early Warning Tool. Following randomization at
      Visit 2, subjects will treat daily for 30 days with Treximet or a matching placebo. Subjects
      will be provided with Treximet for rescue of any persisting or recurring headache. During the
      Treatment Period, subjects will complete a daily Diary reporting headache symptoms and
      response to treatment. After the 30-day Treatment Period, subjects will exit the study at
      Visit 3 .
