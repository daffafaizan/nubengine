      treatment improves survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients undergo primary surgery, radical radiotherapy, radiotherapy with surgery, or best
      supportive care. Arm II: Patients undergo treatment as in arm I. Beginning within 10 weeks
      after surgery or radical radiotherapy or as soon as possible after diagnosis, patients
      receive 1 of the following regimens: Regimen A: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1
      followed by vindesine on days 1 and 8. Regimen B: Patients receive mitomycin, ifosfamide, and
      cisplatin on day 1. Regimen C: Patients receive mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin on day
      1. Regimen D: Patients receive vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin on day 1. Treatment
      in all 4 regimens repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6
      months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,800 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
