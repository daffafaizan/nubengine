      agree to participate you will be scheduled for, dietitian visits, and a study visit which
      will include insulin and glucose infusions, an MRI scan and brain function tests. All visits
      will be on the Hospital Research Unit (HRU) on the 10th floor of Yale New Haven Hospital. You
      will be randomized to either the MCT-supplemented diet or the standardized western diabetic
      diet. If you are on the MCT diet, the MCT oil will be given to you and you will be shown how
      to incorporate it into your diet. The MCT supplemented diet is for two weeks (with a two
      gradual transition onto the diet) and the standardized western diet is for two weeks (with a
      1 week transition onto the diet). At the end of the study you will be admitted to the
      Hospital Research Unit for the insulin 'clamp' and MRI scan. A 'clamp' is a procedure which
      involves insulin and glucose infusions. During a 'clamp' study, the insulin infusion is held
      constant, while the glucose infusion is adjusted every 5 minutes as needed to maintain the
      desired blood glucose levels. Compensation for the study is $750.
