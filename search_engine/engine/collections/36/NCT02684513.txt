      concentration versus a lower CHO concentration) is superior to routine fasting in terms of
      preoperative well-being among patients presenting for scheduled cesarean section.
      Preoperative well-being will be determined by a composite of visual analog scale scores aimed
      at assessing hunger, thirst, anxiety, fatigue and nausea on the morning of surgery.

      Women will be recruited from one of two outpatient obstetric clinics, University of Florida
      (UF) Health Women's Center - Medical Plaza or UF Health Women's Center. Women presenting for
      scheduled cesarean section will be provided with an opportunity to participate. Then the
      women will be randomized into one of three groups: oral carbohydrate beverage (group CHO),
      re-hydration beverage of an equal volume (group R) or fasted controls (group F). All subjects
      who consent to participation will have the following recorded: height, weight, age,
      indication for cesarean section, surgeon, and number of prior cesarean sections.
