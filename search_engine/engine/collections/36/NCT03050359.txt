      people who have duodenal ulcers and also may or may not have Helicobacter pylori (HP)
      infection. This study will look at duodenal ulcer healing and also the elimination of HP in
      people who take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 530
      patients.

      Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-438 20 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg

      HP+ participants will be asked to take a TAK- 438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule twice
      daily in conjunction with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for 2 weeks, followed up by a
      TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily for up to 4 weeks. HP negative (HP-)
      participants will be asked to take a TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily for
      up to 6 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted China, Korea and Taiwan. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 10 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits plus
      final visit at 2 weeks or 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
