    
      The present study is a prospective and interventional study comparing the outcomes of
      education program for one month.

      A one month education program is composed of three visits (every two weeks follow-up ) during
      which subjects were taught about their diseases, action plans in acute exacerbation, and
      inhaler technique.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of systematic education, questionnaires evaluating quality of
      life and satisfaction of education will be examined after each visit.

      Asthma control test (ACT) in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment
      test (CAT) in COPD subjects were compared before and after education as an index of quality
      of life.

      Educational effects were also measured, associated with improvement of their knowledge for
      chronic airway disease itself, proper use of inhaler technique, and satisfaction of subjects
      after education.
