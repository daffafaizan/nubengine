      of about 90 million people affected in Europe (Breivik, H. et al., 2006) and 100 million
      people in US (Relieving Pain in America, IOM Report 2011), or 20-30% of the adult population
      around the world. Chronic pain is defined as a condition that lasts for at least three to six
      months, after the normal healing period of an injury. Medical interventions offered in
      clinics around the globe are unfortunately not giving the results needed to give back the
      quality of life the patients had prior to the onset of the pain. The treatments offered today
      do sometimes reduce pain, but the effect is minor, and new treatment regimens are needed
      (Relieving Pain in America, 2011). Recent quality assurance registry measurements in Sweden
      has shown that patient taken part of multi modal treatment regimens, such as the acceptance
      and commitment therapy, (ACT) show that less then 40% of the patients have a decline in the
      pain level of 1 level on the VAS scale, 55% has no effect and 9 % has an increased level of
      pain after going through the program (Nationel Register for Pain Rehabilitation, Sweden 2017)
      The study objective is to evaluate how the use of a digital pain coach, based on artificial
      intelligence that improves the self-management of pain will decrease the pain interference
      and thereby increase QoL among chronic pain patients, as measured by PROMIS pain interference
      6a. We will here compare the improvement of quality of life by a decrease in pain
      interference, measured by PROMIS, in patients who follow their traditional treatment plan
      provided by the Pain Clinic with the addition of using a web application for increased self
      management of pain. The theory behind the study and the development of the device is
      supported by previously known data, showing that self-management has an effect and is
      important to the treatment by helping patients to believe in their own capacity to control
      their pain.

      The present investigation aims at exploring the effect of including digital tool as an add on
      to standard treatment and rehabilitation and will measure the effect it has on:

      Decreased pain interference Improved management of long-term pain and its consequences. Hence
      self-management of pain Increased function in daily life with the best possible activity and
      participation level Improved experience of health-related quality of life Decreased pain
      experience
