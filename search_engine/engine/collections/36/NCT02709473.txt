      control. However, the difficult airway may be expected in these patients as in the others. In
      the difficult airway situation, cholinesterase inhibitors and sugammadex may be used for the
      reversal. However, sugammadex is not always available due to its cost in every hospital. In
      addition to this, it is well-known that cholinesterase inhibitors do not work well in case of
      deep neuromuscular block. In consideration of these informations, the recovery of the
      neuromuscular block gain an importance in patients undergoing RSI with difficult airway.
      Therefore, decreasing the dosage of non-depolarizing neuromuscular agent may be helpful in
      case of the difficult airway situations. With the aim of decreasing the neuromuscular blocker
      dosage, opioid analgesics especially remifentanil is preferred combined with propofol to
      decrease the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. A recent study demonstrated
      that after induction of anesthesia with remifentanil and propofol, ED50 of rocuronium for
      acceptable intubation conditions was 0.20 mg/kg. In another study, the authors showed that
      the administration sequence of propofol and remifentanil for target controlled anesthesia
      affect the onset time of rocuronium due to change in cardiac output. The authors concluded
      that the prior administration of remifentanil decreased the cardiac output and delayed the
      onset time of rocuronium.

      The investigators hypothesized that prior administration of remifentanil compared to propofol
      may increase the ED50 and ED95 of rocuronium for acceptable intubation conditions in RSI.
