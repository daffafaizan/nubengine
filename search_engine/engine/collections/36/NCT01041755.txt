      but its association with decreased survival and quality of life and should therefore clearly
      established the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions used in this disorder.

      At the end of the nineteenth century to the ammonium was identified as the main agent
      responsible for the development of the syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy. Since then,
      reduced nitrogen compounds from the intestine are considered the main therapeutic measure. On
      this conceptual base, nonabsorbable disaccharides are the first line therapy in hepatic
      encephalopathy.

      Current knowledge indicates that other organs such as muscle, brain and kidney are involved
      in the generation of ammonium, which has set the pace for the development of new treatments,
      able to act systemically in metabolism and elimination of ammonia . L-ornithine L-aspartate
      (LOLA) lowers ammonium concentrations in animal and humans models with hyperammonemia. There
      are no adequate clinical trials comparing the efficacy of LOLA infusion against lactose
      enemas in the treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy.
