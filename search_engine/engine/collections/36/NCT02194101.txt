      improve surgical outcome in high-risk patients. Patients with proximal femoral fracture are
      considered high risk. However, most of this cohort elderly patients have poor cardiovascular
      condition and may not achieve the oxygen delivery goal. We will perform an observational
      pilot study whether the supernormal oxygen delivery is a valid hemodynamic goal for patients
      with proximal femoral fracture.
