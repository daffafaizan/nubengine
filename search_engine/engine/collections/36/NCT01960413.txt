      therapy for improving vaso-occlusion when compared to hydroxyurea alone. The following
      specific aims will be tested in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD):

      Aim 1. To determine whether montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve
      markers of vaso-occlusion-associated tissue injury in adolescents and adults with sickle cell
      disease.

      Aim 2. To evaluate physiologic effects of montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea in
      adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease.

      Subaim 2A. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve lung
      function in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease.

      Subaim 2B. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve
      forearm microvascular blood flow in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease,
      respectively.
