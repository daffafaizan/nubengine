      criteria recruited from the greater Atlanta metropolitan region. The metropolitan Atlanta
      area has about 2,623,744 persons age 12 or older. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental
      Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 109,777 (4.18%) have non-medical use of prescription
      pain relievers, and 48,302 are estimated to have an opioid use disorder. This DSMP describes
      the UG3 phase which will study patients with OUDs early in the course of treatment. The Go-No
      Go criteria listed below have to be met to proceed to the UH3. Recruitment will be from
      treatment programs in the greater Atlanta Metropolitan Region including the DeKalb Community
      Service Board residential, detoxification and other treatment programs which with over 30,000
      patient visits per year represents the largest treatment program in one of two urban counties
      in greater Atlanta. .

      The first UG3 phase will involve an exploratory study in 20 patients with OUDs to assess
      different timing parameters of nVNS effects on sympathetic measures and symptoms of craving,
      as well as modelling to verify and iteratively refine our methods for vagal nerve
      stimulation. The investigators in this trial will then apply nVNS in a pilot study comparing
      active (N=10) to sham (N=10) in OUD patients recently started on medication, looking at
      opioid craving, brain functional response with HR-PET, and cardiovascular and inflammatory
      biomarker responses to imagery-induced opioid drug craving. Brain function will be measured
      with high resolution positron emission tomography (HR-PET), autonomic function with wearable
      sensing devices, and biomarkers will be measured in blood, with an assessment of a broad
      range of stress responsive sympathetic, hormonal and immune markers.
