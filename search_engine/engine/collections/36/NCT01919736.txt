      knee osteoarthritis (OA). The knee adduction moment is one key variable that has been
      identified as an important indicator of medial compartment loads across the knee joint. Use
      of gait-retraining strategies to alter gait movement patterns and lower the knee adduction
      movement in persons with knee OA is a new and promising direction for the potential
      intervention in a population in which few strategies have worked successfully.

      Factors that affect cartilage composition are crucial to understanding the disease mechanisms
      in knee OA. A multi-scale approach towards understanding the knee OA disease process by
      evaluating tissue compositional changes, joint contact mechanics, whole-body neuromuscular
      dynamics, and functional performance. The results will be the first to show the association
      between cartilage composition and daily function (performance and patterns) which are
      implicated in OA development and progression. With the addition of comprehensive muscle
      testing (cross sectional area/volume assessment using MR, strength testing, muscle activation
      and co-contraction patterns during daily activities), it will be possible to study the
      interaction between all major tissues around the knee.
