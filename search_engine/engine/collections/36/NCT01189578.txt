      reactivity to cocaine and cocaine cues; prolonged use is also associated with prefrontal
      abnormalities during response inhibition. Limited research suggests that recreational cocaine
      use has similar, but attenuated, effects on neural functioning. Unfortunately, very little
      research has directly compared cocaine dependent individuals and recreational cocaine users
      in terms of their neural reactivity to cocaine cues and response inhibition. Such comparisons
      could help to elucidate the pathological neuroplasticity associated with the transition from
      cocaine use to dependence. The proposed study will assess neural reactivity to cocaine cues
      and response inhibition in recreational cocaine users using fMRI. These data will be compared
      to data from the baseline visit of an ongoing IRB approved investigation (NCT00759473) in
      cocaine dependent individuals that is using the same experimental procedures as the proposed
      study.
