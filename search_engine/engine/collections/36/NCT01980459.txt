      metabolic syndrome patients with low serum Mg levels have been studied with increased
      interest in recent years. However, serum magnesium levels only represent less than one
      percent of total body magnesium; whereas cellular deficiency of Mg is a more reliable
      parameter to assess repletion of this essential mineral for correlation with indices of
      inflammation.

      The proposed research will compare the efficacy of a 3 month period of treatment with oral Mg
      of diabetic patients selected for elevations of CRP, TNFα and other markers of inflammation
      on cellular and serum levels of Mg.

      We anticipate that 50 hypomagnesemic diabetic patients will be selected for 3 months of
      supplementation with 336 mg of Mg lactate tablets. The repletion of serum and oral epithelial
      cell Mg levels will be correlated with responses of CRP, TNFα, substance P, HgbAIc and
      oxidative/nitrosative (ROS/RNS) stress parameters before and after treatment. Individuals
      will be selected from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait. With completion of these
      analyses, a collaborative manuscript with joint authorship will be prepared and submitted for
      publication.
