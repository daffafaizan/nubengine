      March 2020. This poses a risk to healthcare workers. Whether esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
      is a aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) has brought controversy. Multiple international
      guidelines consider EGD as AGP based on expert consensus. No scientific data has been
      published regarding this. Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5
      microns (μm) in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are
      transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei
      refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods
      of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 metre. With a commercially
      available particle counter, we can differentiate the particle counts of different sizes in
      different areas of the endoscopy room. An increase from baseline particles of < 5um during or
      after the procedure would suggest that the procedure is an AGP. With the use of a commercial
      available particle counter, the number of particles of size (0.3um, 0.5um, 0.7um, 1um, 5um
      and 1um) are recorded. The baseline particle counts before and during the procedure are also
      recorded. The details of the procedure including procedure time and the use of sedation are
      also documented.
