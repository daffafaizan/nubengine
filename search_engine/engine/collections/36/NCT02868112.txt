      palliative care needs, models of care that are focused on these needs are lacking. The
      investigators propose to pilot test an intervention targeting the geriatric and palliative
      care needs of older adults with incurable cancer, referred to as a "transdisciplinary
      intervention."

      The goals of the proposed study are: (1) conduct focus groups with clinicians (from oncology,
      geriatrics and palliative care) and interviews with patients to explore their perceptions of
      older patients' supportive care needs and finalize the transdisciplinary intervention; (2) to
      demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the transdisciplinary
      intervention to older patients with incurable GI and lung cancers; and (3) to estimate the
      effect size of the transdisciplinary intervention for patient-reported outcomes (e.g.,
      between-group differences from baseline to week 12 in quality of life, physical function,
      physical and psychological symptoms).
