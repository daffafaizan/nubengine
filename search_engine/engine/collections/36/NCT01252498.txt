      head and neck cancer patients. However the mechanisms that induce such mucositis are not
      completely understood. Previous work evaluating mucositis in bone marrow transplant patients
      has suggested that prostaglandin levels may be associated with the appearance of mucositis.

      The present study will measure the levels in saliva of the prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2
      before, during, immediately after, and several weeks after radiotherapy for head and neck
      cancer. These salivary levels will be correlated with clinical observation of mucositis and
      patient reporting of pain levels.

      Improved understanding of the mechanism of mucositis may lead to the development of more
      effective targeted agents to prevent this problem.
