    
      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a questionnaire at baseline (paper, online, or telephone-based) and medical
      records are reviewed.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a self-generated SCP (i.e., generated from baseline questionnaire
      responses).

      ARM II: Patients receive a self-generated SCP as in Arm I. Patients also receive a 30-minute
      telephone-based educational counseling session on survivorship care.

      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS: Primary care providers complete a questionnaire about perceptions of
      the SCP and self-efficacy in providing survivorship care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 8 weeks.
