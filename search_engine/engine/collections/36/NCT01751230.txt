      will end about 6 months after the participant's baby is born. All participants will receive
      Women, Infants and Children (WIC) services.

      For the weight management program, participants will be put into one of these groups:

        1. WIC Moms: receive advice and services for nutrition and weight management after
           pregnancy from their WIC clinic.

        2. WIC E-Moms: receive a personalized diet and exercise plan to help them lose the weight
           they gained during their pregnancy. All information will be given to them using a
           SmartPhone, such as an iPhone. They will also get advice and services from your WIC
           clinic.
