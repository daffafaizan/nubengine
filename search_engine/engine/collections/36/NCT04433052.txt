    
      Primary Objectives:

      PART A:

        -  To prospectively validate biomarkers in risk stratification among stable CHD patients

        -  To identify high-risk CHD patients for the subsequent RCT

      PART B • To demonstrate whether a personalised prevention (PPP) strategy in high-risk CHD
      subjects results in a decreased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events (CV death, nonfatal
      myocardial infarction (MI) or heart failure (HF) events) as compared to the local usual care
      (UC)

      Secondary Objectives:

      • To evaluate the difference between the PPP arm to the UC arm in the following, pls.note
      section outcome measure below:

      In addition to the above-listed primary and secondary objectives of the study, the following
      analysis will be carried out based on the data to be collected during the trial:

        -  Effect of personalised prevention on behavioural change.

        -  Effect of behavioural change on CV outcomes and blood pressure.

        -  Identification of key components and risk factors affecting effectiveness of the PPP.

        -  Inter-relationship between nutrition and exercise will be evaluated. Nutrition
           parameters will be based on questionnaires and biomarkers (Trimethylamine N-oxide
           (TMAO), Trimethyllysine (TML), carnitines and their metabolites).
