      connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility,
      and tissue fragility. EDS features such as genetically related cartilage defects,
      craniofacial abnormalities and increased pharyngeal collapsibility have been proposed to
      cause obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). There is evidence from studies based on questionnaires
      that EDS patients might be more frequently affected by OSA and sleep disturbances than the
      general population. However, the actual prevalence of OSA in children and adolescents with
      EDS is unknown.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA in children and
      adolescents with EDS compared to a matched control group. The secondary objective of this
      pioneer study is to assess the quality of life in children and adolescents in EDS in
      comparison to healthy children and adolescents.
