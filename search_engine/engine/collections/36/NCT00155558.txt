      represented the No.3 cancer killer in both male and female population of Taiwan.

      Recently, evidence has accumulated that weekly, 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU may
      improve the response rate and survival time compared with 5-FU bolus regiment. In a
      randomized multicenter trial of metastatic colorectal cancer, Kohne et al reported an overall
      response rate of 44%and a median survival time of 16 months using a weekly-times-six schedule
      of infusional 5-FU (2600mg/m2 24-hours infusion). In another randomized study for advanced
      colorectal cancer, de Gramont et al reported a significantly better outcome in patients
      treated by a similar schedule which combined "bolus plus infusional" 5-FU compared to "bolus"
      5-FU. These results suggest that 24-or 48-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU is more effective
      than the conventional bolus schedules.
