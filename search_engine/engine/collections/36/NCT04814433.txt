      postoperative narcotics. All treatments are applied topically to the surgical bed prior to
      closure of the skin. Each of the drugs used in this study are Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) approved and routinely used for pain relief. However, the route of administration of
      the drugs and addition of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid is considered off-label
      (outside of the FDA-approved indications) and therefore investigational.
