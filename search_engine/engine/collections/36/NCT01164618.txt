      against subsequent prolonged ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury of distant organs and systemic
      inflammatory responses, both of which are key elements in the evolution of local and
      multiorgan effects of many clinical IR syndromes. The signal transduction within the target
      organ to generate ischemia tolerance, and the effects of RIPC on systemic anti-inflammatory
      pathways, however, remain to be elucidated fully. Particularly, data regarding the mechanisms
      of 'second window' protection (a resurgence of protection 24-72 hrs after the initial RIPC
      stimulus) is scant; even less is known of the effects of repeated RIPC, and a potential
      'third window' of protection. Our preliminary data and several recent publications have shown
      that the biology of RIPC and exercise show considerable overlap. This research has raised the
      possibility of a reciprocal effect between RIPC and exercise, with chronic exercise being a
      model of the potential effects of 'chronic preconditioning'. This is relevant, as repeated
      RIPC might be a strategy to improve exercise function in those with limited exercise
      tolerance e.g. heart failure.
