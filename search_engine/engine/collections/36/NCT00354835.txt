    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the early response rates, failure-free survival (FFS), and survival of patients
      with intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and
      vincristine (vincristine sulfate), dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or VAC alternating
      with vincristine, irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) (VI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare FFS, local control, and survival of patients with intermediate-risk RMS treated
      with VAC and early (week 4) radiotherapy vs delayed (week 10) radiotherapy, using data from
      Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS)-IV for historic comparison.

      II. To compare the acute and late effects of VAC to VAC alternating with VI, including the
      toxicity associated with concurrent VI and radiotherapy.

      III. To compare the acute and late effects of VAC as delivered on this study to D9803 VAC.

      IV. To correlate change in fludeoxyglucose F-18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
      maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) from week 1 to week 4 and 15 with FFS.

      V. For VI treated patients, to correlate patient UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family,
      polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype with VI toxicity. VI. To correlate cytochrome P450, family
      2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9
      (CYP2C9), and glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTA1) genotypes with VAC toxicity.

      VII. To prospectively evaluate and validate gene expression values with the intent to define
      the best diagnostic predictors and more powerful prognostic classifiers.

      VIII. To assess the frequency of bladder dysfunction in patients with bladder, prostate, and
      pelvic sites of RMS 3-6 years after study enrollment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms within 42 days of initial surgery
      or biopsy.

      ARM I (VAC): Patients receive VAC chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1
      minute on day 1 of weeks 1-13, 16, 19-25, 28, 31-37, and 40; dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes
      on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, and 40; and cyclophosphamide IV
      over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, and 40.

      ARM II (VAC/VI): Patients receive VAC chemotherapy alternating with VI chemotherapy
      comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-13,16, 17, 19, 20, 22-26,
      28, 31-34, 37, 38, and 40; dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1,13, 22, 28,
      34, and 40; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1,10, 13, 22, 28, 34, and 40;
      and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, 25, 31,
      and 37.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients* in both arms also undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks
      beginning in week 4 (except patients with alveolar RMS rendered group I by amputation OR
      patients needing week 1 emergency radiotherapy for symptomatic spinal cord compression).

      NOTE: *Individualized local control plan that deviates from protocol-mandated radiotherapy
      allowed for patients =< 24 months of age.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months for 4 years
      and then annually for 5-10 years.
