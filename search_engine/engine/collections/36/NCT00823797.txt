      I. The primary endpoint for this study is the 6-month progression-free survival-i.e., the
      proportion of patients who remain alive and free of any tumor progression at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of single agent bendamustine (Treanda) (bendamustine
      hydrochloride) the treatment of malignant gliomas.

      II. To determine the efficacy of bendamustine (Treanda) as a single agent as assessed by
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.

      III. To assess quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain
      (FACT-BR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days
      1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2
      months for up to 3 years.
