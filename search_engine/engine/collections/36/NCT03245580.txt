      suction", or "slow pull" technique. A randomization process will determine which technique.
      Each subject shall undergo 2 passes (2 cores of tissue will be obtained - ideally from the
      right and left lobe of the liver.

      Quality of tissue obtained via the 2 different techniques will be evaluated by number of
      fragments, length of specimens and number of tracts observed by the local pathologist and
      compared between the tissues obtained from the two techniques. We will also note technical
      success rate (ability to insert the needle twice into the liver for obtaining 2 specimens and
      ability to pass into the right and left lobe of the liver).
