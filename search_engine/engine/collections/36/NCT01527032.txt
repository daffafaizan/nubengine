      for systemic AL amyloidosis (AL), but treatment-related mortality (TRM) has historically been
      high. The investigators performed a phase II trial of risk-adapted SCT followed by adjuvant
      dexamethasone (dex) and thalidomide (thal) in an attempt to reduce TRM and improve response
      rates. Patients (n=45) with newly diagnosed AL involving Â£2 organ systems were assigned to
      MEL 100, 140, or 200 mg/m2 with SCT, based on age, renal function and cardiac involvement.
      Patients with persistent clonal plasma cell disease 3 months post-SCT received 9 months of
      adjuvant thal/dex (or dex if there was a history of deep vein thrombosis or neuropathy).
      Organ involvement was kidney (67%), heart (24%), liver/GI (22%) and peripheral nervous system
      (18%), with 31% having two organs involved. TRM was 4.4%. Thirty-one patients began adjuvant
      therapy, with 16 (52%) completing 9 months of treatment and 13 (42%) achieving an improvement
      in hematological response. By intention-to-treat, overall hematological response rate was 71%
      (36% complete response) with 44% having organ responses. With a median follow-up of 31
      months, 2-year survival was 84% (95% confidence interval: 73%, 94%). Risk-adapted SCT with
      adjuvant thal/ dex is feasible and results in low TRM and high hematological and organ
      response rates in AL patients.(British Journal of Haematology 2007;139:224-33)
