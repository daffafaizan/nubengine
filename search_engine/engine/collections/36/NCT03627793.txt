      adults.

      Each participant will receive 8 weeks of twice weekly supervised resistance training. Both
      the frail and non-frail participants will be randomised into either receiving high load
      resistance training or low load resistance training. High load resistance training will be
      delivered at 70% of the participants maximal capacity and low load resistance training will
      be delivered at 30% of maximal capacity. All resistance training will focus on the lower limb
      and regardless of intensity each exercise will be done to failure (unable to complete another
      full repetition).
