    
      The goal of this study is to pilot test a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial
      comparing the survival and quality of life (QOL) of older patients receiving cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker (CRT-P) versus defibrillator (CRT-D) therapy. This
      pilot will enroll 50 HF patients (age â‰¥ 75 years) undergoing CRT device implantation at the
      hospitals of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Duke University, Ohio State
      University, and the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Patients will be randomized to CRT-P
      versus CRT-D and followed until study end. Rates of patient screening, enrollment,
      randomization, and retention as well as cost of care will be examined. The results of this
      pilot study will inform the design of a large pivotal non-inferiority trial and will be
      necessary for its success. Patients who refuse participation in the randomized pilot trial
      will be enrolled and followed as part of a prospective observational cohort. Characteristics
      of patients who choose CRT-P vs. CRT-D will be compared and patients' level of satisfaction
      with their device decision will be measured.
