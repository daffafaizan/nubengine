      development. Despite the seriousness and prevalence of adolescent anorexia nervosa, few
      studies have focused on the effectiveness of various types of psychotherapy treatment.
      Family-based therapy may be an effective approach to treating adolescent anorexia nervosa.
      This study will compare specific family therapy (FT), standard family systems therapy (FS),
      and standard individual psychotherapy (IT) to determine which is most effective in treating
      adolescent anorexia nervosa. The study also aims to determine potential predictors and
      moderators of outcomes, as well as the cost-benefit ratio of each treatment.

      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment
      groups. Group 1 will receive FT, Group 2 will receive FS, and Group 3 will receive IT. All
      participants will receive a total of 24 hours of their assigned therapy over a period of 12
      months. Study visits will occur at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and again six
      months and one year post-intervention. Weight change will be assessed, as well as changes in
      concerns about weight and shape. The cost-benefit ratio of the treatments will also be
      evaluated.
