    
      Patients undergo 5x EEG from safety and research reasons during the study. Stimulation coil
      location (left DLPFC) is determined by magnetic resonance imaging (1,5T, 3D- TFE, voxel size
      1 x 1 x 1 mm, Intera MR scanner) and stereotactic neuronavigation (Brainsight Frameless).

      Patients are evaluated by several psychiatric scales. Positive and negative symptom scale
      (PANSS) is applied before the first stimulation, at the end of every stimulation day and two
      weeks after the last stimulation (a total 6). Other psychiatric evaluations used are Clinical
      global impression (CGI), Sheehan disability scale (SDS), Personal and social performance
      scale (PSP) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), Calgary depression scale for
      schizophrenia (CDSS); (MADRS and CDSS are for the exclusion of depression). These scales were
      used only before the start of the first stimulation, after its completion and two weeks after
      the last test.
