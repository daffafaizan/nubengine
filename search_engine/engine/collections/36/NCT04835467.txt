      biochemical characterization of atherosclerotic plaque. A combined optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) and FLIm that can provide a simultaneous structural and biochemical
      assessment of atheroma has been constructed successfully. This study sought to investigate
      whether the dual-modal intravascular OCT-FLIm is able to characterize high-risk plaques in
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Thirty two patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, who had at least one
      obstructive lesion (>70% diameter stenosis) that is considered suitable for PCI, will be
      included in the study. Culprit and mildly stenotic non-culprit plaques will be imaged using
      OCT-FLIm catheter.
