      Phase 1: Literature review (0-9 months). The research literature on pregnancy outcomes and
      factors affecting family planning decisions of women and men diagnosed with IBD will be
      systematically searched and reviewed. The findings will be used to prepare a topic guide to
      be used in the interviews with women and their partners.

      Phase 2: Interview study (10-20 months). A topic guide prepared in Phase 1 will provide a
      structure for in-depth interviews to explore the experience of family planning by women
      diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their partners. Detailed face-to-face
      interviews will be voice recorded and transcribed verbatim. Each interview may last
      approximately 45-60 minutes, giving participants sufficient time to share their experience. A
      total of 24-30 women diagnosed with IBD will be interviewed, where possible selecting 8-10
      women at different family planning stages (pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and post-delivery). 3-4
      women's partners for in each group, to explore partner's perspective of the pregnancy or
      pre-conception experience.

      Phase 3: Intervention development with focus group interview (21-24 months). The Phase 2
      findings will be used to prepare a draft of the intervention to address the issues and
      support needs as identified by study participants. A group of patients (3-4) and healthcare
      practitioners (3-4) will be recruited to take part in a joint discussion (focus group
      interview) on intervention acceptability, and the comments will be used to further develop
      the intervention.
