      there are changes in a pathway that regulates the "leakiness" the tiny airspaces inside the
      lungs. Even bigger changes in this pathway are seen when patients develop severe breathing
      difficulties (acute respiratory distress syndrome) similar to what is seen in patients who
      get really sick with COVID-19 disease.

      There are important changes in this pathway that occur in patients who have preexisting
      cardiovascular (heart) disease who do not have lung infections. The investigator will
      evaluate these levels in patients with COVID-19 because the investigator believes that this
      baseline difference in pathway regulation may be one reason patients with heart disease who
      contract COVID-19 get sicker than patients without heart or vascular disease.

      The investigator will also assess the levels of components of this pathway in patients who
      are less sick with those who became sick enough to require a tube to help them breathe
      because this is important to determine if COVID-19 lung disease has a similar effect on this
      pathway as other lung infections like flu and bacterial pneumonias.
