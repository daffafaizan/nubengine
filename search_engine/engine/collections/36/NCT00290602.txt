      lethal complication. The use of corticosteroid in ARDS has been the subject of great
      controversy and debate over the years. Unfortunately, trials of short-term, high-dose steroid
      therapy failed to show an improvement in mortality of patients at risk of, or with early,
      ARDS. Several investigators have suggested that the use of corticosteroids in the late or
      fibroproliferative phase of ARDS improved lung function and survival.

      Recently some authors have demonstrated that there is a potential for pulmonary
      fibroproliferation during the early stages of ARDS and the use of low-dose corticosteroids at
      these early stages has been found to lead to a complete maintenance of in vivo and in vitro
      respiratory mechanics in acute lung injury. These articles had important implications both
      for the study of repair mechanisms and the timing of therapies.
