      type gastric cancer. Currently, the histological assessment of gastric intestinal metaplasia
      still relies on the biopsies took from five sites that the updated Sydney System recommended.
      However, the updated Sydney System biopsy protocol needs more biopsy number and procedure
      time, for it is unable to satisfy the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Optic
      Enhancement is a novel image-enhanced endoscopy system. Targeted biopsy protocol based on
      high definition endoscopy with Optic Enhancement will be possible for the diagnosis of
      gastric intestinal metaplasia. This study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of gastric
      intestinal metaplasia from high definition endoscopy with Optic Enhancement targeted biopsies
      and a standard biopsy protocol and assess whether high definition endoscopy with Optic
      Enhancement can reduce the biopsy number needed per patient for the detection of gastric
      intestinal metaplasia without the loss of corresponding diagnostic yield.
