      Herlev Hospital and is a collaboration between the Department of Radiology and the Department
      of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

      The investigators want to include 300 prostate cancer patients referred to our standard
      diagnostic imaging (NaF-PET-CT scan) by the clinicians.

      In addition to the standard diagnostic imaging (NaF-PET-CT-scan), two project will be
      performed on all participants. The project has three arms with the following scanning
      combinations:

      A) Whole-body MRI + SPECT-CT B) Whole-body MRI + Cholin-PET-CT C) Whole-body MRI +
      PSMA-PET-CT The recruitment of project participants takes place on the day when the patients
      are undergoing a NaF-PET-CT scan in the course of regular clinical practice at our
      institution.

      All readers are experienced radiologists or specialists in nuclear medicine. Patient
      identification on each scan will be anonymized and the reader will not have access to
      clinical and biochemical information or previous imaging studies.
