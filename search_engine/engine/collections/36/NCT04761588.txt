    
      10 participants with tyrosinaemia or alkaptonuria will be invited to participate in this
      study. Following consent they will be assessed by their dietitian and a recommended amount of
      Tyr sphere will be prescribed based on their individual needs. Tyr sphere is a food for
      special medical purposes as defined by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013. It is designed to be
      prescribed based on its protein content, not its energy content.

      Visit 1, baseline clinic visit activities: consent, demographics, anthropometric
      measurements, gastrointestinal history, dietary assessment, metabolic control assessment
      including collection of dried blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, record
      routinely taken urine succinylacetone, serum albumin and pre-albumin levels, new dietary
      prescription.

      Weeks 1 to 4 (patient at home): dried blood spots, adverse events reporting/assessment, daily
      Tyr sphere adherence diary, daily gastrointestinal symptoms diary (weeks 1 and 4 only), daily
      intake diary for Nitisinone which is routinely prescribed. There will be a telephone call

      Visit 2, end of acceptability phase clinic visit activities: anthropometric measurements,
      review of diaries, review of adverse events, metabolic control assessment including
      collection of dried blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, investigator's
      assessment of Tyr sphere for the participant and decision on continuing with the
      prescription.

      Three-year routine follow-up: for the participants that do continue with the Tyr sphere
      prescription (in consultation with the investigator), they will enter a follow-up period of
      three years, during which only routine, standard of care visits and procedures will take
      place. Data will be collected on anthropometrics, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels from
      dried blood spots, adverse events, record routinely taken urine succinylacetone, serum
      albumin and pre-albumin levels.
