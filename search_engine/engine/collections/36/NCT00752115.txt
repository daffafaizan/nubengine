      degradative action of phosphodiesterase type 5 on cyclic GMP in the smooth muscle cells
      lining the blood vessels, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and
      increases blood flow. Because phosphodiesterase type 5 is also present in the arterial wall
      smooth muscle within the lungs, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors is also used for the
      treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
