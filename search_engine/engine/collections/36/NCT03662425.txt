      current antipsychotic medications and is related to deficits in social cognitive abilities,
      which include Theory of Mind, emotion recognition and attributional style. Oxytocin (OT) has
      many pro-social effects in animals and antipsychotic-like efficacy in preclinical tests. In
      this study, We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of twice
      daily intranasal oxytocin treatment for 14 days on psychotic symptoms and social cognition in
      patients with schizophrenia. We will recruit 52 patients, Screening of subjects included a
      review of psychiatric and medical history, physical examination, and blood for standard
      laboratory tests, baseline social cognition measures were obtained followed by psychiatric
      ratings. Daily intranasal treatments were initiated after baseline assessments. Social
      cognition measures and psychiatric ratings were repeated beginning 50 min after the morning
      dose of study medication on treatment day 14. psychiatric ratings include The Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms
      (CAINS). The social cognition instruments are some social scales such as Toronto Alexithymia
      Scale ,and some computer tests such as Reinforcement Learning Task. We will collect blood
      samples and MRI data of patients to explore the mechanism of oxytocin. To compare the effects
      of oxytocin on social behaviors in patients with schizophrenia and in health controls , we
      will also recruit some age- and IQ-matched control subjects. We will give them a single dose
      of oxytocin , Behavioral tasks will begin 45 minutes after substance administration
