      treatment phase lasted from Study Day 1 (day of randomization) to the occurrence of a
      protocol-specified progressive disease event or study conclusion, whichever came first. The
      extension phase (including crossover of control group patients) lasted from the progressive
      disease event until the earliest of the following events: a) the patient was no longer
      receiving clinical benefit, b) the patient chose to withdraw from the study, or c) the study
      ended. All patients received ruxolitinib in the extension phase of the study. Maximum
      individual patient duration was 5 years.
