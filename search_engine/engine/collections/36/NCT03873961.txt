      of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. Pain associated
      with the condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life.
      Achilles tendinitis is a common etiology of posterior heel pain that results in significant
      pain and loss of function. Calf exercise is initial management that may be supported by laser
      therapy. A treatment possibility high-intensity laser therapy is little explored.
      High-intensity lasers can deliver more energy deeper into tissue. The hypothesis is that both
      lasers are effective in treatment of plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinopathy, but
      high-intensity laser therapy is more effective.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the changes of heel pain, functional health
      and well-being after high-intensity and low-level laser therapy for plantar fasciitis or
      Achilles tendinopathy.

      The study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region
      (2016-07-14 No. BE-2-32). Patients are recruited in out patient clinic of Physical Medicine
      and Rehabilitation Department in The Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences
      (LSMU) Kauno klinikos.
