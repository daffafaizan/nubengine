      I. To determine the percentage of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer
      who demonstrate undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (< 0.2 ng/mL) at 7 months when
      treated with R-(-)-gossypol (AT-101) and androgen ablation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. II. To determine the percentage
      of patients with PSA >= 4.0 ng/mL, overall PSA < 4.0 ng/mL, and a PSA >= 0.2 ng/mL but < 4.0
      ng/mL during the first 7 months of therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive R-(-)-gossypol orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may receive bicalutamide PO QD beginning 6 weeks before the initiation of
      R-(-)-gossypol and continuing after completion of treatment, at the discretion of the
      treating physician.
