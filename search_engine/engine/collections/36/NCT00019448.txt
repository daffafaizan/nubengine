      or in combination with interleukin-2 for recurrent metastatic melanoma.

      II. Identify the immunologic response in these patients prior to and after these treatments.

      III. Determine the toxicity of these treatments in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are accrued for the first three cohorts and the study proceeds to
      the final two cohorts if responses are observed.

      Cohort I: Patients receive gp100 antigen intramuscularly (IM) into each of 2 proximal
      extremities once every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. (Closed as of December, 1999) Cohort II:
      Patients receive gp100 antigen intradermally (ID) at 5 sites on each of 2 proximal
      extremities once every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. (Closed as of December, 1999) Cohort III:
      Patients receive gp100 antigen IM into each of 2 proximal extremities once every 4 weeks for
      up to 4 doses. If patients do not exhibit immunologic response or dose-limiting toxicity,
      they may receive a higher dose of gp100 antigen on subsequent courses.

      Cohort IV: If cohorts I, II, or III do not produce an immune response and do not experience
      dose-limiting toxicity, patients receive a higher dose of gp100 antigen IM into each of 2
      proximal extremities every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses.

      Cohort V: Patients receive gp100 antigen IM or ID at the dose found to produce immunization
      once every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. Patients also receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes
      every 8 hours for 5 days (15 doses), beginning within 24 hours after gp100 antigen.

      Patients with minor, mixed, or partial response or stable disease may receive additional
      courses of treatment following 3-4 weeks of rest. Patients receive a maximum of 12 courses.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A maximum of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
