      prevalence of diabetes, to the concentration of glucose , insulin resistance and metabolic
      syndrome.The available trials have been conducted using small sample sizes in different
      subgroups (hemodialyzed patients , healthy volunteers , gestational diabetes and post
      menopausal women ) document variable results with a positive result in some (hemodialysis and
      gestational diabetes) and no effect in other settings(healthy volunteers and postmenopausal
      women).We therefore, planned this trial to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation
      (240,000 IU) on insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity.This will also help to
      calculate sample size for and choose an appropriate index for a larger randomized control
      trial which may be required subsequently.

      Study design and comparison:Single group, open label intervention trial involving assessment
      of insulin sensitivity and secretion in 30 volunteers before and after 4weeks of a megadose
      of Vitamin D. The pre and post intervention results will be compared using the paired t test.
