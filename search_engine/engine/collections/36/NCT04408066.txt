    
      CAPTURE is a two-stage sample collection study to complete the development, calibration and
      performance evaluation phases of the LumiraDx Point of Care (POC) device for the detection of
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM status of infected patients. The study is
      split into two arms targeting separate populations throughout each stage.

      Stage 1: Consists of sample collection only, to facilitate the in-house development and
      calibration of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 assays.

      Stage 2: Consists of sample collection to facilitate the performance evaluation of the
      LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 studies. In this stage the testing will be completed onsite using the
      LumiraDx POC device.
