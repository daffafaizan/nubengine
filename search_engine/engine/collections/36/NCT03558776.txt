      factor. The intake of linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 n-6) has been suggested to diminish the
      metabolism of Î±-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3).

      In this context, the proposed study will be conducted to evaluate the influence of the
      background diet, in particular the impact of the simultaneous intake of LA on the conversion
      of ALA into their long-chain (LC) metabolites, the incorporation of n-3 LC-PUFA in human
      tissues and their metabolism into eicosanoids and docosanoids. Further, the influence of a
      regular intake of milk fat, in particular from free-grazing ruminants, on n-3 PUFA metabolism
      will be investigated, because short- and middle-chain fatty acids as well as the
      branched-chain fatty acids in milk fat may influence the conversion of ALA into n-3 LC-PUFA
      (hypothesis).

      Thus, validated nutrition concepts for increasing n-3 LC-PUFA status from plant sources will
      be developed to ensure an adequate intake of n-3 PUFA according to the guidelines of
      nutritional societies and as a contribution to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
