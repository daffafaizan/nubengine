      intervention will last for 12 weeks. The laboratory staff who tests the HbA1c level, the
      outcome assessor who collects the blood glucose data and injection experience include the
      measurement of perceived pain, skin condition at the injection site, and device preference in
      participants, and the statisticians will be blinded to the treatment allocation.

      After informed consent is obtained, the participants can attend an initial study visit to
      determine eligibility for the trial. We propose to enroll 60 patients with type 1 diabetes
      (T1DM), participants are randomized into two groups, 30 in the needle-free jet injection
      group and 30 in the pen injection group. Sample size estimation is based on hypothesized
      changes in the primary outcome pre-prandial glucose in the morning. Participants are
      randomized using a computer-generated list.

      In order to ensure high quality data, two staff are responsible for the input of original
      data into the database to check and confirm the accuracy. When the data entered by two people
      are inconsistent, the auxiliary staff decides which data to use.

      Data analysis will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle by including all the
      randomized patients in the data analysis. Missing data will be filled in with multiple
      imputation method. Any substantial difference in baseline characteristics will be adjusted
      with mixed-model regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted by using
      per-protocol data by excluding those patients who drop out of the RCT.
