      3 weeks. All prophylactic anti-anginal medications will be withdrawn except no more than one
      beta blocker or one calcium channel blocker (CCB) to remain. If patients can tolerate the
      withdrawal of the multiple anti-anginal medications, the dose of the remained one beta
      blocker or one CCB will be kept unchanged until the double-blind treatment period ends. In
      this study period, patients will have two exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) on standard Bruce
      protocol, conducted one week apart. Sublingual nitroglycerin is allowed for symptomatic
      relief of angina attack.

      After screening, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the three
      double-blind treatments: high dose T89 of 300 mg, bid, low dose T89 of 225 mg, bid, or
      placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient will be instructed to administer assigned treatment
      twice daily for 8 weeks. ETTs will be performed at the end of week 6 and 8 of treatment, or
      end of treatment (EOT) if study patient discontinues study prematurely.

      Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) will be used to record patients' quality of life. Clinical
      evaluations and adverse event monitoring will be assessed throughout the study. Laboratory
      tests will be performed at screening and the designated visits.

      Once the treatment period is completed, patients will enter the extended open label safety
      assessment period for a further 44 weeks. During this period, all patients will receive T89
      at a daily dose of 600 mg, and they can resume their original anti-anginal medications as
      needed.
