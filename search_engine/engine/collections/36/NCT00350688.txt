      cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy using 3D-Conformal radiotherapy. It has been recently
      reported that while combination chemotherapy with local therapy (surgery or radiation) does
      modestly increase survival, greater toxicity results. As a precursor to the integration of
      gemcitabine in the standard chemotherapy regimen at our centre, the current clinical trial is
      designed to determine if a novel approach to the delivery of intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (IMRT), namely Helical Tomotherapy, will decrease the toxicity of standard chemoradiation.
      Chemoradiation will be administered as follows: 3 courses Intra-Arterial Cisplatin 90mg/m2
      every 3 weeks and radical radiation delivered as IMRT for a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily
      fractions of 2 Gy per day M-F starting day 15.
