      with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Due to contraindications to cisplatin, this substance can
      not be used in a high number of patients. Especially in elderly patients, patients with
      comorbidities and patients with reduced general condition, cisplatin is a therapy which often
      induces intolerable toxicities. Thus, therapy often has to be interrupted or finished
      prematurely. Due to its favorable toxicity profile, oxaliplatin can be used also for the
      treatment of elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. Based on toxicity data from a
      phase II study of our group in patients with gastric cancer, the dosage for
      oxaliplatin/docetaxel was adopted for this actual study. In previous phase II trials,
      response rates of oxaliplatin based combination chemotherapies were comparable to those with
      cisplatin in patients with metastatic NSCLC.

      In this study we will analyse, if a oxaliplatin based combination chemotherapy has a more
      tolerable toxicity profile and comparable or even better response rate in comparison to a
      cisplatin based chemotherapy. 44 patients in each arm will either be treated with a maximum
      of 6 cycles cisplatin/docetaxel or a maximum of 8 cycles oxaliplatin/docetaxel.
