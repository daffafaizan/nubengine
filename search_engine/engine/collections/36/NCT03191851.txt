      performed regularly in secondary care hospitals widely across the UK.

      Lack of a device specifically designed to perform paracentesis means that flow of ascites
      fluid through the catheter is not optimal leading to incomplete drainage and hence, frequent
      repeated paracentesis as well as a number of complications.

      A new 'Melody' catheter device has been designed and developed in collaboration with Mediplus
      Ltd and NIHR Enteric Bowel function Healthcare Technology Co-operative; specifically designed
      to improve the performance characteristics of paracentesis procedure.

      (The 'Melody ascites drainage catheter' including 'sterile ascetic drainage sets' is CE
      marked for clinical use). In addition, investigators would also like to confirm whether the
      addition of a pump will improve drainage with this device further.

      The Investigators propose to carry out a feasibility study, 'EMPATHY', with an aim to compare
      the performance characteristics of 'Melody' catheter device (with and without addition of
      'Andromeda' pump) with the current device. 112 patients with ascites requiring therapeutic
      paracentesis will be randomised to undergo the procedure using one of the two devices. The
      volume of ascites drained per session will be compared along with ease of insertion and
      removal as well as patient experience including all adverse events up to 7 days following the
      procedure. The outcomes of this feasibility study will inform further refinement of the
      'Melody' catheter device as well as a future large multi-centre randomised controlled trial
      evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the new 'Melody' catheter device in therapeutic
      paracentesis
