      the patients will be treated with a single dose of autologous stromal vascular cells (SVF)
      isolated from 500 ml of adipose tissue extracted from the infraumbilical area. The cellular
      product will be administered via intra-articular injection into patients with moderate to
      severe osteoarthritis (OA). Administration will be performed by injection into the synovial
      space. The dosing regimen will consist of two intraarticular injection of autologous SVF into
      the index knee. Total injection volume will be about 30 mL in two 15 mL aliquots via a 23
      gauge needle inserted 1.5 cm. deep into the intraauricular space of the knee. The total
      number of SVF to be injected is 1.0 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(7).

      The purpose of this study will be to define the safety and efficacy of SVF therapy in
      improving joint function and the quality of life in patients with OA of the knee. We plan to
      enroll twenty subjects for treatment for an adequate sample size for safety analysis with
      signals of efficacy. The primary safety outcome will be tabulation of adverse events related
      to treatment. Efficacy will be quantified at 3, 6 and 12 months by the total Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).
