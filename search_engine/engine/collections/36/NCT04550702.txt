      related questionnaires and bladder diaries of all consecutive women with OAB, who visited
      urogynecologic clinics in a tertiary referral center, were reviewed. Persistence interval was
      defined from the date of prescription of mirabegron to the date of discontinuation of
      mirabegron treatment. Statistical analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier estimator.
      Multivariable Cox proportional-hazard model with all variables with p < 0.25 in the
      univariate analysis was performed to predict OAB retreatment probability.
