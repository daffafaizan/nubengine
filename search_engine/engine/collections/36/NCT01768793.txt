      and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In addition, offspring of overweight/obese women are at
      increased risk for neurodevelopmental delay, becoming obese, and developing metabolic
      diseases. Women who are socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED), especially from African
      American populations, are particularly susceptible to adverse pregnancy-related outcomes
      because of their high prevalence rates of obesity. Therefore, successful weight management
      during pregnancy in SED, African American women has considerable public health implications.
      We have experience in testing lifestyle interventions among SED nonpregnant women that have
      been implemented and sustained within community organizations such as Parents As Teachers
      (PAT), a national home visiting program that provides parent-child education and services
      free-of-charge to high-needs women, prenatally and post-partum, with up to 25 home visits per
      year until kindergarten. We propose to conduct a 24-month (6-month prenatal and 18-month
      post-partum) randomized, controlled trial in overweight and obese SED African American women
      to evaluate the ability of an innovative lifestyle intervention program (PAT+), delivered by
      PAT parent educators during prenatal and post-partum home visits, to improve maternal and
      neonatal/infant weight, metabolic and health outcomes, relative to the standard PAT program
      (PAT). A programmatic evaluation will determine the applicability of the PAT+ intervention in
      real world settings by measuring programmatic reach, implementation, acceptability, and
      sustainability. If effective, PAT+ can be disseminated through this national organization,
      which currently reaches over 249,000 mothers and 319,000 children participating in 2,173 PAT
      programs across all 50 states.
