      all patients in the main PACU setting at the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) Houston
      Healthcare Southeast Hospital after they have undergone surgical procedures with general
      anesthesia, with the exception of patients who report allergies or sensitivity to ginger or
      lavender essential oils (EO) and patients who wish to be excluded from the project.
