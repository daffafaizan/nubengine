      Therefore, there has been much attention brought toward investigating predictive factors of
      postoperative pain. A systematic review of 48 eligible studies with 23,037 patients showed
      preexisting pain, anxiety, age, and type of surgery are the four most significant predictive
      factors for the intensity of postoperative pain. However, this paper evaluated all types of
      surgical approaches. More recently, a prospective observational study showed that
      preoperative State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) for
      anxiety and pain expectations are independent predictors of pain and morphine consumption
      following abdominal hysterectomy. To date, little is known about the predictive factors of
      postoperative pain in the urogynecologic patient population.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors of postoperative pain specific to
      the urogynecologic patient population. We aim to investigate the relationship between
      perioperative factors (such as demographics and medical history) and postoperative pain
      scores on postoperative day 1 with patients who have undergone urogynecologic surgery,
      specifically vaginal reconstruction for pelvic organ prolapse.

      This information would not only fill a gap in knowledge, but would also allow us to counsel
      our patients more accurately in regards to postoperative expectations. Furthermore, if we
      find any positive correlation between modifiable perioperative factors and postoperative pain
      scores, we may be able to minimize these effects in future surgical cases.
