      mg for the treatment of CIU symptoms over four-week treatment period in comparison with
      placebo.

      DESIGN · A multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel-group study in
      300 patients (100 patients each treatment) group.

      INDICATION · Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) ASSESSMENT Primary efficacy measure of each
      treatment will compare the frequency and severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the
      patient in terms of change in mean pruritus score (MPS) over the 4-week treatment
      period.Secondary efficacy measures include change from baseline over the 4 and 6-week
      treatment period in the mean number of wheals (MNW) score; mean total symptoms score (MTSS),
      calculated as the sum of the MPS (Mean pruritus symptoms) and the MNW (Mean number of wheals)
      scores, severity of symptoms of CIU as measured by the patient in terms of change in mean
      pruritus score (MPS) over the 6-week treatment period, Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and
      Quality of life (QoL) which will be assessed by the "Dermatology Life Quality Index"
      (DLQI).Safety: ECGs baseline and final visit; clinical laboratory controls, physical
      examination, incidence of adverse events (AE).

      STUDY POPULATION 300 patients between 12-65 years of age, with CIU
