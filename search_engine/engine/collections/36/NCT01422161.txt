      persistent deficits in hand function. This study investigates whether the application of
      botulinum toxin to a set of synergistically-acting hand muscles, in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy, will lead to reorganization and improved motor function in the
      stroke-involved hand. The investigators will use objective psychophysical measures of hand
      function and hand function rating scales to investigate if Botox in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy will lead to:

        -  improved motor execution,

        -  improved motor planning during a psychophysical two-finger grasping and lifting task
           with varying object weight, and

        -  increased hand function as assessed by the time taken to complete fine motor tasks.
