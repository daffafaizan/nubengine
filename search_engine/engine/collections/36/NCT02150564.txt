      steroids, antiepileptics and other medications would be as per standard procedure and would
      be documented. In addition detailed MRI evaluation will be performed (including contrast
      enhanced MRI study, diffusion MRI, perfusion MR, MR spectroscopy, dynamic-contrast-enhanced
      MRI for permeability studies, as well as functional MRI, and tractography if required) not
      more than 1 week prior to the date of surgery.

      Navigation specific MR sequences would be performed in all patients (both arms).
