    
      The study aims to study the impact of frequent intake of 150-180 gram duckweed on
      gastrointestinal complaints and several other health related biomarkers.

      Objective: The primary objective is to investigate gastro-intestinal complaints during 11 day
      duckweed consumption. Secondary objectives are to assess blood based parameters related to
      general health and urine based biomarkers for kidney function and to investigate consumer
      acceptance.

      Study design: The study has a randomised parallel design. Two different treatments will be
      evaluated e.g. a 11-day intervention with duckweed based meals and a 11-day intervention with
      control/spinach meals. At the start and at the end of the intervention we will collect a
      blood sample and a urine samples. Questionnaires about gut complaints, stool consistency and
      frequency, wellbeing, health complaints or other adverse effects will be collected daily
      during intervention and up to two days after the intervention.

      Study population: We aim to include 24 healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years. Intervention: A
      11-day intervention in which subjects will receive a daily lunch with 150-180g wet weight
      duck weed or spinach. Products will be incorporated in food products such as pasta, curry,
      soup etc.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is frequency and severity of
      gastro-intestinal complaints. Secondary outcomes are intestinal health parameters derived
      from blood and urine samples taken before and after the intervention.
