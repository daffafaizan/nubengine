      of the cervix during a sterile speculum examination. Another method is to place the catheter
      during a digital cervical examination.

      Maternal discomfort/pain during speculum placement of the catheter has been evaluated in a
      few studies whereas studies that compare the digital method with the speculum method of
      placement are lacking.

      The visual analogue scale is used to subjectively assess pain. With a skin conductance
      algesimeter an objective assessment of pain is possible.
