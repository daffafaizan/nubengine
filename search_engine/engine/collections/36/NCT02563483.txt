      memory, language and the ability to live independently. Thus, patients who suffer from this
      disease often require care from another person and must adapt to ensure their health,
      functional capacity and safety. Caregivers have a poor quality of life due to the physical
      and psychological burden of caregiving. Such physical, psychological, social and financial
      burden can increase the risk of death. Within this scenario, techniques such as yoga and
      meditation have emerged as low-cost interventions that offer little or no risk to the
      practitioners. Yoga seeks to develop health and attention through physical postures,
      breathing exercises and formal meditative practices.
