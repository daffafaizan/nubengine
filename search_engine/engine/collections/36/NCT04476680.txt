    
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the rates of 'silent' seroconversion rates,
      consistent with asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in a young healthy adult population
      with a wide spread of vitamin D concentrations.

      The study will be conducted over 16 weeks in two populations: Service Personnel undertaking
      initial military training, who are supplementing with vitamin D (1000 IU/day D3 for 4 weeks,
      and 400 IU/d D3 as a maintenance dose), and civilian students who are not supplementing.

      We will recruit adults aged 18-30 years old. Military and civilian participants will be
      recruited respectively in Catterick and Leeds, UK to start in coincidence with the
      recommencement of Autumn semester.

      In accordance with our power calculation and anticipated drop-out rate, 450 volunteers will
      be recruited in each group. Data collected at baseline and after 5, 9, 12 and 16 weeks will
      include seroconversion status assessed from a validated Dried Blood Spot (DBS) method in
      conjunction with novel salivary antibody testing, plus structured questionnaire responses
      screening for Covid-19 symptoms. Physical and demographic characteristics and serum levels of
      vitamin D concentrations collected from participants at study entry will facilitate secondary
      aims in relation to exploring the influence of gender, ethnicity, body mass and body mass
      index (BMI) on asymptomatic seroconversion, as well as interactions with vitamin D status and
      supplementation.
