      the maximum tolerated dose of vitamin C or, if well tolerated, the dose required to obtain a
      desired ascorbic acid plasma concentration.

      Because this is a phase I study, prospective subjects should have advanced disease (i.e.,
      metastasis) and have failed other curative therapies (or, are unable to receive curative
      therapies due to comorbidities or stage of disease).
