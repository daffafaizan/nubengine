      portable, and inexpensive in clinical use, a standardized and branded laser apparatus and
      system have not been identified. This has caused problems about whether the laser equipment
      used in the literature is valid and reliable in the evaluation of cervical proprioception
      (CP). Besides, the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test, which was designed before for CP
      assessment and standardized with trigonometric equations, carries out measurements in the
      frontal plane. In addition, cervical rotation in the atlanto-axial joint occurs in the
      horizontal plane. Therefore, the investigators presume that evaluating the biomechanical
      motion occurring in the horizontal plane and transferring it directly to the horizontal plane
      will be more practical and reliable for practitioners.

      The subjects' HRA values were measured through AOS ProPointÂ® device in the horizontal and
      frontal platforms and also through the CROM device. Each measurement was repeated bilaterally
      three times, and they were averaged. To validate the measurement method, a comparison between
      the CROM device used as the gold standard and the measurement values was made. Test-retest
      and inter-rater reliability scores were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the
      horizontal measurement method.
