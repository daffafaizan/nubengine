      direct intraperitoneal instillation. Intraperitoneal aerosolization of Bupivacaine 50 mg
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain, morphine
      consumption and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and it is associated with
      rapid mobilization compared with patients receiving direct instillation of Bupivacaine 50 mg
      or placebo.

      In a recent study the investigators found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg with the
      AeronebProÂ® before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynecologic laparoscopic surgery
      reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Patients receiving preoperative
      nebulization of Ropivacaine presented significantly less postoperative pain (-50% clinical
      setting) and consumed significant less morphine (-50% and -40% respectively) than patients in
      control groups during the first 48 hours after surgery.

      The effects of peritoneal nebulization of ropivacaine during laparoscopic colectomy on pain
      control and morphine consumption were not evaluated.

      The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine may produce
      better pain control and less morphine consumption than nebulization of saline after
      laparoscopic colectomy.
