      I. To determine the response rate, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in
      patients with metastatic gastric cancer treated with STI571 who have failed one chemotherapy
      regimen for metastatic disease.

      II. To assess the toxicities of STI571 in these patients. III. To obtain preliminary data on
      molecular correlates to determine clinical efficacy and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (good risk
      [chemona√Øve] vs poor risk [1 prior chemotherapy regimen]).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
