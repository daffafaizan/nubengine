      determine if screening with combination may result in detection of more lung cancer at an
      earlier stage of disease.The study will also assess if the blood test is able to detect lung
      cancers in high risk individuals when the LDCT is negative for cancer. There will be
      health-economic costs included in the final analysis of study data.
