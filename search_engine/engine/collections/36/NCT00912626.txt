      child's illness. While some research has looked at the impact on parents, there has been
      little focused on siblings. We want to better understand how social support may have a
      protective effect on siblings' quality of life. The goal of this study is to determine if
      there is a correlation between an efficacious family environment and sibling behavior in
      families with children who are critically ill. Our hypothesis is that a cohesive, emotionally
      rich and open family environment provides social support so that siblings can explore and
      express the difficult emotions that accompany illness, and is therefore a protective factor
      for a sibling's behavior.
