    
      This is a Phase II, randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), controlled, single centre study. The study
      consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (4 weeks before administration of study
      medication), treatment phase (48 weeks), and the follow-up phase (4 weeks). In the treatment
      phase, HIV-infected participants who have not changed their first-line treatment of highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 8 weeks and have documented evidence of
      their HIV- ribonucleic acid (RNA) measurements being virologically suppressed (HIV-RNA less
      than 50 copies/mL) for at least 24 weeks prior to the screening, will be randomly assigned
      equally in two treatment arms: triple combination therapy arm (DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily
      plus 2 NRTIs) or monotherapy arm (DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily). Participants in the triple
      combination arm who are already on 2 NRTIs prior to randomization may remain on these or
      switch them at baseline, where the participants on the monotherapy arm will discontinue HAART
      at baseline and will start DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, significant vital signs, and significant laboratory tests. The
      total duration of the study will be 56 weeks.
