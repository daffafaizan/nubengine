      carriers and their partners. It is not fully understood how women and their partners adapt to
      highrisk status over time, nor how different aspects of living at risk relate to this
      process. Neither psychological adaptation nor dyadic adjustment has been systematically
      measured in this population. This study is informed by Lazarus & Folkman s Transactional
      Model of Stress and Coping and modifications made to this model for use in studying dyadic
      relationships. A crosssectional research design will quantitatively explore the relationships
      between the appraisals and timing of risk-related stressors, dyadic coping, and the outcomes
      of adaptation and dyadic adjustment. Participants will be recruited from hereditary breast
      and ovarian cancer (HBOC) support groups, website postings, listservs, and clinic patient
      lists. They will have the option of completing either a paper or online version of the
      survey.
