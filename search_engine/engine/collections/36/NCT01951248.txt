      to severe degree is examined with central and peripheral 24-h blood pressure monitoring, 1
      night home polygraphy to determine the degree of sleep apnea, blood and urine samples to

      (p-angII), p-aldosterone, p-vasopressin (p-avp) and p-endothelin, before the start treatment
      with CPAP for sleep apnea.

      After 3 month of treatment all the above described is repeated to determine effects of CPAP
