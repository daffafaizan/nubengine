      Intra-articular steroids may also suppress bone formation, however, the duration or
      relationship to a steroid dose has not been established. It is hypothesized that
      intra-articular steroids suppress bone formation transiently, returning to pretreatment
      levels within four weeks in subjects with osteoarthritis. The purpose of the study is to
      determine if intra-articular steroids suppress markers of bone formation or resorption in
      osteoarthritis patients and whether these markers may be modified by Vitamin D or Dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone density status
