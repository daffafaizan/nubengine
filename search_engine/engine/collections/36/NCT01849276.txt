      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) in
      combination with cytarabine in relapsed/refractory AML.

      II. Define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of metformin in combination with cytarabine in
      relapsed/refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Remission rate. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Disease-free survival (DFS). IV. Length of
      remission.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride in combination with
      Cytarabine.

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-15 and
      cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 3 hours BID on days 4-10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 5 years.
