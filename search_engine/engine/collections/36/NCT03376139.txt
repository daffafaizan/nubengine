      5-weeks treatment with zonisamide to reduce symptoms of PTSD and AUD. The study population
      will consist of 60 Veterans with combat-related PTSD and co-morbid AUD. Veterans will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either zonisamide (up to 400 mg/day) or placebo daily for 35Â±4days,
      followed by a 14-day down-titration period with follow-up. Primary efficacy variables are
      scores on the CAPS-5, fear-potentiated startle (FPS) responses, and percent of heavy drinking
      days (%HDD).
