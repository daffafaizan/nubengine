      falciparum :

        1. In Work Package 1 (WP1) the investigators will assess whether S. haematobium infection
           increases the human reservoir of P. falciparum by increasing the carriage rate and
           incidence of P. falciparum gametocytaemia as well as by increasing the proportion and
           incidence of subject with sub-microscopic P. falciparum infection. The investigators
           will also determine whether this increase in gametocyte carriage is a consequence of an
           impairment of the immune response of helminth infected subjects to P. falciparum.

        2. In Work Package 2 (WP2) the investigators will determine whether the transmission of the
           sexual forms of P. falciparum from the human host to mosquito is increased in S.
           haematobium infected subjects compared to uninfected controls. Moreover the
           investigators will study whether the immunological changes induced in S. haematobium
           infected subjects lead to a decrease of the transmission reducing activity of IgG
           specific to Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 (both capable of blocking/impairing further development
           of P. falciparum in the mosquito gut).

        3. Finally in Work Package 3 (WP3) the investigators will assess whether S. haematobium
           infection affects the transmission of P. falciparum from the mosquito to the human host.
           This effect will be determined indirectly by assessing whether S. haematobium infected
           subjects are more attractive to mosquitoes.
