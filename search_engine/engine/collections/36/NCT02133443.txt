      Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) to evaluate the effect of these on tidal volume,
      inspiratoy activity, comfort scales.

      We propose to evaluate the ability to guide the titration according the patient's comfort
      scale. The intensity of the breathing sensations will be evaluated using the labeled visual
      analog scale (Banzett Scale).
