    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility of combining on-board cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
      with ultrasound imaging to overcome the shortcomings of CBCT or ultrasound imaging alone for
      imaging guided radiotherapy delivery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound imaging prior to and during radiation therapy. Patients also
      undergo kilo-voltage cone beam computed tomography prior to radiation therapy.

      Update (2021/02/04): Removed secondary outcome "Incidence of Adverse Events Related to the
      Ultrasound Probe". Per PI: Study initially intended to involve a non-FDA approved probe for
      use with liver patients but removed this section.
