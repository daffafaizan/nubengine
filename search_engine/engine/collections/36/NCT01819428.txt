      However, newly acquired resistance to these inhibitors is the inevitable obstacle in
      continuous treatment with them. To overcome this problem, many new class of TKIs including
      NOV120101 (Poziotinib) are developing these days. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101
      (Poziotinib) as a first-line monotherapeutic medication, chemotherapy-na√Øve patients will
      participate in this study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 12 mg PO once daily
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Objective response rate (ORR)
      will be analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS
      rate at 12 months, DCR, PFS, and OS will also be analyzed.
