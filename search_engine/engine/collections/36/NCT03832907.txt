      every 5 minutes is more effective in identifying low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and high
      blood glucose (hyperglycemia) when compared to regular measurements with fingersticks [point
      of care (POC)].

      This is an exploratory prospective study primary aiming to evaluate differences between
      Point-of-care (POC) testing (standard of care) and Dexcom G6 CGM (Continues Glucose
      Monitoring sensor system) in 1) glycemic control measured by mean daily blood glucose and 2)
      identifying hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events - in patients with type 1 and type 2
      diabetes treated with basal bolus insulin regimen.
