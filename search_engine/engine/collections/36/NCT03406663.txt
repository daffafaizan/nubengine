    
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety descriptive data on two
      different titration algorithms: the INSIGHT titration algorithm (self-titration of 1
      unit/day) and the EDITION trial algorithm with insulin glargine 300 units/mL (GLA-300) when
      given as basal insulin in uncontrolled T2DM patients on basal insulin with or without
      non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agent (NIAHA) or in insulin na√Øve patients.

      In a Korean, single-center, type 2 diabetes patients with basal insulin therapy will be
      enrolled. They will be randomly assigned to either titration algorithm for GLA-300. After 12
      weeks, the glycemic control, patients' satisfaction to the titration methods and healthcare
      providers' satisfaction to titration methods will be assessed.
