      important prognostic information; an accurate pathology report is the cornerstone to cancer
      treatment and follow-up. In addition to the preoperative serum PSA, Gleason score on
      pathology specimens, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node status, and a positive surgical
      margin with extraprostatic extension (EPE) are significant predictors of clinical and
      biochemical recurrence. However, the prognostic implication of a capsular incision, a tumor
      extending to the inked margins without a histologically documented EPE, remains to be
      defined.
