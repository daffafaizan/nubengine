      patient-reported gastrointestinal toxicity, a broad range of other toxicities will be
      comprehensively evaluated, including urinary, hematologic and dermatologic, this data will
      allow to determining the effect of hypofractionated radiation therapy on each of these
      aspects of toxicity from pelvic radiation. Additionally, will be recognized that it is
      possible to advance in the understanding of the clinical risk and benefits of
      hypofractionation.

      The primary endpoint will be acute gastrointestinal toxicity using the Radiation Therapy
      Oncology Group (RTOG) common toxicity criteria.

      In total, evaluating toxicity in different time points will allow determining if
      hypofractionation is secure concerning acute and late toxicity, that would enable to offer an
      optional treatment to this kind of patient. Chronic gastrointestinal toxicity from radiation
      continues to increase rapidly over two years, and then the rate of developing new toxicities
      slows. As a result, the majority of chronic radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by
      evaluating toxicity two years after completion of radiotherapy is going to be identified.

      Quality of life (QOL) will be evaluated using EORTC QLQ-CX24 and EORTC QLQ-C30, both of which
      have been validated and available in Mexican Spanish.
