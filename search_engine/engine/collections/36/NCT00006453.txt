        -  Compare time to progression in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial carcinoma who
           failed prior first-line platinum-based therapy when treated with carboplatin with or
           without gemcitabine.

        -  Compare response rate, duration of response, and survival time of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these treatment regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to progression-free time (6-12 months vs more than 12 months), type of prior
      first-line therapy, and bidimensionally measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV
           over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats
           every 3 weeks for up to 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each subsequent chemotherapy course, and at
      50 days after study.

      Patients are followed at 50 days, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 3 months for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study.
