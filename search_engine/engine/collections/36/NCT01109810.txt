      and to improve the quality of care for patients receiving Ig therapy in the United States
      through active publication of registry findings and disease management approaches.

      The IDEaL program represents a unique and powerful method for the collection of:

      Patient Level / Humanistic Data / Quality of Life Physician Level / Practice Patterns
      Clinical Data / Therapeutic Outcomes Reimbursement / Impact on Treatment / Policy Decisions

      Whereby:

      Accelerating innovation Producing faster knowledge gains Improving awareness of patient
      outcomes and disease burden Providing a clearer understanding of therapy impact on patients'
      quality of life.

      The objectives of the Registry are:

      to enhance the understanding of the variability, progression, and natural history of disease
      requiring Ig therapy with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic
      intervention; to provide the Ig medical community with recommendations for monitoring
      patients and to provide reports on patient outcomes to help optimize patient care; and to
      serve as an active knowledge base that can provide population-management information, which
      can be used to generate patient-management and practice-management tools; and
