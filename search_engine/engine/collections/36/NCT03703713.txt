      the study. The first blood samples are collected before initializing the treatment as well as
      measurements of body compartments with a bioimpedance analyzer. Collected blood samples are
      electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium and Chloride), colloid osmotic pressure, osmolality and
      hemoglobin. These samples are repeated at 4 and 8 hours after start of the study. Amount of
      infused fluid as well as electrolytes are recorded. Urine volume is measured and urine
      samples are analyzed for the loss of electrolytes.

      Additional samples for guidance of treatment are collected every hour.

      Hopefully the addition of colloid osmotic pressure, osmolality and mass balance can be
      beneficial in the diagnosis of the reason for the disorder as well as for the treatment.
