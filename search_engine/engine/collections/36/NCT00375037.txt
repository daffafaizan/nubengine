      units (wards) in three hospitals will be allocated to either the intervention or usual
      practise. We will stratify by hospital site in order to minimize confounding by
      hospital-level factors. The unit of allocation, intervention, and analysis will be at the
      level of the hospital unit. Thirty hospital units will be randomized to either the
      intervention or comparison arm. We will compare adherence to hand hygiene, MRSA rates, and
      other outcomes between the two study arms.
