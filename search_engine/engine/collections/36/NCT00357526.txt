    
      Sexually active young women (n=130), aged 15-21 years, were randomly assigned to use either
      the vaginal ring or oral contraceptive pills for an initial study interval of three 28-day
      cycles, followed by three cycles of the alternate method. Participants completed surveys
      about method use, acceptability and side effects at baseline, after three cycles, and after
      six cycles, as well as in a follow up telephone interview one month after study completion.
