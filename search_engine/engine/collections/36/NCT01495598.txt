      Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is an incurable, multicentric angioproliferative tumor that most
      frequently involves the skin. It is seen most frequently in people with HIV or other forms of
      immune compromise. Current therapies are limited by toxicities, including cumulative
      cardiotoxicity, while effective oral agents, agents deliverable in resource-limited settings,
      and agents deliverable long-term for relapsing disease are all lacking.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to:

      Assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide in subjects with Kaposi
      sarcoma, whether HIV associated or not.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Measurable, pathologically confirmed KS

        -  Any HIV status; HIV-associated KS subjects must be receiving and able to comply with
           HAART and have achieved an HIV viral load <10,000 copies/mL

        -  Hematologic and biochemical parameters within prespecified limits at baseline

        -  Willing to use effective birth control, as defined in the full protocol

        -  For subjects enrolled in the anti-tumor activity assessment phase, if KS is
           HIV-associated it must be increasing despite HAART and HIV suppression for greater than
           or equal to 2 months, or stable despite HAART for greater than or equal to 3 months

        -  No symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS

        -  No specific KS therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks if that therapy was bevacizumab)

        -  Neither pregnant nor breast feeding

      Design:

      This is an open label single agent phase I/II study of pomalidomide in patients with KS. In
      the phase I portion, up to six subjects will initially be treated with pomalidomide 5mg daily
      for 21 days of a 28 day cycle. Subject to toxicity evaluation, this dosage may be deescalated
      to 3mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle in a second cohort of up to six subjects. If
      either dose proves tolerable, the study will proceed to the phase II portion, and additional
      subjects to a goal of 15 HIV positive and 10 HIV negative subjects evaluable for response
      will be added at the highest tolerable dose to gain preliminary information on activity.
