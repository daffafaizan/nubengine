    
      The study will comprise:

        -  A screening period of up to 28 days;

        -  Two treatment periods lasting a total of 17 days from admission to the Clinical Unit
           (Day -1) to discharge (Day 16). During each treatment period subjects will receive a
           single dose of AZD4635 under fasting conditions. Period 1 is designed to evaluate the
           pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4635 in healthy smokers and non-smokers. Period 2 is
           designed to evaluate the effect of fluvoxamine on the PK of AZD4635 in healthy smokers
           and non-smokers.

        -  A follow-up call will take place between 6 to 9 days after the last dose of fluvoxamine,
           to ensure the well-being of the subjects. Completion of the last follow-up call or
           unscheduled follow-up visit will be considered the end of the study.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for a maximum of 53 days.
