      for regulating blood sugar (glucose) and digestive enzymes into the intestine for digesting
      and absorbing nutrients consumed in meals. Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive clinical
      disease of the pancreas, associated with swelling (inflammation), scarring (fibrosis) and
      loss of normal functioning tissue. Patients develop diabetes mellitus (elevated blood sugar),
      malabsorption of nutrients, weight loss and pain. Presently chronic pancreatitis is
      considered an irreversible condition because the mechanisms responsible for chronic
      pancreatitis are poorly understood and no therapy is proven. However, recent studies provide
      important clues that oral medications (Thiazolidinediones) used to treat diabetes mellitus
      might improve or reverse features of chronic pancreatitis, including elevated sugar or
      diabetes, reduced secretion of digestive enzymes, and pancreatic swelling and scarring.
