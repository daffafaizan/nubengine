    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-comparative study in healthy subjects designed to assess
      systemic exposure to articaine and its metabolite articainic acid after dosing a single
      topical ocular administration of AG-920 in the randomized study eye.

      In this study, subjects who provide informed consent and fulfill all the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria will receive a single dose of study drug in one eye. The
      study eye will be randomized. The single dose will be administered by the clinic staff as two
      drops 30 seconds apart in study eye. Subjects will have pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples
      taken at multiple periods over 24 hours following dosing. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring any changes in heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, visual acuity,
      biomicroscopy, and AEs.

      The study will consist of 3 clinical visits: Screening Visit, Dosing and PK Blood Level
      Sampling (0-8 hours) Visit and a Follow Up Visit (with PK blood level sampling 24 hours after
      study drug treatment).
