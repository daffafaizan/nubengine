    
      The purpose of this single-arm, interventional pilot study is to evaluate the effect of
      psychological stress intervention for patients with chronic urticaria, as many of these
      patients report heightened levels of stress before and/or after the onset of the urticaria.
      Participants will meet individually with a University of Mississippi Medical Center
      psychiatry resident for one hour once a week for six consecutive weeks to be educated on
      psychological stress intervention techniques. There is no control group for this pilot study.
      All participants will complete a packet of psychological and dermatological questionnaires
      before the first session with the psychiatry resident and one week after the final session.
      All participants will record daily 1) their urticaria symptoms and 2) the type and number of
      medications taken for his/her chronic hives. If psychological stress intervention proves to
      be effective, then this therapeutic modality would benefit patients with chronic urticaria,
      while avoiding addition and/or continuation of medications that may have significant adverse
      side effects.
