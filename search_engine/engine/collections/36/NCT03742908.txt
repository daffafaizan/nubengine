      patients in China. In 2015, more than 60% of patients undergoing breast reconstruction in
      Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital opted for implant based breast
      reconstruction. One of the major complications in implant based breast reconstruction is
      infection, which could cause implant explantation, delay the time to adjuvant therapies in
      breast cancer patients, and inflict adverse psychological effects. Although empirical
      intravenous and/or oral antibiotics are suggested peri-operatively, local applications of
      antibiotics/antiseptics and their combinations are applied differently in many medical
      centers worldwide, and some even suggest against the use of intraoperative local antibiotics.
      Furthermore, there is no consensus as to the local application of antibiotics
      intraoperatively for breast reconstruction patients in Chinese population. We therefore
      designed an open-label prospective randomized control trial in our Chinese patient population
      to investigate the effects of three different approaches of intraoperative surgical site
      intervention with antibiotics and or antiseptics. In each groups, all peri-operative
      interventions are standardized to best reduce bias. Short-term infection rate and long-term
      capsular contracture rate will be observed in the hope of singling out the best modality in
      our medical center to integrate into the overall comprehensive treatment for female breast
      cancer patients.
