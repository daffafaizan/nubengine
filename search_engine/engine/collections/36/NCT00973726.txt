    
      Study 1: 24 type 2 diabetics with minimal diabetic retinopathy but varying HbA1c level.

      Study 2: 24 type 2 diabetics with minimal diabetic retinopathy. Study 3: 24 type 2 diabetics
      with minimal diabetic retinopathy.

      Plan of trial:

      Study 1: Test individuals will be examined at baseline: Prior history of illness, eye
      examination, blood test, fundusphoto and fullfield-ERG. Afterwards test individuals will take
      an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which results in a peak in blood glucose after approx.
      2 hours, whereafter the blood glucose level normalizes. Immediately after the sugar intake
      test individuals will be examined by repeated fullfield-ERG's and blood glucose measurements
      (every 30 min) until the blood glucose level has been normalized.

      Study 2: Test individuals will be examined at baseline: Prior history of illness, eye
      examination, blood test, fundusphoto and dark adaptation. Afterwards test individuals will
      take an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which results in a peak in blood glucose after
      approx. 2 hours, whereafter the blood glucose level normalizes. 80 minutes after the sugar
      intake test individuals will be examined by repeated dark adaptation and blood glucose
      measurements.

      Study 3: Test individuals will be examined at baseline: Prior history of illness, eye
      examination, blood test, fundusphoto. Afterwards test individuals will take an oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) which results in a peak in blood glucose after approx. 2 hours,
      whereafter the blood glucose level normalizes. At baseline (fasting) and 80 minutes after the
      sugar intake test individuals will be examined by redfree photos of optic disc and blood
      glucose measurements.
