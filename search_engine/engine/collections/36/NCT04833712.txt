    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Current guidelines
      recommend catheter ablation of AF in symptomatic patients refractory to antiarrhythmic
      therapy. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) remains the cornerstone of any ablation procedure
      irrespective of patient characteristics. Recently, single fraction stereotactic radioablation
      has been used in patients with ventricular arrhythmias non-eligible for transcatheter
      ablation or after a failed transcatheter ablation.

      This is a single center, single arm, prospective and phase 1 clinical trial. Patients with
      refractory AF non-eligible for transcatheter ablation or after a failed transcatheter
      ablation will receive stereotactic radioablation for PVI.

      The target contours for paroxysmal AF stereotactic radioablation will cover the left
      atrial-venous wall, the myocardium and the myocardial sleeves of the PVs transmural at the PV
      antrum, similar to catheter ablation. The contours will be approximately 4-6 mm wide along
      the PVs / LA and approximately 2-4 mm deep depending on the tissue thickness.

      A pre-validation study will evaluate the location with respect to right and left PVs.
      Patients with esophagus in direct contact with the actual target lesion will be excluded.

      PVI will be assessed by means of Cardio Insight non invasive mapping system during
      radioablation.

      Safety is the primary endpoint of the study. Safety will be assessed by incidence and
      evaluation of any serious adverse evens using CTCAE V5.0 criteria associated with the
      procedure through 90 days (short-term) and 12 months (intermediate term).

      Efficacy will be evaluated by assessing atrial fibrillation recurrence and AF burden after 90
      days of blank period until 12 months post-treatment based on pacemaker interrogation.
