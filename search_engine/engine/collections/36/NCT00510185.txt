    
      Patients >74 y.o. with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome will be randomised to an
      early aggressive (coronary angiography within 72 hours followed, when indicated, by
      revascularization) or an initially conservative strategy (medical therapy, and coronary
      angiography only for refractory ischemia).

      As reported in Amendment 1, the trial was stopped in May 2010 after the enrolment of 313
      patients, which was the minimum sample size calculated in order to achieve a 80% power of
      detecting a difference in the primary-endpoint rate from 40% in the conservative arm to 25%
      in the invasive arm, based upon the log-rank test for survival curves (1-beta 0.80; 2-tailed
      alpha 0.05)
