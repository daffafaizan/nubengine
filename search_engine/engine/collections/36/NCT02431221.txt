    
      This study is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      clinical trial of the effects of perhexiline maleate on a rank-ordered, hierarchical variable
      consisting of outcome and functional measures in 350 subjects with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy and symptoms of moderate to severe congestive heart failure. The study is
      designed in four parts: 1) an open-label run-in period of 2 weeks, 2) A blinded, randomized
      phase of variable duration (anticipated between 6 months and 18 months depending on
      enrollment rate), 3) an open label period of 3 months, and 4) a randomized withdrawal period
      of 3 months. Subjects who do not experience an adverse outcome (death or resuscitated
      ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, need for surgical intervention, cardiovascular
      hospitalization, occurrence of atrial fibrillation, or study dropout) will undergo
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing in order to determine change from baseline in maximum oxygen
      consumption.
