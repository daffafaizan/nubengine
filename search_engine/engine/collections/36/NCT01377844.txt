      sugar transporters. The use of EGT0001442 may enhance the elimination of glucose from the
      blood by increasing the amount of urine produced. Hence the blood glucose levels are
      significantly decreased and the efficacy of EGT001442 can be established by assessing the
      three months average blood glucose levels (HbA1c). Due to the increased urinary output, the
      effect of EGT001442 on blood pressure levels are also assessed.
