      heart rhythm disturbances.

      Fluoroscopy is the imaging modality routinely used for cardiac device implantation and
      electrophysiological procedures. Due to the rising concern regarding the harmful effects of
      radiation exposure to both the patients and operation staffs, novel three-dimensional mapping
      systems such as Ensite NavX have been developed and implemented in electrophysiological
      procedure for the navigation of catheters inside the heart chambers.

      Ensite NavX is a promising system to guide catheters inside the cardiac chambers and vessels
      without the use of fluoroscopy.

      This study is intended to compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a zero-fluoroscopic
      approach with conventional fluoroscopic approach as performing catheter ablation of right
      atrial arrhythmias.
