      dose of lenalidomide when given together with MIL62 and how well this combination works in
      treating patients with Relapsed/Refractory low-grade Follicular Lymphoma(FL) and Marginal
      Zone Lymphoma(MZL). Giving MIL62 plus lenalidomide may work better in indolent Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma(NHL).
