    
      Crohn's disease is often treated with glucocorticoids or mesalazine. Both drugs are indicated
      for active Crohn's disease. Treatment with mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of
      mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Budesonide 9 mg/day or mesalazine 4.5 g/day are
      better than lower doses.

      So far only one trial compares the efficacy and safety of budesonide and 5-ASA. The result of
      this trial is that budesonide is more effective in inducing remission than mesalazine. The
      primary objective of this trial is to confirm this result for other presentations of
      budesonide and mesalazine; i.e. Budenofalk® capsules (9 mg/day) and Salofalk® tablets
      (Eudragit-L-coated oral mesalazine; 4.5 g/day) in moderately active Crohn's disease.
      Mesalazine is used in this trial as a comparator.
