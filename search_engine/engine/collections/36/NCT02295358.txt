      supplementation on intraocular pressure (IOP) as well as the signs and symptoms of dry eye.
      We hypothesize that dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will be associated with a
      significant change in intraocular pressure compared to baseline measurements prior to
      beginning supplementation. We further hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      will be associated with a significant increase in tear production and volume as well as a
      significant change in patients' subjective complaints of dry eye.
