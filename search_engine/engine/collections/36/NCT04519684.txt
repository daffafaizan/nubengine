      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), for the treatment of medically refractory
      peri-pouch fistulizing disease in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. The study will
      randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with
      MSCs, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct
      injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in
      and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three
      months. If complete healing has been achieved participants will continue to be followed for
      one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be
      eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control
      participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to
      receive an injection of MSCs and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total
      duration of 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the month 6 time
      point.
