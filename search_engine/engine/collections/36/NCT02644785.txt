      upon admission to the operating room (OR) and immediately prior to and 30 min after protamine
      infusion initiation. A rapid effect-response-based clinical assessment will be made using
      clinical and laboratory monitoring data for diagnosis and treatment decisions during
      protamine infusion, which may complicate the recovery from surgery.
