      been shown to be one of the most effective treatments.The α-2 receptor agonists are another
      important class of anti-shivering drugs that, unlike meperidine, produce little respiratory
      depression.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α-2 adrenoceptor agonist with potent effects on the
      central nervous system . Intravenous dexmedetomidine reduces both the vasoconstriction and
      shivering thresholds . Clinical studies had demonstrated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in
      prevention of shivering . Few clinical trials investigated its efficacy in treatment of
      established shivering. The optimum dose for shivering control with the least hemodynamic
      derangements is still under research.
