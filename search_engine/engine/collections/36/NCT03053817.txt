      musculoskeletal health and few harms. Showing an additional benefit to brain health and
      cognition in particular is likely to encourage adoption and help elucidate mechanisms
      underpinning brain health in HIV.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate, in comparison to individuals not offered
      the exercise intervention, the extent to which a comprehensive exercise program impacts on
      indicators of brain health, where these indicators are the primary outcome of cognitive
      ability (B-CAM) and the related brain health outcomes of depression, anxiety, fatigue,
      motivation, and speed of motor performance.

      A secondary objective is to estimate the extent to which changes in brain health are mediated
      through exercise induced changes in brain network function as measured by EEG and/or by
      exercise induced changes in muscle power, aerobic capacity, physical function, and body
      composition.
