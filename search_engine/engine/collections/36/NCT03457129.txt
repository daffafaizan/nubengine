    
      A total of 60 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of either partial onset or primary
      generalized epilepsy will be recruited into the trial. 30 subjects will initiate perampanel
      at a dose of 2 mg/day and titrate upwards every 2 weeks to a target dose of 6 mg/day.
      Subjects in this group will be designated Group A. The remaining 30 subjects will also begin
      perampanel at a dose of 2 mg/day but will titrate upwards every 3 weeks to a target dose of 6
      mg/day and will be designated Group B.
