      used Î±2-adrenergic receptor, and it helps provide sedation, analgesia and inhibition of
      sympathetic activation. The investigators propose to recruit 120 patients who is undergoing
      the arteriovenous malformation embolism operation in department of Neurosurgery. Patients
      will be randomly divided into 4 groups(control group, sufentanil and low dexmedetomidine dose
      group, sufentanil and middle dexmedetomidine dose group, sufentanil and high dexmedetomidine
      dose group), then the investigators select post-operative records to determine whether
      dexmedetomidine can take a positive role in neurosurgical analgesia.
