      context within which it develops is best treated using an individual adolescent intervention
      or an intervention that includes both the adolescent and the parents. This will be
      accomplished by conducting a randomized controlled pilot study of Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A) in comparison to Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed
      Adolescents and Parents (IPT-AP). Twenty-two families with adolescents (ages 12-17) who meet
      criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder NOS, or
      adjustment disorder with depressed mood and also report elevated levels of parent-adolescent
      relationship problems will be randomized to receive IPT-A or IPT-AP. Assessments will be
      administered at screening, baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16 (post-treatment), and 4
      months post-treatment. Outcome measures will include depression symptoms, quality of
      parent-adolescent relationships, parents' and adolescents' communication skills (assessed
      through observational coding of a parent-adolescent conflict negotiation task), and
      adolescents' physiological stress responses to negotiating conflict with a parent (assessed
      through collection of salivary cortisol). Identifying the best approach to treating both the
      adolescent's depression and the family environment in which it develops and is maintained
      would have significant implications for the long-term outcomes of depressed adolescents and
      their families.
