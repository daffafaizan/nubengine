      independent cardiovascular risk factor that is associated with cumulative inflammatory load
      with an elevation of circulating levels of cytokines, which mediate the mechanism of
      endothelial cells activation by increasing the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) function
      and generation of vasoconstriction. Enalapril maleate is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed by
      hepatic esterases in enalaprilat, which is a potent inhibitor of ACE. ACE inhibition
      decreases vascular systemic resistance and mean, diastolic and systolic blood pressures in
      several hypertensive states, independently of the mechanism, ACE inhibitors have a widespread
      clinic use for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the researchers considered that there
      could be an association between the use of enalapril and the decrease in arterial stiffness.
