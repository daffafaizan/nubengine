    
      This is a single center, single-arm, non-blinded dose titration efficacy and safety trial
      evaluating the ability of clevidipine, a vascular-selective L-type calcium channel
      antagonist, to rapidly control acute hypertension in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. At screening a clinical and neurological examination will be carried out. For the
      purposes of this study, acute hypertension will be defined as a range of SBP to be controlled
      within immediately prior to initiation of study drug. Approximately 20 patients with acute A
      SAH will be enrolled. Infusion of study drug will be initiated as soon ass the patient
      arrives in the ER and diagnosis is made and consent is obtained. All eligible patients will
      be enrolled to receive clevidipine in an open label manner.

      Clevidipine will be infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 90 seconds.
      Thereafter, titration to higher infusion rates can be attempted as needed q90 seconds to
      obtain the target SBP range.

      Titration to effect is to proceed by doubling the dose every 90 seconds, up to a maximum of
      32.0 mg/h, until the desired effect (SBP within the target range) is attained. Clevidipine
      infusion may continue for up to a maximum of 48 hours. Blood pressure and ICP recording will
      be recorded q 5 minutes. Assessment of safety will be performed throughout the treatment
      period and until 6 hours after termination of study drug.
