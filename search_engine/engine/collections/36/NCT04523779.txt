      randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and implementation potential of a brief
      cognitive behavioral therapy(bCBT) intervention for anxiety delivered either in-person or via
      VA Video Connect-Home (VVC-H), according to patient preference. Brief CBT will be delivered
      by existing Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers at three large VAMCs
      (Houston, New Orleans, and San Antonio). Aim 1 will examine the clinical effectiveness of the
      bCBT intervention vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) for anxiety at 4-, 8-, and 12-month
      follow-ups. Aim 2 will determine factors associated with bCBT response, and explore Veteran
      demographic and clinical factors associated with VVC-H engagement. An exploratory aim will
      use mixed, qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand implementation successes
      and challenges related to delivery and impact of bCBT anxiety and VVC-H use in the PCMHI
      setting. The primary hypothesis is that anxiety outcomes, as measured by the General Anxiety
      Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) will be superior at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow up for patients
      who are assigned to receive bCBT vs. EUC.
