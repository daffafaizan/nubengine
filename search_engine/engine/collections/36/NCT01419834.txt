      For patients following a 2 doses/cycle schedule (patients who were enrolled and started
      treatment prior to Amendment A(8)), one cycle has 2 days of intravenous hu3F8 treatment,
      given approximately 7 days apart.

      For patients following a 3 doses/cycle schedule, one cycle has 3 days of intravenous hu3F8
      treatment, given on days 1, 3 and 5. After Cycle 1, patients may receive treatment on a
      modified schedule of 3 days of intravenous hu3F8 over 10 days, as needed. To limit
      side-effects, patients receive analgesics and antihistamines as premedications. Cycles are 21
      days and can be repeated up to a total of 12 cycles, see section 9.1 for details. Evaluations
      before, during and after treatment are summarized in Tables 4A and B. In addition, to further
      study the side effect of pain, patients will be asked to assess their pain on the days of
      treatment with hu3F8 at 3 different time points: (a) prior to commencement of hu3F8, (b) at
      least once during the acute pain episode when rescue pain medication doses are usually
      required and (c) prior to discharge from the Pediatric Day Hospital.
