      paediatric patients. This study is designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of different
      bupivacaine concentrations in paediatric patients undergoing ultrasound-guided TAP blocks for
      unilateral inguinal hernia repair surgery. Seventy-four patients aging between 1 and 8 years,
      undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia surgery, were enrolled for this study after obtaining
      Institutional Ethics Committee approval and written informed consents from parents or legal
      guardians (2016/1281). Group 1 (n:37) received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.25% and Group 2 (n: 37)
      received 1 mg/kg bupivakain 0.125% for ultrasound-guided TAP block following standard general
      anaesthesia induction. All patients received remifentanil 0,1 μg/kg/h infusion and
      paracetamol 15 mg/kg intraoperatively, and paracetamol 4x15 mg/kg per day postoperatively.
      FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) behavioral pain assessment scale was used
      for evaluating patients' postoperative pain levels at 15-, 30-, 45-minute and 1-, 2-, 6-,
      24-hour. Tramadol 1 mg/kg was administered intravenously as rescue analgesic when FLACC score
      was ≥4. Total analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay and side effects were recorded.
