    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of obtaining FMISO PET (hypoxic volume and tumor to blood
      background values [T/B]) and dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) &
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI measures in patients with intracranial brain tumors.

      II. Determine if ferumoxytol-enhancement and hypoxic volume are imaging profiles of
      glioblastoma immunotherapy-mediated pseudoprogression or true progression in a clinical
      trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the feasibility of baseline and follow-up FMISO PET and MR imaging
      co-registration.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET imaging metrics as assessed by
      baseline "test" and "retest" experiments.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ¹⁸F-fluoromisonidazole intravenously (IV) and 1.5 - 2 hours later
      undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI over 20-40 minutes and a retest examination within 7 days.
      Participants may undergo 2 more PET/MRI scans no sooner than every 4 weeks.

      After conclusion of the diagnostic tests, participants are followed for up to 5 years.
