      individuals vaccinated with the 17DD yellow fever vaccine show significant alterations on the
      levels of expression of genes such as CLEC5A, IFNG, IL6, RNASEL, IRF7, IRF9, STAT2 e OAS1
      (8). The study which will be conducted by the Rockefeller University will be focused in the
      qualitative analysis of the genome and exome of volunteers. The study in LATIM will be
      focused in the quantitative analysis of mRNA, which, together with the results of sequencing,
      may help in the search for biomarkers. As the expression of mRNA is restricted to the acute
      phase of the adverse event, it will be done only during the first 30 days after the beginning
      of the adverse event.
