      absent menstrual periods is likely caused by insufficient energy (calorie) intake compared to
      energy expenditure. Premenopausal women with menstrual disturbances and amenorrhea suffer
      from reductions in bone mineral density, particularly in the lumbar spine. Bone loss observed
      in amenorrheic women may be serious enough to result in osteoporotic fractures, but is also
      associated with a high prevalence of stress fractures. Increased calorie intake should help
      improve energy status, menstrual status, and bone health.

      Comparison: Premenopausal women with irregular or absent menstrual periods will be assigned
      to either receive additional calories or serve as controls. A group of premenopausal women
      with normal menstrual periods will also be used for comparison.
