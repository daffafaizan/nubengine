        -  To compare the efficacy and tolerability of cytotoxic chemotherapy versus aromatase
           inhibition for the down-staging of strongly ER+ primary breast cancer in postmenopausal
           women.

        -  To identify biological predictors of response to these two treatment modalities.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter pilot, feasibility study followed by a randomized study. In
      the pilot study, a record of all patients screened and invited to participate in the study is
      compiled. Reasons for failure to recruit will be recorded. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, epirubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day
           1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve at least partial response after 3
           courses receive docetaxel IV on day 1 of 3-week courses for an additional 3 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for 18-23 weeks until day of surgery.

      Patients in both arms undergo surgery at week 18-23. Most patients then receive adjuvant
      therapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, periodically during study treatment, and then during
      follow up.

      Blood is collected pre-treatment, at mid-treatment, and before surgery. Blood is then
      collected every 6 months for 2 years. Blood samples and preserved tumor samples are used for
      correlative studies.

      After completion of surgery, patients are followed up at least annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients for the pilot study and 716 patients for the phase
      III study will be accrued.
