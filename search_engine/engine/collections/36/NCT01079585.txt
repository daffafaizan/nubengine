      subjects. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two Muffin cakes, with or
      without 40 grams Okara on three occasions (three visits). In two visits the subject will
      receive a Muffin cake with 40 grams Okara (but with similar caloric value), and in one visit
      a Muffin cake without Okara.

      Postprandial gastric emptying time will be measured for each subject, by 13C Breath Test.

      Okara is a natural water extracted food grade soy product, contains approximately 35% protein
      (mfb), and about 43% of dietary fibers.
