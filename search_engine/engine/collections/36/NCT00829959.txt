    
      This questionnaire is part of a study at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
      The purpose is to ask women who are seeking genetic testing for HBOC their viewpoints
      surrounding fertility, childbearing and parenting, both at the time of testing and at the
      time of results disclosure. The aim is to evaluate if the genetics results disclosure may
      influence women's views regarding these topics. Researchers hope to use this information to
      provide more information to the patient and the caregiver to help both parties with this very
      important cancer survivorship issue.
