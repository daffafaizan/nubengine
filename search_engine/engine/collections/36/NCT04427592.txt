      trans-vaginal ultrasound to diagnose placenta accreta spectrum ( PAS). Detecting new signs to
      help sure diagnosis of PAS.

      Cesarean section will be performed through extended transverse supra-pubic incision bladder
      dissection from anterior uterine wall using electro-coagulation instruments and double
      ligation of large caliber bridging vessels.

      Uterine incision above the placental bulge by at least 5 mm then complete separation of the
      placenta starting from least resistance plans to high resistant one leaving a clear defect
      which will be closed by running sutures from inside the uterus and controlling placental bed
      hemorrhage then closing the uterine incision with compressing the bed from outwards ( double
      compression sutures ) internal Iliac artery ligation may be done as a complementary measure
      to control the bleeding from abnormal pelvic vasculature, insertion of intraperitoneal drain
      and closure of abdominal wall in layers.
