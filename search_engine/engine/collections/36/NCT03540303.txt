      lymphoma is still a problem for the current treatment. There are still some patients with
      poor therapeutic efficacy, and the efficacy of CAR19-T cell therapy remains to be improved.
      Basic research shows that there is a synergistic effect between CAR-T cell therapy and
      anti-PD1 pathway, and it did have efficacy in clinic. However, the regimen of CAR19-T cells
      combined anti-PD1 inhibitors need to be combined with the application of anti-PD1 antibody
      and culture of CART cells during the treatment, there may be adverse events to PD1
      antibodies. In this study, CAR19T cells carrying cytosolic activated PD1 possess the dual
      effects of CAR19T cells and anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies while overcoming the adverse
      events of anti-PD1 inhibitors, and might have better efficacy than conventional CAR19T cells
      plus anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment, with fewer side effects.
