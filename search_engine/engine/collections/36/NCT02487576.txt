      study groups: In study group (A) participants consume isocaloric carbohydrate-rich meals (65%
      Carbohydrates; 20% Fat; 15% Protein) in the morning and fat-rich meals (35% Carbohydrate; 50%
      Fat; 15% Protein) in the evening for four weeks. After a washout-phase participants consume
      isocaloric fat-rich meals in the morning and carbohydrate-rich meals in the evening for
      another four weeks. Study group (B) receives the same interventions in the reversed order.
