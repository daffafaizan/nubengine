      their eligibility will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30, 60, or 100 Î¼g/kg
      lipegfilgrastim. There will be 11 visits to the investigational center during the study,
      including a screening visit, 1 inpatient period (through Day 4 post-dose) and 9 ambulatory
      visits.

      Blood samples for PK, PD and immunogenicity analysis will be collected pre-dose and at
      specified time points post-dose. A mandatory blood sample for pharmacogenetics (PGx) will be
      collected from all participants. During the study the following safety assessments will be
      performed: vital signs measurements,physical examinations, record of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, urinalysis, safety ECG recordings, local tolerability (injection site
      reactions), overall tolerability, pregnancy testing, spleen sonography, and concomitant
      medications
