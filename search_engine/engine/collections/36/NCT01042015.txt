      trauma victims who have exsanguinated to the point of cardiac arrest. In appropriately
      selected subjects, after an initial emergency attempt at resuscitation with standard
      techniques, an arterial catheter will be inserted into the descending thoracic aorta. Using
      appropriate tubing, pump, and heat exchanger,a large quantity of ice-cold saline (0.9% Sodium
      Chloride for Injection USP) will be pumped as rapidly as possible into the aorta with the
      goal of cooling the brain (tympanic membrane temperature, Tty) to <10 C. If possible, a large
      venous catheter will be placed and recirculation of fluid established.

      Once the subject has been sufficiently cooled, bleeding will be controlled surgically. The
      subject will then be resuscitated and rewarmed with full cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The goal is to improve neurologically-intact survival in these patients.
