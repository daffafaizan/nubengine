      Liters of cold Custodiol solution. Patients were randomized into either purge group (Pg)
      (n=40) were graft fluid contents were washed out by the patient's portal vein blood (0.5ml
      per gram graft weight) through incompletely anastomosed hepatic vein, or No purge group (NPg)
      (n=40) where graft fluid contents were washed into the systemic circulation by the patient's
      portal blood. The primary outcome objective was the mean arterial blood pressure 5 minutes
      after portal declamping. Secondary objectives included hemodynamic and oxygenation.
