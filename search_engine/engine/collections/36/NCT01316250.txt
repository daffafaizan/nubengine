      the IRIS trial indicate that in patients with chronic phase CML treated with first line
      imatinib, achievement of a complete or partial cytogenetic response (CCyR or PCyR) at 12
      months is associated with a significantly better progression free survival (PFS).

      Second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib can overcome imatinib
      resistance because of greater potency to bind to BCR-ABL. Recent results indicate that, in
      patients with previously untreated chronic phase CML, nilotinib results in a faster and
      higher rate of CCyR or PCyR than imatinib. However, nilotinib use is associated with diet
      restriction and much higher financial cost. Hence, an appealing strategy is to achieve the
      high rate of CCyR with first line nilotinib and then to maintain this response with long term
      imatinib which is user friendly and cost-effective.

      The primary objective is to test the ability of imatinib to maintain the cytogenetic response
      in patients who achieved CCyR or PCyR at 12 months with first line nilotinib. The secondary
      aims are to assess the effects of this strategy on molecular response, BCR-ABL mutations, and
      CML progenitors.
