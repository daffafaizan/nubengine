      undergoing Robotic Arm-Assisted TKA (RA-TKA) with the intraoperative use of a tourniquet to
      those undergoing RA-TKA with a short tourniquet time. The primary objectives will be to
      compare the total duration of hospital stay, quadriceps function, and the amount of
      postoperative narcotics utilized and VAS pain levels. The secondary objective will be to
      compare variables of patient functionality at five postoperative intervals.
