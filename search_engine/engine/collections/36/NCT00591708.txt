    
      Adolescent Asian boys and girls will consume a controlled diet for two three-week periods.
      The basal diet will contain 600 mg/d calcium and will be supplemented with beverages
      fortified with calcium citrate malate to achieve a range of intakes from 600-2100 mg Ca/d.
      Each participant will be studied on one of four combinations of a lower and a higher calcium
      intake within that range in a cross-over design.
