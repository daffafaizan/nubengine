      comparison of CBT-I, COPD-ED and non-COPD, non-sleep health education attention control (AC)
      using a highly efficient 4-group design. Arm 1 comprises 6 weekly sessions of CBT-I+AC; Arm
      2=6 sessions of COPD-ED+AC; Arm 3=CBT-I+COPD-ED; and Arm 4=AC. This design will allow
      completion of the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the efficacy of individual treatment
      components, CBT-I and COPD-ED, on insomnia and fatigue. 2. Define mechanistic contributors to
      the outcomes after CBT-I and COPD-ED.
