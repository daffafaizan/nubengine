      same-gendered teams of three or volunteer as acquainted groups of three . Teams will be
      randomized to receive oxytocin or placebo. The investigators will first measure baseline
      personality traits including prosocial orientation. Cohesion will then be measured using a
      cooperative, virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying mission. All online behavior will
      be recorded within the task and all offline, real world, behavior will be video recorded
      throughout the study by digital cameras for later behavioral coding. To measure biobehavioral
      synchrony, autonomic physiology will be recorded and saliva samples will be taken throughout
      behavioral testing.
