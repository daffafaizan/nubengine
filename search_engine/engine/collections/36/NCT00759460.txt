      is particularly high in patients with schizophrenia. Individuals with metabolic syndrome are
      twice as likely to die from, and three times as likely to suffer from a heart attack or
      stroke compared to individuals without the syndrome.

      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain is common in patients taking neuroleptics
      and atypical antipsychotics, and excessive body weight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
