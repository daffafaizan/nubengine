    
      The purpose of this study is to test an investigational vaccine known as "VAX161B". VAX161B
      is a vaccine for the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 avian influenza virus (bird flu). In this
      study, the subject will receive the VAX161B vaccine at one of five doses to see which does
      might be the best. VaxInnate want to find out how safe these vaccines are and how well they
      are tolerated by people who receive them. To measure how effective each type of vaccine is,
      VaxInnate will test the ability of the body to develop an immune response, which means how
      well the body recognizes and defends itself against the influenza virus.
