      symptomatology and chronification. Among all mental illnesses, AN has the highest mortality
      rate, which is about 5.1 per 1000 people per year. High drop-out rates (up to 40%) or small
      treatment motivation constrains treatment success. Since the onset of AN is mainly in
      adolescence, it is important to start with therapy as early as possible and establish an
      effective single-setting treatment program for this age group to prevent chronification.

      MANTR-a (Maudsley model of anorexia nervosa treatment for adolescents) is an innovative,
      theory-based, tailored treatment program which combines a cognitive behavioural approach with
      motivational interviewing. The main focus of the treatment program is the transformation
      maintaining factors of AN, like personality aspects, pro-anorexic beliefs, emotion regulation
      strategies, thinking styles and obstructive behaviour from caregivers.

      The aim of this study is the examination ot the effectiveness of the MANTR-a treatment
      program for adolescents and young adults. Therefore we compare MANTR-a (intervention group)
      with treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will be conducted before treatment (T0,
      baseline), after six months (T1), after 12 months (T2) and after 18 months (T3, follow-up)
      via questionnaires, interviews and neuropsychological measurements. Process evaluation takes
      place after every session. Each group consists of female adolescents and young adults within
      the age of 14-21 suffering from AN (ICD-10: F50.0, F50.1), resulting in an overall sample
      size of 100.

      The long-term goal of the study is to provide an evidence-based outpatient treatment for
      children and adolescents with AN in order to prevent a chronic course of the disease.
