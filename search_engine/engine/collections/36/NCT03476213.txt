      technology seems to prevent these events. Total of 80 patients planed for elective
      neurosurgical brain tumor resection fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be devided into
      two groups. First half will be anesthetized using TIVA with manual induction and the second
      half will be anesthetized using TCI. All patients will fulfil Modified Brice Questionnaire
      one hour after the end of operation.
