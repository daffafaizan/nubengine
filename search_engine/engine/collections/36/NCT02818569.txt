      what is known about the benefits of sleep in humans has been obtained from studies of
      patients with insomnia, the most common sleep disorder with a reported prevalence of 10 to
      15%. Unfortunately, insomnia is an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction,
      coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and death. More so, sleep
      disturbances lead to neurocognitive deficits such as delirium and psychosis. However, the
      principal medications (i.e. benzodiazepines, zolpidem) currently used to treat insomnia are
      associated with side effects such as daytime sedation, delirium, anterograde memory
      disturbance, and complex sleep-related behaviors. We recently found that a nighttime
      intravenous bolus administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with normal sleep
      architecture comprising of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (N1, N2, N3) sleep, with
      improved next-day psychomotor vigilance performance compared to zolpidem. Presently,
      dexmedetomidine is only available in an intravenous formulation. The goal of this project is
      to develop dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, into an oral sleep therapeutic with
      a neurocognitive sparing profile.
