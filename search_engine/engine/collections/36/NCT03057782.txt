    
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study designed to assess noxious-specific
      neurophysiologic responses and clinical signs following procedural pain in infants requiring
      hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) following elective surgery.

      The main goal of the study is to develop a method that reliably quantifies the level of pain
      induced from clinically-required noxious procedures to infants hospitalized in the NICU. This
      method will use measures of neurophysiological, autonomic, and behavioral responses to
      non-noxious and clinically-required noxious stimuli in order to guide the pharmacological
      treatment of NICU patients with analgesic agents, sedatives and/or muscle relaxants.

      The investigators hypothesize that resting state activity and physiological responses to
      noxious and non-noxious stimuli provide a more reliable assessment of the level of pain of
      infants hospitalized in the NICU compared to behavioral-based pain scores.
