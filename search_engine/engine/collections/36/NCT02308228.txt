      functional independence, but also metabolic health, as muscle is the organ primarily
      responsible for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The elderly suffer obligatory losses of
      muscle mass and strength, exacerbated by illness and physical inactivity. Progressive
      resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective intervention identified to improve
      muscular strength, and combat the muscle atrophy of aging (sarcopenia); however, overall the
      muscle response to PRT is blunted in the elderly and variability of response increased, with
      some individuals actually losing muscle mass. The Bamman and Peterson labs have independently
      been studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the "non-responder" phenotype,
      with the goal of identifying novel intervention strategies to promote mass and strength gains
      to improve function. We hypothesize that the abundance of anti-inflammatory, alternatively
      activated M2 macrophages in muscle predicts response to PRT in the elderly; those with the
      highest number of M2 macrophages and lowest inflammatory gene expression prior to the start
      of training gained the most mass. Further, we determined that metformin treatment increased
      M2 macrophage abundance, and decreased inflammatory cytokine gene expression. These
      provocative findings have led us to our central hypothesis that adjuvant metformin may
      improve the responses to PRT in the elderly by altering the muscle tissue inflammatory
      environment, thereby enhancing mechanisms that drive PRT-induced myofiber hypertrophy.
