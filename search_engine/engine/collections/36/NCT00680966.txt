      adolescents entering treatment have more than one condition. This study will evaluate service
      delivery methods of integrating empirically supported interventions for depression and
      non-nicotine substance use disorders (SUD)in an effort to improve treatment engagement,
      response, and maintenance of gains. The two examined interventions are the Adolescent Coping
      With Depression course (ACWD) and Functional Family Therapy (FFT).

      This study will expand upon previous research by systematically treating both depression and
      SUD. Over a 5 year period, 180 adolescents with depression/SUD and their parents/guardians
      will be recruited in Oregon and New Mexico and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a)
      FFT followed by ACWD, (b) ACWD followed by FFT, or (c) an intervention combining and
      augmenting FFT and ACWD (Integrated Treatment). Each treatment arm will consist of 24
      sessions provided over 20 weeks. Participants will be assessed at intake, after the provision
      of 6, 12 (Mid-treatment), 18 and 24 (Post-treatment)treatment sessions, and at 6 and 12 month
      follow-ups.
