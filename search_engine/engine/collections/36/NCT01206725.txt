      subclinical heart disease:

      Moderate Intensity Exercise will:

      Not significantly improve myocardial function compared to controls,

      Despite significant improvement (compared to controls) in:

      Glycaemic control (HbA1c) Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) Body composition (DXA)

      Aerobic Interval Training Group will:

      Significantly improve myocardial function compared to controls,

      Significantly improve (compared to moderate intensity exercise group):

      Glycaemic control (HbA1c) Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) Body composition (DXA)
