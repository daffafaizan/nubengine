      the most common causes of disability in older people. Acupuncture is a well-founded
      supplement or alternative to pharmacological and surgical treatment methods. The improvement
      is, however, often brief, so to preserve the initial effect the acupuncture has to be
      repeated at regular intervals.

      In veterinarian medicine implantation of gold-beads in acupuncture-points around a joint has
      been used mostly in dogs for at least 30 years in the treatment of OA. The effect measured on
      eating pattern, physical activity and signs of pain last for several years. It may be
      hypothesized that implanting gold in acupuncture points acts as a continuous acupuncture
      stimulation.

      The purpose of this one year randomised, controlled trial of middle-aged and elderly patients
      is to examine the effect of implanting gold beads extraarticularly in five acupuncture-points
      around a knee with OA.
