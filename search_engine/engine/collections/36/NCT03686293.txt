      patients. Postprandial glucose tests have been used for decades to monitor and compare
      glucose responses. Yet, individuals eating identical meals present high variability in
      post-meal blood glucose response making comparisons challenging. A recent landmark study
      showed that the inter-individual variation of postprandial glucose responses was associated
      with multiple person-specific factors including faecal microbiome factors. Gut microbial
      richness has for a long time been considered a hallmark of gut health and stability.
      Furthermore, microbial richness has been associated with colonic transit time, which together
      with the gastric emptying rate appear to be major determinants of the initial glycaemic
      response to carbohydrate-containing meals. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate
      whether postprandial glucose responses are associated with gut microbial richness, as well as
      secondary measures including gastric emptying rate, intestinal transit time and gut microbial
      composition and fermentation.

      In an acute-meal study, 40 healthy fasted participants will consume a standardized breakfast
      including one tablet of paracetamol (for estimating gastric emptying rate) and 300 mL of
      juice.
