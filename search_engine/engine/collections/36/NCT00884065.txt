      Diacutaneous fibrolysis (DF) is a manual technique to treat the mechanical pain of the
      musculoskeletal system. While this technique has achieved promising results empirically, its
      effectiveness has not been tested in clinical trials. We aimed at evaluating the
      effectiveness of a single session of DF on pain and mobility in patients suffering from
      painful shoulder.

      Subjects and methods:

      This clinical trial took place in two public Primary Health Care Centres. Fifty patients were
      randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group, who received a real DF session, and
      the control group, who received a placebo DF session. The degree of active mobility (flexion,
      abduction, extension, external and internal rotation), the pain in the hand behind back
      position and the participant's perception of the technique in terms of comfort and results
      obtained were measured.
