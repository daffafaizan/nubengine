        -  The addition of secondary endpoints for safety. The collection of data related to these
           secondary safety endpoints was already planned and the corresponding statistical
           analyses were described in the statistical section.

        -  The addition of an exclusion criterion regarding the administration of immunoglobulins
           and blood products. It is already included in the elimination criteria section. It
           impacts only immunogenicity.
