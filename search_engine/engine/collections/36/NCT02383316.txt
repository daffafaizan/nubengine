      development of some symptoms. The investigators have demonstrated that MAPK upregulation in
      Noonan Syndrome is responsible for partial growth hormone (GH) insensitivity, and subsequent
      growth retardation.

      Clinical traits evocative of energy metabolism dysfunctions have been recently reported in
      Noonan Syndrome patients, although the origins and consequences of these metabolic changes
      have not been documented to date. The aim of this study is to explore the metabolic status of
      children with Noonan Syndrome.

      Children with Noonan Syndrome will be compared with age- and sex-matched healthy children.
      The investigators hypothesize than Noonan Syndrome children have an increased insulin
      sensitivity compared to GHD children.

      Study parameters will be collected including: clinical measurements (height, weight, body
      mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressure), glucose and insulin levels at baseline
      and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), body composition measured by dual-energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

      The study will include only one visit.
