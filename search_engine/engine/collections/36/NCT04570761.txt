    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting almost 6% of the world's
      population over the age of 65. This disease, in its most typical sporadic form, is
      characterized by an episodic memory impairment linked to a deficit in consolidation. Many
      studies indicate that sleep promotes this consolidation stage during the deep slow sleep
      stage by facilitating the transfer of information between the hippocampus and the neocortex.

      A method of acoustic brain stimulation at night by pink noises has been recently developed
      and has shown its effectiveness in strengthening memory consolidation in healthy volunteers.
      Actually, there is no study observing the effect of this new stimulation method on
      populations with neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular in AD for which this technique
      could potentially become a therapeutic option.

      The hypothesis is that of a strengthening of the memory consolidation capacities in subjects
      with AD as has been shown in healthy subjects.
