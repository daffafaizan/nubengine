    
      This is a phase IV, multicenter randomized (1:1), active drug-controlled study (double-blind,
      double dummy) with parallel groups evaluating the efficacy of SMO versus oxazepam in the
      treatment of AWS in alcohol-dependent patients.

      A placebo-controlled design was considered but excluded, given that a gold standard treatment
      for AWS is available (i.e., BDZs).

      Furthermore, considering that SMO and oxazepam have two different pharmaceutical formulation
      (suspension and tablets, respectively), a double-dummy design was adopted.

      Thus, all subjects will receive both medications, tablets (oxazepam or placebo) and
      suspension (SMO or placebo), at the same time.
