      longer-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of lurasidone for the treatment of
      subjects with schizophrenia who have participated in Study D1050238, a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment
      of subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects who have completed the 28-week double-blind phase or
      who have experienced a protocol-defined relapse event during the double-blind phase of study
      D1050238 will have the option to participate in this study. In addition, if/when the study is
      discontinued by the sponsor, all subjects participating in the open-label phase and the
      double-blind phase of study D1050238 will have the option to participate in this extension
      study
