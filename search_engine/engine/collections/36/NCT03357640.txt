    
      Women will be managed by either of the two modalities and will be followed up by transvaginal
      ultrasound monthly for three successive months to evaluate the size and location of the
      functional ovarian cyst (follicular), to compare the effect of different modalities of
      management whether remission, regression, progression or persistence of functional ovarian
      cyst.

      The women will be assigned randomly to either study group to take oral contraceptive pills or
      to control group to take placebo. The 2 groups will be treated and followed up equally. Oral
      contraceptive pills will be given to the study group as follow:

      The women will receive one package of oral contraception (Cilest containing norgestimate 250
      microgram + ethinyl estradiol 35 microgram) and will be counseled about how to take oral
      contraception and informed of possible side effects. They also will receive a diary card for
      recording oral contraception intake to be returned to the physician on the next period. An
      appointment for the women in this group will be scheduled at one month of treatment for the
      second ultra-sonography. If the ovarian cyst does not show remission, the women will continue
      the same treatment and will follow up in another month by transvaginal ultra-sound. If the
      ovarian cyst still persists or progresses at the second month, the women will be followed up
      for third month. All results of the two groups will be compared. Data will be collected,
      tabulated according to the standard statistical method.
