    
      This study is a randomized prospective controlled study assessing the short and long-term
      effects of external foot center-of-pressure manipulation on gait pattern, muscle activation
      pattern, energy consumption, physical function, pain, and quality of life. Sixty patients
      will be recruited for the study and divided randomly into two groups, an experimental group
      (thirty patients) and a control group (thirty patients). Both groups will be similar with
      respect to demographic and pathological profiles.

      The experimental group will be fitted with a customized biomechanical device worn on the feet
      (AposTherapy Biomechanical System, AposTherapy - Sports and Medical Technologies Ltd.,
      Hertzlia, Israel). The device is custom calibrated for each patient. The device allows center
      of pressure manipulation for all phases of the gait cycle and induces controlled perturbation
      during gait. The immediate effects of the device will be evaluated using center of pressure
      measurements, three-dimensional gait analysis, and surface electromyography. Following this,
      patients will be instructed to walk with the device at home on a daily basis according to a
      customized AposTherapy therapy protocol. They will return to the laboratory for measurements
      of gait pattern, muscle activation pattern, energy consumption, physical function, pain, and
      quality of life after three months, six months, and twelve months from the start of the
      therapy protocol. Data from the analyses will be used to reveal potential changes in the
      aforementioned measurements as a result of the study intervention.

      The control group will carry out the same measurements in the laboratory over the period of
      one year, however without the biomechanical intervention device.
