      I. To determine the antitumor activity of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck using objective response rates (partial and complete
      responses).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of objective response, rate and duration of stable disease,
      progression-free, median and overall survival rates of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      II. To document the safety and tolerability of SB-715992 in recurrent and/or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      III. To characterize the population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SB-715992 including an
      assessment of significant covariates on SB-715992 PK and an assessment of the potential
      relationships between the pharmacokinetics of SB-715992 and relevant safety and efficacy
      endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.
