      severe, it can compromise the dentition's prognosis. Restorative therapies for treatment of
      severe tooth wear should be preferably minimally invasive and adhesive.

      This study compares two different treatment techniques for severe tooth wear. The first
      technique is regarded as the 'standard' technique. This is a full rehabilitation using only
      direct composite restorations (AP-X, Kuraray, Japan).

      The second technique comprises a full rehabilitation using both direct and indirect resin
      composite restorations (Estenia C&B, Kuraray, Japan). 10 indirect restorations are placed on
      specific elements i.e. first molars and palatal sides of all maxillary anterior teeth. Other
      elements are restored conform the direct protocol.

      An important benefit for the patients is the rehabilitation of their worn dentitions.
      Functionality (teeth are less sensitive, improved chewing ability, better occlusal stability,
      etc) and aesthetics will be improved immediately after finishing the treatment.

      Indirect techniques have the advantage of a superior control over form of restorations.
