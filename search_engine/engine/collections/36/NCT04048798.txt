      frequency nasal cannula (HFNC) provides an inspiration O2 fraction of 21-1% and it has a
      minimal dead space and can be well tolerated due to humidified air. It provides 5-7 cm H2O
      positive end expiratory pressure to the airways and may prevent atelectasis. In the
      preoperative room, forced vital capacity, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory
      frequency, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), carbon dioxide, oxygen pressure and carbon
      dioxide partial pressure values in blood gas analysis will be recorded. We will apply HFNC in
      the preoperative and postoperative period to Group I patients, while applying a constant O2
      concentration to Group II patients. After appliying HFNC for two hours in Group I patients
      and O2 via face mask in Group II patients measurements will be repeated. During surgery,
      similar mechanical ventilation parameters will be applied to the patients. After the
      operation Group I patients will be applied HFNC, while Group II patients will be applied O2
      via face mask in the recovery room for two hours. Measurements will be repeated. Primary end
      point of the study is the association between oxygen pressure, carbon dioxide partial
      pressure values among preoperative before and after HFNC and O2 and postoperative times.
