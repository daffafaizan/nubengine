    
      This is a prospective, open-labeled, multi-site evaluation of clinical performance of the
      STAAR EVO+ Visian™ Implantable Collamer® Lens (VICL) with Aspheric (EDOF) Optic [EDOF ICL]
      for the improvement of UCNVA in subjects who require between +1.00 and +2.50 Reading Add.

      Approximately 48 subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will undergo EDOF ICL
      implantation in both eyes. All eyes will be followed for 6 months after surgery.

      The first eye implanted with the study lens and the appropriate time for fellow eye
      implantation will be determined by the medical judgement of the Investigator. All eyes will
      be analyzed for safety and performance.

      The primary performance endpoint is defined as achievement of monocular UCNVA of Snellen
      equivalent 20/40 or better at 40 cm at 6 months after implantation in equal to or greater
      than 75% of implanted eyes.
