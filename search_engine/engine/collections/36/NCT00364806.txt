      annually have a migraine headache. The anti-emetic dopamine receptor antagonists have proven
      efficacy for migraines, are at least as well-tolerated as triptans, and enjoy wide-spread use
      in North American EDs. However, it is not yet clear which medication within this class and
      which dosage is optimal. Therefore, we propose a randomized clinical trial to compare the
      efficacy and tolerability of two standard medications for migraine.

      Specific Aim: To compare the efficacy of metoclopramide versus prochlorperazine for the
      emergency department treatment of migraine headaches. Both of these medications will be
      combined with diphenhydramine to prevent extra-pyramidal side effects.

      Patients will be enrolled as participants if they present to one of the participating EDs and
      consent to participate. Medications will be administered as an intravenous drip over 15
      minutes. Rescue medication will be administered, if needed, after one hour. A follow-up phone
      call will be conducted 24 hours after the ED visit.
