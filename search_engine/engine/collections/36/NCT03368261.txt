      population of SCD children (SS, SC) with similar medical caring, aged from 8 to 16 years old.

      Unlike the important number of studies in SCD adults, very few SCD children studies were
      performed. None of these studies reported the mortality rate associated with PAH in children
      although the literature reported a decrease of this morbid-mortality comparing different
      medical caring of the patients. The investigators hypothesized that physiopathological
      mechanisms responsible for PAH had to be different in SCD children compared with adults, as
      most degenerative processes had no time enough to appear during children's lives. At the
      inclusion in our study the diagnosis of PAH will be performed by transthoracic
      Doppler-echocardiograms in a group of 306 children (aged between 8 to 16 years old) with
      either SS or SC genotype with similar medical caring, to avoid a known selection bias. These
      patients will be followed during a 3 years longitudinal period. The occurrence of the
      clinical specific complications associated with SCD (acute chest syndrome, painful vaso
      occlusive crisis, septicemia and stroke) and the observed mortality rate of our children
      group, will be compared in patients groups stratified according to the occurrence of PAH. The
      expression of several molecular and cellular genetic biomarkers potentially associated with
      this complication will also be studied.
