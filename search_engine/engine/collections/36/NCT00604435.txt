    
      This is an open labelled, prospective, randomized, phase II clinical trial. A total of 60
      patients with core-biopsy confirmed breast cancer, stage ⅡA to ⅢC, and to be treated with
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy are eligible for entry into this study. Patients will be
      allocated randomly to two groups to receive either 3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE and endostar or
      3 cycles of neoadjuvant DE. All cases receive mammography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      (CEUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
      pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy, and then undergo surgical resection. The primary endpoint
      is clinical/pathological response. The secondary endpoint is (1) the safety and tolerability
      of the regimens, (2) the role of mammography, CEUS, MRA and PET for response evaluation, and
      (3) angiogenic profile and biological information involved in tumor response.
