      receive rosuvastatin 10mg daily (Treatment A) in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a washout
      period of at least 7 days. In interval 2, darunavir/ritonavir 600/100mg bid (Treatment B)
      would be administered for 7 days, followed by another 7 day washout period. Lastly, in
      interval 3 subjects will administer darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin (Treatment C) for
      total of 7 days. Group 2 will administer Treatment B in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a
      washout period of 7 days, then treatment A in interval 2 for 7 days followed by another 7 day
      washout period. Group 2 would then co-administer rosuvastatin and darunavir/ritonavir for the
      last 7 days. Intensive PK sampling will be performed on day 7, 21 and 35 following a meal.
