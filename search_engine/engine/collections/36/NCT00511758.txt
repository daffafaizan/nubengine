      purposes, after your routine colposcopy of your cervix.

      VISUAL DETECTION OF PRECANCEROUS LESIONS:

      Reflectance (the ability of an area to reflect light) imaging helps doctors visually tell the
      difference between precancerous tissue, cancerous tissue, and normal tissue in the cervix.
      Researchers want find out whether a digital camera image can be as effective as colposcopy at
      screening for precancerous tissue.

      STUDY PARTICIPATION:

      You will be seen in the clinic during a routine visit. Your cervix will first be examined by
      the clinician using a standard white light headlamp, and the image will be recorded.

      Your cervix will then be re-examined with the digital camera, which will involve the use of
      different types of light (standard white light, green filtered light, cross and parallel
      polarized light). These digital images will be taken before and after acetic acid (vinegar)
      is applied.

      Researchers will use these images to make comparison studies with the colposcopy procedure.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be finished on this study once your cervix has been examined with the
      digital camera.

      This is an investigational study. Up to patients 20 will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
