      groups: (I) diabetes mellitus type 1 (with (a) or without (b) vascular complications), (II)
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (with (a) or without (b) vascular complications), and (III) healthy
      persons. Diabetes mellitus will be defined by the guidelines of the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA).

      The examinations for this study consist of a blood pressure assessment, Flow Mediated
      Dilatation (FMD)-measurement, and a handgrip exercise test. The protocol will take
      approximately 2 hours.

      The investigator who performs the FMD-test followed a course and passed thorough evaluation.

      The blood pressure assessment will be continuously for 20 minutes to avoid large bias.
