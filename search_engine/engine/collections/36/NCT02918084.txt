      Latin America. Because nearly 80% of breast cancers are endocrine-responsive tumors, the
      majority of patients candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) are also candidates for
      endocrine therapy (ET). The optimal timing (i.e. concomitant vs sequential administration)
      for the integration of these two treatments has not been clearly defined yet.

      In patients with hormone receptor positive early stage breast cancer who are candidates to
      adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, the optimal timing for the integration of these
      two treatment modalities has not been clearly defined yet.
