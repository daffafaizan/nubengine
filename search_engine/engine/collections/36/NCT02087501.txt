      It is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent Graft System implantation may offer a number of
      benefits over conventional and recently developed treatment options for patients suffering
      from AAA. These other treatment modalities include open surgery and the more recently evolved
      EVAR.

      The Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System has a low profile of 14Fr and is implanted through a
      percutaneous approach. The modular bottom-up construction requires a single-sided femoral
      access and there is no need for cannulation of the contralateral limb, a requirement present
      in the majority of commercially available devices. These features are anticipated to result
      in a simplified procedure with less surgical trauma, shorter procedure time, lower levels of
      radiation exposure and shorter hospitalization periods. Moreover, the device is flexible
      enough to reach also tortuous anatomies and its fixation elements reduce the concern of
      migration and type I endoleaks.

      As such, it is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System may have potential clinical
      advantages and may exhibit benefits over commercially available stent-grafts.

      Hypothesis:

      In this clinical study safety and performance primary endpoints are compared between HORIZON™
      and those reported for the Lifeline Registry of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (Control).
