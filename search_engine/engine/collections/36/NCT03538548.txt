      protocol (#6912) who will receive a standard 12-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy
      for relapse prevention. Using a variety of self-report questionnaires and computer-based
      tasks, three major domains will be assessed and evaluated as predictors of treatment outcome:
      (1) impulsivity, (2) motivation to change, and (3) learning style. Measures of these factors
      will have been obtained in the #6912 protocol. A better understanding of the impact of
      impulsivity, motivation to change, and learning style on treatment outcome will provide
      critical information to guide the refinement of CBT for cocaine abuse. For example, the
      results of this study may help guide the development and introduction of more targeted
      cognitive remedial strategies or behavioral training components into the framework of
      evidenced-based practices. These additions may help ameliorate the deleterious effects of
      specific participant characteristics on the acquisition and implementation of coping skills,
      which can further improve the efficacy of CBT.
