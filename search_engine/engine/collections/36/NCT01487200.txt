    
      This study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active comparator design. The
      study was conducted in male and female patients â‰¥35 years of age with symptomatic OA of the
      knee.

      Twenty-four (24) patients with knee OA were randomized (1:1:1:1) and treated with a single IA
      injection of either 10, 40, or 60 mg of FX006 or 40 mg of TCA IR.

      Each patient was evaluated for a total of 6 weeks following a single IA injection. Following
      screening, safety, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) were evaluated during one (1) 48-hour
      in-patient period (Day -1 to Day 2), two (2) 24-hour in-patient periods (Day 14-15 and Day
      42-43) and seven (7) out-patient visits (Days 3, 4, 5, 8, 22, 29 and 36).
