      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced objective abscopal responses in solid tumor with
      metastasises. We hypothesize that hypofractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy combining
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) might improve the clinical response
      rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint of
      the current phase II trial is progression-free survival rate at 2 years, secondary endpoints
      are overall survival, safety and toxicity.
