      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of bortezomib and rituximab in patients with relapsed
           or refractory, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial response, complete response unconfirmed,
           and complete response) in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Estimate the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds once weekly in weeks 1-4 and rituximab IV
      over 5-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-5*. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 2 courses.
      Patients achieving stable disease or better receive an additional 4 courses of bortezomib
      alone.

      NOTE: *Patients receive rituximab in weeks 1-3 only during course 2 of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 18
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
