      patients with spastic equinus were randomly assigned to receive three sessions of either
      focused shockwave therapy or radial shockwave therapy at 1-week intervals. The intensities
      that were used during FSWT (0.1 mJ/mm2) and RSWT (2 bar) were comparable. Patients were
      evaluated at baseline and at 1, 4, 8 weeks after the final shockwave treatment. The primary
      outcome measure was modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score. Secondary outcome measures were
      Tardieu scale, ankle passive range of motion, plantar contact area during gait, and gait
      speed. A linear mixed model with repeated measures was used to compare each outcome measure
      between the two groups.
