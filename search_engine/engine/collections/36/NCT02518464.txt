      drugs have been tried in migraine sufferers including anti-depressants, anti-seizure
      medications, blood pressure medicines and others. The investigators have shown that in a
      small number of patients, a certain type of blood thinner (Clopidogrel) can reduce or
      eliminate migraine headaches in patients who also have a hole in the heart wall that allows
      flow from the right side of the heart to the left. Ticagrelor is a blood thinning drug which
      works in the same way as the clopidogrel, but is broken down by the body differently and thus
      allows everyone to use it. The investigators wish to test this medication to see if it works
      as well, or better than the clopidogrel.
