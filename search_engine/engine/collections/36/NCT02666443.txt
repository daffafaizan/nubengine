      supraclavicular blocks. The investigators will be answering essentially two questions. First,
      how long do supraclavicular blocks last when low dose dexamethasone is used as an adjunct.
      Only one study has looked at doses this low (Liu et al. 2015). Some methodological problems
      with this study include evaluation of shoulder surgery using supraclavicular blocks, which
      may or may not cover the posterior port site; use of the endpoint of "time to first
      analgesic", which may or may not indicate actual block duration; and low numbers powered to
      80%, which may yield spurious results. To avoid these issues the investigators chose upper
      limb surgery, a type of block which will definitely cover the entire surgical site, and an
      endpoint of time to first pain at surgical site, regardless of whether analgesic is needed.
      The investigators are also powering to 95% and recruiting higher numbers of patients.

      The second question evaluates the efficacy of 1 mg of intravenous dexamethasone. The study is
      powered to address this question, but in doing so is also powered adequately to address the
      first question. Studies to date have mixed results and methodological errors. No other
      studies have evaluated this dose of intravenous dexamethasone.
