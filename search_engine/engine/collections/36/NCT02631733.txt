      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of liposomal irinotecan
      (MM-398) + veliparib combination.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of MM-398 + veliparib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To characterize the preliminary efficacy of
      the combination using key efficacy indicators, such as objective response rate, clinical
      benefit rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)
      at 24 weeks, and progression free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Imaging, tumor, and blood biomarkers to assess the sensitivity or resistance to each drug
      and/or correlation with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 5-12 and 19-25 or 3-12 and 17-25. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within
      2-6 days prior to beginning liposomal irinotecan treatment, patients may optionally receive
      ferumoxytol (FMX) IV and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 24 hours
      after FMX infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
