    
      This hospital-based cardiac registry maintains data from all non-opposing adults living with
      HIV, with one or more other cardiac risk factor, who undergo complete cardiac examination at
      the Cardiac Center at the Saint Antoine Hospital.

      RECOVIH registry -

      The focus of this hospital-based cardiac registry is on clinical care, particularly on risk
      stratification, of adults living with HIV.

      The register was designed to evaluate echocardiographic, coronarographic, and blood pressure
      abnormalities among people living with HIV (PLWH).

      The primary goal of this single hospital registry is the improvement of patient care,
      especially risk stratification, by medical audit-type evaluation of cardiac tests and
      outcomes.

      RECOVIH data and research -

      Cardiac, biochemical, and associated data collected by this single hospital registry are also
      used as a source of data for some types of research. This research is particularly timely and
      relevant as currently little scientific evidence exists describing optimal cardiac care, and
      risk stratification, for adults living with HIV.

      The primary goal of research using RECOVIH data is the quantification of morphologic and
      functional cardiac abnormalities and blood pressure abnormalities.

      The secondary research goal is the identification and description of key aspects of the
      relationship between HIV, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and CVD risk factors. Exploration of
      this complex relationship may help identify and describe the impact of chronic HIV related
      infection and inflammation, antiretroviral use (ARV), and individual health risks on the
      development and course of morphologic and functional cardiac abnormalities and blood pressure
      levels.
