      despite maximal conventional therapy. Neonates with pulmonary hypertension have been treated
      with iNO, a selective pulmonary vasodilator. This multicenter, double-masked
      placebo-controlled randomized trial tested whether iNO would reduce the risk of death and/or
      the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a prospectively defined
      cohort of term or near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure unresponsive to
      conventional therapy. The sample size was based on a reduction of the primary event (death or
      ECMO) from 50 percent to 30 percent; 90 percent power; and a two-tailed Type I error of 0.05.

      Infants were evaluated at baseline for pulmonary, cardiac, bleeding status, and therapies
      received. Those who were greater than 34 wks gestation and 14 days old or less and required
      assisted ventilation with an OI (mean airway pressure x FiO2 divided by the PaO2 x 100)
      greater than 25 were eligible. They were randomly assigned to receive iNO at 20 ppm or 100
      percent oxygen as a control. Infants whose PaO2 increased by less than 20 mm Hg after 30
      minutes were studied at 80ppm iNO or control gas.; MetHg and NO2 concentrations were
      monitored regularly. Management, including surfactant administration, included prospectively
      defined criteria for study gas response, escalation, reinitiation, and weaning. The maximum
      total time on study gas was 336 hrs (after 240 hrs, the INO concentration was required to be
      no more than 5 ppm). Patients were followed to death, discharge, or 120 days and evaluated at
      18-24 mos by a masked certified examiner.
