      endotracheal intubation; specifically, in locating the glottic opening. Ultimately this would
      result in a new use of capnography to aid in securing normal and difficult airways. Currently
      capnography is only utilized for the confirmation of endotracheal tube placement.

      If successful, this study will provide information, and allow for the development of
      instrumentation that will assist in difficult airway management; specifically, in locating
      the glottic opening when visualization may be impaired. Ultimately this technique will be
      useful for routine and emergency airway management.
