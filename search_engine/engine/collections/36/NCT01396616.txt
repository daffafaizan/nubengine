      toric IOLs is an emerging technology that shows promising results. Similar to implanting a
      one-piece acrylic lens, toric IOLs provide good distance vision and, in many patients,
      freedom from spectacles for distance vision. A low absolute residual refractive cylinder has
      been associated with the implantation of toric IOLs, and the safety profile for toric IOLs
      has been good. As improvements with regard to rotational stability and treatment and cylinder
      power range are made, toric IOLs will emerge as an effective, safe treatment option for
      correcting astigmatism during cataract surgery.

      Further, to evidence on the safety and efficacy of TORIC IOL for patients having cataract
      associated with astigmatism served as the basis for us to identify the published literature
      on the safety and efficacy of TORIC IOL implantation in the treatment of cataract associated
      with astigmatism, thus provide a background for the development of clinical investigation
      plan for the present study.
