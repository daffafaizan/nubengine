      Patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit have a high risk to develop acute
      kidney injury (AKI). AKI is an independent risk factor of mortality. Given the absence of
      validated pharmacological treatments for limiting the progression of AKI or for accelerating
      recovery from AKI, early intervention and the restoration of the glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) in this context of septic shock might improve the patients' prognosis. One major
      challenge is therefore how to determine whether or not the AKI is reversible. The
      best-studied biomarkers (NGAL and KIM 1) have little discriminant power in septic patients
      because of their poor specificity or unsuitable kinetics for very early diagnosis. The
      combination of urine assays for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) and
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) has shown good diagnostic performance
      for the very early detection of the risk of developing AKI in the following 12 hrs. Urine
      levels of these two markers specifically reflect damage to kidney tubules. Moreover, the
      levels appear to be strongly correlated with the severity of tubule damage. Thus, one can
      reasonably hypothesize that measurement of these markers in the very early stages of septic
      shock might determine the presence and severity of kidney tubule damage. A threshold (yet to
      be defined) would help to differentiate between (i) transient, non-severe injury and (ii)
      injury that is already too severe to be reversible.

      Purpose : to determine whether or not the urine concentration of TIMP2*IGFBP7 may distinguish
      patients with high risk of persistent or transient AKI during the early phase of septic
      shock.
