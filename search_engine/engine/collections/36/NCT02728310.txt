      post-operative analgesia following a range of surgical orthopaedic procedures. Pain
      management by infusion of local aesthetic into wounds was found to improve pain, reduced
      opioid use and side effects, increase patient satisfaction, and shorten the hospital stay
      when compared to placebo or no treatment, but actually it was not definitively proven that
      wound infiltration provides additional analgesic or outcome benefit in the setting of a
      comprehensive multimodal analgesic approach. The hypothesis of this study is that a
      consistent amount of Levobupivacaine 0.5% for LCWI and LIA could provide a more extended
      postoperative analgesia for post-operative incident and rest pain with a better
      post-operative recovery and rehabilitation following THA, in the first 72 hours after
      surgery.
