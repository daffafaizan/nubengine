      been reported positive. Yet, the prevalence of the infection in French healthcare workers
      remains unknown as it mostly reflect symptomatic infections.

      Also, the prevalence of infection was reported being higher in male healthcare workers, and
      in those having patients' facing roles. However, the impact of the level of exposure to
      SARS-CoV-2, the use of personal protective equipment and hospital organization to prevent
      infection and spread remains unclear.

      Our study aims to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among French healthcare
      workers after the first wave of the pandemic. It also aims to explore the impact of the type
      of occupations and the level of exposure to the viruses on the seroprevalence of infection.
