      after consent is obtained to one of four groups. Anxiety will be assessed preoperatively
      using the modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale. Children will be accompanied by one
      parent to MRI scanner where monitors are applied. All children will have anesthesia induced
      with nitrous oxide and oxygen followed by sevoflurane until IV is established. Thereupon,
      they will be managed by their randomization assignment. The propofol pump will be concealed
      at all times. If propofol was used, it will be disconnected from the patient and residual
      propofol in the line flushed so prevent unblinding the patient's assignment. A blinded
      observer will be present to evaluate the patient when emergence begins. The single blinded
      observer will follow the patient from the MRI scanner through recovery room evaluating vital
      signs as well as emergence delirium (using the PAED scale). A PAED score > 12 at any time
      during emergence period will confirm the diagnosis of emergence delirium. After discharge
      from hospital, a post-discharge questionnaire will be completed at 12, 24 and 48 hours after
      discharge. All parents will be called to retrieve the questionnaire results after 48 hours
      after discharge from hospital.
