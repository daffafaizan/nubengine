    
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the
      onset/progress/resolution of pneumonia and the levels of Procalcitonin, a prohormone whose
      concentrations fluctuate in response to bacterial infection.
