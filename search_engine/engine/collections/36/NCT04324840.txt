      of CC-90010 in combination with adjuvant TMZ to estimate the MTD (Maximum tolerated dose)
      and/or the RP2D (recommended Phase 2 Dose) of CC-90010 as adjuvant therapy. After two dose
      escalation levels (or earlier as decided by the Safety Review Committee ) are assessed as
      safe and tolerated in the Adjuvant Therapy dose escalation, the Concomitant Therapy dose
      escalation will start, exploring escalating oral doses of CC-90010 in combination with
      concomitant TMZ+RT, to estimate the MTD and/or the RP2D of CC-90010 as concomitant therapy.

      The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010
      administered at or below the MTD determined for the Adjuvant Therapy and the Concomitant
      Therapy in Part A, in expansion cohorts of approximately 20-30 evaluable subjects each, in
      order to further define the RP2D. Parts A and B will consist of three periods: Screening,
      Treatment, and Follow-up periods.
