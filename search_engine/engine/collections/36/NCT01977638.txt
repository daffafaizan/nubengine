      2mg/day). Dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 phase 1 scheme. Adverse
      experiences will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events, version 4.0. Dose escalation will continue until dose limiting toxicity is
      encountered in >1/3rd of patients at any dose level. The dose level below this will be
      determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. Patients will be treated, at the discretion of
      the Principal Investigator, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the
      withdrawal of consent. At the maximum tolerated dose a further 20 patients, defined by tumour
      HR23B expression will be enrolled.
