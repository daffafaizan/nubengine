      prednisone is the optimally tolerated dose when used as maintenance therapy following
      autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. II. Compare the
      response rate in patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the progression-free and
      overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to age (60 and over vs under 60). Within 60-100 days after autologous stem cell
      transplantation, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      lower dose oral thalidomide daily and oral prednisone every other day. Arm II: Patients
      receive higher dose thalidomide daily and oral prednisone every other day. Treatment
      continues for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3 months, and then at time of disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients (20-40 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 17-21 months.
