    
      This clinical trial was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
      The local authorized clinical trials ethics committee approved the protocol and consent forms
      (Afyon Kocatepe University Clinical Trials Ethics Committee, 2011-KAEK-2 2017/172). Between
      2015 and 2016, 38 pseudophakic participants were enrolled in this study. After providing
      information to patients about the disease and treatment, patients predicted to show adherence
      to treatment, were enrolled in the study.

      Detailed ophthalmological examinations of all subjects were performed prior to Nd: YAG laser
      posterior capsulotomy intervention. Anterior chamber parameters of cases with PCO were
      measured Measurements of IOP, anterior chamber parameters, visual acuity, Slit-lamp,
      gonioscopy and fundus examinations, and measurements of central macular thickness (CMT),
      choroidal thicknesses (CTs), and MPOD were performed after maximal pupil dilatation.

      Proposed procedure, including risks, beneÔ¨Åts, and alternatives were discussed with all
      subjects, and all participants signed of informed consent form.

      Choroidal thicknesses were recorded as subfoveal CT (SCT), nasal CT (NCT) and temporal CT
      (TCT).

      MPOD measurements were subsequently made by using luminance differential thresholds test.
      After measurements a refractive surgery specialist carried out Nd: YAG laser posterior
      capsulotomy interventions to patients who were decided to applying Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy.

      All examinations and measurements were repeated and recorded at 1st week, 1st and 2nd month.
