      over 550, 000 deaths, >12 million infections and an economic toll in the trillions of dollars
      to date. The urgent need for a global vaccination program to control this pandemic has
      prompted the development of several vaccines.

      Preliminary reports from few trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vaccines have
      been published (2-4).

      However, no trials have yet reported the long-term post-vaccination immune response that
      would potentially determine the necessity and timing for booster doses of the vaccine.

      Therefore, this study is designed to assess the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and G at
      several time points after the first and the second dose of the vaccine.
