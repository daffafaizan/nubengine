      morphological features. Centrally located cytoplasm granulation (CLCG) is one type of
      cytoplasmic dimorphism exhibited by oocytes that could be linked to pesticide exposure with a
      significant risk of decreased ICSI outcomes.

      This retrospective study included 633 women who were part of an intracytoplasmic spermatozoa
      injection (ICSI) program between 2009 and 2011. The participants lived in the Picardy region
      of France and had been exposed to pesticides. The participants were divided in two groups
      based on prevalence of oocytes with CLCG (LCLCG [n= 83]: low prevalence of oocytes with CLCG
      under 25%. HCLCG [ n= 68]: high prevalence of CLCG over 75%). The embryological and clinical
      outcomes were analysed for both groups and were calculated using the difference between the
      two values. The included population in the investigator's retrospective study consisted of
      633 couples who attended a reproductive medical center and who were part of an ICSI program
      between 2009 and 2011.
