      (PEPA-Poly Ester Poly Arylate synthetic co-polymer membrane) decreases undernutrition (often
      associated with inflammation) and consequently morbidity, comparing one year mortality in
      patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), with severe Protein-Energy Wasting (PEW), treated
      with dialysis using a non-adsorbent synthetic membrane (Polysulfone or Polyethersulfone)
      versus an adsorbent membrane (PEPA).
