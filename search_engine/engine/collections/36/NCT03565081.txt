      band resistance exercise training, significant reduction was observed in their body weight,
      BMI, and regional extremities fat mass and percentage. Regarding the functional performances,
      there were also significant improvements in their hand grip strength, 3 meter timed up and
      go, 30 seconds sit to stand, and 2-min step up tests, as early as the 8th week of training.
      Balance function achieved significant improvements after 16 weeks of training.
