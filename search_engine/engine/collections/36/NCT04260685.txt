      Assuming mean and standard deviation of mean arterial pressure in lidocaine group versus
      esmolol group is 90±27.9 versus 73± 22.5 so the sample size will be 70 (35 in each group )
      using Open Epi program with confidence level 95%, power of test 80% All patients will be
      hospitalized and visited a day before the surgery, full history with physical examination and
      routine investigation will be done, the nature and complications of the study will be
      explained in detail to the patient and informed written consent will be obtained from every
      participant.

      All patients will be kept nil orally 6 hours before the operation. All surgeries will be done
      by the same surgeon to decrease observer's bias. The surgeon and the outcome assessor
      (anesthesiologist collect the data) will be blinded to study drugs.

      Using computer generated randomization table, each group consists of 35 patients.
