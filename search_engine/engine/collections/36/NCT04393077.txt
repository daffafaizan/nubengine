      responsibilities in the control, prevention, care, and treatment of its spread. In this
      period, they provided the necessary health practices for suspicious or confirmed COVID-19
      patients in the front lines and under harsh conditions, which are generally long and tiring.
      It is clear that infectious disease outbreaks have a psychological effect on the general
      population, and especially on health workers. The social distance required to prevent
      outbreaks is a key factor in disease management while causing social and psychological
      effects.

      2.1. Design A randomized controlled experimental research design. The study complied with the
      guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist.

      2.2. Participants This study will conduct with nurses working in a university hospital
      located in Istanbul between May 2020 and June 2020, working in the care of COVID-19 patients.

      2.5. Measures The data will be collected with the Introductory Characteristics Form, the
      positive units of distress scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Burnout
      Inventory. The investigators created our data collection forms using Survey Monkey, which
      provides electronic self-access and prevents data from multiple entries from the same person,
      making it easier to collect and track data. Confidentiality will be guaranteed by completely
      disabling electronic and IP address records to obtain anonymous replies.
