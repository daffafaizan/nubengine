    
      Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of moxibustion treatment for patients with osteoarthritis
      of the knee, with respect to relieving pain, improving the dysfunction and improving their
      quality of life as well.

      Design: A multicentre, double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized controlled clinical study
      will be performed in China. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to moxibustion
      group (real moxibustion plus placebo gel) and the control group (diclofenac sodium gel plus
      sham moxibustion) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in both groups will receive 12
      sessions of real/sham moxibustion in 4 weeks at 3 acupoints (ST35, EX-LE4, ST36 ). Either
      diclofenac sodium gel or placebo gel will be applied 4 g per knee 4 times daily for 4 weeks.
      The whole study period is 13 weeks, with a 1-week run-in period, 4-week treatment phase, and
      8-week follow-up phase. The primary outcome measure will be the change of the global scale of
      the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at the end of the
      course. The secondary outcomes include the change of other subscales (pain, stiffness, and
      function) of WOMAC, Visual Analogue scale (VAS) and Patient Global Assessment (PGA). Safety
      will be assessed at every visit.
