      collaborative study carried out by the University Hospitals Centre for Nursing and Care
      Research (UCSF) and the Finsen Center (Oncology and Hematology Clinics) of the Copenhagen
      University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen, Denmark. The project draws in cancer
      patients who have undergone chemotherapy and who are now disease-free or at a stable phase in
      their illness and have good prognoses.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a 12-month rehabilitation program
      comprising supervised and structured physical exercise training (body conditioning;
      strength-building; relaxation; massage), patient education and coaching combined with a
      home-based physical exercise group component and will include a control group. Groups of
      12-15 patients will be formed (mixed genders; different oncological and hematological
      diagnoses) who will train together once weekly during the intervention period. Participation
      in a training program with peers is seen as a positive motivational factor that stimulates
      and challenges the patient through physical activity, to use his/her own resources to
      establish sustainable coping strategies.
