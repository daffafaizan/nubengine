    
      AMT-130 is an investigational, single administration gene therapy intended to modify the
      disease course for HD. Preclinical studies have shown that AMT-130 lowers huntingtin protein
      and is associated with decreased progression of Huntington disease signs in animal models.

      This 5-year trial consists of a blinded 12-month Core Study Period to evaluate the safety and
      potential impact of AMT-130 on disease progression and an unblinded 4-year Long-Term Period
      with periodic follow-up visits to evaluate the safety of AMT-130 and disease progression in
      treated individuals. Following completion of the 12-month blinded post treatment follow-up
      period, subjects will be individually unblinded. Once the crossover has been activated after
      review of data by the DSMB and FDA, subjects randomized to the imitation (sham) procedure who
      continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (including adequate MRI striatal volumes) will
      be allowed to crossover to receive AMT-130 treatment.
