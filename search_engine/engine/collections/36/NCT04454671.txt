      techniques have been proposed. Neuromodulation techniques through the application of an
      analgesic electric current using a needle as an electrode, are increasingly used in the
      treatment of pain.

      In this study, the investigators will compare whether the application of a neuromodulation
      technique is more effective than applying the dry needling technique in isolation.
