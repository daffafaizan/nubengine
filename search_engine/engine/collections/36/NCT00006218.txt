      advanced malignancies. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose
      of this treatment in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this
      treatment in these patients. IV. Determine the tumor response in these patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously
      over 96 hours. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response receive treatment for 1 course past
      the course in which the complete response was documented; patients with partial response may
      receive treatment for up to 1 year; and patients with stable disease may receive treatment
      for up to 6 months. During the accelerated phase of the study, cohorts of 1 patient each
      receive escalating doses of 3-AP until one patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
      or 2 different patients experience grade 2 toxicity during any course. When the accelerated
      phase ends, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
