      ablation and an antiandrogen. These patients are typically asymptomatic and have minimal or
      no radiologically evident disease by standard bone and CT scans. Therapeutic options are
      limited, with 3rd line hormonal treatments generally providing only brief durations of
      benefit in a small minority of patients. Chemotherapy is effective, but the role of this
      somewhat toxic approach in the asymptomatic patient is debatable. In addition, patients
      suffer from the long-term side effects of androgen ablation such as muscle wasting, decreased
      strength, decreased sexual functioning, and impaired cognition. If the hypothesis that
      androgen replacement can inhibit cancer growth in androgen insensitive patients is correct,
      such treatment would not only delay disease progression but could also improve quality of
      life. If the hypothesis is incorrect and androgens actually stimulate growth, the
      consequences are unlikely to be catastrophic since the selected population has only a minimal
      disease burden.
