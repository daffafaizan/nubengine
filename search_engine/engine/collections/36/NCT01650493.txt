    
      Objective is to evaluate the demineralization and remineralization effects of two
      experimental fluoride containing dentrifices on enamel and root surface lesions compared with
      a control dentrifice.

      Study is a partially randomized, 3-period cross over study involving 30 subjects who need a
      full-coverage crown on a posterior tooth. Each subject will use each of the study dentrifices
      over 3 months according to a randomization scheme. Subjects will brush daily with the
      assigned dentrifice unsupervised. Subjects will each have two provisonal crowns for use
      during the study. These crowns will contain three hard tooth tissue sections located at
      interproximal sites. The three tooth tissue slabs will consist of an artificial enamel caries
      lesion, an artificial root caries lesion, and a sound root. After removal, the tooth slabs
      will be evaluated using polarized light and photomicrographs for changes in area and depth of
      lesions.
