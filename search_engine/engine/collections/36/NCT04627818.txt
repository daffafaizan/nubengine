      differential diagnosis. This causes a delay in the diagnosis with risk of long lasting
      symptoms and adverse effects on the reproductive function. However, the diagnosis can be made
      more accurately with improved diagnostic tools. Moreover, minimally invasive surgery allows
      for preservation and potential improvement of fertility in these women.

      The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of the clinical implications
      (including reproductive problems and obstetric complications), appropriate diagnostic tools
      and correct surgical treatment of Mullerian anomalies.
