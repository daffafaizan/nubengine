      metabolism to appropriate times of the 24 hour day. Chronic circadian rhythm disruption
      predisposes individuals to metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes.
      Conversely, maintaining a daily rhythm of feeding and fasting cycles sustains a robust
      circadian rhythm which improves cellular bioenergetics and results in improved metabolism.
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a specific feeding-fasting pattern in which feeding is
      restricted to 8-12 hours a day.

      At the beginning and end of the study (which will be three months in duration), the following
      parameters will be measured: height, weight, body mass index, percent body fat, waist/hip
      circumference and blood pressure. Blood sugar levels will be monitored continuously for 2
      weeks at a time at the beginning and end of the study using a continuous glucose monitor.
      Additionally, a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be used to collect
      information about body composition. Information will be collected about the mitochondria with
      a muscle biopsy. Participants will use a smartphone application (called myCircadianClock
      (mCC), developed by the Salk Institute) to keep track of food/beverage intake and will wear a
      wrist-worn actigraphy device to monitor physical activity levels and sleep.
