    
      This study is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence study in adult
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive up to four separate single oral 300 mg doses of a
      coated microsphere (cMS) formulation of crizotinib. Period 1 through Period 3 will evaluate
      the effect of food, and, the effect of multiple doses of a gastrointestinal acid reducing
      agent, esomeprazole, in fasted state, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of crizotinib cMS. Period
      4 will evaluate whether apple sauce or orange juice may reduce the effect of multiple doses
      of esomeprazole on the PK of crizotinib cMS, if there is an effect.
