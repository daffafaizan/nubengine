      in the MESA study in New York City, without contraindications to MRI or PET procedures. Those
      eligible will have one brain PET scan with 11C-PIB within 12 months of a brain MRI. Vital
      signs will be checked prior to injection of 11C-PIB, 10 minutes after the injection, and
      again at the completion of the PET scan. The primary outcome measure for amyloid will be
      whole brain 11C-PIB SUVR. The relation between exposure groups and amyloid in the brain will
      be analyzed using linear regression.
