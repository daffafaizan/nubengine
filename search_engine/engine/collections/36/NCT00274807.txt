        -  Determine the complete remission rate in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
           treated with induction chemotherapy comprising mitoxantrone hydrochloride, cytarabine,
           and etoposide.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen when given to patients with newly
           diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on
      days 1-3, cytarabine IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 and 8-10, and etoposide IV
      continuously over 72 hours on days 8-10. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
