      likely corresponds to the neural correlates for mental imagery of movement. Such cognitive
      aspects of motor control may underlie other cognitive functions, such as mental calculation.
      The present transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study is aimed to characterize the
      relation between cognitive processing and motor control. Based on our previous results from
      neuroimaging experiments, we hypothesize that the ability to process information for motor
      imagery would primarily be associated with the dorsal lateral premotor context (PMd) as well
      as the posterior parietal cortex. TMS will be used to disrupt neural processes in the limited
      brain structures under the coil for a short period of time (virtual lesion study). For this
      proposal, 15 healthy subjects will perform number-guided motor execution/imagery tasks. Both
      tasks will be guided by 10 visual number stimuli presented at a rate of 1.0 Hz. For the test
      TMS stimuli, a paired TMS stimulation will be delivered to either M1 or PMd100 (to) 150
      milliseconds after 5 of the visual number stimuli. The frequency of TMS stimulation will be
      1.0 Hz on average for a short period of time (10 seconds). Measurement will be accuracy of
      the task performance under the TMS stimulation as compared with a sham condition. We expect
      that the TMS stimulation to PMd will interfere with the performance of motor imagery more
      than the performance of motor execution. The present study will clarify the neural correlates
      underlying the ability of imagining movement, which is now drawing growing attention in the
      neuroscience community.
