      tolerability as well as pharmacokinetics after single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple
      ascending doses (MAD) of RQ10 in Parkinson's disease patients. A secondary objective will be
      to assess the impact of single doses of RQ10 on gastric emptying in Parkinson's Disease
      patients as well as the effects of RQ10 on gastroparesis symptoms. The expected results of
      this exploratory phase Ib study will allow deciding about whether to proceed with further
      development of RQ10 in Parkinson's Disease patients ("go-no go") and help design a formal
      phase IIa "proof of concept" study by informing repeat-dose selection and possible effect
      sizes in Parkinson's Disease patients.
