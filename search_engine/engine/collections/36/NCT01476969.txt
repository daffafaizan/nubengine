      group consisted of three 5-minute cycles left lower limb ischemia, induced by inflating a
      blood pressure cuff on the lower limb to 600 mmHg with an intervening 5 minutes of
      reperfusion, during which time the cuff was deflate; the control group consisted of placing
      an uninflated cuff on the left lower limb for 30 minutes. The postconditioning protocol was
      applied after the aortic cross-clamping. The clinical data of inotropes requirement,
      drainage, ventilation and intensive care time will be recorded. Venous blood samples will be
      taken perioperatively for detecting concentration of troponin I (cTnI), Myocardial enzyme,
      Renal function, Cystatin c, and High-sensitivity c-reactive protein(HS-CRP).
