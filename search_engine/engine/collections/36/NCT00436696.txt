      I. Perform a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNP) and SNP haplotypes.

      II. Identify true disease-associated SNP alleles using a customized genotyping platform
      enriched for haplotype analyses in an independent sample set.

      III. Validate disease-associated SNP alleles and haplotypes in a final independent sample
      set.

      IV. Identify neuroblastoma predisposition genes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to presence of
      high-risk disease (yes vs no) and MYCN amplification (yes vs no).

      DNA samples are derived from participants' banked blood or uninvolved bone marrow. A whole
      genome scan of DNA samples is employed to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs). The candidate SNPs are investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to
      identify 10-20 true disease-associated alleles. The disease-associated alleles are again
      investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to validate 5-10 disease-associated
      SNPs. SNPs are then analyzed for heritable predisposition.

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing. A certificate of confidentiality
      protecting the identity of research participants in this project has been issued by the
      Children's Oncology Group.
