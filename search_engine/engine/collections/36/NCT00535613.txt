      anesthesia. It consists of confusion, disorientation, delusions, and hallucinations. It
      manifests in children as some combination of restlessness, moaning, inconsolable crying,
      involuntary physical activity, and thrashing about. This puts patients at risk of injuring
      themselves or their caregivers, causing bleeding or disruption of their surgical repair, and
      pulling out IVs and drains. It can be difficult to maintain necessary vital sign monitoring
      in these agitated patients, and constant one-on-one nursing is often required. When emergence
      agitation occurs, all members of the healthcare team, and the parents report dissatisfaction
      with the quality of the child's recovery from anesthesia.

      Propofol is a commonly used intravenous anesthetic agent. Studies have compared continuous
      infusions of intravenous propofol versus inhalational sevoflurane for the maintenance of
      anesthesia. These have shown a significant decrease in the incidence of emergence agitation
      in the patients who received the propofol infusions. This proposed study will investigate the
      effects of a single bolus dose of propofol at the conclusion of a sevoflurane inhalational
      anesthetic.
