      I. To ascertain whether patients treated by sublobar resection (SR) + brachytherhapy (BX)
      have longer time to local recurrence as compared to the patients treated by SR (local
      recurrence includes recurrence within the same lobe or hilum [N1 nodes], or progression at
      the staple line after treatment effects such as scarring have subsided).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare procedure specific morbidity and mortality between study arms. II. To compare
      overall survival and failure-free survival between study arms. III. To assess freedom from
      regional or distant recurrence. IV. To assess the effect of histological or cytologic
      positive resection margins on time to local recurrence.

      V. To determine the effect of brachytherapy on quality of life (QoL). VI. To determine the
      effect of brachytherapy on pulmonary function.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo open or thoracoscopic sublobar resection comprising either a wedge
      resection or anatomical segmentectomy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo surgery as in arm I. Patients also undergo intraoperative
      brachytherapy comprising iodine I 125 implant at the resection margin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36
      months and then yearly for 2 years.
