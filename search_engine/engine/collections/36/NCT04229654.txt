      Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. One was a university prenatal diagnostic center and the other
      a private one. The centers were purposively selected to represent different characteristics
      of the level of care and demographic characteristics. The research instrument was a 26-item
      questionnaire divided into three sections. The first section contained 12 questions designed
      to assess women's ideas about the purpose and limitations of the scan (yes/no). The second
      was on expectations before the scan while the third dealt on women´s perception of the fetus
      during the ultrasound examination. All women attending for a mid-trimester anomaly scan were
      invited to fill out the first two parts of a pretested structured questionnaire before the
      scan and after the ultrasound examination, the third part of the questionnaire concerning
      their experience of the scan session was completed and collected.

      Additionally, the questionnaire included demographic questions (age, parity, educational
      level, marital status). The source of the questionnaire items was interviews with experts.

      Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional review board. The anomaly
      scan was performed by fetal-maternal specialists between 18 and 24.6-week gestation.

      All data were recorded and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      version 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were used for the
      sociodemographic data. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or
      Fisher exact test. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to
      delineate the factors associated with a higher knowledge level. A p-value <0.05 was
      considered statistically significant.
