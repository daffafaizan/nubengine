        -  To determine the accuracy and sensitivity of intraoperative lymph node mapping with
           isosulfan blue and sentinal node biopsy (SLN) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

        -  To compare molecular and immunohistochemical methods for detection of micrometastases in
           the SLN and primary tumor and evaluate the clinical outcome.

        -  To evaluate the clinicopathological utility of hematogenous micrometastases in
           predicting disease recurrence in CRC.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive isosulfan blue subserosally around the primary tumor for sentinel
      lymph node (SLN) identification and SLN(s) are marked. Patients undergo a standard colon
      resection as planned to include the SLN(s) and regional lymph nodes.

      Lymph nodes removed during surgery are analyzed within 30 days after surgery. Routine
      pathologic analysis (H&E) are performed on all lymph nodes (SLN and non-SLN) removed.
      Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for cytokeratin antibodies AE-1/AE-3 or MAK-6 are
      performed on all lymph nodes negative by H&E. Multimarker PCR (MM PCR) are performed on all
      SLNs. Blood samples are collected at baseline and then periodically for 4 years for MM PCR to
      detect circulating tumor cells and standard tumor markers (e.g., CEA).

      After surgery, patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years.
