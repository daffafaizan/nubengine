    
      The study will include three phases (pilot feasibility n=10; pilot acceptability/efficacy
      n=40; RCT n=140), with 190 men at risk for HED, RSB, and SAB. Participants in the RCT will be
      randomly assigned to either the computer-based program or services as usual at 2 large public
      universities in the midwest and southwest U.S. The three study phases will address the
      following aims:

      AIM ONE: Examine the feasibility of the computer administered personalized feedback and
      cognitive training approach (Phase I; n=10), and the acceptability and efficacy of individual
      intervention components based on skills assessments and interviews at 1-month follow-up
      (Phase II; n=40). Data from Phases I and II will be used to modify and streamline the
      intervention prior to the RCT (Phase III).

      AIM TWO: In an RCT (n=140), evaluate whether the prevention program impacts cognitive
      training and personalized feedback targets at 1-month follow-up, relative to services as
      usual (SAU). Cognitive training targets include (a) enhanced focus on women's affect; (b)
      reduced focus on women's non-affective cues; and (c) correction of over-perceptions of
      women's sexual interest. Personalized feedback targets include (a) increased readiness to
      change; (b) increased perceptions of risk; and (c) reduced misperceptions of peer attitudes
      and behaviors.

      AIM THREE: Evaluate whether the prevention program shows short-term effects on attitudinal
      (e.g., rape supportive and sociosexual attitudes) and behavioral outcomes (SAB, HED, and RSB)
      at 1-month follow-up.
