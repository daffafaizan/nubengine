      patches of non-scarring hair loss. People living with AA are at higher risk of developing
      depression, anxiety and social phobia than the general population (Koo et al., 1994;
      Ruiz-Doblado, Carrizosa, & García-Hernández, 2003). Interventions that aim to reduce
      engagement in negative appearance related thoughts, and attentional bias towards negative
      self-referential information may be helpful for this population.

      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) offers one potential method of reducing social
      anxiety in individuals with AA. MBC is a structured eight-week programme that has been
      recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence as an effective intervention to
      reduce the risk of relapse in depression since 2009.

      The main aim of the current study is to investigate whether an MBCT course can reduce social
      anxiety in individuals with AA. A single-group case-series design will be adopted, whereby
      participants will act as their own control; data collected from participants during and after
      they have received the intervention will be compared to data collected before they have
      received the intervention. Semi-structured interviews will be carried out at the end of the
      study to investigate participants experiences of the intervention.

      The investigators predict that MBCT will reduce social anxiety in individuals with AA. More
      specifically, the hypothesis are:

      (i) participants will experience an increase in mindfulness during the intervention period,
      relative to the baseline phase and this will be maintained at follow-up

      (ii) increases in mindfulness will be associated with decreases in social anxiety, anxiety
      and depression, and increases in dermatology quality of life.
