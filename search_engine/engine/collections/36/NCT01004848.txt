      diabetes among overweight adults with pre-diabetes. However, proven effective interventions
      have not been sustained or disseminated in community settings. A community-academic
      partnership aims to employ community-based participatory research to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, peer-led diabetes
      prevention intervention that promotes weight loss.

      People who develop diabetes go through a period when they have "pre-diabetes". In clinical
      settings, overweight adults with pre-diabetes who reduce their weight by 5-10% can reduce
      their risk of developing diabetes by 55-60%. To date, there are no studies testing the
      effectiveness of peer-led, community-based programs in achieving diabetes prevention through
      weight loss.

      We will identify and enroll 400 overweight (BMI > 25) adults with pre-diabetes in East Harlem
      and randomized half into a community-based, peer-led lifestyle education program that teaches
      simple ways to lose weight.
