      the study will be from those who have voluntarily scheduled appointments for contact lenses.
      During the patient's initial visit, the study will be explained to them and they will have a
      choice of whether or not to take part with no penalty for refusal. If a patient agrees to
      take part in the study, they will have their HOA measured with the LADARWave instrument prior
      to contact lens insertion and right after contact lens insertion. Patients will then return
      for visits both one week and one month later for follow up measurements at the time of their
      regularly scheduled visits.
