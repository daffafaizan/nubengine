    
      Malignant melanoma is one of the most common cancer forms worldwide and WHO estimates 132,000
      new cases each year. The incidence rate vary up to 150-fold between different regions and
      ethnicities, the highest rates are found in emigrated Caucasian populations (e.g. Australia
      and New Zealand).

      There are few therapy alternatives for advanced malignant melanomas. At present, dacarbazine
      (Dacarbazine Medac®) is the most commonly used therapy. Immunotherapy with IL-2 and IFN is an
      alternative, but it is associated with multiple side effects. Hence, there remains a
      considerable need for alternative treatments.

      By using SentoClone®, autologous tumour-reactive lymphocytes are expanded and infused to the
      patient, where they have the opportunity to seek out and attack the primary tumour and
      metastases. The first step is to identify the tumour draining lymph node(s), which is done in
      parallel to surgical resection of the primary tumour or metastasis. The sentinel and/or
      metinel node(s), the initial meeting place between tumour antigen and the immune system, are
      further dissected and collected during the surgery.

      In this study SentoClone® will be compared with Dacarbazine Medac® and Temodal® which are
      currently regarded as standard first-line therapies in advanced malignant melanoma.
