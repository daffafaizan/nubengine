      first-line management of unresectable stage III NSCLC patients, regardless of the EGFR
      mutation status. But the 5-year survival rate is not satisfying. Previous clinical studies
      showed there is a potential value but also a high risk of radiation pneumonia in treatment
      regimens of combination TKI with radiotherapy. This study intends to explore the safety and
      efficacy of concurrent almonertinib, a new third-generation EGFR-TKI drug, with radiotherapy
      in EGFR-sensitive mutated locally advanced NSCLC patients.
