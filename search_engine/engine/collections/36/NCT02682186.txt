      maximal pain of the first 6 post-operative hours after prosthetic breast expansion. The pain
      will be assessed according to a numerical scale. This prospective, randomized, double blind
      study will include 92 patients successively during two years, randomized into two arms : Pecs
      group and Control group, which will respectively have the block, and no block. The rest of
      the anesthesic and surgical care will be identical.

      An intervention team (which will be different from the anesthesic team), will be alone with
      the patient for 15 minutes, and will realize or not the Pecs blocks according to the previous
      randomisation so that all caregivers taking in charge the patients as well as research
      observers will be blinded.
