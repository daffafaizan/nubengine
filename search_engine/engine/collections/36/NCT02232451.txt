    
      Selective cannulation of common bile duct (CBD) by insertion of a guide-wire seems to be
      associated with fewer complication and post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) rate than the
      conventional biliary tree access with contrast injection even if results are conflicting. The
      aim of our study is to test a new guide-wire (loop-tip wire) with a loop in the tip for the
      prevention of PEP and biliary tree access, in PEP high-risk patients.

      Type of study: Multicentric, prospective and randomized trial

      Patients: PEP high-risk patients underwent ERCP for benign biliary pathology

      Number of patients: 320 patients (160 for each group)

      Aim:

      Primary end point: The evaluation of the incidence of PEP . Secondary end point: The
      evaluation of CBD percentage cannulation.
