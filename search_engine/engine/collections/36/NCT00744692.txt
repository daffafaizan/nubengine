      purpose of eradicating malignant cells. Additionally, these regimens exert varying degree of
      immunosuppression/immunoablation that aids in reducing the likelihood of rejection by host
      hematopoietic cells. However, myeloablative /immunoablative regimens have also been
      associated with significant regimen related toxicity (RRT) and regimen related mortality
      (RRM) that may cause death in up to 20% of patients and significantly higher rate of severe
      organ dysfunction or failure. While most of these RRT occur typically in the first 100 days [
      e.g. VOD (veno occlusive disease), pulmonary or intracranial hemorrhage, multiorgan failure
      (MOF)], there are significant long term toxicities of TBI and/or chemotherapy including
      growth impairment, gonadal dysfunction/failure, hypothyroidism, cataracts, neurocognitive
      impairment, and second malignancies.

      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of attaining acceptable rates of donor
      cell engraftment (>25% donor chimerism at 180 days) following reduced intensity conditioning
      (RIC) regimens in pediatric patients < 21 years receiving cord blood transplantation for
      non-malignant disorders.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To describe the pace of neutrophil and platelet recovery

        -  To evaluate the pace of immune reconstitution.

        -  To determine the treatment related mortality, overall survival and disease free survival
           by days 100 and 180 post-transplant

        -  To describe incidence of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) (II - IV) and chronic
           extensive GVHD

        -  To describe the incidence of grade 3-4 organ toxicity

        -  To evaluate long-term complications, such as sterility, endocrinopathy, and growth
           failure

        -  To evaluate the incidence of late graft failures at 2 years post-transplant
