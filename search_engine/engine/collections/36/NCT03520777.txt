      for participation in the study. Patients who consent to the study will be given a chance to
      work with one of three creative artists (visual artist, creative writer, therapeutic
      musician). The artist will be selected according to a pre-determined schedule, and the arts
      intervention may last up to 90 minutes. Subjects will be asked to complete study
      questionnaires before and after the arts intervention.
