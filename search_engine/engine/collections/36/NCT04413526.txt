      integrated applications develop rapidly, surgery is still the best way to remove the tumour
      lesion. Traditional ways that have curative removed tumours in three methods, which are liver
      resection, liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

      As for primary liver cancer, surgery, and RFA are both effective and safety, but for the
      complexity of end-stage liver cancer, surgical resection may not remove the tumours alone.
      Surgical resection with radiofrequency ablation therapy for intractable liver cancer is a
      kind of active plan. The therapy can eliminate the tumour, maximize the protection of patient
      liver tissue, reduce operation damage, reduce the incidence of complications, and improve
      patients quality of life after surgery.
