      INV_MMR vaccine) in contrast to the US standard of care (M-M-RÂ®II, Merck and Company,
      referred to as COM_MMR) when both are used as a second dose in subjects 7 years of age and
      older. In this study, the INV_MMR vaccine may be administered as a second dose to persons
      with either a history or formal documentation of at least one dose immunization with any MMR
      vaccine. This study is intended to support licensure of GSK's MMR vaccine in the US.
