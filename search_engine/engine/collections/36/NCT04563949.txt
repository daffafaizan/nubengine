    
      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to follow clinically suspicious lesions to
      determine the outcome including surgical biopsy, removal, monitoring, etc. for up to 2 years
      after lesion identification.

      Subjects will be consented and enter the trial to have their suspicious lesion(s), biopsied
      via DermTech's adhesive patch biopsy and assessed with DermTech's non-invasive PLA, and
      followed up to 2 years per standard of care. Lesions must be photographed and/or the site of
      the lesion anatomically defined to permit follow-up of the lesion(s) and lesional site(s)
      during future visits.

      Subjects will be followed per standard of care for lesion biopsy, excision, treatment and/or
      monitoring. Other than DermTech's non-invasive PLA of the lesion(s) no other study procedures
      will be performed and subjects will be treated according to the standard of care. The
      subject's medical management team should use standard of care, visual assessment changes
      (i.e., "ABCDE") and physician judgment for suspicious lesion characterization and monitoring
      when planning the subject's course of treatment.
