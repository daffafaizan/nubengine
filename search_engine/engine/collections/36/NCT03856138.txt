      burden, and the pediatric population is especially vulnerable to these gastrointestinal
      infections. According to a World Health Organization report in 2003, the median incidence of
      diarrhea for all children age under 5 years was 3.2 episodes per child-year, and this number
      has not changed significantly since 1980s. In Taiwan, the enteric pathogens associated
      mortality is low, but the social burden and economic costs are substantial because of the
      high incidence.

      Intestinal microflora are able to use the substances consumed in the diet: bacteria can
      transform complex polysaccharides and monosaccharides in short-chain fatty acids. Short-chain
      fatty acids are a source of energy for colonocytes and directly affect the storage of lipids
      and the absorption and metabolism of food, creating the so-called 'second meal effect'.

      Qualitative and quantitative alterations of commensal flora may result in various
      gastrointestinal and extraintestinal diseases. One of the first interactions these bacteria
      have when interacting with the intestinal epithelial cells lining the GI tact.

      The first aim of this study is to evaluate the role of intestinal microbiota and their
      relationship with childhood gastroenteritis. The second aim of this study is determining the
      inflammatory markers (such as fecal TNF-Î±, interleukin -6, calprotectin, lactoferrin) on the
      host of childhood gastroenteritis. The investigators try to seek to gain an advanced
      understanding effect of intestinal microbiota and fecal inflammatory marker in the childhood
      gastroenteritis.
