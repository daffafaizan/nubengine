    
      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the expression of PSMA via 18F-DCFPyL PSMA-based PET/CT in patients with
           metastatic HER2-negative, AR-positive breast cancer. Expression of PSMA will be
           quantified using PSMA-based PET imaging using a novel agent, 18F-DCFPyL, as a
           non-invasive imaging biomarker of tumor neovasculature in HER2-negative, AR-positive
           metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  PSMA PET will be compared with the expression of PSMA in CTCs and diagnostic metastatic
           tissue from patients with HER2-negative, AR-positive metastatic breast cancer.

        -  PSMA expression will be correlated with clinical benefit (objective response and
           progression-free survival) to bicalutamide and ribociclib for patients enrolled in
           NCT03090165.
