      activating EGFR-mutations, have resulted in the licensing of gefitinib in this indication.
      This offers the prospect of a true personalized treatment of patients with NSCLC.
      Implementation of such a personalized treatment strategy is dependent both on the
      availability of adequate tumor samples for the EGFR-mutation analysis and on the timely
      reporting of the mutation analysis results. Ideally the results should be available in all
      patients within 2 weeks of the analysis request.
