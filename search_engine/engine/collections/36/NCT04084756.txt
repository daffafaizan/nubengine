      Converging evidence suggests that suicide prevention efforts may be enhanced by explicitly
      including family members in treatment, however no couple-bases suicide-specific interventions
      exist.

      The study's objectives are to test the effect of the Couples Crisis Response Plan (CCRP), a
      targeted single-session couples intervention, on suicide ideation among military service
      members and Veterans, and to understand how the use of the CCRP impacts suicide risk during
      the period of time immediately post-discharge from a psychiatric inpatient unit. The CCRP
      will be compared to an active control condition (mental health education).

      The primary aim is to compare the effect of the CCRP to an active control condition on
      suicide ideation in the 6 months following treatment among military service members and
      Veterans who have been psychiatrically hospitalized for acute suicide risk and their
      partners. The CCRP is specifically adapted for use with partnered service members at elevated
      risk for suicide. A secondary aim is to determine how use of the CCRP skills impacts suicidal
      ideation over time and identify the role partners play in encouraging use of the plan and
      managing suicide risk.
