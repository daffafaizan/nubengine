      for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). It will take place at Penn
      State Hershey. Half of the single occupancy rooms of the 5th and 7th floor will be assigned
      to contain the antimicrobial surface at five locations: bed rails, overbed table, door
      handles, counter, and arm rests of bedside chair. The remaining rooms will serve as controls.
      Data on HAIs will be gathered for all the patients admitted to the rooms during the duration
      of the study. After 45 days the rooms will be flipped so that test rooms become controls and
      control rooms become test rooms. The duration of the study will be for a minimum of 90 days.
