    
      Primary objective: To determine if non-cytotoxic oral THU-Dec when combined with nivolumab
      can improve objective response rates of nivolumab

      Secondary objectives:

      i) To evaluate clinical efficacy end points and toxicity of oral THU-Dec when combined with
      nivolumab ii) evaluate the induction of a T-cell response in patients with metastatic NSCLC
      iii) To evaluate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of resistance and predictive biomarkers for
      response to nivolumab

      Study design: This is a Phase 2 randomized two arm trial of nivolumab alone or in combination
      with THU-Dec, in previously treated patients with stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC). The primary goal of this trial is to compare the efficacy of oral THU-Dec as a way
      of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response to nivolumab to that of nivolumab alone. The
      primary efficacy endpoint is overall RECIST-defined response. To accomplish this goal 60
      patients will be randomized 2:1 to THU-Dec plus nivolumab or nivolumab only respectively.
