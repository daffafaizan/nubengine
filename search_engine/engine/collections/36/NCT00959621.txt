      meaning that 10-15% of all pregnancies will end in an abortion; 1/10 of these abortions are
      recurrent (1 % of all pregnancies). In about half of women with habitual abortions (HAB)
      hereditary (F V Leiden, F II (prothrombin) mutation, Protein C, S deficiency and
      anti-thrombin) or acquired (antiphospholipid antibodies) thrombophilia are observed. Efficacy
      of the medical treatment of patients with a history of HAB has yet to be completely
      demonstrated. We have recently shown that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as effective
      as unfractionated heparin in prevention of thromboembolic complications in pregnant women and
      causes less bleeding complications (UFH) and has no osteoporotic effect. LMWH could be safer
      than UF-heparin during long treatment periods (7-8 months).

      Study design: Randomised placebo controlled multicenter study.

      Centers: Helsinki (2), Oulu (1), Stockholm (1), Leiden (1)

      Number of patients per study: 90 patients per group, 270 altogether

      Timetable: Starting 2/2002, finishing 31.12.2007

      Drugs:

      HABENOX 1 and 2: Study groups Group 1 : Enoxaparin 40 mg+ placebo, Group 2: Enoxaparin 40
      +ASA 100 mg, Group 3: ASA.

      HABENOX 3: Study groups Group 1: Enoxaparin 40 twice daily+ placebo o.d., Group 2: Enoxaparin
      40 mg twice daily +ASA 100 mg o.d.

      Time frame: one year since entering the study with primary end-points:livebirths (> 37 weeks
      of gestation) and premature livebirths (> 24, but <37 weeks of gestation)

      Primary end-points: Pregnancy outcome: livebirths (>37 weeks of gestation), premature
      livebirths (> 24, but <37 weeks of gestation) Secondary end-points: Bleeding complications,
      intrauterine growth retardation (<-2SD), pre-eclampsia, abruptio placentae,

      Inclusion criteria: Three or more consecutive abortions of first trimester (ad h 12+6 wks) or
      two second trimester abortions (ad h 13 wks-23+6 wks) or one third trimester abortion (24
      weeks or more) with one first-second trimester abortions. Depending on the thrombophiliatest
      (tested before pregnancy) result the patients will included in one of the three sub-studies:

        1. HABENOX 1: those who have one thrombophiliatest positive: F V Leiden (heterozygote) or
           protein C or S deficiency, or anticardiolipin antibodies (low to moderate level),
           prothrombin gene mutation, or high level of F VIII.

        2. HABENOX 2: those with thrombophilia test negative

        3. HABENOX 3:those with "high risk" thrombophilia: positive combined thrombophilia, F V
           Leiden (homozygote), anticardiolipin antibodies (high level >40) , lupusanticoagulant,
           or AT III deficiency.

      During next pregnancy the patient, with inclusion criteria fulfilled, will be asked to sign
      informed consent and she will be allocated into one of the three treatment groups. The
      treatment will be started before 7 weeks of gestation. At baseline and follow-up visits
      plasma, serum and 20 ml morning urine will be frozen (analysed later for antithrombin,
      protein S, C, APC ratio, PAI1, PAI2, U-PAR, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex,
      CRP, TNFalpha(+ receptor), ICAM, VEGF(+receptor), urinary stabile metabolites of thromboxane
      and prostacyclin.

      Follow-up: US/Doppler + obstetric check-up at 8, 10, 14, 18, 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks of
      gestation Ending: In the group of combined medication, tablets will be stopped at 36 weeks of
      gesta-tion. LMWH will be started in all patients after delivery and continued 6 weeks
      postpartum.
