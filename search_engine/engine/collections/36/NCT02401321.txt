      I. Test the feasibility of the study protocol, including recruitment and retention.

      II. Assess the short-term impact of the intervention on standardized measures of
      behavioral-emotional adjustment of spouse caregivers and diagnosed women on depressed mood,
      anxiety, quality of marital communication, perceived spousal support, and spouse caregivers'
      skills and self-confidence to manage the emotional toll of the illness on themselves and the
      ill partner.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and spouse caregivers complete the Taking Care of Her Program comprising 5
      telephone-delivered intervention sessions over 45-60 minutes every 2 weeks. The intervention
      sessions are designed to provide training for spouse caregivers and patients to better manage
      the impact and emotional toll of recently diagnosed ovarian cancer, including its impact on
      their interpersonal communication and support about the cancer.
