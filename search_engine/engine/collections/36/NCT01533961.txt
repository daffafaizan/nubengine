    
      The present study is designed to obtain safety, tolerability and PK data after single oral
      administration of increasing doses of SCYX-7158 in healthy male sub-Saharan African subjects.
      This study will also assess the impact on the relative bioavailability of SCYX-7158
      administered as a capsule after single oral dose administration.

      The study will be divided in 3 different parts. Study Part I will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study with SCYX-7158 administered as
      a capsule.

      A other part is scheduled to evaluate the impact of activated charcoal intake on the PK
      characteristics of SCYX-7158 and determine the most adapted treatment schedule for charcoal
      to enhance SCYX-7158 elimination while allowing a sustained drug exposure likely to be
      therapeutically active.

      A last part is planned to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a new formulation (tablet) of
      SCYX-7158 in healthy male volunteers
