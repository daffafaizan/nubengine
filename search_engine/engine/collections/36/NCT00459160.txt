      that had a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg prior to going to the operating room will be
      randomized to one of two groups. The randomization will take place at the operating room
      door. The first group will have a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg (LMAP)
      and the second group will have a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg (HMAP).
      Before the operating room and in all other aspects of their care the patients will be treated
      as per standard of care. Patients will then be followed to determine if there is a difference
      in 30 day survival between the two groups. Secondary outcome measures will be Sequential
      Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, APACHE II, ARDS, ICU length of stay, myocardial
      ischemia, stroke, acidosis, coagulopathy by conventional labs and thromboelastogram,
      estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, Glasgow Outcome Score, the presence of
      leukocyte apoptosis, the serum level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and G-CSF, and
      the rate of infectious complications (VAP, UTI, Wound infections). Blood samples (20 ml each)
      will be taken at three time points: prior to randomization, immediately after the end of
      resuscitation protocol, and 24 hrs after randomization. Blood will be examined for the
      presence of leukocyte apoptosis and levels of IL-6 and G-CSF.
