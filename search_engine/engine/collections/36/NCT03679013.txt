      (IHVI) will be the setting of this clinical trial involving two groups of subjects and
      comparing the opiate based standard of care regimen currently adopted (Group 1) at the IHVI
      with a treatment group (Group 2). Group 2 will receive a scheduled multimodal pain regimen
      consisting of PO (pro ora [oral]) Gabapentin paired with intravenous Acetaminophen. Opioids
      will be available for breakthrough pain in the treatment group for pain scores greater than
      4. The outcomes of total opioid consumption and minimum/ maximum pain scores will be assessed
      at the 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and PRN (pro re nata [as the situation demands])
      timepoints. Assessment will include amount of opioids consumed in both groups as well as
      number of requests for breakthrough pain medication in Group 2.

      Minimum and maximum pain scores in all study groups will be assessed via Numeric Rating Scale
      (0-10) as per Inova Health System (IHS) policy; 'Pain Management for the Adult Population',
      at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and PRN with opioid requests in all groups and opioid
      administration follow up within one hour as per IHS inpatient medication administration
      policy. Follow up medication administration scores will not be recorded as part of study
      results.

      Secondary assessments will include the incidence of ileus both during hospitalization,
      increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT), post-operative
      tidal volumes as assessed by incentive spirometry as compared to pre- surgical values, time
      from Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU) arrival to extubation in both groups, and the
      effects of an opioid based regimen versus an opioid sparing regimen on cost of medication and
      hospitalization.

      The investigators hypothesize that a scheduled opioid- sparing pain regimen consisting of
      intravenous Acetaminophen IV APAP and PO Gabapentin for 48 hours post- operatively will
      reduce opioid consumption while maintaining adequate pain relief as evidenced by pain scores
      less than two (2), and a reduction in opioid consumption, and that reduced opioid consumption
      will lead to a reduction in the incidence of ileus, an opioid related side effect, no
      increase in AST/ALT, post-operative tidal volumes as assessed by incentive spirometry
      comparable to pre- surgical values, and demonstrate a positive effect on the cost of
      medication and hospitalization.
