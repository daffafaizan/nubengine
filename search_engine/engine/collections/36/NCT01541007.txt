      experimental scheduling of 10 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive weeks of a 6 week cycle. In both study
      arms the planned cumulative dose of cabazitaxel at week 18 is 150 mg/m2. Our study aims to
      evaluate differences in the total received dose in relation to the planned dose as a measure
      of which of the 2 treatment schedules is superior.
