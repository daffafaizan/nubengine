      risk for a variety of psychiatric disorders, lasting into adulthood. This increased risk is
      accompanied by a set of biological changes ranging from changes in cortical thickness to
      endocrinological changes. At a behavioral level, children with complex PTSD (developmental
      trauma disorder) show severe and long-lasting negative effects. Such children exhibit a wide
      range of symptoms: affect dysregulation, attention difficulties, impairment in interpersonal
      relationships, aggressive and dissociative behaviour, disturbances of cognition.
      Corresponding alterations in neural networking and brain development are well studied.
      Although evidence-based treatment approaches for children with non-complex PTSD exist,
      complex-traumatized children have no well-evaluated treatments. Furthermore, early
      intervention can prevent the chronification and exacerbation of symptoms and promote social
      adaptation and participation.The following topics will be addressed: (1) brain development
      (Multimodal MRI (mMRI) including anatomical (T1-MPRAGE, T2-FLAIR, DTI-Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging) and functional MRI measurements (resting-state functional MRI, task fMRI (presenting
      affective pictures according to the International Affective Picture System, IAPS), EEG); (2)
      alterations in neuroendocrinological systems involved in stress regulation (Cortisol,
      Oxytocin, Vasopressin); (3) behavioral symptoms; (4) cognitive functioning; (5) attachment
      representations of children and their primary caregivers;
