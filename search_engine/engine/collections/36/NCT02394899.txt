      arise suddenly and call on the problem solving skills of their parents. They are also at risk
      of neurocognitive delays; these may become evident during the pre-school years. Previous
      research by this group has demonstrated improved developmental outcomes after parental
      interventions incorporating play techniques in high risk and healthy pre-school children. The
      aim of the study is to determine usefulness in children with SCD of similar developmental
      interventions augmented by lessons in problem solving.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Parents of all infants with Hb SS (homozygous
      sickle cell disease) or SÎ²0 -thalassemia disease identified by newborn screening during the
      initial year of the study will be invited to participate. They will be randomized to
      intervention or control. Parental stress, infant's development and hemoglobin levels will be
      measured at recruitment and again after six months. The intervention will occur during
      monthly Penadur (intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin) visits and will include supervised play
      with their children using an inexpensive toy and participation in solving a problem which may
      arise as they parent their child with SCD. At the end of the study, all control dyads will
      also be given the toys used in the intervention. All parents will be given the results of
      their children's developmental assessments and appropriate referrals made if deficits are
      identified.

      The study is minimal risk. Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality.
      Respect for, and the maximum protection of the best interests of the research subjects will
      be maintained.
