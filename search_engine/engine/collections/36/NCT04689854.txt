    
      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of select interbody implant devices in patients who undergo interbody fusion
      surgery of the cervical spine. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet eligibility
      requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. These patients will
      present with degenerative conditions in the cervical spine that are amenable to surgical
      treatment and will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled into the study,
      subjects will undergo interbody fusion surgery using one of the NuVasive interbody implant
      groups based on the surgeon's standard of care. At least 150 subjects (a minimum of 75
      patients in each implant group) will be enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after the
      surgery.
