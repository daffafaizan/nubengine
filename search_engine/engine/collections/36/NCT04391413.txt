      high procedural complexity. The clinical sequelae of a suboptimal result in this context may
      be severe, and thus, it is recommended that patients with left-main lesions be considered for
      imaging-guided interventions by means of optimal coherence tomography (OCT) in non-ostial
      left main lesions. The investigators have previously demonstrated in a randomized trial of
      patients undergoing PCI for a lesion responsible for non ST elevation acute coronary
      syndromes that OCT provides useful clinical information beyond that obtained by angiography
      alone, and OCT-guidance for angioplasty in these patients yielded a significantly higher
      proportion of patients with an optimal functional result after stenting. In this context, the
      aim of the present study is to evaluate whether OCT-guided left-main angioplasty is superior
      to left main angioplasty guided by fluoroscopy alone, as assessed by fractional flow reserve
      (FFR) measured after stent implantation. Eligible patients must be aged 18 years and over,
      admitted for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD); AND
      present an angiographically significant non-ostial lesion of the left main stem requiring
      angioplasty with drug eluting stent implantation.
