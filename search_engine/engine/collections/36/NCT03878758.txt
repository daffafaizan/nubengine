      abdominally delivered by Subjects via a reusable insulin pen device. All pen needles will be
      attached by study staff. The pen needle outer cover and inner shield will be removed prior to
      subject use so that they will not be able to identify which device they are using. Subjects
      are to perform 12 injections into the abdomen (6 pairs of injections). Pairs of injections
      will be evaluated and each pair will contain one BD Nano™ PRO and one comparator pen needle.
      Within the 12 injections, each comparator will be injected twice, therefore each subject will
      experience 2 of each of the following pairs:

      BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs Artsana Insupen Extr3me 4mm x 33G x 2 BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs
      Artsana Insupen Extr3me 3.5mm x 34G x 2 BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs Simple Diagnostics Comfort
      EZ™ 4mm x 33G Each Subject will evaluate pain after completion of each pair of injections
      using a 15 cm relative Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
