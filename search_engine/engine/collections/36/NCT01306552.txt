      Despite wide spread tobacco prevention campaigns and initiatives, the proportion of children
      and adolescents who smoke remains high, especially in Germany. Current research indicates
      that comprehensive strategies, especially with a parental involvement component, appear to be
      the most effective school-based smoking prevention programs.

      A popular smoking prevention program in the city of Berlin is the Karuna interactive show
      jumping course "Still smoking or already alive?" ("Rauchst du noch oder lebst du schon?"
      Mitmach - Parcours). This parcours was designed to teach facts about smoking and its
      health-damaging effects, its negative effects on physical appearance, to promote
      communication and to enhance participants' awareness of social pressure and their
      self-efficacy to deal with these situations. No study to date has evaluated its effectiveness
      in reducing smoking rates among participating students. The study aim is to test the
      effectiveness of an interactive combined student-parent intervention in 7th graders regarding
      the reduction of smoking rates among secondary school children aged 12-15 compared to no
      smoking prevention intervention using self-reported questionnaires. In addition, it will be
      tested whether the program that involves the combination of a student and a parent
      intervention is more effective in the reduction of smoking rates in comparison to a program
      without a parental intervention.
