        -  Establish the efficacy of high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients
           with intermediate prognostic risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the PSA relapse-free survival rate of this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 4-5 days per
      week for at least 9 weeks.

      Patients are evaluated at least weekly during radiotherapy and at 2 and 4 months after
      treatment completion. Thereafter, patients are followed every 6 months for a total of 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
