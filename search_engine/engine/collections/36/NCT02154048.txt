      longest period of time with the least amount of side effects. One type of pain medication is
      called local anesthetic, which is a numbing medication that is injected in the area
      surrounding nerves to block pain. This injection is called a nerve block. Ropivacaine is a
      local anesthetic that is commonly used for nerve blocks and will be used in this study. The
      effects of ropivacaine may last for 8 to 12 hours after surgery. Recent research studies have
      shown that adding a medication called dexamethasone (a steroid) may increase the time that
      the nerve block will provide pain control. The purpose of this study is to see if adding
      dexamethasone to ropivacaine and injecting this around the nerves during a supraclavicular
      brachial plexus block increases the duration of pain relief as compared to both placebo
      control and systemic control groups.
