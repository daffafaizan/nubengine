      such as anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities.
      Various research groups could identify a beneficial effect of ACs in IBD and intestinal
      inflammation.

      A total of 112 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be screened for eligibility between
      0 and 28 days prior to baseline visit. At the baseline visit, subjects with moderate to
      severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score â‰¥6) and fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be randomized into two treatment arms (ACRE or placebo). Total duration of drug product
      administration will be 8 weeks (56 days) followed by a follow-up phase of 30 days.
