      patients may have a loss of vision in one eye; trouble with balance; double vision; numbness
      in the face; and tingling, numbness, or weakness in the arms or legs. Some CIS patients may
      develop MS, but others may not. Studies have shown that when CIS is accompanied by magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-detected brain lesions that are consistent with those seen in MS,
      there is a high risk of a second neurologic event and a diagnosis of MS within several years.
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of atorvastatin, an antihyperlipidemic, in the
      prevention of MS in CIS patients.

      This study will last 18 months. All participants must complete a 3- to 5-day course of
      corticosteroids at least 28 days before the baseline evaluations. This corticosteroid therapy
      must be initiated within 60 days of CIS onset. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive 80 mg of either atorvastatin or placebo by mouth daily for 12 months. Study visits
      will occur at screening and every 3 months thereafter until the end of the 18-month study.
      Blood collection will occur at selected visits, and other additional evaluations will be
      performed at Months 1 and 2. Selected participants will undergo MRI brain scans. Participants
      will be offered interferon beta-1a (AvonexÂ®), free of charge, if they develop disease
      activity. Participants will be instructed to report any change in their health status to
      their treating physician within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.
