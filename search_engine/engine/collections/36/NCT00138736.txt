      plays an important role in the innate immune system. MBL replacement in MBL-deficient
      children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia represents a new approach to lower the risk of
      febrile episodes, of hospital admission, of prolonged use of intravenous antibiotics and of
      severe infections.

      The aim of the Phase II study is to find evidence for the correct prediction of plasma levels
      of MBL necessary for clinical effects and biological efficacy, to confirm the dosage regimen
      needed to reach the required MBL plasma levels, and reconfirm the safety and lack of
      side-effects.
