      from Department of Medical Information, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Patients were
      excluded if they had stage I or II disease, no complete medical records, received treatment
      previously, or without concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Follow-up data is updated on October
      1st, 2015.The propensity score-matching (PSM) method was adopted to balance observed
      covariates between both groups. Propensity scores reflect the conditional probability that is
      intended to be uniform between patients received CCRT and IC+CCRT based on their baseline
      characteristics. Matching was performed based on nearest-neighbor matching, and comparing
      between CCRT and IC+CCRT patients were matched within their respective risk groups.
