      mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) with or without monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195
      in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (under 50 vs
      50 and over) and duration of previous complete remission (CR) (0-6 vs 7-12 months). All
      patients receive induction chemotherapy comprised of cytarabine IV over 2 hours, mitoxantrone
      IV over a maximum of 20 minutes, and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-6. On day 5 of
      induction, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive day
      6 of induction chemotherapy. Patients then receive monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 (MOAB
      HuM195) IV over 4 hours on days 6-9 or 7-10. Treatment with MOAB HuM195 repeats every 2 weeks
      for 2 courses (courses 1 and 2) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. During course 1, MOAB HuM195 begins 30 minutes to 24 hours postchemotherapy.
      Patients who do not achieve CR by day 70 of induction and show evidence of bone marrow
      progression (regimen failure (RF)) are taken off study. Patients without RF are assigned to
      one of two consolidation groups based on response: Group A (CR): Patients receive
      consolidation chemotherapy comprised of mitoxantrone IV over a maximum of 20 minutes on days
      1 and 2, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-4. Patients
      with New York Heart Association class II heart disease preconsolidation receive no
      mitoxantrone during consolidation. Patients receive MOAB HuM195 IV over 4 hours on days 4-7
      or 5-8. Treatment with MOAB HuM195 repeats every 2 weeks for 2 additional courses (courses 3
      and 4). During course 3, MOAB HuM195 begins 30 minutes to 24 hours postchemotherapy. Group B
      (partial remission (PR), hematologic improvement (HI), or stable disease (SD)): Patients
      receive MOAB HuM195 as in group A but no consolidation chemotherapy. Patients without RF
      after treatment on group A or B receive maintenance MOAB HuM195 IV over 4 hours on days 1-4.
      Treatment repeats every month for 8 additional courses (courses 5-12). Arm II: Patients
      receive day 6 of induction chemotherapy. Patients receive no MOAB HuM195 during the entire
      study. Patients without RF at day 70 of induction are assigned to one of two consolidation
      groups based on response: Group C (CR): Patients receive consolidation chemotherapy as in
      group A. Group D (PR, HI, or SD): Patients receive no further treatment. Patients may be
      eligible to receive MOAB HuM195 on PDL Study 195-302. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
