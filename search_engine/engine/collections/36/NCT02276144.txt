      obstetric complications, such as gestational diabetes (GDM) or preeclampsia (PE), we are able
      to offer systematic clinical results from determining the independent risk factor and
      developing a predictable model. Recently, obstetric complications, especially GDM and PE,
      have increased due to the growth of elder pregnancy. In addition, as liver dysfunction has
      been known to be an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood
      pressure and renal dysfunction, its clinical importance has risen. Metabolic syndromes, such
      as obesity, hypertension, type II diabetes and abnormal lipid profile, have been known for
      its importance in development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Considering abnormal
      liver function being an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high
      blood pressure and renal dysfunction in normal adult patients, we are able to predict that
      liver dysfunction might be a high risk factor of obstetric complications in pregnant women.
      In previous studies, the frequency of liver dysfunction in normal pregnant women was
      obtained.

      The purpose of this current study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome,
      abnormal liver function and non-alcoholic fatty liver in early pregnancy and the related
      risks of obstetric complications.
