      microvascular anastomoses in lieu of traditional suturing techniques. Each of these free
      flaps may be in individual patients or two anastomoses may be included in one patient.
      Historical controls will be used for comparison of complication rates of U-clip versus
      sutured anastomoses. Postoperatively, the study participants will be evaluated at 2 weeks
      (+/- 1 week) and at 3 months (+/- 1 month) follow up.
