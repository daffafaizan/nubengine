      it relates to breast drainage, to determine the proportion of women undergoing axillary
      lymphadenectomy at risk for lymphedema. II. To determine if blue lymphatics contain lymph
      node metastases. III. To evaluate the incidence of lymphedema and associated other surgical
      related quality of life in those undergoing this procedure as compared to the current
      standard of care.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PILOT PORTION: Patients receive isosulfan blue dye subcutaneously (SC) and then undergo
      reverse mapping-guided axillary lymph node dissection.

      RANDOMIZED PORTION: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive
      isosulfan blue dye subcutaneously (SC) and then undergo reverse mapping-guided axillary lymph
      node dissection. ARM II: Patients undergo standard axillary lymph node dissection and then
      receive isosulfan blue dye SC.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
