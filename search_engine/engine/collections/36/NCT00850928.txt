      utilizes prospective serial assessments. The enrolled 50 surgical subjects will be evaluated
      preoperatively and postoperatively over 6 time-points (preoperatively, inta-op, post op day
      1, post op day 7, three months and six months) using a widely accepted set of neurocognitive
      tests, multiple indices of functional recovery, as well as blood tests for plasma biomarkers
      of inflammation and Î²-amyloids. Enrollees will be divided in 2 groups: 25 patients with mild
      cognitive impairment (diagnosed by clinical assessment) and 25 normal elderly patients.

      The definition of normal elderly includes: 1). Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) < 3 and
      Mini-Mental Exam Score (MMSE) >27; 2). Performance on neurocognitive testing (including
      memory) that is within 1.5 Standard Deviation (SD) of the age matched normative data; 3). The
      informant interview confirming no functional impairment in the subject. The definition of MCI
      includes: self-reported memory and functional complains, a history of memory decline with
      functional changes that are corroborated by a knowledgeable informant, and a clinical
      interview resulting in a GDS=3 or higher and MMSE=26 or lower.
