      Primary

        -  Assess the contribution of MRI in accurately determining tumor size in women with ductal
           breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the sensitivity of MRI in detecting DCIS.

        -  Evaluate the contribution of mammography in accurately determining tumor size.

        -  Compare the contribution of MRI vs mammography in assessing tumor extension.

        -  Compare the contribution of MRI vs mammography in assessing dense breasts.

        -  Evaluate the morphology of DCIS by MRI.

        -  Evaluate the curve of dynamic MRI in assessing DCIS.

        -  Evaluate the impact of nuclear grade of DCIS by MRI.

        -  Evaluate the rate of revision surgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound imaging, unilateral
      breast MRI, and tissue sampling.
