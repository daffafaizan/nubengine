      symptoms during respiratory diseases. Chronic cough can be a disabling condition, apparently
      idiopathic or associated to pathology such as asthma, sinusitis with posterior discharge or
      gastroesophageal reflux.

      Factors susceptible to provoke or increase cough are well known, but inhibiting factors are
      much less known. Muscular exercise is thought to influence respiratory reflexes in a
      considerable and complicated way. For example, a bronchodilation is observed in healthy or
      asthmatic individuals, but recovery period frequently triggers asthma attacks. Effects of
      exercise on cough reflex are much less known.

      This study aims to determine the influence of muscular exercise on cough reflex in children
      and healthy adults.

      Highlighting the inhibition of cough reflex by exercise can have a significant effect on
      chronic cough patient care. There is actually no symptomatic treatment really effective
      without side effects.
