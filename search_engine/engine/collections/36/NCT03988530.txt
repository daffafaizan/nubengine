    
      This Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with
      open-label follow-up to identify the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a repeated-dose
      regimen of DPI 386 nasal gel (intranasal scopolamine gel) for the prevention and treatment of
      nausea associated with motion sickness. The study will have two arms: DPI-386 nasal gel and
      placebo nasal gel for Treatment Day 1. Treatment Day 1 will include 50 subjects per arm, for
      a total of 100 subjects (n=100). All 100 subjects from Treatment Day 1 will receive
      open-label DPI-386 Nasal Gel for Treatment Days 2-4 (50 of these were originally randomized
      to receive placebo prior to receipt of the investigational product.).

      Treatment Day 1 will be conducted aboard an ocean-going vessel to obtain data in an
      operationally relevant real world environment and within 30 days of Treatment Day 1,
      Treatment Days 2-4 will take place at the clinical site.
