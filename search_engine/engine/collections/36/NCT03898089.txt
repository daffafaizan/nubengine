      Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is the most widespread form of the low back pain. The
      NSLBP is called low back pain without recognisable specific underlying pathology. The
      lifetime prevalence of low back pain is up to 84%. The prevalence and burden the low back
      pain of increases with aging.

      The use of various methods of non-pharmacological and non-invasive especially exercise,
      mobilization, and manipulation in low back pain. Core stability exercise is a common exercise
      modality in the treatment of low back pain. Core stability exercises improve trunk strength
      and low back disability in elderly with NSLBP. However, the studies have showed that
      decreasing strength in the deep muscles (such as the transverse abdominis and multifidus) is
      accompanied by increased activation in the superficial muscles (such as the erector spina) in
      patients with low back pain. Therefore, myofascial release technique on superficial muscles
      can be effective in NSLBP.

      To the best of our knowledge, there is no randomized controlled study investigating the
      effect of the myofascial release technique combined with core stabilization in elderly with
      NSLBP. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the myofascial release technique combined
      with core stabilization exercise in elderly with NSLBP.
