      left with reduced walking capacity and significant disability. After stroke, individuals must
      relearn movements that have been disrupted due to damage to the brain, therefore, enhancing
      motor learning is critical to improving the rehabilitation of walking after stroke. In this
      project investigators will examine how individual factors influence motor learning after
      stroke and use this information to personalize post-stroke rehabilitation.
