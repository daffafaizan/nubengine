    
      A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively simple,
      manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD in patients with substance use
      disorders (SUDs). One hundred sixty outpatients with comorbid PTSD and SUDs from three VA
      facilities will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT for PTSD in conjunction with
      standard treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 80) or TAU only (n = 80).
