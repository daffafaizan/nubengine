      During day 3, 24-hour energy expenditure (including a second night of measurement) will be
      measured in the metabolic chamber. On this day, the participant will perform 2 bouts of
      physical activity on a stationary bicycle for 15 minutes each bout. This will give us a
      measurement of physical activity energy expenditure. On day 4, at 7 am, the participant will
      exit the metabolic chamber and will enter a different, smaller metabolic chamber for the
      measurement of energy expenditure in response to a meal. This measurement will start at
      approximately 8 am with assessment of the resting metabolic rate (45 minutes). The
      participant will then be given a high-fat meal replacement to consume over 10 minutes. Energy
      expenditure measurements continue in the metabolic chamber for a 6-hour period.
