      poor visual prognosis. Several treatments have been suggested, though there is still no
      standard therapy. CNV diagnosis will be based on fundus biomicroscopy (presence of serous
      retinal detachment with or without retinal hemorrhages), fluorescein angiography (FA)
      (presence of early phase hyperfluorescence with late phase leakage) and OCT findings
      (hyperreflective lesion related to a CNV complex with serous foveal detachment or
      intraretinal fluid with increased foveal thickness). Inflammation will be considered active
      if anterior chamber cells or optic disc leakage in FA is observed. Each patient will undergo
      a complete clinical exam, including best corrected visual acuity (VA) (Snellen charts). Once
      active CNV is identified, a loading dose of 3 injections of IV bevacizumab will be proceeded
      monthly and systemic immunosuppression will be introduced or intensified. After the first 3
      injections, the patient will be clinically examined and OCT will be proceeded monthly. The
      persistence of intra/subretinal fluid in the OCT will indicate one more IV bevacizumab
      injection. Immunosuppression status evaluation will be done at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of
      follow up and intensification will be done if inflammatory signs or persistence of
      intraretinal fluid is observed. Presence of intra/subretinal fluid and manual measurement of
      retina central foveal thickness (CFT) will be proceeded in horizontal scan by the same
      examiner.
