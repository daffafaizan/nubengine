      evidence for neurotoxic effects of anesthetics in animal models and a collection of
      epidemiologic studies in humans. Recent studies of anesthesia in fetal and neonatal primates
      are yielding more evidence of neurotoxicity associated with many common anesthesia and
      sedation techniques (e.g. propofol, etomidate, sevoflurane, desflurane and isoflurane). On
      the other hand, the data suggests that some alternative sedative agents, such as
      Dexmedetomidine, may not have the same neurotoxic effect.

      Children routinely undergo sedation for MRI scanning with large doses of propofol and other
      sedatives. Many of these scans occur at young ages when these children may be at risk of
      neurological injury from sedative exposure. In addition, these scans do not involve any
      stimulation - which could be protective against neurodegeneration.

      The investigators propose a pilot study to determine if a standard bolus dose and infusion of
      dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the dose of propofol (infusion) required for
      accomplishing an MRI. Based on previous work with the combination of propofol with
      dexmedetomidine for other procedures, we propose a standard dose of dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg
      bolus followed by an infusion at 1mcg/kg/hour). The investigators will augment this sedation
      with propofol (1mg/kg followed by 100mcg/kg/min infusion).

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of low dose propofol with dexmedetomidine will be
      effective undergoing MRI while sparing exposure to the high dose of the sedative.
