    
      This is a 3-year open-label multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing arrhythmia
      burden in patients with Fabry cardiac disease. This is an observational study, but with
      implantable loop recorder (ILR) insertion at recruitment and removal at end of trial for the
      intervention arm.

      Null hypothesis: There will be no difference in the identification of arrhythmia between
      patients following standard care compared to patients following standard care but with the
      addition of ILR monitoring.

      Beyond the proposed hypothesis, data collected will be used to inform whether ILR in FD will:

        1. Reveal a high burden of unrecognised arrhythmia

        2. Lead to frequent treatment modification (anti-coagulation, pacemaker and ICD
           implantation, ablation)

        3. Enable the development of FD specific risk prediction algorithms

        4. Identify predictive power of new (Troponin, BNP, lysoGB3, T1 and T2 mapping) and
           traditional biomarkers
