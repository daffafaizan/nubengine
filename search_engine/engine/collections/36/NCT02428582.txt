      potentially underdiagnosed condition caused by fixed stenosis or occlusion of in most
      conditions at least one of the three gastrointestinal arteries. Atherosclerosis is a
      predisposing factor for CGI. Clinical symptoms can vary widely. Typical symptoms are
      postprandial abdominal pain, unintended weight loss and food avoidance. But atypical
      abdominal pain such as exercise related pain, diarrhoea and nausea can also indicate CGI. The
      use of endovascular techniques for revascularization of chronic stenosis and occlusions of
      the gastrointestinal arteries has rapidly increased and endovascular therapy with stenting
      has become the most common method chosen for revascularization, having replaced open surgery
      with its associated morbidity and mortality. Nowadays standard care in significant chronic
      gastrointestinal ischemia is the use of bare metal stents although the patency of these
      stents is not very high. According retrospective data the patency of covered stents is
      significantly higher compared to bare metal stents. One likely explanation for these lower
      restenosis and re-intervention rates observed with covered stents is the established barrier
      to tissue ingrowth. Only recent retrospective data about this topic is available but the
      expectancy in this prospective study is that the patency of covered stents is indeed higher
      compared to metal stents.
