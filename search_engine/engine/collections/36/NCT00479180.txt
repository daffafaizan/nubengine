    
      Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, Phase I/II clinical trial of Vascugel™ treatment
      vs. Gelfoam® in patients undergoing creation of an arteriovenous graft or fistula for
      hemodialysis access.

      All patients will undergo preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging and/or angiography (whatever
      is the standard of care at the research site) of the vein and artery to evaluate the optimal
      site for vascular access placement in the upper extremity.

      Patients will be examined with Doppler ultrasound or standard of care immediately after
      surgery to verify patency of the AV graft or fistula.

      During the follow-up period, each patient will undergo a physical examination and imaging of
      the vascular access at specified intervals.
