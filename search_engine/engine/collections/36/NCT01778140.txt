      "Patient-specific" reminders yields superior performance than that with
      "Non-patient-specific" reminders in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.

      A 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed by cluster randomization using
      physicians as the unit of allocation. Physicians in 3 university medical centers will be
      randomly assigned into 1) patient-specific arm with Anti
      Contrast-Induced-Nephropathy(Anti-CIN) reminder, 2) non-patient-specific reminder arm, and 3)
      the control arm without any reminders, respectively.

      The patient-specific alert, Anti-CIN system, is designed as a real-time CDSS implementation
      on CPOE for monitoring physician's contrast-enhanced CT and IVP orders. Computerized pop-up
      reminders provide the patient-specific encounters with optimal decision options when patients
      are at a high CIN risk or patients with unknown risk factors are encountered.
      Non-patient-specific reminders always pop up no matter whether the patient is at a high risk
      or not.
