      tubercle of the calcaneus, and 10% of the population will at some points in their life
      experience this condition. Accumulated loading of the plantar fascia seems to relate to
      development of PF, as it is commonly seen in runners and those who are overweight, and number
      of daily steps or simply time of standing has been shown to be a predisposing factor for PF
      development ( Orthosis and glucocorticoid injections are 2 widely used treatments and in most
      clinics the standard treatment, despite the fact that a recent Cochrane review found limited
      evidence for treatment of plantar heelpain.

      Once the condition gets chronic the response to several kinds of treatment is less
      predictable. However it has been demonstrated that endoscopic surgery for plantar fasciitis
      using a deep-fascial approach was successful in individuals with an active sports anamnesis,
      and all patients returned with this treatment to full athletic activities within 8-15 weeks.
      This high succesrate is not seen in conservative treatment with decrease in activity,
      training and injections of glucocorticosteroid, eventhough they had shorter disease duration.
      Therefore the investigators think it would be interesting to offer this minimal invasive
      operation to patients much earlier in the disease, especially as there is no reported severe
      sideeffects .

      However, surgery is very seldom compared with results of other treatment modalities, and no
      randomized studies exist on the effect of operation vs the normal conservative
      standard-treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to compare in a randomized controlled trial the effect of
      endoscopic operation with the standard conservative treatmentprotocol with training
      supplemented with 1-3 injections of glucocorticoids in patients with chronic plantar
      fasciopathia.
