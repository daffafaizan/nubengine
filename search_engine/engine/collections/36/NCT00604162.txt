      with a dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol will allow for more efficient
      evaluation of the colonic mucosa. This is expected to improve the capability of the GivenÂ®
      Diagnostic System to detect colonic pathologies and to serve as a diagnostic and screening
      tool for colonic disease.

      This study is designed to compare capsule colonoscopy and colonoscopy procedures in detecting
      colon abnormalities. Note that the physician performing the capsule endoscopy and reading the
      capsule videos and the physician performing the colonoscopy were unaware of each other's
      findings until completion of the examinations and reports (assessor-blind).
