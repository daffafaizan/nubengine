      characterization of pulmonary function and functional class, CPET was performed using
      incremental and constant work rate protocols. Subjects performed 6-8 weeks of IMT using a
      handheld inspiratory loading device (ThresholdÂ®, Philips); both exercise tests were then
      repeated. Patient-centered outcome data were collected before and after IMT (RAND-36
      assessment and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class).
