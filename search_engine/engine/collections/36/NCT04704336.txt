      with HIV (PWH) in Africa, this population now has higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) -
      mortality than the general population largely due to an increased burden of hypertension. In
      Nigeria, the acute shortage of physicians limits the capacity to control hypertension among
      PWH at the primary care level where the majority receive treatment. This study proposes the
      use of practice facilitation (PF) - which will provide external expertise on practice
      redesign and a tailored approach to delivery of the evidence-based task strengthening
      strategy - to integrate hypertension into the HIV care model. Using a clinical-effectiveness
      implementation design, we will evaluate the effect of a PF strategy for integrating an
      evidence-based intervention for hypertension (HTN) control into HIV care among 960 patients
      with uncontrolled HTN in 30 primary health centers (PHCs) in Nigeria. Study is in 3 phases:
      1) a pre-implementation phase that will develop a tailored PF intervention for integrating
      TASSH into HIV clinics; 2) an implementation phase that will compare the clinical
      effectiveness of PF vs. a self-directed condition (receipt of information on TASSH without
      PF) on BP reduction; and 3) a post- implementation phase to evaluate the effect of PF vs.
      self-directed condition on the adoption and sustainability of TASSH. The PF intervention
      comprises: (a) an advisory board to provide leadership support for implementing TASSH in HIV
      clinics; (b) training of the HIV nurses on TASSH protocol; and (c) training of practice
      facilitators, who will serve as coaches, provide support, and performance feedback to the HIV
      nurses
