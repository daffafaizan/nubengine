      monitoring and response system to track and further treat unrelieved symptoms for patients
      living at home during chemotherapy treatment as compared with usual care which consists of
      patients calling their oncology provider for symptom concerns. For the intervention group,
      the monitoring system is paired with automated delivery of self-care suggestions tailored to
      the specific symptom profile the patient reported and also automatically 'alerts' the study
      oncology nurse practitioner about unrelieved symptoms. The nurse practitioner, utilizing
      national evidence based symptom guidelines for symptoms at moderate to severe levels calls
      the patient and further assesses and intensifies symptom treatment. The usual care group
      called the system daily and reported similar data but did not receive self-care coaching or
      notification of unrelieved symptoms to the study nurse practitioner. On every call, the usual
      care group was told to follow the standard procedure of calling their oncology providers for
      symptom concerns. The specific aims of the study are to test whether the symptom monitoring
      intervention reduces presence, severity and distress of 11 symptoms. The symptoms monitored
      in the project were nausea/vomiting, pain, sore mouth, numbness & tingling, diarrhea, trouble
      thinking, trouble sleeping, changes in appearance, depressed mood, anxiety, and fatigue.
      Secondary outcomes tested whether the intervention improved functional performance and
      decreased interference with activity when compared with the usual care attentional control
      group. Other aims compare self care strategies utilized and their perceived effectiveness and
      document patient satisfaction with the monitoring system.
