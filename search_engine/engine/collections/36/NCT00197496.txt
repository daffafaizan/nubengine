      regarding post-hip fracture rehabilitation is sparse. A recent Cochrane review suggested that
      the potential for enhancing the recovery of mobility in hip fracture patients with treadmill
      gait retraining warrants further research in this area. Body weight supported treadmill
      training (BWSTT) is a novel approach to retraining ambulation, and has been successfully
      implemented in other patient populations. BWSTT may be ideal for retraining gait after hip
      fracture, as it is task-specific and alleviates the demands of maintaining equilibrium while
      walking skills are trained. The objectives of the proposed pilot study are to evaluate the
      feasibility and tolerability of using BWSTT as a gait retraining strategy in individuals who
      have experienced a hip fracture, and to explore whether it can improve mobility, fear of
      falling and function. Participants' feedback will be sought regarding the BWSTT experience
      for use in planning future clinical trials, to be submitted to CIHR. Quantitative outcomes
      will be assessed at baseline, and after 4 weeks of training 3-5 times per week. Outcome
      measures include: the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, health-related quality of life
      (SF-36), Falls-Efficacy Scale and the 2-minute walk test. Based on previous research
      experience with the frail elderly, we anticipate that many patients will be receptive to
      rehabilitation in the form of BWSTT. We hypothesize that BWSTT after hip fracture will result
      in significant gains in ambulatory capacity, as well as improvements in quality of life and
      functional independence. In addition, we anticipate that BWSTT will prove to be a feasible
      and effective gait retraining strategy.
