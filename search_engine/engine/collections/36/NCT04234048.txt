      dose limiting toxicities due to the excipients used in previous formulations has impeded its
      therapeutic utility. The product formulation in the current study (ST-001) is a phospholipid
      suspension of nanoparticle sized fenretinide. The current study is a Phase 1 trial in
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in order to determine the safety
      profile, pharmacology, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ST-001 nanoFenretinide. Targeted
      T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-Cell NHL) indications include: (1) Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL) including mycosis fungoides (MF) and SÃ©zary Syndrome (SS); (2) non-cutaneous T-cell
      lymphoma (non-CTCL) subtypes: angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma (PTCL) not otherwise specified (NOS); and, follicular T-cell lymphoma (FTCL) as
      defined in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies.
