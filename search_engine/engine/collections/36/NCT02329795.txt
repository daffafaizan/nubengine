      time-to-progression and/or overall survival. The aim of this study is to explore the
      feasibility of establishing an individualized response model, that, based on several
      morphologic, physiologic and metabolic parameters extracted from computed tomography (CT),
      positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is able to predict
      the tumor response at the level of an imaging voxel, using machine learning techniques.

      Imaging modalities include MRI, PET/CT with 18F-fluroethyltyrosine (18F-FET), and PET/MRI
      with 64Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM).
