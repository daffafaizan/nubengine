      for respiratory physicians. Many patients present recurrent pneumothorax. Thoracic closed
      drainage is a basic and effective treatment to pneumothorax. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease(COPD)is one of the main causes of spontaneous pneumothorax. Many patients precluded
      the performance of surgery for poor pulmonary function. In China, economical load is another
      reason for patients who are unwilling to surgery. So we want to seek a cheap, effective and
      safe method for refractory pneumothorax. We will adopt three methods in this study.
      Conventional thoracic closed drainage was continuously used in the control group, autologous
      blood was perfused to the target pulmonary segment in the treatment A group and self-made
      silicone bronchial plug was placed to the target pulmonary segment in the treatment B group.
      The leak position was detected by biliary lithotomy balloon. Main outcome measures: duration
      of continuous leakage. Secondary end-points included the lung reexpanded, hospital costs and
      hospital stays etc.
