      the accuracy of clinical assessment as compared to the assessment of pulmonary mechanics in a
      population of children intubated and mechanically ventilated for bronchiolitis. Before and at
      20 minutes following a routinely scheduled albuterol treatment, measurements of pulmonary
      mechanics obtained as part of the child's clinical care will be compared to a healthcare
      provider's simultaneous clinical assessment. Three healthcare providers (a nurse, physician,
      and respiratory therapist) will assess the child during these time periods. Data regarding
      their observations will be recorded using a data collection tool (attached). Healthcare
      providers will be blinded to each other's assessments and to the measurements of pulmonary
      mechanics. Using sensitivity and specificity analysis, the healthcare provider's assessment
      of response will be compared to the standard assessment of response according to the
      measurements of pulmonary mechanics. A precision of the estimate of sensitivity and
      specificity will be calculated. Clinical characteristics of the child will be recorded. Each
      child may be assessed on up to three occasions if that child receives greater than 1 dose of
      albuterol. However, no more than 3 providers will assess the child at one time.
