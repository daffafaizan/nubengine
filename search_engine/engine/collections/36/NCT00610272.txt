      Group A Treatment of single site of painful bone metastasis:

      Arm 1: 4 Gy single fraction; mandate first retreatment if moderate or severe pain persists or
      recurs (as measured by categorical pain scale or VAS greater than 50 mm), >4 weeks after
      initial RT) retreat with 8 Gy single fraction; second retreatment is optional if moderate or
      severe pain recurs (as measured by categorical pain scale or VAS greater than 50 mm), retreat
      with 8 Gy after > 4 weeks

      Arm 2: 8 Gy single fraction, mandate first retreatment if moderate or severe pain persists or
      recurs (as measured by categorical pain scale or VAS greater than 50 mm), >4 weeks after
      initial RT) retreat with 8 Gy single fraction; second retreatment is optional if moderate or
      severe pain recurs (as measured by categorical pain scale or VAS greater than 50 mm), retreat
      with 8 Gy after > 4 weeks

      Group B Treatment of multiple bone metastasis: lower hemibody radiotherapy (LHBI):

      Arm 3: 8 Gy in a single fraction; retreatments > 4 weeks, using local RT fields to sites of
      residual or recurrent, moderate or severe pain with a single fraction of 8 Gy) ; second
      reirradiation with 8 Gy using local RT fields optional (at discretion of PI);

      Arm 4: 12 Gy in 4 fractions of 3 Gy in 2 consecutive days interfraction interval of a minimum
      of 6 hrs; retreatments > 4 weeks using local RT fields to sites of residual or recurrent,
      moderate or severe pain with a single fraction of 8 Gy); second reirradiation with 8 Gy using
      local RT fields optional (at discretion of PI) ;
