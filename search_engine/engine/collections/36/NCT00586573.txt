    
      Memantine (Namenda) is a low-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
      believed to work by blocking prolonged low-level activation of the NMDA receptor and
      resultant neuronal damage caused by abnormal glutamatergic activity, yet also allowing normal
      physiological activity of the NMDA channel. Memantine (Namenda) was approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration in 2003 for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
      Memantine improves or delays the decline in cognition (attention, language, visuo-spatial
      ability), as well as functional and behavioral symptoms in adults with moderate Alzheimer's
      disease.

      Although the efficacy and safety of memantine has not been tested in people with ADHD, the
      spectrum of disorders possibly amenable to NMDA receptor antagonist treatment may include
      ADHD and associated executive function deficits (EFDs). To this end, we are proposing an
      open-label pilot study of memantine in adult subjects with ADHD and ADHD Not Otherwise
      Specified (NOS).

      This will be a 12-week, open-label pilot study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of
      memantine hydrochloride (Namenda) administered to 20 adults 18-55 years of age with ADHD and
      ADHD NOS. All subjects that enter the study will undergo standard screening and diagnostic
      procedures. After obtaining written informed consent from the subject, the diagnosis of ADHD
      will be established through clinical evaluation by an expert clinician. Only consenting
      subjects satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the study.
