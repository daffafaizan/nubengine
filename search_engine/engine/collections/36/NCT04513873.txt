      with the project support of TÜBİTAK BİDEB 2209A in 2016. It is an equipment that looks like a
      blood tube with a fixed arm on the right and a moving arm on the left with a total height of
      80 cm. It has some answers to common questions of parents as well as the key concerns of the
      children " Will it hurt me?"
