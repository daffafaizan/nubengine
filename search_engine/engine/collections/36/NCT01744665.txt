      CCyR during TFR phase (> 1% BCR-ABL); This study was terminated early as > 2 cases of
      confirmed loss of complete cytogenetic response were reported despite BCR-ABL monitoring
      during the TFR Phase. All cases achieved MR4.5 after Nilotinib treatment re-initiation and
      maintained until end of study; trial did not mandate re-initiation within 4 weeks after loss
      of MMR_ that was a requirement in other Nilotinib TFR trials Initial sample size was 300
      patients with CML-CP; Amendment #2 in June 2015 reduced sample size to 59 due to recruitment
      challenges; Study endpoint analysis and interpretations of data were challenging due to small
      sample size for early study closure..
