      neuropathic pain and the treatment of epilepsy in HIV-infected individuals. Lamotrigine is
      metabolized via glucuronidation.

      Raltegravir is a newly developed integrase inhibitor that is also metabolized via
      glucuronidation.

      Since both agents are metabolized via glucuronidation, there is a possibility of competition
      for glucuronidation, leading to drug-drug interactions between raltegravir and lamotrigine.

      This primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of raltegravir on the
      pharmacokinetics of single dose lamotrigine (by intrasubject comparison). A secondary
      objective is to determine the effect of single dose lamotrigine on the pharmacokinetics of
      raltegravir when compared to historical controls. Another secondary objective is to evaluate
      the safety of combined use of single dose lamotrigine and raltegravir.
