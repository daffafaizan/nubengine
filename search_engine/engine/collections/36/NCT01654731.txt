    
      This is a multi-center, randomized (treatment will be assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance will be compared with the test drug to see whether the drug has a real
      effect), parallel-group (two or more groups of patients will receive different treatments)
      study that will assess the efficacy and safety of bezafibrate in patients with primary
      biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who had an inadequate biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid,
      as defined by the Paris II criteria. Bezafibrate 400 mg or placebo will be daily administered
      in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 13-15 mg/kg/d for 24 months. Patient safety
      will be monitored. Primary end-point will be the percentage of patients with a complete
      normalization of the following biochemical tests: alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases,
      total bilirubin, serum albumin, and prothrombin index. Secondary endpoints will include the
      percentage of drug-related adverse events, survival rates without liver transplantation or
      liver decompensation, time course of non-invasive liver fibrosis measurements (Fibroscan,
      serum hyaluronic acid), time course of liver histological parameters (fibrosis stage,
      necro-inflammatory grade, ductopenia) assessed on percutaneous biopsy specimens, time course
      of endoscopic, ultrasound, and biochemical features of portal hypertension, time course of
      pruritus and of quality of life using validated scales.
