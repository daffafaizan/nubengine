      Objectives

      The primary objective will be to measure the hemodynamic effects of vasopressin on portal
      pressure in cirrhotic patients who have had a hypovolemic phlebotomy during a liver
      transplant.

      The secondary objectives will be to measure the effects of vasopressin on portal pressure in
      patients who have not had a phlebotomy and to compare this effect between patients who have
      or have not had a hypovolemic phlebotomy.

      The tertiary objective will be to assess the effect of the variation in portal pressure under
      vasopressin, associated or not with a hypovolemic phlebotomy, on hemorrhagic clinical
      outcomes (intraoperative bleeding and blood transfusions).
