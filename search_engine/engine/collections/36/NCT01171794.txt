      for definitive data on several points. The trial will employ two pharmaceutical intervention
      arms, which will compare placebo (the standard of care - information on prevention of
      altitude sickness) with the widely used NSAID ibuprofen. We will also determine Optic Nerve
      Sheath Diameter (ONSD) measurements via ultrasound in both the control and interventional
      arms. We will accomplish these objectives with a prospective, double blinded view of a large
      population of hikers who are ascending at their own rate in a true hiking environment: The
      White Mountain Research Station Owen Valley Lab (OVL) and Bancroft Station (BAR).

      Primary hypothesis: Ibuprofen 600 mg TID will be superior to placebo in decreasing both the
      incidence and severity of AMS in high altitude travel.
