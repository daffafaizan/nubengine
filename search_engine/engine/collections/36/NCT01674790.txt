    
      Aerobic exercise: Body weight support (BWS) treadmill exercise at moderately high intensity
      (60-70% of heart rate reserve) using 15-30% BWS. An additional 6-10 min will be needed for
      warm-up and cool-down. Heart rate will be continuously monitored, and blood pressure and
      rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured periodically.

      Cognitive training: Computerized dual n-back training program that involves a working memory
      task, the difficulty of which adapts to the individual participant's performance.

      ROM exercise: Non-aerobic passive and active movement of upper and lower extremity joints
      performed with the subject lying on a plinth. RPE will be recorded every 5 minutes to ensure
      intensity remains low. Mental activities: Unstructured mental activity: such as listening to
      light novels on tape, which will be selected by the subject from a pre-determined list.
