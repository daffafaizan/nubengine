      healthier food choices at the point-of-purchase. In 2017, the French government has selected
      the Nutri-Score as single front-of-pack nutrition label to be applied on food products sold
      in French supermarkets, on a voluntary basis.

      Some studies have found that the Nutri-Score would help consumers making healthier choices.
      Nevertheless, its impact has been demonstrated in experimental supermarkets and its
      implementation only concerns products sold in groceries and supermarkets, as it is stated in
      the official decree. The potential impact of the Nutri-Score in contract catering remains
      unknown, while this sector represents a growing share of out-of-home catering and that the
      promotion of the Nutri-Score in this sector is now part of the National Public Health Plan.

      Thus, the objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of the implementation
      of the Nutri-Score in contract catering restaurants on the nutritional quality of food
      purchases. The trial will be conducted using a quasi experimental before/after design with a
      comparison group. Data on purchases will be collected regularly through receipts, and the
      nutritional quality of purchases will be evaluated over time on two pairs of sites. In each
      pair of sites, one site will receive an intervention (Nutri-Score) and one site will be a
      control site. Within each pair, the sites will be comparable in terms of food offer and
      consumers profile.
