      Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) is defined as developmental qualitative defect of
      systemic origin, which affects one to four of first permanent molars and frequently
      associated with permanent incisors . The prevalence of MIH worldwide was reported from 2.4%
      to40.2% and clinical measures of MIH based on scientific criteria was established based on
      the European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry criteria to allow comparison between the findings
      of different studies .

      The most commonly reported clinical problems for patients with MIH are hypersensitivity of
      teeth to various thermal and mechanical stimuli result in improper tooth brushing, plaque
      accumulation and rapid caries progression. Severely affected enamel shows post eruptive
      breakdown and such teeth require extensive treatment, ranging from prevention to restorations
      and extractions. MIH patients also have increased risk of developing dental fear and anxiety
      as well as behavior management problems added to the difficulty to achieve effective local
      anaesthesia which are related to chronic pulp inflammation from dentin exposure due to
      excessive enamel breakdown.

      Rational As developmental of Second Primary Molar start at the same time as the development
      of the first permanent molars and incisor but the maturation of permanent teeth occur more
      slow. So when a systemic disturbance occur it affect second primary molar as well as first
      permanent molar and incisors.

      Few studies test the association between hypomineralized second primary molar (HSPM) and MIH.
      While no study available on Egyptian children.
