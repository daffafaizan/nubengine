        -  Determine the complete and partial response (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with temozolomide.

        -  Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a confirmed
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after a confirmed CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-27
      months.
