      with type 2 sleep test will be performed in eligible subjects during early1st trimester (<16
      weeks). Repeat sleep study will be done if the RDI in 1st trimester is less than 5. If the
      subjects meet the inclusion criteria without any of the exclusion criteria, randomization
      into either receiving CPAP treatment or usual ANC will be done. The pressure of CPAP machine
      is determined using autoCPAP machine algorithm at 90 percentile. Adjustment of CPAP machine
      is repeated at 24-28 week gestations. Subjects in both groups received standard usual care
      during ANC and outcomes were measured with similar case record forms.
