        1. To define the prevalence of osteoporosis in a falls clinic population, and compare it
           with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic and
           non-fallers.

        2. To evaluate the usefulness of peripheral bone scanning techniques in a falls clinic
           population.

        3. To determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures in a falls clinic population and
           compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic
           and non-fallers

        4. To investigate functioning, disability, health related quality of life and perceived
           need for rehabilitation in a falls clinic population including variation in a one year
           period, and compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the
           falls clinic and non-fallers.
