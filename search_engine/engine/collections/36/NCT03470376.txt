      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100 mg/dL, not receiving any lipid-lowering
      treatment. After a 3-week lipid stabilization period with a standardized diet regimen, the
      effect of a 3-month oral NC containing red yeast rice-derived monacolin K 3 mg, berberine 500
      mg, policosanol 10 mg, astaxanthin 0.5 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg and coenzyme Q10 2 mg vs no
      active treatment (noNC) was tested on plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, high density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride, lipoprotein(a), PCSK9, high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV).
