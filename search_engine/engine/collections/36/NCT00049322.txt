        -  Compare neovessel formation at 8 and 14 weeks after hepatic arterial chemoembolization
           in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with bevacizumab versus
           no bevacizumab (observation after chemoembolization only).

        -  Compare time to progression, objective response rate, and tumor marker progression in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with liver function
           impairment.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the cancer biomarker pattern of peripheral blood cells and plasma before and
           after chemoembolization in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study.

      All patients receive hepatic artery chemotherapy (chemoembolization) comprising doxorubicin
      HCl liposome, cisplatin, and mitomycin on day 8 and possibly on day 92. Patients are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning 1
           week prior to the first chemoembolization. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients do not receive bevacizumab. Patients in arm II may cross-over receive
           bevacizumab as in arm I if recurrent tumor is evident at week 14 by CT scan or MRI or a
           50% or greater increase in AFP level has occurred since day 8 chemoembolization.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (15 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
