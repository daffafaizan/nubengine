      as in the pregnant female and newborn populations. Such an agent may help prevent the
      progression of the disease in infants and children in early stages of infections. In theory,
      rCD4-IgG has antiviral effects.

      Part 1: Per the original protocol, a total of six pregnant women were enrolled in Groups A
      and B. Patients in Group A received rCD4-IgG at the onset of labor, and those in Group B
      received rCD4-IgG twice per week, beginning 1 week before the expected date of delivery.
      Newborns were not treated in Part 1 of the study.

      AMENDED: In Part 2 of the study, a total of nine pregnant women are enrolled in Groups C, D,
      and E and receive a higher dose of rCD4-IgG at the onset of labor. If the mother has not
      delivered 18 hours after rCD4-IgG injection, a second injection at the same dose is
      administered; daily injections are given thereafter until delivery. The newborns receive 1 of
      3 doses of rCD4-IgG daily for the first 5 days of life. Infants are enrolled sequentially to
      each dose level.
