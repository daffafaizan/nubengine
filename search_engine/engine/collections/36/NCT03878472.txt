    
      Several important clinical trials including MAGIC, FLOT4, POET, RTOG 9904 and TOPGEAR have
      identified the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment in treating locally advanced GEJ
      cancer or gastric cancer.

      patients with resectable locally advanced proximal gastric cancer will receive neoadjuvant
      treatment of PD-1 antibody or in combination with apatinib Â± S1 Â± Oxaliplatin.

      The investigators will shut down the study in advance, if situations below happens: 1) 1
      treatment related death, >3 disease progression or >2 hyper-progressive disease happen during
      the first stage; 2) 2 treatment related death, >6 disease progression or >4 hyper-progressive
      disease happen during the whole study.

      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.

      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)
      tumor volume increase >50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.
