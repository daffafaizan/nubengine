      investigated the feasibility or effect of aerobic exercise in this subgroup of stroke. The
      patients have few and temporary symptoms and are therefore early discharged from the
      hospital. After an cerebral infarct the patients have increased risk of recurrent stroke and
      they are at risk of developing cognitive deficits or vascular dementia over time. Researchers
      want to investigate if high-intensity training at home in the acute phase has an effect on
      aerobic fitness, endothelial response and health profile in this potential fragile group of
      patients. We hope to increase the patientsÂ´ physical and mental function, and thereby prevent
      a recurrent stroke and slow the progression of vascular diseases.
