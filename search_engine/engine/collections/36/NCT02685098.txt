      requiring semi-elective lower extremity major amputation within a 30 day period for
      non-infectious complications related to critical limb ischemia (CLI). After enrollment
      patients will be scheduled for amputation 7 days after MSC administration. The
      investigational treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the
      point of care. Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the thigh muscles and the gastrocnemius
      muscle (for below knee amputation only) of sixteen patients undergoing major amputation.
      Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months we will test the
      hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or
      infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory investigation we will
      assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene, revision of amputation, and
      death after major amputation.
