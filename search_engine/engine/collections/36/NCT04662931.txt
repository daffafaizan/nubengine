    
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder, caused by a mutation in the Î²-globin
      gene, which early on progresses into a systemic disease. Vaso-occlusion is a hallmark of SCD
      and can lead to serious acute and chronic complications.

      Crizanlizumab has been approved in US, India and other countries to reduce the frequency of
      vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients with SCD aged 16 years and older.

      The purpose of this local Phase IV study is to evaluate the safety of crizanlizumab
      specifically in Indian patients with SCD aged 16 years or older with a history of VOC leading
      to healthcare visit.

      The study is open label and single armed. 140 patients will be treated with crizanlizumab for
      about one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg in addition to receiving standard of care.

      The primary objective is to assess frequency, severity and causality of serious adverse
      events (SAEs) during the treatment period. Secondary objective is to assess overall safety
      and tolerability of crizanlizumab.
