      effective treatment for obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and improves
      hyperglycemia independently of weight loss have been proposed. Two are of particular
      interest; a) the hindgut hypothesis suggesting that nutrient delivery to the distal intestine
      drives the production of "incretins" which enhance insulin secretion (e.g. glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1)), and b) the foregut hypothesis, positing that foregut bypass reduces the
      secretion of factors (i.e. anti-incretins) that normally defend against hypoglycemia. The
      investigators have been actively investigating this topic and have developed a hypothesis
      based on past studies that they wish to test in a limited human clinical study. In addition,
      preclinical data suggest that there exists a gut-to-beta cell pathway, responsive to
      nutritional tyrosine, regulating insulin secretion, and this pathway provides a mechanism for
      the early postoperative improvements in hyperglycemia observed in RYGB.
