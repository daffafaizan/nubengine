      somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and
      may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect
      quality of life. It is therefore of utmost importance to accurately assess upper limb
      impairments. Clinical assessments exist for both motor and somatosensory function, but lack
      good psychometric properties. Robotic technology show promising potential and is readily
      available to assess motor function and proprioception. Robotic assessment for sensory
      processing is currently not yet available, despite being the most relevant somatosensory
      function. Indeed, sensory processing shows the strongest association with upper limb
      movement, and only shows incomplete recovery at 6 months after stroke.

      Our group has recently developed a novel robotic assessment of sensory processing, using the
      Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies Ltd., Canada). This cross-sectional study is set up
      to collect a large amount of data from healthy controls, in order to obtain reference values
      for future research and to serve as control data for comparison with stroke patients. 40
      younger healthy adults and 40 older healthy adults will be recruited and will undergo
      extensive clinical and robotic assessment of upper limb motor and somatosensory function, as
      well as cognitive function. This study also allows to investigate possible age-related
      decline in task performance, as well as investigation of the role of cognition in performance
      on this novel task.
