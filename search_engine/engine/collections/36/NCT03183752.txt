      Previous studies suggest that metformin (MTF) therapy decreased thyroid volume and nodule
      size in subjects with insulin resistance (IR).

      Objectives To evaluate the impact of IR and metformin use on the volume of benign thyroid
      nodules (TNs).

      Methods A randomized clinical trial to placebo (P) or MTF use. Previous fine needle
      aspiration confirming the diagnosis is necessary to inclusion. Exclusion criteria were:
      nodules with a predominantly cystic pattern, pregnancy, diabetes, acromegaly, previous use of
      MTF, levothyroxine, corticoid or any weight loss medication in the past six months, hepatic
      or cardiac insufficiency, creatinine levels > 1.4 mg/dL and MTF intolerance doses >1.0
      gram/day. Patients will receive similar tablets of MTF and placebo and will be instructed to
      take 3 tablets/day of MTF (500mg/tablet). Thyroid volume, as TN volume, will be accessed by
      ultrasound, both in the beginning, six months and one year after randomization, by the same
      researcher blinded regarding location group. Blood samples to measure: TSH, FT4, TPO-Ab,
      lipid profile, glucose and insulin were done after 8h fasting.
