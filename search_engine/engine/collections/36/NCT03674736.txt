      each food. For each food you will receive 3 different amounts of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or
      Lentils which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine (Rice or
      Wheat) or lysine (Chickpeas or Lentils).

      The quality of the protein in the Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or Lentils will be compared to the
      quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving you 4 reference diets containing amino
      acids made up like the amino acids in egg protein. The amount of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or
      Lentils you receive will be provided in a random order.

      Each experiments will be conduced over 3 days- 2 adaptation days where you will receive the
      diets at home, provided by the investigators and 1 study day. On the 3rd day (study day) you
      will visit the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at the Hospital for Sick Children where you
      will receive 9 hourly meals. Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min
      intervals for 1 hour. Breath collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th
      meal every 15 minutes until 30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will
      be collected during each of the 3rd study day.

      Before the study begins, you will visit the CRC at the Hospital for Sick Children for a
      baseline study assessment. At that time your body composition (fat and fat-free mass) will be
      measured and your resting energy expenditure will be measured. This will tell us the amount
      of calories your body need so we can prepare the diets for you for each experiment. This
      baseline assessment takes about 2 hours.
