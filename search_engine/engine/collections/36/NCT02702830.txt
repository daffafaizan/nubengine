      I. To determine the feasibility of performing upright treadmill cardio-pulmonary exercise
      stress testing utilizing magnetic resonance imaging.

      II. To determine the reproducibility of measures of peak oxygen uptake (V02) and cardiac
      output as well as arterio-venous oxygen difference (A-V02) difference in survivors of breast
      cancer treatment and control participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CPET using a one-way breathing mask in 2 separate days 1-2 weeks apart.
      Patients also undergo MRI before and within 60 seconds after exercising.
