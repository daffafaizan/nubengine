      glucose control in diabetic women during pregnancy and/or predicting risk of adverse neonatal
      events in these women. Our population is unique compared to published studies and contains
      significant numbers of African American women and overweight or obese women. Two of these
      markers have been examined in several other populations of pregnant women and have shown
      utility for both outcomes. However, the recommended levels of these markers need to be
      determined in specific populations as ethnicity and BMI affect the values. Values obtained in
      recruited women will be compared with biobanked samples from women who have no evidence or
      history of diabetes. Additionally, two other potentially promising markers will be examined
      (beta-hydroxybutyrate and triglycerides). Both these analytes change during pregnancy and
      beta-hydroxybutyrate has shown correlation with large for gestational status or macrosomia in
      some studies. A combination of markers may be a better predictor of adverse neonatal outcomes
      than a single marker.
