      I. To characterize the safety profile of pembrolizumab in patients with urothelial carcinoma
      undergoing radical cystectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore a signal of anti-cancer immunological activity by evaluating surgical specimens
      for evidence of post-treatment lymphocytic infiltration and residual tumor compared to
      pre-treatment biopsy samples.

      II. To explore a signal of biomarker activity by evaluating surgical specimens and blood
      samples for established and not-so-established markers of response to pembrolizumab.

      III. To report the tumor yield and sufficiency of tumor for immunological and biomarker
      activity.

      IV. To examine the interaction of the human microbiome and pathologic response to
      pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. About 4 weeks after treatment, patients then undergo radical cystectomy per
      standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 and 90 days.
