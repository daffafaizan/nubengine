    
      This controlled trial has tested the effectiveness of a socio-culturally tailored depression
      care program that includes a patient-centered approach to antidepressant medication
      management or structured psychotherapy (Problem Solving Treatment (PST)), patient/family
      depression education, treatment maintenance and relapse prevention counseling. Intervention
      enhancements include: depression care management based on a stepped care depression treatment
      algorithm; extension of the oncology care management team with a master's degreed social
      worker, who acts as Cancer Depression Clinical Specialist (CDCS) and provides PST, treatment
      follow-up and feedback to the oncologist, and who facilitates patient-provider communication
      and health system and community resources navigation; a psychiatric consultant, who provides
      supervision of the CDCS and consultation and antidepressant medication prescription for
      individual patients; and a didactic for oncologists on depression management. Cultural
      sensitivity and competency enhancements include: patient choice of first line treatment
      (antidepressant medication/PST) and degree of family participation in their depression care;
      PST tailored for language and literacy of patients with cancer; bilingual, bicultural CDCS;
      Spanish educational materials; and communication facilitation. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)
      patients will receive the care and services routinely provided patients with cancer plus an
      educational/resource pamphlet for patients and for family members(on depression and cancer,
      depression treatment, talking with your doctor about your depression, and medical center and
      community mental health care resources). With patient consent, the oncologist is informed if
      EUC patients screen positive for major depression/dysthymia.
