      C-section, all subjects will receive single-shot spinal anesthesia (1.5 mL bupivacaine HCl
      0.75% with dextrose 8.25%). Subjects in Group 1 (Standard of Care) will receive intrathecal
      morphine injection (e.g., DuramorphÂ®) 0.2 mg in conjunction with the single-shot spinal
      anesthesia. No TAP block will be administered. Subjects in Group 2 (EXPAREL/TAP) will receive
      a bilateral TAP infiltration with a single 20 mL dose of EXPAREL 266 mg expanded in volume
      with 20 mL of normal saline for a total volume of 40 mL (20 mL infiltrated on each side of
      the abdomen).
