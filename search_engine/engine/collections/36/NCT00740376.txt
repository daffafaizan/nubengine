      mobility and increased pain. After other treatments for pain relief and return to activities
      of daily living fail, knee joint replacement is often the best option and unicompartmental
      knee arthroplasty was introduced as an appropriate treatment for management of osteoarthritis
      when disease effects only a portion of the knee joint. This study is a prospective,
      comparative, randomized, double blind (patient and post-operative evaluator), multi-center
      clinical study under a common protocol to determine the safety and effectiveness of the
      Uniglide Unicondylar Mobile Bearing knee implant system.
