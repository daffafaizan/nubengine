      inhibition using 5-azacitidine to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and
      progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer.
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of systemic 5-azacitidine therapy on the
      expression of other methylated genes in triple negative invasive breast cancer using an
      Illumina GoldenGate array. OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over
      10-40 minutes 5 days a week for 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients undergo definitive breast surgery within 12 days of the last dose of
      azacitidine.
