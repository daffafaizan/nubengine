      combination with protease inhibitor is recommended. Side effects of this products and the
      number of pills may induce a lower adherence, and thus a lower efficacy. 40 patients with a
      CD4 count over 100/mm3, a HIV RNA over 5,000 copies/ml and antiretroviral naive, take the
      once daily combination of FTC, ddI, efavirenz during 24 weeks. The primary end-point is the
      viral success maintained from 12 weeks until 24 weeks. Secondary end-point is the adherence
      to the association and safety.

      The trial is prolonged during a total of 72 weeks.
