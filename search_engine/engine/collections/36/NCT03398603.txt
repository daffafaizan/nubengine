      concentration is the stability of the AMH level over the menstrual cycle. So far the unbiased
      AMH concentration is the most important argument to manage this parameter.

      There are several studies, which give different professional opinions of the AMH
      concentration depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. Some authors came to the
      conclusion that the AMH concentration over the menstrual cycle is constant, others described
      significant fluctuations. It is unclear, if the described fluctuation is relevant for the
      interpretation of the ovarian reserve. Recently it could be shown, that intraindividual
      fluctuations of joung women during the menstrual cycle is stronger, which means that the
      measurement of AMH in this age is less secure.

      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate, if the new AMH measurement with the ElecSys
      method delivers stable values over the menstrual cycle.

      The secondary goal of the study is to determine whether there are any fluctuations in the
      number of antral follicles as given by 3D ultrasound.

      For this reason we are recruiting a group of 50 women within two categories of age to measure
      eventually changes in AMH- concentration during their menstrual cycle.
