      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode and increases to 60% after the
      second pneumothorax. The pathogenesis of this benign disease remains unclear. Generally,
      rupture of the emphysematous change or blebs in the apex of the lung is considered as the
      cause of pneumothorax. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular
      pathogenesis of blebs formation or emphysematous change of the lung in these young, healthy
      patients. The blebs resected from the pneumothorax patients will be used for RNA and protein
      levels analyses. The adjacent normal lung tissue will be used as a control for comparison.
