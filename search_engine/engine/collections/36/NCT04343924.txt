      (GP+ Diving Group). This course, lasting 2 weeks, will consist of a daily dive, 5 days per
      week, for a total of 10 dives. These will be supervised by a graduate instructor according to
      the rules of supervision defined by the sport code. The dives will be conducted in open air,
      at a maximum depth of 6 meters for a maximum duration of 20 minutes.

      A matched group (gender, age, height, weight and BMI) will be composed of patients (n=12) who
      will not complete the Scuba Diving Discovery Course (GP- Virtual reality group). The subjects
      of this group will follow virtual reality sessions recreating the environment in which the
      scuba divers of the GP+ group operate. A control group (GT) will be composed of patients
      (n=12) who are monitored and treated for PTSD and who will not attend the dive discovery
      course or virtual reality sessions.

        -  The main evaluation criterion will be the NON-INVASIVE determination of salivary alpha
           amylase.

        -  Secondary evaluation criteria will be heart rate variation, CGI, HAD and BECK Anxiety,
           EGF, PCL-S and IES questionary.

      The main objective is to study the effects of immersion and pressure relief ventilation on
      the activation of the autonomic parasympathetic nervous system.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the symptomatic impact of parasympathetic autonomic
      nervous system activation on overall improvement, anxiety and depressive symptoms,
      functioning, and the 3 subtypes of PTSD symptoms as vegetative neuro hyperactivity, invasive
      syndrome and avoiding
