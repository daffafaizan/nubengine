      are being reported increasingly in conjunction with the use of PI-containing regimens. Some
      of the manifestations of these metabolic alterations include hyper/dyslipidemia,
      hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, lipodystrophy (in face and
      extremities), and body fat redistribution (e.g., central obesity and buffalo humps). Despite
      reports of increasing prevalence of metabolic complications among PI users, the question of
      whether they result from PI therapy has not been answered. Some of these complications, e.g.,
      a decrease in peripheral fat with an increase in visceral fat and buffalo hump, have been
      observed in HIV-infected individuals who were not receiving PIs. This study compares 3
      different antiretroviral regimens used in the FIRST study (CPCRA 058), 1 of which does not
      contain a PI, and examines metabolic alterations which occur.

      This study enrolls patients simultaneously co-enrolling in the FIRST protocol; 120 patients
      from each of the FIRST study strategy groups. At entry, Months 1 and 4, and then every 4
      months, blood is drawn to measure serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
      LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. At entry and Months 4, 8, 12, and then every 12
      months, body cell mass, and body fat by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are assessed.
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/01: At Months 4, 8, and 12, then every 4 months through closure of the
      FIRST protocol] patients are weighed and skinfold measurements and body circumference
      measurements are done. The skinfold and body circumference measurements will be discontinued
      after the study has collected a minimum of 2 years of follow-up data on all participants.
      Statistical evaluations are performed on the data.
