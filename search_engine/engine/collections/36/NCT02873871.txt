    
      Randomized clinical trial to compare radial artery patency after transradial coronary
      catheterization using 2 different hemostasis techniques. Patients submitted to diagnostic or
      therapeutic coronary catheterization will be prospectively enrolled in this single-center
      trial and will be randomized to radial hemostasis with TerumoBand® or a standardized
      compressive dressing with gauze and elastic bandage.

      Interventions: Radial hemostasis with TerumoBand® and Radial hemostasis with a standardized
      compressive dressing
