    
      This is a pilot, randomized, single-blind, two arm controlled, multicenter study in subjects
      undergoing surgical treatment for peri-implantitis disease. Eligible subjects will undergo a
      surgical treatment and be randomly assigned during surgical intervention (after flap opening)
      in a 1:1 ratio to adjunct BonyPid-500TM implantation or no BonyPid-500TM implantation.

      Randomization will be stratified by site and number of eligible implants, i.e., single or
      multiple.

      The study population includes male and female subjects, 20 - 80 years of age at screening,
      diagnosed with peri-implantitis and recommended for surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      disease.

      Up to 77 subjects will be enrolled to this study which will be conducted in two medical
      centers in Israel.
