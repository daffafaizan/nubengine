      Give way weakness is a symptom often associated with psychogenic etiology, but its
      neurophysiological basis is poorly understood. Our objective in this study is to identify the
      cerebral mechanism of give way weakness.

      Study population

      We will study 6 patients with give way weakness and 6 healthy volunteers all age 18 years old
      or older.

      Design

      In this study, patients will try to resist against the examiner's force and subsequently give
      way. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be recorded while this maneuver is performed
      repeatedly.

      Outcome measures

      Movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) analysis will be performed on the data and its
      amplitude (in volts) and latency (in seconds) in each individual patient will be described in
      contrast to the data obtained from healthy volunteers.
