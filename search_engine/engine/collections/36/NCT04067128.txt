      randomly assigned to receive health coaching or usual care. Participants were English- and
      Spanish-speaking patients from a county-based public health system who had previously
      received a positive airway pressure device for the treatment of sleep apnea. An unlicensed,
      trained health coach called patients three times to resolve barriers to adherence. Adherence
      measures collected by device modem at baseline and 4 weeks were the primary outcome measures.
