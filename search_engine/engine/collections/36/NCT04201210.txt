      safety be considered equivalent to a matched sibling donor transplantation (MSD), in order to
      offer cure for the majority of patients with sickle cell disease.

      The main questions of this trial are:

        -  Safety of a α/ß T-depleted haploidentical HSCT

        -  Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD

        -  Rate of rejection

        -  Immune reconstitution

        -  Fertility It is expected that the use of TCRαβ+ and CD19+ depleted haploidentical cell
           grafts in combination with the less aggressive and well tolerated conditioning regimen
           needed for patient preparation will be associated with a low risk of grade II-IV aGVHD
           and no extensive cGvHD, no graft failure and increase speed, spectrum and functionality
           of immune system reconstitution. This is supposed to reduce the incidence of severe
           infections leading to lower rates of transplantation related mortality (TRM).
