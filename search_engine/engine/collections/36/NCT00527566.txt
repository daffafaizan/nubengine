        1. Document the safety of mepolizumab therapy in patients with CSS.

        2. Demonstrate the steroid sparing effect of mepolizumab therapy by decreasing
           corticosteroid dosage while using this anti-IL5 therapy.

        3. Demonstrate the efficacy of anti-IL5 therapy in improving the signs and symptoms of CSS
           by:

             1. Measuring serum markers of CSS disease activity, including: peripheral
                eosinophilia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti- neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen,
                C-reactive protein and IgE levels.

             2. Assessing the activity level of vasculitis via the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity
                Score

             3. Evaluating asthmatic response via serial peak flow and FEV1 measurements as well as
                asthma symptom scores using the Juniper scale.

             4. Assessing changes in novel parameters such as fractional excretion of nitric oxide
                and IL-5 levels.
