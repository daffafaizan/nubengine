    
      This study is a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to evaluate safety and clinical
      benefit of AIGIV administered to systemic anthrax patients as part of their medical care
      after exposure to Bacillus anthracis (anthrax exposure can be via inhalation, ingestion,
      injection). Study information (i.e. data on safety and clinical benefit evaluation of AIGIV
      up to Day 30 following administration) and patient samples (for assessment of AIGIV
      pharmacokinetics and anthrax toxin levels) will be collected (up to Day 7 following AIGIV
      administration) prospectively to the extent possible; however, in some cases data may be
      collected retrospectively (including scavenged patient samples for assessment of serum AIGIV
      concentration and anthrax toxin levels). Therefore, both prospective and retrospective data
      collection are allowed in this study to maximize the amount of information obtained from
      systemic anthrax patients who have been treated with AIGIV.
