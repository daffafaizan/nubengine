      increase is mainly thought to be caused by the increasing elderly population and the
      increasing amount of spinal instrumentation in this population. The symptoms range from
      backache to severe neurological deficits. Up to 1/3 of cases are reported to be culture
      negative and cases can therefore be difficult to diagnose.

      MRI is thought to be the main imaging technique to visualise infection. But with the
      increasing availability of 18-F FDG PET/CT, it is reported to be nearly as efficient to
      diagnose spinal infection.

      During the long antibiotic treatment of spondylodiscitis, the clinicians have no real good
      imaging technique to predict residual disease since MRI during the remodelling fase of the
      spine will mimic no difference or worsening.

      Since 18-F-FDG PET marks areas with a high amount of inflammatory cells it may also be faster
      in returning to normal images and therefore correlates better to actual status than MRI.

      Some of the purposes of this study are therefore:

        -  To describe changes on PET/CT and MRI at index and after 4, 8 12 and 26 weeks and
           compare these to the clinical findings as well as inflammatory biomarkers.

        -  To investigate the correlation between normalisation of inflammatory biomarkers and
           changes on MRI and PET/CT.
