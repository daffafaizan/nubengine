      impact a patient's quality of life. Its incidence is said to be 28 persons per 100,000
      annually. The disease is manifested in one or more fingers by finger locking in flexion or
      extension, leading to pain, discomfort and at times, loss of function. Patients frequently
      report having to snap their fingers back in position to alleviate symptoms. The
      pathophysiology relates to thickening of the flexor tendon sheath, which can impair tendon
      gliding within it.

      Although multiple treatment strategies are available, it is not entirely clear which
      treatment offers the best outcome, especially when the finger has not reached end stage
      locking. In general, corticosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is offered as the first
      line of treatment. Splinting alone has also been described as a reliable method treatment.
      However, Patel and Bassini indicated that steroid injection results in fewer recurrences than
      splinting alone. Surgery is typically reserved for recurrent triggering, cases refractory to
      injection, or digits locked in flexion. The effects of steroid injection followed by
      splinting however have not been reported in a comprehensive fashion. It may be that this form
      of treatment could result in a synergistic effect, which can offer a treatment modality
      superior to either injection or splinting alone. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine whether steroid injection followed by splinting is superior to injection alone.
