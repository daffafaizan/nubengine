      characterization studies in asthmatics presenting in acute severe exacerbation. Specifically,
      we will determine the frequency of secretor status in these subjects by blood and saliva
      testing, and we will also perform a detailed cellular and biochemical analysis of their
      airway secretions. We will collect airway secretions using two methods. One method will be to
      have subjects cough sputum into a clean plastic container. The other method only applies to
      asthmatics with near-fatal asthma requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. In these
      asthmatics, we will collect airway secretions by tracheal aspirate using methods normally
      applied in their clinical care.
