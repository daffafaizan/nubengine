      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with Breast
      Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      Breast Cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the Breast Cancer patient using a similar protocol as
      investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-Breast Cancer CSC immunity
      induced by Breast Cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of Breast Cancer CSCs by antibodies
      produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with Breast Cancer CSC-DC.
