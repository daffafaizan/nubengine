      and is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, decreased blood oxygen levels, and
      hemoptysis. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of cold water immersion and
      the dive reflex on pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in
      those who have already experienced IPE, as well as explore the possibility of a genetic
      predisposition. Healthy nonsmoking subjects who have experienced IPE will be recruited for
      several cold-water immersion experiments and DNA analysis. Their pulmonary arterial and
      pulmonary arterial wedge pressures will be measured as they undergo immersed rest and
      exercise trials in thermoneutral and cold water. If the pressures increase with these trials
      as hypothesized, the effects of sildenafil administration (a pulmonary vasodilator) will be
      tested during a second trial. Blood will also be drawn for DNA analysis of certain genes with
      possible relation to IPE. Results of these tests will be compared with those of the general
      population.
