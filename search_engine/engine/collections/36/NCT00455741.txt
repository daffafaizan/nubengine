      ovarian follicles followed by a decrease in levels of inhibin A and B and complex changes in
      estradiol, which include an initial increase followed by an inevitable decrease. Therefore,
      there are dynamic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback from the aging ovary, prior
      to the ultimate loss of feedback that occurs with the complete cessation of ovarian function.
      While there is ample evidence that the loss of ovarian function is a major contributor to the
      menopause, there is evidence from animal models that primary age-related neuroendocrine
      changes may also contribute to reproductive aging. Specifically, there is evidence for
      changes in the hypothalamic and pituitary responses to estrogen negative and positive
      feedback. An understanding of the age-related changes in the physiology of the hypothalamic
      and pituitary responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback is critical in determining whether
      hypothalamic and pituitary changes per se contribute to the menopause and the impact of the
      loss of reproductive function on the brain.
