      (NaOH) to form stearate soap. Then the GB extract will be added to the final form. The
      formulated cream will be characterized for identifying the type of emulsion, calibration
      curve for GB, drug content, irritation to skin, homogeneity test, pH, FT-IR test, ex vivo
      studies, physical stability, and human application. Finally, a 9-questions questionnaire was
      published using Google forms for the human volunteers.
