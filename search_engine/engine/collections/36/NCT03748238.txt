      hysteroscopic endometrial injury for treatment of recurrent implantation failure.
      Approximately 230 patients who had failed to achieve a clinical pregnancy after the transfer
      of at least four good-quality embryos in a minimum of three fresh or frozen cycles to a woman
      under the age of 40 years will be randomized into two groups. Injury group will receive
      endometrial injury during their hysteroscopic procedure, whereas the control group (n=115)
      did not. This study will investigate that, whether the endometrial injury is beneficial in
      recurrent implantation failure patients to increase the odds of clinical pregnancy rates,
      live birth rates, and implantation rates.
