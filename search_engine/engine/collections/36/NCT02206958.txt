      feasibility and potential treatment effects of a multi-component intervention that combined
      behavioral urinary incontinence treatments with physical activity to improve urinary
      incontinence, toileting skills, quality of life, and physical function in frail older women
      without dementia living in senior apartment buildings.The intervention included a 12-week
      program of tailored behavioral UI treatments delivered by a nurse practitioner during 4 home
      visits, 150 minutes of weekly walking, and twice weekly strength training classes.
