    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study assessing the safety
      and efficacy of three dose levels of CNS 7056 compared with midazolam in patients undergoing
      diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.

      Patients who met all study entry criteria and completed screening procedures were randomly
      assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: CNS 7056 0.10 mg/kg,0.15 mg/kg, or 0.20 mg/kg; or
      midazolam 0.075 mg/kg. Patients received their assigned treatment administered as a single
      intravenous injection by a syringe driver over 1 minute. The endoscopy started when a
      Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score of ≤3 has been reached,
      but no earlier than 90 seconds after Time 0 (the start of study drug injection). Rescue with
      sedative medication (midazolam 1-2 mg) was be permitted at the discretion of the
      administering physician.

      Efficacy assessments consisted of the MOAA/S scores, Aldrete scores, and drowsiness measures
      using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Cognitive function was assessed by the Hopkins Verbal
      Learning Test-Revised™ (HVLT-R™) and memory for the procedure by the Brice Questionnaire.

      Safety assessments included adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, pulse
      oximetry measurements, clinical laboratory tests, and pain on injection using a VAS.
