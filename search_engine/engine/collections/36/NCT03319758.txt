      radiographic outcomes following immediate implant placement with thin or dehiscences buccal
      plate using bone augmentation in combination with an absorbable collagen membrane. Subjects
      in need of one implant replacing tooth to be removed in the maxilla within region 13-23 are
      included. At least 15 patients are recruited. No implant-supported temporary restorations are
      used during the first 4 months. After a screw-retained provisional phase of 2 months, a Ô¨Ånal
      impression is taken at implant level and take-in definitive crown. Patients are recalled for
      oral hygiene maintenance and prosthetic controls every 6 months for the entire duration of
      the study.
