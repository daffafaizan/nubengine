      months. 50 patients were randomly assigned to each group. The patients were divided into
      chemotherapy group, chemotherapy combined with thalidomide and megestrol acetate group, The
      best supportive treatment group, the best supportive treatment combined with thalidomide and
      megestrol acetate group. The chemotherapy group and the best supportive treatment group were
      the control group. The combined group was administered continuously for 8 weeks according to
      thalidomide 100 mg qn po and megestrol acetate 0.16 qd po. Calculating the sum of the longest
      diameters of the target lesions from each patient before and 8 week after treatment. Patients
      in each group before treatment, 4th week, and 7th week were observed T cell subsets, B cell
      subsets, NK cell subsets and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Through nutritional
      assessment Table (PG-SGA), Multidimensional Deficit Power Meter (MFSI-SF), Quality of Life
      Assessment Scale (EORTC QLQ-C30), Prognostic Assessment Form (GPS), Physical Status
      Assessment Form (ECOG) and lean body mass, upper arm muscle circumference and upper arm
      muscle area analysis of the effect of thalidomide combined with megestrol acetate on the
      nutritional status of patients with advanced cancer which reveal that thalidomide combined
      with megestrol acetate may improve the immune regulation and nutritional status of patients
      with advanced malignant tumors mechanism.
