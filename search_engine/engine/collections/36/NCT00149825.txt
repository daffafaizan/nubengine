      Persistent insomnia can hinder response to treatment. In addition, individuals whose insomnia
      does not resolve with standard antidepressant therapy are at increased risk for recurrence of
      their depression. Between 60% and 84% of people who have major depressive disorder report
      symptoms of insomnia. This study will assess the efficacy of combining antidepressant
      medication and sleep-focused psychotherapy to simultaneously treat sleep difficulties and
      depression.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      desensitization therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy to target insomnia. All participants
      will also receive escitalopram oxalate, an antidepressant medication. The study will last 12
      weeks. The severity of participants' depression and insomnia will be assessed. Study visits
      will occur weekly for the first 6 weeks, bi-weekly for the last 6 weeks, and once 6 months
      post-intervention.
