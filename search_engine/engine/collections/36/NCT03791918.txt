      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of
      TACE for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B especially for those with
      tumor beyond up-to-seven criteria. Recently, Lenvatinib was proved non-inferior to sorafenib
      in overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and Programmed Cell Death Protein-1
      (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus PD-1 antibody in
      intermediate-stage HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized
      control to demonstrate the superiority of lenvatinib combined with PD-1 antibody over TACE.
