      an onset of action of at least several weeks. Ketamine has emerged as a drug with promise for
      cancer patients. It has been shown to potentiate opiate analgesic effects. Single dose
      parenteral and enteral administration studies in medically healthy treatment-resistant
      depressed patients have shown rapid relief of symptoms. A recent two patient case series
      reported a rapid and moderately sustained symptom reduction in depression and anxiety in
      palliative care patients following a single dose of oral ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, with no adverse
      effects. Benefit was seen as little as 1 hour after the administration and sustained up to 30
      days. These case reports generate hypotheses of efficacy for ketamine in the treatment of
      depression and anxiety in patients with cancer. This study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled investigation of these hypotheses.
