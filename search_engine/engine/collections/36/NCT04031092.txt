      Exercise and physical activity is an important part of the treatment for chronic pain. Use of
      wearable tech might be a way to help facilitate physical activity in patients with chronic
      pain. Here it will be evaluated whether use of wearable tech giving feedback about the user's
      activity level increases physical activity in patients participating in inpatient
      rehabilitation for chronic pain. The control group will be wearing the same wearable tech as
      the intervention group, but they will not receive any feedback about their activity level.

      The feedback application will give participants in the intervention group information about
      the number of PAI they earn each week. PAI is short for personal activity Intelligence. You
      earn PAI points every time your heart rate increases: The higher heart rate, the faster you
      earn PAI. Previous research have shown that those who achieve 100 PAI or more every week over
      time live for an average of more than eight years longer than others.

      During the study all participants will take part in a traditional inpatient rehabilitation
      program. The program consist of two periods at the rehabilitation center with two weeks at
      home in-between. The study will take place during the two periods at the senter and the
      period at home. Time spent on physical activity and number of earned PAI's will be counted
      during the period at home.
