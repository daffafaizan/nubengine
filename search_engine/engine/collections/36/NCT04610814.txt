      academic medical centers in Boston, will begin carrying PRBC in 2019. The program is intended
      to provide BMF clinicians with 24-hour immediate access to appropriate blood products to be
      utilized if needed for patients following life-threatening illness or injury. The four
      fundamental goals of this program are: save lives' ensure transfusion safety; minimize blood
      product waste; and conduct continuous quality assurance. Our goal is to observationally
      evaluate this new protocol of administering blood products in the pre-hospital setting. We
      will collect data on patients with hemorrhagic shock being transported by Boston MedFlight,
      who receive or would have been eligible to receive pre-hospital blood transfusion by the
      inclusion criteria.
