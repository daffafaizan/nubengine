      of ezetimibe (10mg/day) on: 1) the efficiency of endogenous (plasma-derived) cholesterol
      excretion (%/day) 2) de novo cholesterol (DNC) synthesis ((%/day) 3) cholesterol efflux from
      tissues into blood (Ra), and 4) global RCT (efflux from tissues that is excreted as fecal
      sterols). Subjects will receive 7 weeks of either treatment or placebo, undergo RCT and DNC
      measurements, taking 10 days, then cross-over to the alternate placebo or treatment for an
      additional 7 weeks, followed by a second set of RCT and DNC measurements.
