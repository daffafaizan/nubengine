      with vinorelbine and docetaxel. II. Determine the time to disease progression, time to
      treatment failure, response duration, and survival in this patient population treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1 and 8, and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 only. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 month, and then
      every 1.5-3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 69 patients will be accrued for this study.
