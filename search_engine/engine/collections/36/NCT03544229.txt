      people who have symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis.

      The study will enroll approximately 205 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups (in 1:1:1 ratio) which
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

      TAK-906 Maleate 5 mg (After implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further
      randomized to this arm) TAK-906 Maleate 25 mg TAK-906 Maleate 50 mg Placebo (dummy inactive
      pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      Prior to Amendment 8, participants were randomized to receive TAK-906 5 mg. After
      implementation of Amendment 8, participants will not be further randomized to this dose arm.
      All participants will be asked to take one capsule twice daily, at approximately the same
      time each day throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall study duration is
      approximately 17 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
