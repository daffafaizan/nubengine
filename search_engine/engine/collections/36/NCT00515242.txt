      they are among the most common reasons for which adults use complementary and alternative
      medical (CAM) therapies as well as more conventional relaxation therapies. Although massage
      is one of the most popular CAM treatments for anxiety, its effectiveness for this problem has
      never been rigorously evaluated. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of
      massage as a treatment for a diagnosed anxiety disorder. Massage will be compared with two
      other relaxing treatments: thermotherapy and time in a relaxing environment, which reflect
      the types of activities that persons with anxiety might try to relieve their symptoms.
