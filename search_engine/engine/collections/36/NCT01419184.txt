    
      Eligible participants will be recruited within 24 hours of hospital admission for cSSSI due
      to suspected or documented Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), and who are
      anticipated to require IV antibiotics effective against MRSA and at least 3 days of
      hospitalization for management of cSSSI. The primary objective is to compare
      infection-related hospital length of stay between participants treated with daptomycin and
      vancomycin. Secondary objectives were to compare participant reported outcomes (pain symptoms
      and Health Related Quality of Life), 30 day cSSSI-related hospital readmission rates, and
      cSSSI-related medical resource utilization and costs between participants treated with
      daptomycin and vancomycin.
