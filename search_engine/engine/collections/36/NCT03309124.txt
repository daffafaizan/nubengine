      three treatments of white potatoes (a) baked (with skin), (b) mashed, (c) fried French fries,
      or white bread, prepared on the day of testing, will be served to healthy older adults (65+
      years). Participants will consume the equivalent to 1 medium sized potato (~280 kcal) or an
      equivalent amount of calories from white bread. Glycemic response, insulin, incretin hormones
      (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)), dipeptidyl
      peptidase 4 (DPP4), and cholecystokinin (CCK) will be measured for 2 h (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90
      and 120 min) following meal consumption, as well as mood and subjective appetite. An ad
      libitum test meal will be provided at 120 min to assess food intake suppression.
