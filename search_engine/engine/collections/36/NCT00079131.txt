      I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma treated with
      oblimersen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the
      response duration in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety and
      tolerability of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of
      this drug on bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in tumor biopsy specimens from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
