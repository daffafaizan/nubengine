      II- Recruitment criteria Inclusion

        -  Age : 45 and higher

        -  Female or male

        -  Type 2 diabetes with diabetes typing according to widely-accepted clinical and
           biological criteria [3].

        -  Subject able to practice physical activity. This includes a normal exercise test with or
           without anti-ischemic drugs, performed in the preceding 6 months or short before
           randomization. A certificate of no contre-indication for PA is to be delivered prior to
           randomization.

        -  With at least 3 available creatinine measurements in the 6 to 24 preceding months
           showing a rapid renal function decline defined as an eGFR slope below -5 ml/min/yr

        -  Estimated GFR equal to or higher than 30 ml/min/1.73mÂ², defined by the CKD-EPI formula,
           at inclusion visit

      Non inclusion

        -  Age strictly lower than 45 years

        -  Indication for cardiovascular rehabilitation (notably patient with ischemic heart
           disease or coronary revascularisation)

        -  Treatment with systemic NSAIDs or corticosteroids

        -  Lower limb amputation (above trans-metacarpal)

        -  Active proliferative retinopathy (risk of bleeding in case of effort)

        -  Contra-indication for the participation to PA:

             -  Severe non-operated valvulopathy

             -  Uncontrolled hypertension > 180/110 mmHg

             -  Thrombus in the left ventricular cavity

             -  Unstable coronaropathy, according to physician

             -  NYHA stage IV heart failure

        -  Any condition that would jeopardize patient's safety or would affect the conduct of the
           study

        -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women of child-bearing potential without effective
           contraception during the study

        -  Any situation associated with unreliable cystatin-C determinations, according to patient
           medical history: HIV positivity, melanoma and thyroid dysfunction

        -  Simultaneous participation to any interventional study able to interfere with the
           current study endpoints

        -  Patients not registered to the social security

        -  Protected adults (under guardianship and trusteeship)

        -  Subject unable to express their consent (due to intellectual/mental incapacity)

      III- Intervention HIPA group Twice weekly physical activity session in a dedicated structure,
      supervised by a graduated coach, alternating sessions of strengthening and intermittent HIPA,
      allowing a mixed stimulation of neuro-muscular and cardiovascular systems, and regular (every
      3 months) adjustment of the intensity of the program.

      Control group Counseling of physical activity according to recommendations from the working
      group on Physical Activity of the SFD (French Language Diabetes Society) supported by
      patient's oriented leaflet.

      IV- Handling with the COVID-19 pandemics

      The COVID-19 pandemics has modified the shape of the study with

        -  difficulties to comply with the study plan, including recruitment pace. Visits can be
           postponed if required but investigators are encouraged to follow the initial plan. The
           time between randomization and V3 (1 month) and V4 (3 months) can sometimes be too short
           and it is acceptable to perform this visit by phone or even to cancel it.

        -  difficulties to comply with physical activity (PA) plan. As PA facilities have been
           locked down in the pandemics context, the sports committee of the ACTIDIANE study has
           agreed to move attendances to the gym to some remote PA sessions, via websession or if
           not possible, via telephone coaching sessions.
