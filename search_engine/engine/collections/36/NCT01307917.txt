      causative factor of nephropathy in a pediatric population with diabetes. The investigators
      plan to recruit 40 adolescents with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and 40 healthy peers into a
      double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Peripheral arterial tonometry, a noninvasive
      method to assess vascular status, will be employed to study endothelial function in both
      groups. Measurements of renal nitric oxide synthesis will be assayed using a nitric oxide
      chemiluminescence analyzer. Urinary protein microarray analyses will be conducted to assess
      early markers of kidney inflammation. The array is a multiplex sandwich fluorescent
      immunoassay for the simultaneous quantification of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
      IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory
      protein-1-alpha and beta, and RANTES. The initial acute response and effect of 14 days of
      treatment with a flavonoid-rich capsulated supplement will be compared to a placebo. Study
      subjects will return for baseline assessments a week after the final flavonoid supplement to
      evaluate the sustainability of the response. Differences between group means for the measured
      variables before, during, and after the interventions will be tested for statistical
      significance using paired t-tests and nonparametric statistics. Univariate correlations will
      be calculated using Pearson's r.
