    
      Dyspnea, referred to by patients as "shortness of breath" or "breathlessness," is frequently
      associated with decreases in functional status, quality of life, and disabilities. Currently
      available questionnaires do not specifically address the shortness of breath component of
      COPD. The development of a patient reported outcome questionnaire that will specifically
      assess Shortness of Breath with Daily Activities (SOBDA) in patients with COPD is needed.
