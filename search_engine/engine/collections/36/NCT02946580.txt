      tertiary center (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) from 2017 to 2018. Adult male
      and female patients between the ages of 18 and 80 who were planned to undergo non-urgent,
      elective posterior-approach spinal fusion surgeries by the Department of Neurosurgery were
      eligible for inclusion. Of note, patients with preexisting opioid and/or laxative use were
      still considered eligible and patients were not stratified according to these
      characteristics. Once a surgeon and the patient made a joint decision to proceed with
      elective, posterior spinal fusion surgery, patients would be approached by study personnel,
      with all eligible patients recruited independently of their surgeon to ensure no conflict of
      interest. After informed consent, eligible patients provided baseline demographic information
      including age, sex, race, pre-operative laxative use, and pre-operative opioid use. In
      addition, subjects completed a Bowel Function Index (BFI), a validated measure of
      opioid-induced constipation.10 Patients were not instructed to alter their daily regimen from
      time of consent to initiation of the study. On the day prior to scheduled surgery, clinical
      research pharmacy staff randomized subjects in a 1:1 ratio. With the exception of the
      pharmacist preparing the study drug or placebo, who was unaffiliated with the investigators
      or study sponsor, the individual treatment assignment was unknown to study staff, patients,
      sponsors, and clinical treatment teams.

      Upon completion of surgery, post operative care unit nurses administered 25 mg of oral
      naloxegol (12.5 mg for creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) or an identical placebo within 2
      hours of arrival in the recovery room post-operatively and then every 24 hours thereafter
