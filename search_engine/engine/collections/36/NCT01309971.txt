      evaluations of the progression of questionable lesions over time, and no studies depicting
      the prevalence of these lesions. Since carious lesions have the ability to arrest and
      possibly reverse, determining how often these lesions are being seen in practice and learning
      more about their characteristics and patient risk assessment are important steps in order to
      manage these lesions without unnecessary surgical intervention.
