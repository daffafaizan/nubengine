    
      This is a randomized Phase II, open label, multi-centre study, with two independent arms.

      Patients receive 6 injections of IPH2101, at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg (according to
      their randomization) administered over one hour infusion at four weeks intervals.

      A patient whose disease achieves at least a minimal response to study treatment at any time
      during the initial period of 6 cycles can be treated with an additional period of treatment
      of 6 cycles.

      Patients are followed 6 months after treatment completion or until a KIR occupancy level <
      30% (i.e if the time required for KIR desaturation was > 6 months), whichever is longer.
