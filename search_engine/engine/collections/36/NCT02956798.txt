    
      The study is a prospective single institution phase II single-arm open-label trial evaluating
      SAbR in patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic RCC.

      Problem Statements:

        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) safely delay the start of systemic therapy?

        -  Safely delaying the start of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life
           benefits for patients since systemic therapy has significant side effects.

        -  Can SAbR be curative in truly oligometastatic RCC patients?

      Primary Endpoint:

      â€¢ Time to start of systemic therapy (TTST) defined as the time from the first day of SAbR to
      start of systemic therapy.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  Modified progression-free survival (mPFS) is defined as the survival interval without
           development of >3 sites of new metastasis, new sites of metastases that are not amenable
           to SAbR treatment, a total of >6 sites of metastasis that required SAbR, local failure
           at SAbR-treated site, or development of brain metastasis.

        -  Overall Survival

        -  Local control

        -  Toxicity

        -  HRQOL

      Sample Size: 23 Patients will be enrolled.

      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along
      with the 95% confidence interval.
