      increased insulin resistance (IR) and more rapid decline in β-cell function, highlighting the
      urgency and importance of early intervention strategies for improving insulin sensitivity and
      preserving/improving β-cell function to prevent T2D and mitigate against the increased
      vascular disease risk.

      Preliminary findings show a reduction in glycemic load selectively depletes visceral and
      ectopic lipid and improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in non-diabetic adults.
      The proposed research will investigate if the phenotypic features increasing T2D risk in
      individuals of Indian ancestry (IR and impaired β-cell function) can be favorably modified by
      a low glycemic (LG) intervention, and if the increased IR is attributable to genetic factors
      regulating adipocyte differentiation and function.

      These research objectives will be achieved through a 24-week randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) comparing isocaloric LG versus control diets in Indians with prediabetes. Compared to
      individuals in the control group, those on the LG diet are expected to have greater ectopic
      (pancreas, liver, visceral and intramyocellular) fat depletion assessed with MRI/MRS, and
      improvements in first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity assessed with the
      C-peptide model and oral minimal model, respectively during an OGTT. Reductions in hepatic
      and pancreatic lipids will be associated with improvements in first-phase β-cell response.
      Individuals with a greater number of risk alleles from a 53-SNP IR genetic risk score will
      have lower insulin sensitivity and leg fat, supporting the notion that impaired adipocyte
      differentiation leading to limited peripheral adipose expansion capacity is an important
      etiological factor underpinning IR cardiometabolic disease in Indians.

      The results will broaden the evidence base for effective prevention strategies in this high
      risk population by investigating the effect of the proposed diet intervention on underlying
      physiological and molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of T2D in Indians.
