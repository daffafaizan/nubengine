      during infancy may have effects on infant behavior and development. Children who require open
      heart surgery before their first birthday are vulnerable to developmental delays, especially
      related to motor skills (mobility) in the first year of life. Early delays in gross motor
      functioning (e.g., rolling, crawling, walking) have implications for learning and
      psychosocial development through adulthood. To date, no interventions to improve the gross
      motor functioning of children born with CHD have been developed. The purpose of this study is
      to learn more about developmental behaviors and to examine changes in developmental progress
      related to motor activities among a group of infants who received open heart surgery within
      the first three months of life. Activities will be tailored based on the individual infant's
      motor ability and medical status.
