      vasomotor symptoms (at least seven severe or moderate hot flush attacks per day) whereas 80
      comparators must be symptomless (no hot flushes). Thorough vascular function and risk factor
      assessments will be done, including clinical assessment of autonomic nervous system,
      endothelial function measurements, 24-hour ECG and blood pressure evaluation, and lipid and
      various other vascular surrogate marker measurements. In the first part of the study we
      compare these baseline measurements between women with or without severe vasomotor symptoms.
      In the second part of the study the women are randomized to receive placebo, oral estrogen,
      oral estrogen plus progestin or transdermal estrogen for 6 months. After the treatments the
      baseline assessments are repeated.
