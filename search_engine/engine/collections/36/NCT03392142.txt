    
      This is a multicenter, open label, single-arm, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of allogeneic HCT after
      failure of rituximab.

      Tabelecleucel will be selected for the subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell
      products based on matching >= 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, at least one of which
      is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+
      PTLD. Sites will provide high resolution subject and subject's graft donor HLA typing results
      and other information as required by the protocol.

      Tabelecleucel will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle,
      subjects will receive intravenous (IV) tabelecleucel at a dose of 2Ã—10^6 cells/kg on Days 1,
      8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

      NOTE, 29 April 2020: Study sites/locations with status "completed" may be screening EBV+ PTLD
      HCT subjects in clinical study ATA129-EBV-302 (NCT03394365).

      NOTE, 16 February 2021: all study sites have closed and all data has been transferred to the
      clinical study database for monitoring under ATA129-EBV-302 (NCT03394365).
