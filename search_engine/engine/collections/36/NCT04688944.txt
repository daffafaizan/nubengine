      spinal stenosis who will undertake posterior lumbar decompression and fusion surgery in our
      hospital.They all take preoperative lumbar mri examination and waist and back muscle strength
      test as well as recording their preoperative visual analogue scale,oswestry disability index,
      lumbar stiffness disability index score.All patients will receive a follow-up lasting for 1
      year,and we will record patients outcomes,such as visual analogue scale,oswestry disability
      index and lumbar stiffness disability index score at each follow-up time. At the same time,we
      will recruit 100 healthy subjects without lumbar diseases or chronic lumbar pain. The
      difference of their age with patients was less than 5 years. Meanwhile, lumbar dorsal muscle
      strength test and lumbar mri examination were conducted, and visual analogue scale as well as
      oswestry disability index and lumbar stiffness disability index score was recorded in healthy
      subjects.
