      screening numbers are used as 'Subject Identification Code" along with patient initials.
      Patients withdrawn from the study retain their screening number. New patients must always be
      allotted with a new screening number. The study population includes chemotherapy-na√Øve adults
      with high-risk MIBC. Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will receive cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on
      days 1, 8 and 15. On day 1, adequate hydration and antiemetics are needed. Study chemotherapy
      will repeat every 4 weeks on an outpatient basis and continued until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of clinical condition, patient refusal, or up to 2 or 3
      cycles, depending on the operation schedules.

      Patients will be seen every 4 weeks. All study subjects will be also eligible to receive best
      supportive care (BSC) defined as any standard supportive measures that are not considered a
      primary treatment of the disease under study, including the use of growth factors (i.e.
      G-CSF) for myelosuppression, bisphosphonates for management of skeletal metastases,
      analgesics and transfusion of blood products. BSC will be provided at the discretion of the
      investigators.
