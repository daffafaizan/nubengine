      response or overreaction of the immune system against food antigens or components of the
      commensal flora involve it. Corticosteroid therapy is effective for adult patients with CD,
      but it has side effects and can't promote mucosal healing. In recent years, EN is becoming
      primary therapy in induction and maintenance remission of CD, especially in children. But the
      mechanism of EN in induction and maintenance remission of CD is still unclear, and parts of
      patient have good clinical response to EN therapy while other don't. So we design the study
      to explore whether EN treats CD by effecting intestinal flora and whether the intestinal
      flora of patient with CD relates with clinical response.
