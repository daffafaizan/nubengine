    
      There is an urgent need for a macrofilaricidal drug, killing or sterilizing permanently O.
      volvulus adult worms, which could be used in individual case management and, after
      appropriate testing, as an alternative drug to ivermectin in Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
      programs. Emodepside is a promising candidate to kill the adult and sexually mature O.
      volvulus as explained below. Emodepside was shown to be macrofilaricidal against a variety of
      filarial nematodes and is a registered drug for animal health, commercialized by Bayer AG
      under the name of Profender® (in combination with praziquantel) or Procox® (in combination
      with toltrazuril).

      A first-in-human (FIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses of
      emodepside in healthy Caucasian men has been conducted and the preliminary results are
      favourable, supporting continuation of the Phase I development program. In the present repeat
      dose study, PK as well as safety and tolerability of the liquid service formulation of
      emodepside, given over 10 days, will be tested.
