    
      This is a single-institution, open-label, non-randomized phase II trial of erlotinib
      administered concomitantly with radiation therapy following surgical resection of gross
      disease. A total of 45 patients with previously unirradiated, high-risk cutaneous SCC
      requiring post-operative radiotherapy will be enrolled to assess the primary endpoints of
      time to recurrence and disease free survival. Pretreatment biopsies will be required to
      confirm the histological diagnosis of SCC. Four to six weeks after surgical resection,
      patients will begin erlotinib (150 mg po qd) beginning the first day of radiotherapy.
      Patients will receive 5040 cGy beginning on day 1 of therapy in standard fractionations.
      Patients will be followed to evaluate for toxicity based on NCI common toxicity criteria
      (v3.0). Patients will be followed on protocol for a minimum of 2 years with regularly
      scheduled CT scans, clinical evaluations, and laboratory work. Patients with residual or
      recurrent cancer will be taken off protocol for salvage therapy.

      As a secondary objective, molecular response of tumors to erlotinib monotherapy will be
      determined. When possible, participants will be enrolled and treated for 14 days with
      erlotinib prior to surgical resection. The pretreatment biopsy specimen (control) will then
      be compared to tissue acquired during the surgical resection after 14 days of erlotinib
      (experimental group).
