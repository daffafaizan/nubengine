      I. To determine the safety profile of tosedostat (oral) in combination with cytarabine
      (subcutaneous [SQ]) or azacitidine (5-azacytidine) in patients age 60 years or older with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      II. To observe the anti-tumor effects of tosedostat in combination with cytarabine or
      5-azacytidine, if any occur.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation of cytarabine and azacitidine followed by a phase
      II study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive tosedostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and
      cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive tosedostat PO QD on days 1-28 and azacitidine intravenously (IV)
      over 10-40 minutes or SC for on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants will be followed up at 28 days and then
      every 3-5 months thereafter.
