      canal, or a traumatized spinal cord. The majority of the patients have high pressure bladders
      which can lead to reflux and frequent infections in the urinary tract. Although children
      experience insufficient bladder emptying, many of them also experience urinary incontinence
      and have to perform clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). If no intervention is made, the
      children are at high risk of renal deterioration.
