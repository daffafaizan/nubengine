      PCOS by improving insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss. In this pilot study, we
      will determine the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women
      with PCOS to test this hypothesis. We will evaluate 15 women over a 10-month period, starting
      with a 4-month intervention-free observation period to determine the effect on ovulation of
      adding up to 22g/day of fiber supplementation to their usual weight-maintenance diets (to
      achieve 28-36 g fiber/day assuming baseline dietary fiber intake, could feasibly be
      translated into clinical practice.
