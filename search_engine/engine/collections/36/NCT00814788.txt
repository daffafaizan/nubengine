        -  To compare the PSA response rate in patients with hormone-independent recurrent or
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with bicalutamide and everolimus after
           first-line androgen deprivation therapy.

        -  To evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the toxicity of bicalutamide and everolimus in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease status (metastatic disease vs
      biochemical recurrence without measurable disease).

      Patients receive oral bicalutamide and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-42 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
