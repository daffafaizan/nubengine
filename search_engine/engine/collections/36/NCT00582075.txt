      developed metastases who develop new brain metastases within the first year of undergoing
      stereotactic radiation combined with the administration of temozolamide within the first year
      post treatment. Retrospective and prospective studies suggest that 50- 60% of long-term
      survivors develop new brain metastases. Since it is important to observe all patients
      recruited for a minimum of a year to measure the primary outcome, traditional phase 2 designs
      such as Simon's two stage optimal design or the mini-max design are not practical in this
      case. Survival and QOL are secondary end points. QOL will be measured using the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT -BR). It will be administered at baseline, at week four
      and every three months for 24 months.

      This protocol includes radiosurgery with standard radiation doses (15-24 Gy based upon RTOG
      9005). Patient may be registered after radiosurgery as long as Temodar is started within two
      weeks of radiosurgery.

      Beginning within two weeks after radiosurgery: TMZ 200mg/m2 days 1-5 repeat q28 days.
      Patients who have received prior chemotherapy will receive 150 mg/m2 days 1-5.

      Temozolomide is continued until there is disease progression defined by systemic progression
      or new metastases. If lesion treated with radiosurgery progresses in the absence of new CNS
      tumors or systemic progression, then TMZ will continue. Temozolomide is discontinued for
      systemic progression requiring other systemic chemotherapy.

      Palliative radiation may be administered to non-CNS sites during protocol treatment, but
      additional systemic chemotherapy will not be administered until patients progress
      systemically or until new metastases develop.
