      region, pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potential approach to radical cure. However,
      pancreaticoduodenectomy is consider as one of the most complex operations associated with a
      high rate of postoperative complications such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric
      emptying, hemorrhage, abscess, and sepsis. These complications increase the costs associated
      with pancreaticoduodenectomy. Numerous interventions and techniques have been introduced to
      decrease the morbidity. But there is little evidence for the superiority of one anastomotic
      technique over the others. Therefore, investigators intend to conduct a multicentre,
      big-sample, retrospective study to analysis the surgery results of pancreaticoduodenectomy
      and compare the different suture technique.
