      Prospective observational studies of the effectiveness of Autologel have demonstrated
      promising results in regard to the healing of diabetic foot ulcers including severe Wagner
      grade 3 and 4 ulcers. The aim of the current trial is to compare the efficacy, measured as
      wound healing in a single-blind (assessor) randomized controlled trial, of usual and
      customary care with and without Autologel in treating Wagner 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers.
