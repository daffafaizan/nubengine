      for treatment. In addition, the patients are routinely prescribed physical therapy with a
      home exercise component. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether home exercise alone
      is an alternative option to physical therapy. Patients will be approached about the study
      after they have agreed to receive a glenohumeral and subacromial injection per standard of
      care for their clinical treatment. The hypothesis being tested is whether home exercise is
      alone is as beneficial for pain relief, restoration of range of motion, and improvement in
      shoulder disability from adhesive capsulitis as physical therapy. Additionally sex
      differences, diabetes mellitus, endocrine, and mental health histories will be noted.
