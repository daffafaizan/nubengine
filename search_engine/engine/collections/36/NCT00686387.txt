      adults. It is nearly uniformly fatal, with a median survival of approximately one year,
      despite modern treatment modalities. Efforts to understand why some patients live longer or
      shorter than the average may provide insights into the biology of these neoplasms. For years,
      researchers have tried to identify independent predictors that could help in treatment
      planning. With the recent interest in molecular biology and molecular genetics, tumor markers
      are now being examined as potential predictors. A marker that could predict tumor response to
      therapy, the likelihood of recurrence, and survival would thus be quite useful.
