      to different physicians. Since 2016, Zhongshan Hospital has set up the Internet-based glucose
      management system (iGMS) to monitor plasma glucose of diabetes patients, and further set up
      an Artificial Intelligence Assisted Insulin Titration System (iNCDSS) to recommend insulin
      regime in 2019. Previous single-center clinical trial (NCT04053959) have demonstrated the
      efficacy and safety of iNCDSS in glycemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      This multi-center study enrolls 120 patients with Type 2 Diabetes from 20 wards of Zhongshan
      Hospital who are on treatment with insulin for at least 3 months. They are randomly allocated
      into 2 groups at a ratio of 1:1 after screening for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Patients in the Intervention group (AI group) receive insulin regimen set by iNCDSS and
      patients in Control group receive insulin regimen recommended by endocrinologists.

      This study will be conducted in the Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan
      University and consist of a 7-day intervention period. Patient allocation will be stratified
      by HbA1c, BMI and previous total insulin doses. The primary endpoint is the fasting plasma
      glucose level after the 7-days trial period.
