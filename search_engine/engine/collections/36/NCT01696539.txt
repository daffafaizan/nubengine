      Existing research has indicated many potential methods of attenuating prostate cancer
      progression and preserving patients' quality of life, but is lacking in definitive
      conclusions regarding the effectiveness of these methods in practice. This study seeks to
      further investigate the impact of post-diagnosis physical activity on biological indicators
      of health and self-reported quality of life in a cohort of men with prostate cancer in
      Sweden. Participants are randomized to either a walking intervention group, which encourages
      walking 10,000 steps per day for one year, or to a standard-or-care control group, and
      followed for 11 weeks.
