      to mothers. Only 20-40% of women quit smoking during pregnancy which implies that a majority
      of smokers continue smoking despite the associated feto-infant morbidity and mortality. It is
      therefore important to identify ways and means of protecting these infants as they grow and
      develop during intrauterine life. In this study, we propose to assess the utility of
      higher-strength folic acid (4mg) combined with smoking cessation programs as compared to
      standard of care (smoking cessation program and low-strength (0.8mg) folic acid) in reducing
      the level of morbidity (specifically fetal body and brain size) sustained by infants of
      smokers
