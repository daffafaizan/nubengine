    
      This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in the USA and in Europe. It is an open label,
      dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and efficacy of CP-4055 as a single agent when administered as a 2 hours intravenous
      (IV) or a continuous IV (CIV) infusion administered daily for 5 days in a 21-day cycle,
      either alone or with idarubicin IV, in patients with refractory/relapsed hematologic
      malignancies who have either failed potentially curative therapy or are considered unsuitable
      for standard therapy.

      In a second phase of the study the efficacy of single agent CP-4055 in patients with AML may
      be assessed.

      It is intended that patients receive a minimum of two cycles of therapy in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or significant disease progression.
