           In this study, following suggestions of WHO, these drugs are used for intermittent
           treatment.

        -  It will be tested if this approach reduces the number of malaria attacks and ameliorates
           the severity of the disease

        -  It will also be determined if anemia due to malaria, which is prevalent in northern
           Ghana, may be reduced

        -  Moreover, the interaction between red cell polymorphisms such as HbS, HbC,
           alpha-thalassemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and SP will be
           examined
