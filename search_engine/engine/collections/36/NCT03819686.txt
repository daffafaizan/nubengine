      transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney
      transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages such as better kidney quality, increased
      short- and long-term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care
      cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD
      patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The
      main outcome of this study is change in the proportion of study participants who have at
      least one living donor inquiry by friends/family over 12 months from baseline.The long-term
      objective is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances
      communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral
      EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention
      (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities
      in access to LDKT.
