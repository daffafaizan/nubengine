      metabolic processes of most cells and play important roles in human growth and development.
      Iodine deficiency disorders can have serious consequences on brain and physical development.
      In neonates iodine deficiency and hence insufficient supply of thyroid hormones could cause
      neonatal goiter, neonatal hypothyroidism, and endemic mental retardation.

      Iodine deficiency disorders can be prevented and controlled by providing iodine and iodine
      can be provided in different ways. However, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World
      Health Organization jointly recommended salt iodization where iodized salt is accessible.
      Iodized salt is a safe, cost effective and sustainable strategy to ensure sufficient intake
      of iodine by all individuals and to improve maternal and infant health. However, although the
      effect of iodine on human health is well established efficacy of iodized salt has not been
      studied.
