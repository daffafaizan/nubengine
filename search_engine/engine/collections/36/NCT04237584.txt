      16 weeks of enzalutamide or darolutamide exposure in patients demonstrating a biochemical
      response improves disease outcomes. By adding radium-223 following a potential bone flare
      phenomenon [after first 12-14 weeks of therapy with an androgen receptor blocker (ARB)],
      including patients expected to have durable response to systemic therapy, and mandating the
      use of bone protective agents during treatment, the investigators aim to demonstrate an
      optimal time to add radium-223 in the mCRPC landscape.
