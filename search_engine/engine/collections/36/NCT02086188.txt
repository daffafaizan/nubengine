    
      A randomized 1:1 placebo controlled 10-week study of mirabegron as add-on therapy to an
      educational intervention on behavioral modification including pelvic floor exercise (BM-PFE)
      to a cohort of 40 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) subjects with overactive bladder (OAB). Trial will
      last approximately 12 weeks for each subject, including screening period and treatment
      period.

      Active drug will be mirabegron 25mg daily with optional up-titration to 50mg daily after
      approximately 5 weeks. Subjects will be randomized at the Baseline Visit based on recordings
      in a voiding diary kept for 72 continuous hours in the screening period.

      Voiding diaries of a 72 hour period each will be utilized during the screening period,
      between Phone Visit 1 and Titration and between Phone Visit 2 and Final Visit. In the
      diaries, subjects will record the time of each micturition and/or urgency episode, urine
      volume with each void (when available), any episode of incontinence, and the severity of
      urgency (Overactive Bladder Symptom Composite Score, mean of 72 hour total daily cumulative
      score.

      Primary outcome will be average daily OAB-SCS total score, Final Visit vs. Baseline. This
      accounts for the frequency, urgency and incontinence components of OAB.
