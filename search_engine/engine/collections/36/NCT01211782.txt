        1. differences from baseline between AC-1204 and placebo groups' ADAS-cog scores at 6
           months

        2. differences from baseline between AC-1204 and placebo groups' CIBIC+ scores at 6 months
           Secondary endpoints will include differences between AC-1204 & placebo groups' scores
           for these same instruments at 3 months.
