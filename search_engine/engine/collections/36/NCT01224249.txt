      and it hereby plays a major role in several important cellular processes. Previous studies
      have indicated that the selenium status of the Danish population is below the levels required
      to optimize the suggested protective effects of selenium towards major diseases including
      cancer. In Denmark, important natural sources of selenium are fish and shellfish.
