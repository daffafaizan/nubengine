      worse graft outcomes when compared with Caucasians. This has been attributed to various
      immunologic and non-immunologic factors, including a greater rate of acute rejection,
      resistance to standard doses of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids, different
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and noncompliance. It has therefore been
      suggested that quadruple immunosuppression, including antilymphocyte antibodies for
      induction, should be used in this high-risk population to improve graft survival. CNIs are
      currently the mainstay of immunosuppressive regimens. Tacrolimus has been shown to be
      significantly more effective than Cyclosporine A in preventing acute rejection. As a result,
      Tacrolimus has become the CNI of choice in preventing acute rejection, and has produced
      similar graft survival rates at one year, with higher creatinine clearances. However, there
      is no report examining the efficacy of Sirolimus in improving renal function and its side
      effect profile when compared with Tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients, particularly in
      African-Americans with immediate graft function in a steroid-free environment.
