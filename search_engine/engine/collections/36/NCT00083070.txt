      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of temozolomide in
           pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the biologic activity and mechanism(s) of resistance to this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
