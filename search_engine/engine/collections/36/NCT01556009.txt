      the initial 7 months of the study, all 24 subjects will receive vismodegib, 150mg/day. They
      then will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intermittent vismodegib, 150 mg/day, during
      months 10-13, 16-19, and 22-25 or to receive treatment with PDT at month 10 and at three
      month intervals thereafter. The safety and efficacy of intermittent vismodegib and of PDT
      will be assessed at the time of the subjects' visits to the Study Center and at the time of
      telephone contacts. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review results for an interim
      analysis when 12 subjects have completed 28 months. The DSMB review will focus on adverse
      events and efficacy results. Subjects will be monitored for the presence of surrogate
      endpoint biomarkers (SEBs) at each Study visit.
