      severe. Effective postoperative analgesic technique especially in an elderly with significant
      comorbidities is challenging. (1) Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly popular
      for hip surgery anesthesia. Modern regional anesthesia for major hip surgery includes the use
      of a single shot and continuous epidural or spinal injections, continuous lumbar plexus
      blockade and continuous peripheral blockade of the femoral nerve (FN), fascia iliaca (FI)
      block, 3-in-1 FN block and sciatic nerve. The use of either single shot or continuous
      peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly popular. (2) These techniques have shown
      effective and safe postoperative pain control, resulting in lower opioid consumption,
      improved earlier rehabilitation and high patient satisfaction. (3) Pericapsular nerve group
      (PENG) block has been recently recommended by Giron-Arango et al. for use as postoperative
      analgesia in hip surgeries. It is a new regional anesthesia method based on blocking the
      articular branches of femoral nerve (FN) and accessory obturator nerve(AON) and obturator
      nerve in the region between the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and ilio-pubic eminence
      (IPE).The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated section of the joint suggesting
      these nerves should be the main targets for hip analgesia. (4)
