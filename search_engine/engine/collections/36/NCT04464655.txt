    
      The aim of this study is to develop a comprehensive 10-minute protocol based on function and
      myocardial tissue characterization without the need for contrast injection, which can be
      standardized for 70% of cardiac patients.

      To test this 10-minute CMR protocol for its ability to significantly improve diagnostic
      decision-making and to reduce cost.

      To test its clinical feasibility, performance and cost-effectiveness in different populations
      including: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (-)OS-CMR and Ischemic Heart Disease and CAD
      (+)OS-CMR
