    
      This study was a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, bioequivalence study. A total of
      172 participants undergoing bilateral cataract surgery were assigned investigational product
      to each eye according to a computer-generated randomization list for each of 2 study
      variables: treatment with T-PRED or Pred Forte in the first eye undergoing cataract
      extraction and the aqueous humor sampling time point.

      The investigator determined which eye was clinically suited for the first operative
      procedure; treatment of this eye was randomized to either T-PRED or Pred Forte. The second
      eye received the other study treatment (RP if the first eye received T-PRED; T-PRED if the
      first eye received Pred Forte) at the time of the second cataract extraction.
