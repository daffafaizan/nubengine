      at Philadelphia VA with BMIs between 30 and 40. Participants in the control group would
      receive usual care from their providers and monthly weigh ins. Participants in the incentive
      conditions will receive daily monitoring of their weights for 32 weeks, plus a package of
      financial incentives if they lose weight. Incentive group subjects will be given a weight
      loss target of 24 lbs in the first 24 weeks and will be able to choose a weight loss goal of
      0, 0.5, or 1 lb per week for the final two months of the study. Financial incentives in the
      first deposit contract condition will consist of a potential payment for every day they are
      under their target weight which consists of the prorated daily amount of their deposit
      contract plus an equal 1:1 match provided by the study team for the first 6 months framed as
      'weight loss period' and then for 2 months framed as 'maintenance of weight loss'. In the
      second deposit condition, the incentive consists of 8 months of the prorated daily amount of
      their deposit contract plus a 1:1 match (without the framing of 'weight loss' vs 'maintenance
      of weight loss'). We will have 80% power to find a 5 kg difference in weight loss between the
      intervention and control groups. Subjects who lose more than 20 pounds in either of the
      intervention groups will be eligible for an additional incentive.

      The proposed interventions will serve as the basis for a larger-scale intervention study of
      incentives for weight loss and maintenance that has the potential to substantially reduce the
      health burden of obesity among veterans.
