      in Morioka, Japan, in 2014. The new recommendations of the ICCLLR state that the outcomes of
      LLR are not inferior than OLR regarding to operative mortality rate and margin negativity,
      and are superior in decreasing postoperative complications, blood loss, and the length of the
      postoperative hospital stay. However, it is not clear that whether LLR is able to alleviate
      the impairment of liver function after hepatic resection, and there is no RCTs to compare the
      short and long outcomes between LLR and OLR.
