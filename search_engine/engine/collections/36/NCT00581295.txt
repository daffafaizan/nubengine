      in critically ill patients by using DOS.

      Non-invasive Optical Techniques DOS,near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy (NIR-DOS.

      NIR-DOS provides functional physiologic tissue/organ information without ionizing radiation
      and without withdrawing any blood, in a cost-effective and rapid manner. The application of
      frequency-domain photon migration analysis (FDPM) to NIRS allows independent measurements of
      tissue absorption and scattering properties at depths of 1 cm or more below the skin surface.

      Such capabilities will improve early diagnosis, detection, optimization of therapy,
      assessment of adequacy of resuscitation, and alteration in management plans for all of these
      critical conditions.
