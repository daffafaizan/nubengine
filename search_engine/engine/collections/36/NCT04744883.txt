      achieving desired levels of analgesia with lower dosages of opioid analgesics, and fewer side
      effects and abuse-relevant drug effects. This X year project will test study hypotheses in a
      sample of 240 chronic low back pain patients. The study will have 2 key elements: 1) a
      randomized, controlled SMT or MT in chronic pain (CP) patients completing daily take home
      exercises and 2) laboratory evoked thermal pain protocols pre- and post- therapy, permitting
      the quantification of EO function and the examining of treatment-induced changes in EO
      function (placebo vs. naloxone).

      The study will employ a mixed between/within-subjects design using double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled administration of the opioid antagonist (naloxone). The study will use a 8
      week supervised MT or SMT manipulation with subjects randomly assigned to one of the groups.
      All participants will undergo 6 laboratory pain-induction sessions in total. 2 during the
      pre-treatment phase, 2 during the mid-treatment phase, and 2 post-treatment. The laboratory
      sessions are identical with the exception of one of the 2 mid-treatment laboratory sessions,
      where extra questionnaires are administered. Each laboratory session will be roughly 2-3 days
      apart and the first 2 laboratory sessions will occur prior to the randomization to the
      treatment condition.
