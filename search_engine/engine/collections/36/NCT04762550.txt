      associated with high morbidity and mortality. End stage liver disease is known to be
      accompanied by dysregulated coagulation, which is further exacerbated in the immediate
      perioperative period by transplantation, leading to both coagulopathic bleeding and
      thrombosis. Altered thrombin generation is thought to play a key role in the predisposition
      of these patients for both severe coagulopathic hemorrhage and life-threatening
      thromboembolic complications. Despite this, thrombin generation during the immediate
      transplant period in patients with end-stage liver disease is poorly characterized, in part
      because it is not well reflected by conventional measures of coagulation. This study aims to
      characterize changes in thrombin generation capacity pre, intra- and post-transplant
      utilizing a novel point-of-care thrombin generation assay. Other specific aims of the study
      are to identify risk factors for patients with impaired thrombin generation and will assess
      the association of impaired thrombin generation with overall clinical bleeding risk. The
      overarching goal of this work is to develop a point-of-care-testing guided algorithm
      addressing dysregulated thrombin formation that improves coagulation management without
      increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications. Ultimately, this line of research will
      improve the outcomes of liver transplantation.
