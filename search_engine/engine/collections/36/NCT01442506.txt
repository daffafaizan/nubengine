      and can be recognized by new endoscopic techniques. Aim of the study is to test the efficacy
      of HD+ endoscopy in conjunction with i-scan (newly developed post processing digital filter)
      or chromoendoscopy (acetic acid) to diagnose Barrett's esophagus.

      Patients with visible columnar lined lower esophagus (CLE) or known Barrett's esophagus are
      included. After standardized PPI therapy (14 days; standard dosage) patients are randomized
      at a 1:1 ratio to undergo either chromoendoscopy in conjunction with acetic acid application
      (10-15ml; 1.5%) or HD+ endoscopy in conjunction with i-scan. Mucosal surface structure within
      CLE is graduated according to Guelrud's classification (type 1-2: endoscopic prediction:
      gastric epithelium; type 3-4: Barrett's epithelium). Biopsies are taken in a targeted fashion
      (type 1-4) in both groups and subsequently 4-quadrant biopsies were taken. Primary outcome
      analysis's to investigate the diagnostic yield of the different biopsy protocols.
