    
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the influence of both bundles on the
      knee stability - anterior-posterior translation, internal and external rotations after the
      double-bundle reconstruction of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and to compare the stability
      after single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction using a computer navigation system.

      Methods Anterior-posterior translation, internal rotation, and external rotation were
      recorded in the deficient condition (without ACL), in the anteromedial-reconstructed,
      posterolateral-reconstructed, and in the whole ACL-reconstructed condition for double-bundle
      reconstructions and before and after the ACL reconstruction in single-bundle group. KT-1000
      was used to evaluate anterior-posterior translation.
