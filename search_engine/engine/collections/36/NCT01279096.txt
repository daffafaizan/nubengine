    
      I.3 Primary Objectives :

      To determine the MTD of escalating doses of clofarabine starting from 20 mg/m2/day to 40
      mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5, as a replacement of cytarabine as part of a combination of
      etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen).

      I.4 Secondary Objectives :

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of clofarabine when used in combination with
           etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen) and determine
           the duration, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events that occur during the
           treatment and follow-up periods ; we search DLT

        2. To determine the Overall Response rate (OR) (Complete Remission + Complete Remission
           without platelet's normalization) of clofarabine plus etoposide ,asparaginase,
           mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen) in pediatric patients with refractory or
           relapsed ALL at the established clofarabine RP2D.

        3. To document the rate of Partial Response[s] in the study population

        4. To document time-to-event parameters, including duration of remission, Event Free
           Survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, and overall survival (OS).
