      neurofibromas (PNs) if they extend longitudinally along a nerve and involve multiple
      fascicles. PNs are a major cause of morbidity and disfigurement in individuals with NF1, and
      as the tumor growth progresses, can cause a multitude of clinical deficits including pain and
      impaired physical function. PNs have the potential to undergo malignant transformation to
      Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheet Tumors (MPNST).

      Mirdametinib (PD-0325901) is an orally delivered, highly selective small-molecule inhibitor
      of the dual specificity kinases, MEK1 and MEK2 (MAPK/ERK Kinase) which prevents the
      phosphorylation and subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

      Previous studies of mirdametinib (PD-0325901) demonstrated PN shrinkage and sustained
      inhibition of pERK. Reduced tumor volume indicated that cell proliferation or cell death may
      be altered in PNs with administration of mirdametinib (PD-0325901).
