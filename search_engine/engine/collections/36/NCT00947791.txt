    
      Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a common, recurrent, and disabling medical condition. Although
      mania is the defining feature of BPD, depression represents the majority of illness burden in
      patients with this devastating condition. Despite the high degree of morbidity and mortality
      associated with bipolar depression, currently available treatments are few and often
      inadequate. Recently, a single intravenous (IV) dose of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in
      severe unipolar depression. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of a single IV dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant bipolar
      depression (TRBD).
