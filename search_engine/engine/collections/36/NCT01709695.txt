      12 children and adolescents ages 8 - 15 with ADHD treated with once-daily INTUNIV(TM)
      (guanfacine; GXR) extended release tablets and 12 ADHD subjects randomized to placebo
      treatment. Children will be comprehensively assessed using a variety of clinical and
      neuropsychological measures. They will be scanned at baseline while performing both the
      go/no-go task (a well validated task for measuring inhibitory control (Durston et al., 2002,
      2003)) and the Stay Alert task - a new task designed to measure the arousal component of
      attention, which was used successfully in a recent fMRI study of guanfacine in healthy adults
      (Clerkin et al., 2009). They will then be treated with GXR or placebo for 6 - 8 weeks in
      accordance with titration and dosing strategies used in recent Phase III dose optimization
      trials (e.g., up to 4 mg/day), and re-scanned while performing the same two tasks. The fMRI
      scans will be conducted using a dedicated research 3.0 T Siemens scanner.
