      devastating impact on patients, their families and friends, and society. Currently, no
      laboratory test exists for these disorders. We are trying to develop a molecular test based
      on blood spots (small spots of blood obtained from patients' fingertips that have been dried
      on special paper). Volunteers take part by filling out the questionnaire at
      www.spot-depression.org. They may then be selected to provide a dried blood spot, which can
      be collected at home using a kit that will be mailed to their address.
