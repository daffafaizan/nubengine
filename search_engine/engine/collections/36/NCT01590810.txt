    
      Up to three planned panels (A, B and C) of either 8 healthy participants or 8 participants
      with mild to moderate hypertension will be enrolled. For Panel A and Panel B, dosing will
      occur in an alternating fashion between Panel A and Panel B with dosing commencing in Panel
      A. Participants will receive alternating single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up
      to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5). Subsequent doses in any Panel will be
      administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic
      effects of a given dose. For Panel C, participants will receive single rising oral doses of
      MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1 through 5). Depending on safety,
      tolerability and hemodynamic effects observed in the healthy participants, Panels A and/or B
      may be truncated and dosing may proceed in Panel C with hypertensive participants. In this
      case, dosing of hypertensive participants in Panel C will start with the second highest dose
      achieved in healthy participants.

      Amendment 1 of the protocol added Panel D (healthy males) based on the pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic and safety results from Panels A-C. Participants in Panel D will receive
      single rising oral doses of MK-8150 or placebo in up to 5 treatment periods (Periods 1
      through 5) at a dose range of 50 mg to 500 mg of MK-8150. Each treatment period will be
      approximately 3-4 days apart.
