      weight, all of which are maintained long term.It is controversial whether, after RYGB,
      patients choose to eat less high fat and sugary foods in favor of lower energy dense
      alternatives. If true, this could conceivably contribute to improved glycemia and body
      weight. Disparities among studies on food selection and intake are likely due to the almost
      complete reliance on self-reported food intake which is vulnerable to inaccuracy.This
      controversy can best be resolved by complementing existing findings with direct measures of
      target behaviour in humans. Therefore the proposition to use direct measures in humans after
      RYGB to test the hypothesis that the selection and intake of foods varying in fat content and
      glycemic index, as well as the pattern of ingestion within and across meals, changes in a
      manner that leads to beneficial outcomes on body weight.
