      have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and have been stable on medication treatment for
      at least 6 months. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between optimal
      medication therapy (or the therapy that has resulted in the most stable blood pressure for
      that particular patient) and the predicted optimal medication therapy based on a patient's
      genetic profile.

      Chart reviews for the patient's history of antihypertensive therapy will be coupled with
      buccal swabs and blood pressure readings collected from eligible patients who have provided
      informed consent. The swab will be analyzed for fourteen genetic variants that are associated
      with antihypertensive therapy response (efficacy, side-effects).

      2.2 Study Objective To assess the relationship between the drug therapy class/combination of
      therapy classes that resulted in the best blood pressure control for a patient vs. what the
      Geneticure high blood pressure panel would have predicted.

      2.3 Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the clinical time to achieve optimal blood pressure treatment.

        -  To assess the number of office visits required to achieve optimal blood pressure
           treatment.
