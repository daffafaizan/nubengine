        1. At 3 months, to investigate the effect of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus
           exercise therapy on muscle strength and knee function in middle-aged patients with
           degenerative meniscus lesions.

        2. At 2 years, to investigate the effect of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus
           exercise therapy on self-reported outcomes in middle aged patients with degenerative
           meniscus lesions.

        3. At 5 years, to describe radiographic changes in knee osteoarthritis development after
           arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or exercise therapy in middle-aged patients with
           degenerative meniscus lesions.

      Patients included in the study will be randomized into one of two groups. The interventions
      are: arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and supervised neuromuscular- and strength training.
      Subjects will be tested before and after intervention, at 12 months, 24 months and finally at
      five years.
