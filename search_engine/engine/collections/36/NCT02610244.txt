      This program has been identified as a promising intervention for youth with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who have deficits in aspects of executive functioning (EF),
      such as working memory (WM) and attention (ATT), as well as social-emotional behavior (SEB).
      Findings regarding the efficacy and generalization of transfer effects associated with Cogmed
      have been mixed, possibly due to methodological limitations of the standard program. In our
      study, these limitations will be addressed with ADHD youth (8-16 years) in a randomized
      controlled trial using a modified version of the Cogmed program (MCT) that is suitable for
      use in a hospital setting (duration = 3 daily 35-min sessions for 10 weeks). The main
      objective is to determine whether there is improvement in WM and ATT, a reduction in concerns
      related to ADHD and SEB, and transfer effects for reading and math following participation in
      our MCT.
