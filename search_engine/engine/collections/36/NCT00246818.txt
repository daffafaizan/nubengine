      While the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness is stressful, undergoing treatment for
      cancer including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy result in stress to the patient. In
      addition, cancer treatment frequently is associated with fatigue, physical de-conditioning
      and metabolic abnormalities characteristic of the metabolic syndrome, leading to speculations
      that cancer therapy may render survivors more prone to developing metabolic syndrome and its
      sequelae, cardiovascular disease. In a recently conducted study we detected a high incidence
      of hyperlipidemia and increased body fat content, decreased aerobic performance and
      musculoskeletal functioning and a high frequency of parameters of psychological distress in
      long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma. Based on these data and findings, it appears
      desirable to devise a program that would help cancer survivors not only to improve
      musculoskeletal functioning and aerobic performance, as a physical exercise program would
      offer, but in addition relieve psychological stress and enhance the well-being of cancer
      survivors after completion of treatment with multimodality therapy. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) has
      been used in Asian culture for centuries to improve wellness, reduce stress, and to promote
      healing by improving the flow of Qi. While a number of studies have provided scientific
      support for these claims in different populations, a beneficial role for TCC in the
      management of cancer survivors has not been established.

      This study aims to compare in a randomized, wait-list controlled design, the efficacy of TCC
      to an exercise program in improving aerobic exercise capacity and endurance, reducing stress
      and improving Quality of Life in adult survivors of malignant solid tumors.
