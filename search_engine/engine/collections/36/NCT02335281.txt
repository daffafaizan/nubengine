      microecological through Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for IBD (UC and CD). We
      will establish a standardized isolation, store, and transportion steps of fecal bacteria from
      donated fresh stool in the laboratory. Then the bacteria will be transplanted to mid-gut by
      nose-jejunum nutrition tube. Patients in this study will be assigned to receive standardized
      FMT only once or traditional medicine of mesalazine and would be followed up for at least 1
      year. The clinical symptoms, sign, blood tests, abdominal CT, endoscopy and questionnaire
      will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of Standardized FMT at the start
      and end of the projects.
