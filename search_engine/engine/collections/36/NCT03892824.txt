      prevention in AF patients taking OAC at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≤ 4 and stroke
      history). This patient population accounts for ~20% of the entire AF population, which is
      ~300K/year in the United State and EU. The implant is designed to exclude emboli > 1.2mm in
      size from reaching the anterior circulation. In AF patients, approximately 80% of strokes are
      total or partial anterior circulation strokes caused by occlusions of the main branches of
      the Circle of Willis, mainly M1-2, and rarely A1-2. The diameter of these branches, in the
      majority of cases, is > 1.5 mm
