      there is difference in the incidence of aortic valve replacement between the standard aortic
      valve reimplantation procedure and aortic root reimplantation procedure more than 21.1%. If
      there is truly difference between groups (Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure and Aortic
      Valve Reimplantation Procedure), then total 64 patients for both groups are required to be
      80% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval would reveal a
      difference in favour of the Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure of 21.1%. The blinding
      process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received valve-sparing operation, but
      don't know the type of the last. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board.
      Depending on a type of the procedure, the patients are divided into two groups: Aortic Root
      Reimplantation Procedure group includes 32 patients and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure
      group consists of 32 patients. Randomization is conducted intraoperatively by using
      accidental sampling after examining the aortic valve and making a decision on the possibility
      of a valve-sparing operation.
