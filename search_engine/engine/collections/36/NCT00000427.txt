      prevent osteoporosis. PTH is a protein hormone that increases the calcium and phosphorus
      release from bone, leading to formation of new bone. This study will examine the changes in
      bone density measured at multiple places in the skeleton and changes in chemicals in the body
      that indicate bone breakdown and bone formation. The study will indicate whether some
      breakdown of bone is required for PTH to have an overall bone-building effect in men.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive PTH alone by daily injection under the
      skin, alendronate alone taken by mouth, or both PTH and alendronate. The study will last 2.5
      years. All participants will receive some form of treatment for osteoporosis. Blood, urine,
      and bone density tests will be performed at 6-month intervals. During the first 6 months,
      participants will come in for additional study visits.

      Participants who complete the initial 2.5 years of their assigned treatment will be eligible
      for a 12 month extension to monitor bone density and bone turnover after PTH is stopped.
      Participants who were receiving alendronate will continue taking alendronate. The goal of
      this extension is to determine what happens to bone density and turnover after PTH is stopped
      and whether alendronate is needed to prevent loss of PTH-induced bone gain.

      Participants who complete the 12 month extension while on their assigned treatment will be
      eligible for a second 12 month extension in which all participants receive PTH therapy.
      Participants who have been receiving alendronate continue taking alendronate. The goal of the
      second extension is to determine if responsiveness to PTH is enhanced by a 12 month
      suspension of PTH treatment.
