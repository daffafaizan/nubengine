      mitochondria within skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes (type 2 DM), damage that is evident
      morphologically and by functional criteria. In this project, we propose, firstly, to more
      fully test this hypothesis of an impaired bio-energetic capacity, and to begin to examine the
      pathogenesis of damage to mitochondria in type 2 DM. We are also interested in assessing the
      potential for reversing damage, and improving functional capacity of mitochondria through a
      weight loss or a combined exercise and weight loss intervention.

      The first specific aim is to measure the functional capacity of mitochondria in human
      skeletal muscle in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2 DM (obese, sedentary,
      non-diabetic adults with the Metabolic Syndrome and/or impaired glucose tolerance). The
      second specific aim is to examine the morphology of mitochondria in human skeletal muscle in
      type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2 DM. The third specific aim is to examine
      the pathogenesis of mitochondrial damage in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type
      2 DM. The fourth specific aim is to assess whether exercise and diet can improve
      mitochondrial function and morphology in type 2 DM and in those at apparent risk for type 2
      DM.
