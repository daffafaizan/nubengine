      (1cc/50mg live mycobacilli) in the deltoid. Following a wait period after BCG vaccination,
      patients will then receive standard strength BCG intravesical therapy once a week for a total
      of 6 weeks. The BCG is instilled and held in the bladder for approximately 2 hours. While the
      BCG is retained in the bladder the patient should be repositioned every 30 minutes to
      maximize bladder surface exposure to the agent. Patients will undergo a cystoscopy every 3
      months following most recent TURBT. Study duration last approximately 6 months.
