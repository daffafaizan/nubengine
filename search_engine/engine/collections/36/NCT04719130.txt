      participants' recruitment will be done by a non-probabilistic sampling resulting from
      invitations to Basic Health Units. The sample size estimation indicated 164 participants.
      Participants will be allocated, by means of a randomization process, to one of two groups (82
      for each group): Experimental Group (multimodal circuit exercise) or Control Group (cycle of
      multidisciplinary lectures on pain ). The primary outcomes are global chronic pain intensity
      and global functional disability scores. The secondary outcomes are functional mobility and
      cardiorespiratory capacity. All analyses will be processed using the RStudio software. The
      differences will be considered statistically significant when a 2-tailed p-value is less than
      5% (p < 0.05). The statistical analysis will follow the intention to treat. Discussion: This
      study will discuss the effects of multimodal circuit exercise on global chronic pain
      intensity and global body functional disability scores. The hypothesize is that multimodal
      exercises will reduce musculoskeletal chronic pain and disability in older adults to the same
      extent as traditional supervised and structured exercises.
