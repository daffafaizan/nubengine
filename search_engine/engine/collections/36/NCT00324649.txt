      antiretroviral drugs. The initial recommended regimen in antiretroviral-naive patients
      according to therapeutic guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHS)
      includes two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a third drug from
      another class (PI or NRTI).

      The use of nucleoside analogues, especially stavudine and zidovudine, is associated with
      untoward side effects, including lipodystrophy hepatic steatosis/lactic acidosis syndrome,
      peripheral neuropathy, and anemia. However, Truvada has a low potential for both
      mitochondrial toxicity and fat distribution disturbances.

      As described in the Consensus Document of the Spanish Group for the Study of AIDS (GESIDA),
      and the AIDS National Plan from the Spanish Ministry of Health "Recommendations on metabolic
      alterations and body fat distribution", studies should focus on the evaluation of body fat
      disturbances after antiretroviral drug substitutions, based on the basic assumption of
      virologic control of the patient and equivalence in potency of the new drug regarding
      virological control. In addition, studies based on selective substitution of antiretroviral
      drugs in HIV-1 infected patients under virological control, are recommended in the European
      Medicines Agency (EMA) in the "Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products
      for the treatment of HIV infection".

      In this study, stable, virologically controlled, HIV-1 infected participants receiving
      antiretroviral regimens containing zidovudine and lamivudine were randomized to switch to
      Truvada or to stay on their zidovudine- plus lamivudine-containing regimen. Participants in
      both groups continued the third drug of their antiretroviral regimen (either an NNRTI or PI).
      Changes in limb fat in the two groups were assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA).
