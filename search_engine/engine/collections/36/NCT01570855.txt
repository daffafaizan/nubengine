      needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy of the lung lesion. Cancer cells (Bulk
      of tumor) and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) will be isolated and expanded in the laboratory.

      The drug screening assay will be used to evaluate the response of the CSCs and of the cancer
      cells to the various chemotherapy regimens.
