      to either Glargine U100 or Degludec as the basal insulin, then a 2 week break, and followed
      by a cross-over to the other insulin. Each study period will begin in Honolulu, Hawaii (HI)
      (airport code HNL) with a non-stop flight to Newark, New Jersey (NJ) (EWR) lasting
      approximately 10 hours with a 6 hour time difference between destinations. After up to 72
      hours in EWR, participants will return to Honolulu and spend up to 72 hours at that
      destination. Investigators plan to recruit 25 adults with established T1D currently being
      treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI).
