      outcomes and quality of life. Although clinical trials conducted study teams show that
      diet-induced weight loss interventions in obese older adults, when combined with exercise,
      improve body composition and physical and metabolic function in the short-term, the overall
      safety and long-term benefits of intentional weight loss in older adults remain
      controversial. Weight loss can also worsen age-related loss of muscle mass and decrease bone
      mineral density. Because of these concerns, health care providers are reluctant to recommend
      weight loss in obese older adults. The goal is to determine whether weight loss-induced
      improvements in body composition and physical and metabolic function observed in short-term
      clinical trials persist over time is critical to inform geriatric obesity treatment.
