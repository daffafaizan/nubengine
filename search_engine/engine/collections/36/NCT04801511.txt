    
      Sixty patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4N0M0, cT1-4N1-2M0, â‰¤12cm from anus)
      will be enrolled and receive preoperative IMRT concurrent with high-dose intravenous vitamin
      C and 2-3 cycles of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy, and then after 4 weeks rest, they will continue to
      complete 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6). Radical surgery will be performed
      at 10-12 weeks after IMRT.

      In this study, we will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method through
      the acute toxicity [during CRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy )], PCR (pathologic complete
      response) rate, sphincter preserving surgery rate, 2-year survival rate and 2-year
      disease-free survival rate.
