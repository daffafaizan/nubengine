      a day and increasing to 30 mg a day as tolerated in addition to standard ascites treatment)
      of 10 cirrhotic subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects are monitored for
      changes in frequency of paracentesis, quantity of ascites removed, and body weight.
      Additionally, subjects laboratory values were checked frequently during the first days of
      dosing to ensure tolerability and slow correction/increase in serum sodium.
