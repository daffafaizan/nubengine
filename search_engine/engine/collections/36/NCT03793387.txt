      performed in the operating room (OR) under general anesthesia without extra radiation
      exposure, which is expected to reduce the discomfort for the patient during localization.
      This study will be carried out at the Hsinchu Branch of National Taiwan University Hospital.
      It is expected that 40 patients with pulmonary nodules will be randomly assigned into two
      groups. One group will receive bronchoscopic dye localization in the hybrid examination room
      equipped with cone-beam computed tomography, and the other group will receive ENB-guided dye
      localization in OR. The primary goal of the study was to compare the localization duration of
      the two groups of patients, the total dose of radiation exposure during localization and the
      incidence of location-related complications, and the secondary goals were the results of the
      surgical procedure, including the surgical duration.
