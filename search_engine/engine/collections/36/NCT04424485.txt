      common malignant tumor among women. The majority are papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and TT
      is the procedure of choice. Since the micrometastasis rate of the central lymph nodes (CLNs)
      is about 30% to 90% in PTC, CLN dissection can improve the prognosis and reduce tumor
      recurrence as well as provide accurate information for the evaluation of tumor staging.
      However, TT procedure has some important complications such as vocal cord paralysis (VCP) and
      hypocalcemia (due to accicental parathyroidectomy or damage to the parathyroid gland-PG-
      vasculature). Use of intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) has reduced the rate of VCP.
      However, the incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia is still high (15-70%), and it is now
      the most common complication of TT. Intraoperative identification of SLNs and PGs can help
      surgeon to overcome these problems.
