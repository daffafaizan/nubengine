      complications, and caregivers can play a fundamental role in this process, namely because
      they feed the patient. However, studies show a lack of professional-caregiver communication
      in dysphagia, and caregivers' need for more information. Communicating dysphagia-specific
      food procedures through a visual poster might bridge professional-caregiver communication
      gaps, with consequences for the patient's health.
