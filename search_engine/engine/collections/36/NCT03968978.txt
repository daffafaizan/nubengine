      of 24 weeks, followed by a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks. During the treatment
      period, one dose of 210 mg tezepelumab will be administered via a single-use APFS or AI
      subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) starting at Visit 2 (Week 0) until Visit 7 (Week 20).
      Subjects will be administered tezepelumab at the site during Visits 2 (Week 0), 3 (Week 4), 4
      (Week 8) and 7 (Week 20). At-home administration of tezepelumab will occur during Visit 5
      (Week 12) and Visit 6 (Week 16). Each device will be assessed separately using descriptive
      presentations.
