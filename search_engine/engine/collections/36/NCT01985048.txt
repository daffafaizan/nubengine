      track how comprehensive biomarker profiles change during the normal course of rehab, and
      associate biomarkers at baseline with MACE outcomes assessed one year later. Blood draws,
      vitals, and patient medical histories will be collected as subjects enter rehab and at the
      end of the rehab program. Major adverse cardiac events will be assessed via phone interview
      at 12 months.
