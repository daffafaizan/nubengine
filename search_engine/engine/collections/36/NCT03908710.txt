      complications of hypertension, the incidence of high blood pressure is increasing, and it is
      still the main cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death, partly due to
      deficiencies in preventive care and control of the disease in an aging world. Blood pressure
      values obtained by self-measurement at home (HBPM) have been shown to predict the
      cardiovascular prognosis equally well as or better than blood pressure values obtained in the
      clinic (CBPM) in several observational studies. Aim of the present study was to investigate a
      new clinical medical system for treatment of hypertension with a clinical decision system and
      a electronic health record, a patient app and a home blood pressure monitor. " The patient
      app and the doctor's record reflect each other and basically contain the same information.
      Doctors can treat their patients remotely and the patients are able to manage some health
      issues by themselves by using the applications. Some patients need the physical examination.
      We therefore included patients after a so-called triage step with medical questions.
