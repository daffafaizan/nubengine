      the effects of two infusions of rituximab on response of memory B cells to bacterial motifs,
      on biochemical function, and histological features. We will enroll 10 consecutive
      AMA-positive patients with the diagnosis of PBC based on internationally accepted criteria
      and histological staging determined at liver biopsy and being currently treated with UDCA.
      Importantly, patients with advanced histological stages, decompensated liver disease, or
      waiting for OLT will not be included in the study (see exclusion criteria).

      Patients eligible and willing to enter the study will be evaluated at baseline by isolation
      and study of frequency and absolute numbers of B cells and their function, biochemical and
      AMA tests. Histology and quality of life will be also evaluated in all patients. The
      methodology to be used for B cell study is already well-established in our laboratory as can
      be seen in the attached paper (Kikuchi et al. 2005b). Patients will be administered 1,000 mg
      rituximab intravenously by slow infusion on Day 1 and Day 15 (+/- 1 day). Rituximab's
      pharmacokinetics indicate that complete B cell depletion is obtained 2-3 days after
      administration and that such effect may be lost after 9 months (Vieira et al. 2004). In
      addition to our B cell work, serum samples will undergo AMA testing, including titers, using
      recombinant mitochondrial antigens (Miyakawa et al. 2001). Patients will also undergo serum
      chemistry panel, which includes liver function tests. Patients will continue on a steady dose
      of UDCA therapy throughout the study.
