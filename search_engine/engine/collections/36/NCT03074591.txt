      treatment with IV iron for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
      (HFpEF) and iron deficiency (ID), both with or without anaemia, can improve exercise capacity
      as measured by 6-minute walking test (6-MWT) and symptoms while being safe. The FAIR-HFpEF
      study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Ferinject® in improving symptoms of HFpEF in
      patients with ID. Analyses will focus both on subjective and objective measures as well as on
      patients with and without anaemia. Furthermore, the tolerability and safety of Ferinject®
      treatment will be evaluated.
