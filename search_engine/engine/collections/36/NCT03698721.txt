      digested by dispase and sowed on collagen-coated culture support. Keratinocyte Serum Free
      Medium (KSFM) will be used for proliferation. Microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA
      extraction, Reverse Transcription and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) will
      be performed during passages. Cell culture conditions will be optimized to improve
      proliferation and avoid loss of differentiation. The investigators will develop scaffolds
      based on sodium alginate hydrogels, followed by freeze-drying to generate porous sponges (at
      -20°C and -80°C). Cultured cells will be associated to these original scaffolds and to other
      scaffolds, for example alginate hydrogels or Collagen Cell Carrier (CCC), cultivated for 28
      days and analyzed. Histological and immunohistological appearance of cellularized scaffolds
      will be compared to assess the effectiveness of each scaffold for tissue engineering in
      urothelium.

      Cellularized scaffolds will be studied in vitro (Transepithelial Electrical Resistance,
      impermeability, ability to be stitched, resistance to urine) and in vivo in ectopic location
      (subcutaneous location in Nude mice) or in orthotopic location (bladder augmentation in small
      animal).
