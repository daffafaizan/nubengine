      I. To improve the visualization/delineation of glioblastoma lesions using delayed 18F-FDG
      PET/CT imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV). Patients then undergo a standard of
      care PET/CT scan at 60 minutes and a second PET/CT scan at 240 minutes after injection.

      Note:

      Standard Uptake Value (SUV) is defined for state-of-the art PET/CT scanners as Standardized
      uptake values = count activity per ml within region of interest (MBq/ml)/[injected dose
      (MBq)/body weight (kgx1000)]
