      transepithelial crosslinking. The study will compare two riboflavin dosing regimens during
      the crosslinking procedure. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of transepithelial corneal collagen crosslinking performed with riboflavin 0.1% for
      reducing corneal curvature. Safety and efficacy outcomes will then be compared between the
      treatment groups. In particular, we will compare the two groups with regard to their efficacy
      in reducing corneal curvature. Secondary outcomes will include visual acuity. Safety
      assessments will include a tabulation of adverse events, patient symptoms, loss of visual
      acuity, changes in endothelial cell density, slit lamp examination of the cornea and lens,
      and contact lens tolerance for contact lens wearers
