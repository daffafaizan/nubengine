      a novel biomarker reflecting the severity of underlying cardiovascular, neurodegenerative,
      and microvascular disease. Since blood flow to the retina is predominantly supplied by the
      internal carotid artery (ICA), we hypothesized that ocular microvasculature and structure
      changes may reflect the disease status or therapeutic effects in patients with carotid artery
      stenosis.

      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel, non-invasive imaging modality
      that can be a reliable tool for the qualitative and quantitative assessments of ocular
      vessels during various ocular pathological or physiological changes. Recent studies have also
      demonstrated the ability of OCTA to quantify retinal microvascular changes in monitoring
      cardiovascular risk.

      This study aims to evaluate ocular changes in patients with carotid artery stenosis by
      optical coherence tomography angiography before and after carotid artery revascularization
      procedure.In this study, the patients with carotid artery stenosis and control group will
      receive a series of cerebral and ocular examinations including the most important cerebral CT
      perfusion (CTP) and OCTA. After that, the cerebral and ocular data between the two groups
      will be compared. Also, the preoperative and postoperative data acquired will be compared.
