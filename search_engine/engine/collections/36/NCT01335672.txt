      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate survival differences after first myocardial infarction in patients with
           and without COPD.

        2. To investigate if these survival differences exist due to a) differences in prevalence
           of risk factors (e.g. smoking) b) differences in management after myocardial infarction
           (e.g. uptake of cardiac rehabilitation, prescription of beta-blockers) and c) COPD
           related events (e.g. exacerbations).
