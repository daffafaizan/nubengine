      pain after upper extremity surgery or other trauma affecting the radial, ulnar or the medial
      nerve, or branches of these nerves such as digital nerves is unknown. The reason that some
      patients develop persistent neuropathic pain after surgery, while others, who have been
      through the exact same procedure or trauma, are pain free is still unknown. The underlying
      mechanisms are still largely unknown. This can lead to different responses to treatment.
      Whenever possible, it is important to identify and address the underlying pain mechanisms in
      the individual patient in order to design an optimal treatment.

      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the factors implicated in the
      development of persistent pain after nerve suture surgery investigating Clinical symptoms,
      standardized clinical examination for neuropathic pain, 92 biomarkers special developed for
      neuropathic pain, genetics.

      Conditioned pain modulation and Cold pressor test is intend to be performed in all the
      patients.
