      essential practices for delivery care outlined in the Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC). The
      intervention, including the introduction of the SCC and mentorship visits to support uptake,
      will be tested in four purposively selected health facilities in Nchelenge District, Luapula
      Province of Zambia. Since the essential delivery care practices outlined in the SCC are
      evidence-based practices broadly accepted to support positive clinical outcomes for mothers
      and infants, this evaluation will focus on adherence to the checklist rather than on patient
      outcomes. Data will be collected through observations of skilled birth attendants assisting
      with childbirth delivery before the start of the intervention and again at 3 months and 6
      months post-intervention. A health worker questionnaire will be administered at the time that
      the SCC is introduced and six months later to gather their perspectives on incorporating the
      SCC into clinical practice in Zambia.
