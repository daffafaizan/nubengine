      ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. During the course of previous investigations, it was shown
      in animal models that transient limb ischemia (our stimulus for generating remote ischemic
      preconditioning) leads to induction of a portfolio of myocardial genomic responses concerned
      with stress-response and repair mechanisms, reduces myocardial infarction after prolonged
      coronary occlusion, protects against cardiopulmonary bypass-induced neural, pulmonary and
      myocardial damage, and when administered to the recipient, reduces IR injury in the
      transplanted heart.

      In humans, it has been have shown that RIPC downregulates genes responsible for
      pro-inflammatory pathways concerned with TNFÎ±-signaling, apoptosis and exocytosis in
      circulating leukocytes, reduces ischemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, and decreases
      markers of myocardial and lung injury in a pilot study of children undergoing open heart
      surgery. However, the latter study was not powered to demonstrate differences in anatomic and
      age-related subgroups, or clinically relevant 'hard' end-points such as ventilation time,
      intensive care, and length of hospital stay.

      Thus, we are now proposing a large-scale clinical study examining genetic predictors of
      clinically relevant postoperative outcomes, and how they are modified by remote
      preconditioning.
