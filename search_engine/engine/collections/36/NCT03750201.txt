      diagnose and treat the condition.

      Usually doctors treat the first symptoms of glaucoma or ocular hypertension by prescribing
      eye drops. Unfortunately, there can be side effects associated with the use of these eye
      drops and there are reports of non-compliance due to difficulties in inserting these drops,
      all of which can impact on how effective this treatment regimen is.

      The purpose of this study is to assess how well the new automated DSLT device for laser
      treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension works in comparison with the standard SLT and
      determine that it is as effective in reducing intraocular pressure.

      DSLT or SLT will be performed in the study eye according to the randomization assignment.
      Eligible patients who sign the informed consent will be enrolled at each of the study sites,
      and undergo a washout (in the case of being medicated). After washout there will be a
      baseline visit, where continued eligibility is confirmed. Following confirmation of continued
      eligibility, 50% of patients being randomized to each treatment group. Randomization will be
      to a pre-determined randomization list.

      The un-masked investigator(s) will open the envelope corresponding to the subject ID and
      administer the treatment as indicated by the randomization envelope. The masked
      ophthalmologist(s), who will perform the follow up, will be masked as to the nature of the
      treatment the patient underwent.

      Only one eye per participant will be included in the study and they will be treated using
      either DSLT or SLT as per the randomized treatment allocation.
