      study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of XPro1595 in patients with
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and elevated blood levels of the inflammatory biomarker
      high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP).

      XPro1595 is a second-generation inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that selectively
      neutralizes soluble TNF, an inflammatory factor implicated in Alzheimer's pathology.

      A key element of this study is to identify Alzheimer's patients that are most likely to
      benefit from XPro1595 treatment. Enrollment is limited to patients with evidence of
      peripheral inflammation using elevated blood inflammatory biomarkers. For instance, hs-CRP is
      an inflammatory biomarker elevated in the blood of some Alzheimer's patients and elevated CRP
      has been shown to predict response to TNF inhibitors in multiple other diseases.

      Alzheimer's patients with elevated blood inflammatory biomarkers will be enrolled in a
      12-week study to determine the safety and the ability of XPro1595 to reduce neuroinflammation
      using a combination of invasive and non-invasive biomarkers of inflammation. The study will
      identify the dose of XPro1595 to be used in a larger Phase II disease modification study.
