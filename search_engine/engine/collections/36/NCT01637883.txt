      control group. The whole ETT cuff will be either dripped with 3 ml (4.5 mg) of benzydamine
      hydrochloride or nothing 5 minutes prior to anesthesia induction. The incidence and severity
      of POST at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively will be assessed. The potential
      adverse effects of benzydamine hydrochloride (throat numbness, throat burning sensation, dry
      mouth and thirst) will also be evaluated.
