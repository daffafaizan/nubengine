      will have a heightened tolerance to the sedating effects of antipsychotic medications, which
      will be reflected in differences in the participants' electroencephalogram response (EEG),
      when compared to healthy control participants.The following Specific Aims are designed to
      test this hypothesis and create the diagnostic tool.

      Specific Aim 1: The investigators will first conduct a pilot dose-response evaluation of the
      anti-psychotic drugs ziprasidone (Geodon) (20, 40, or 60 mg tablet) and olanzapine (ZyprexaÂ®)
      (2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg tablet) in non-psychiatric ill control participants to determine the
      optimal dosage that promotes sedation in healthy participants versus a placebo. The
      evaluation will comprise of a physical examination and questionnaires. The investigators will
      start with the lowest dose of each drug and if the dosage fails to induce sedation in healthy
      participants, the investigators will repeat the pilot dose-response evaluation with the next
      higher dose until the maximum dose is reached for both drugs. Specific Aim 2. To determine
      whether the pattern of EEG activity in response to a single dose of the anti-psychotic
      medication determined from the dose-response study from Aim 1 distinguishes schizophrenia
      participants from normal controls. The investigators will start with 2-4 healthy control
      participants to determine that the results show a discernible effect on the EEG using the
      dosage from Aim 1. If the dose of anti-psychotic medication fails to show an effect on the
      EEG the investigators will increase the dosage until the maximum dosage of the chosen
      medication is used. Once the dosage is identified the investigators will move onto getting
      IRB approval to evaluate participants diagnosed with schizophrenia.
