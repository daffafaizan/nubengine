    
      Prospective, open-label with blinded assessor, randomized, parallel, single-dose phase I-II
      clinical trial in which 24 patients affected with osteonecrosis of the femoral head ARCO
      grade I or II will enter the trial with the primary objective of assessing the feasibility
      and safety of "ex-vivo" expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells fixed in allogenic bone
      tissue in osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy
      of the implantation by imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) and clinical questionnaires (pain
      by visual analogue scale, quality of life by SF-36 and WOMAC Index).

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (core decompression and the
      tissue engineering product composed by "ex-vivo" expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells
      fixed in allogenic bone tissue or the standard treatment of isolated core decompression).
      Thereafter, patients will be followed for 12 months.
