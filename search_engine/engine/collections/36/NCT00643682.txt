      preparation as they prepare for colonoscopy. This often leads to poor compliance with
      preparation protocol and therefore inadequate bowel preparation. Our goal is to include a
      simple educational card which will hopefully improve the quality of bowel preparation by
      providing a visual component with the preparation instructions. This card will stress the
      importance of drinking the entire bowel preparation and provide representative images of a
      dirty and clean colon. We will specifically target patients directly booked for screening
      colonoscopy (those without a pre-procedure office visit). In a randomized fashion, patients
      in the control group will receive the standard bowel preparation instructions and patients in
      the intervention group will receive the educational card along with the standard bowel
      preparation instructions. The primary outcome will be the endoscopist's assessment of the
      quality of preparation using a standardized bowel preparation scale. Secondary outcomes will
      include the number and types of polyps found, colonoscope insertion and withdrawal time, and
      patient satisfaction with the procedure.
