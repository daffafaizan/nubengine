      curriculum of the ASSIST (Advocating for SupportS to Improve Service Transition) program, a
      12-week parent training program targeting parents' ability to advocate for services to
      improve the transition to adulthood for youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      Preliminary work demonstrated that youth whose parents participated in the "Volunteer
      Advocacy Program- Transition" or VAP-T (a pilot 12-week intervention program on which ASSIST
      is based) were more likely to be employed or in postsecondary education (PSE), and received
      more school-based and adult services, when compared to a wait-list control group.

      In the proposed research, the investigators conduct a randomized-controlled trial with 180
      families to build on previous findings in four important ways: 1) by making modifications to
      the program content to make it applicable to service systems across the nation, and
      rigorously testing whether the ASSIST program is effective when delivered across three states
      (Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin); 2) by incorporating the perspective of offspring with ASD
      into the intervention and data collection; 3) by examining mechanisms by which the ASSIST
      program influences youth outcomes; and 4) by exploring barriers to participation and factors
      that moderate treatment response.

      The investigators hypothesize that ASSIST participation will improve parents' advocacy
      ability, leading to higher rates of employment, PSE, social participation, and service access
      for youth with ASD. The investigators will test this hypothesis by randomly assigning parents
      of transition-aged youth with ASD (ages 16-26) to either a treatment or active,
      materials-only control group, and following families over 3 years. The investigators propose
      four Specific Aims: (1) To use a multi-site randomized-controlled trial to examine whether
      ASSIST participation increases parent advocacy ability (i.e. the intervention target); (2) To
      test whether participating in the ASSIST leads to improved youth outcomes (employment,
      post-secondary education, social participation, service access) during the transition to
      adulthood; (3) To examine which aspects of parent advocacy ability mediate the relations
      between ASSIST participation and youth outcomes; and (4) To explore moderators of treatment
      response and barriers to participation in the intervention.

      By rigorously testing a new intervention to improve the transition to adulthood for youth
      with ASD, the proposed research addresses an area of critical need as identified by the
      2016-7 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan. The project will result in a
      new intervention to improve outcomes for youth with ASD that can be disseminated through
      state and local agencies across the nation.
