      matched targeted therapy for patients with leukemia. It will describe the range of mutations
      found in patients with leukemia with this type of profiling, and describe the clinical
      outcomes of patients who receive a matched targeted therapy.

      Our tissues and organs are made up of cells. Cancer occurs when the molecules that normally
      control cell growth are damaged. The damage results in unchecked cell growth which causes a
      tumor, a collection of cancer cells. The damage is referred to as an alteration. There are
      different types of cancer-causing alterations. Genes are the part of cells that contain the
      instructions which tell our cells how to make the right proteins to grow and work. Genes are
      composed of DNA letters that spell out these instructions.

      By participating in this study, the participant's leukemia cells will be tested for cancer
      causing alterations. This testing is called leukemia profiling. The leukemia profiling will
      be performed using bone marrow or blood that has already been obtained during a clinical
      test. Alternately, the profiling may be done on leukemia cells that are planned to be
      obtained as part of routine clinical care.
