      mortality due to cardiovascular events, and if sustained leads to hyperactivity of
      parathyroid glands and renal bone disease. Similarly, increased calcium-phosphate product as
      a result of elevated levels of phosphate in the blood is an additional risk factor for
      vascular calcification. Elevated blood potassium levels is another major electrolyte disorder
      in patients with advanced renal disease which is potentially life threatening. Therefore
      control of blood phosphate and potassium levels is a fundamental component of treatment for
      end stage renal disease. Management of hyperelectrolyte levels in renal failure patients
      requires restriction of phosphate and potassium intake through dietary measures, promotion of
      excretion via GI tract through medication delivery (i.e. supplementary binders), and removal
      through dialysis. All these strategies come with limitations however, specifically adherence
      to dietary restrictions and medication compliance is poor due to lack of immediate
      repercussions, as well as the complex kinetics involved with removal via dialysis given the
      dependence on duration and frequency of dialysis whose manipulation is limited by time
      considerations for the patient and scheduling issues in the dialysis unit.
