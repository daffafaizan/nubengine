    
      All pediatric patients (aged 1-16 yrs) with newly diagnosed diffuse brain stem tumor or
      inoperable thalamic tumor which infiltrate brain stem from the pediatric oncology units in
      Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden will be eligible. A possible tumor biopsy with
      histologic findings is not taken into account. The diagnosis is based on MRI. The patients
      are given a conventional local radiotherapy of 54 Gy, during which the patient also receives
      topotecan as radiosensitizer. Within four weeks after completed radiotherapy, the
      investigational drugs are started. If the family for some reason refuses radiotherapy, the
      investigational therapy may still be considered. The guardians and age-appropriate patients
      are asked for written informed consent. If the family is not willing to participate in the
      trial, the patient is treated according to the currently best available therapy (meaning RT
      without topotecan as palliative therapy). The family has the right to withdraw from the
      study, whenever they so wish.

      Brain MRI at initial diagnosis, before the start of triple medication, and q 3 mo after
      initiation of triple medication, if not otherwise clinically indicated. In case it is decided
      to continue medication with progression in MRI, repeat MRIs are recommended every month. MRI
      should also be registered, if feasible, at the discontinuation of the medication.

      The clinical follow-up, as well as MRI follow-up, on clinical indications will continue also
      after discontinuation of therapy.

      PET-CT and/or MRI spectroscopy should be considered at diagnosis and at 3 mo after the start
      of triple medication.
