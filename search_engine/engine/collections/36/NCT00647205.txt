      T-SPOT.TB for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in this population. Concordance between
      TST, QuantiFERON TB Gold and T-SPOT.TB will be assessed in patients with different risks of
      TB, in a transversal study. This study will include 240 patients during 2 years: 80 HIV
      infected antiretroviral naïve patients originated from low TB prevalence countries, without
      any active TB (40 patients with CD4 cell count > 350/mm3, 40 with CD4 < 350/mm3), 80 HIV
      infected antiretroviral naïve patients originated from high TB prevalence countries, without
      any active TB, 40 HIV infected patients with active TB and 40 HIV negative patients with
      active TB. TST and the 2 blood interferon gamma assay will be compared according to the level
      of risk. The improvement of latent TB diagnosis in HIV infected patients may lead to the
      initiation of TB prophylaxis and decrease the incidence of this life threatening disease.
