    
      Total vessel area of a filtering bleb was measured with ImageJ software on colour photographs
      of a filtering bleb on day 1, 14, 1, 3 and 6 months and 1 year after trabeculectomy. Blebs
      were classified clinically as successful (IOP below 18 mmHg and a >30% reduction in IOP
      without antiglaucoma medications or additional surgical interventions) or failed. Linear
      regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation of the bleb vascularity with
      IOP.
