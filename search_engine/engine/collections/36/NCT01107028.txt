      six-minute walk test and completion of questionnaires) and randomization to one of two
      groups--either Rehab or Wait--will take place at the same enrollment visit if time permits.
      Subjects in either group will complete pulmonary rehabilitation, just at slightly different
      times, depending on which group they are randomized to.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program run by respiratory and/or physical therapists and other
      health professionals that involves exercise, education, and support with the goals to improve
      functional capacity, symptom management, and well-being. It will last 6-8 weeks, during which
      time, subjects will complete 18 approximately hour-long sessions. Pulmonary rehabilitation
      may be completed at any local center that makes travel convenient.

      Data collection visits will take place at National Jewish Health at baseline, eight weeks
      (without intervening pulmonary rehabilitation in the Wait group), after completion of
      pulmonary rehabilitation (time varies, depending on the randomization group), and finally six
      months after completion of the pulmonary rehabilitation program.
