      increasing rapidly. Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a
      constellation of conditions secondary to CKD, including 1) metabolic disorders of calcium,
      phosphorus and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), 2) bone diseases and 3) calcifications in blood
      vessels and soft tissues. CKD-MBD could increase the risks of cardiovascular diseases and
      bone fracture and overall mortality. However, the data of prevalence of CKD-MBD in Chinese
      population with different CKD stages is lacking. This is a multi-center cross sectional
      epidemiological study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of Chronic
      Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) in Chinese population.This is a
      multi-center cross sectional epidemiological study. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) in
      Chinese population. A questionnaire was designed to collect the information of demographic
      data, medical history, laboratory test results and medications from the patients. Multistage
      stratified cluster sampling method will be used. Based on the sample size estimation, a total
      of 14-28 tertiary hospitals and 42-56 level II hospitals distributed in seven different
      geographic regions across China will be included. At least 9863 subjects will be enrolled.
      The primary outcome is the prevalence of CKD-MBD, including the prevalence of hypocalcemia,
      hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
