      Thailand. Mortality is clearly reduced in HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patients who
      initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) after the treatment of TB, but the optimal timing to
      initiate ART is one of the major concern for patients concurrently receiving both therapies.
      To date, the prospective, randomized, control trial to study the optimal timing to initiate
      ART in the patients is still limited. In addition, the current recommendation to start ART in
      patients co-infected with HIV and TB is still based on expert opinions. Here, the
      investigators plan to investigate the optimal timing to initiate antiretroviral therapy in
      HIV-infected patients who are receiving tuberculosis treatment between at 4 weeks and at 12
      weeks after tuberculosis treatment by comparing the composite end point of death rate,
      hospitalization rate and adverse drug reactions at week 48, 96 and 144 at Bamrasnaradura
