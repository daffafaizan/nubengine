      Herb-partition moxibustion (Treatment Group) and b) Sham herb-partition moxibustion (Control
      Group). All patients in the trial will be treated with moxibustion 3 times a week, once a day
      for 30 minutes, for a total of 12 weeks. MRI will be used to observe the changes on brain
      structure and function in patients with UC, and further research on the characteristics of
      the brain nerve response of these patients with herb-partition moxibustion. In addition,
      tissue morphology and molecular biology tests will be conducted to observe the regulation and
      expression of VDR and antimicrobial peptides in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients. All
      these steps will be done in order to provide experimental basis for the mechanism of the
      effects of herb-partition moxibustion in the treatment of UC.
