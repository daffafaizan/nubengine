    
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of clazakizumab vs placebo for the prevention of acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary manifestations. The study
      will compare clazakizumab to placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion followed by an
      open-label dose of clazakizumab if there is no improvement or a worsening of condition occurs
      after 24-hours or anytime during the first 14 days after the first dose of clazakizumab or
      placebo. We hypothesize that clazakizumab will be safely tolerated and will reduce the risk
      of progression of COVID-19 to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the safety and tolerability of clazakizumab vs placebo for the treatment of
      patients with COVID-19 disease and signs of pulmonary involvement

      Sixty adult patients with COVID-19 and signs of pulmonary involvement at Houston Methodist
      who are not in need of ventilator support at the time of enrollment.
