    
      Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of volociximab in combination with C/P + B in subjects with previously untreated
      Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC.

      Subjects will be treated with the C/P + B + volociximab (V)combination for a total of 6
      cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Subjects with stable disease (SD)or better per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)after the 6th cycle of combination treatment (C/P + B + V)
      will be considered for further treatment in a maintenance phase with B + V at the same dose
      until subject withdrawal from treatment.

      Volociximab will be administered at doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
      Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab will be administered at their registered doses for
      this combination.

      Follow up for each subject will extend over a 90-day period following the last dose of
      volociximab. End of study is defined as 90 days after the last dose of volociximab for the
      last subject treated in the study.
