    
      The participants included in this study will be drawn from the Ingenix Normative Health
      Informatics Database, a proprietary research database containing claims and enrollment data
      dating back to 1993 for members of a large, geographically diverse US health plan. This study
      will include cohorts of participants who have claims consistent with a diagnosis of
      rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and who initiate
      golimumab, anti-TNF biologics, non-anti-TNF biologics, or systemic non-biological treatments.
      Participants will be identified by claims bearing codes for dispensed drugs, procedures or
      diagnoses and followed after the launch of golimumab for up to 8 years. A sample of enrolled
      health plan members without claims evidence of diagnosis or treatment of Rheumatoid
      arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis will also be selected. The claims
      database will be used to estimate the incidence of the primary outcomes of serious
      infections, tuberculosis (TB) and non-TB mycobacterial infections, malignancies such as
      lymphoma, and other selected outcomes. No study agents will be administered in this study.
      All participants will receive standard-of-care treatment as prescribed by their physician
