    
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial. Patients having an operative
      mortality < 4% (low operative risk) for surgical aortic valve replacement will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either transcatheter heart valve replacement (TAVR) with the Edwards SAPIEN 3
      or aortic valve replacement with a commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valve.
      Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually
      through 10 years.

      A subset of PARTNER 3 randomized patients will be enrolled in the Actigraphy/QOL. Additional
      patients will be enrolled in either the Bicuspid Registry, Underrepresented Populations
      Registry (UPR) or the Alternative Access Registry.
