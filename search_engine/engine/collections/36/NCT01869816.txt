      that inhibits proinflammatory pathways in monocytes and adipocytes. Using a recently
      developed enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we reported that circulating CTRP-3
      levels were elevated in patients with glucose metabolism dysregulation.

      Progranulin was identified as a key adipokine mediating high fat diet-induced insulin
      resistance and obesity through interleukin-6 (IL-6) in adipose tissue. We previously reported
      that progranulin levels were significantly higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes and
      were associated with macrophage infiltration in omental adipose tissue. Moreover, the
      expression of progranulin reduces inflammation and its degradation into granulins peptides
      enhances inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque, which may contribute to the progression of
      atherosclerosis There has been no previous report on the implication of CTRP-3 or progranulin
      in humans with cardiovascular disease (CAD). In the present study, we compared circulating
      CTRP-3 and progranulin levels in patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or
      progranulin is significantly associated with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well known
      CAD risk factors.
