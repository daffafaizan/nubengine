      I. To determine the cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) response rate and safety of O6BG
      (O6-benzylguanine) /BCNU (carmustine) when given biweekly as two consecutive daily doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon
      O6-alkylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alkyltransferase (AGT) activity in CTCL lesions
      will be examined to determine the effects of consecutive day O6BG administration on the
      extent and duration of AGT depletion.

      II. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon
      degree of induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest will be examined in the malignant
      T-cell population of lymphomatous tissue and in the constitutive cells of the skin to
      determine drug efficacy and toxicity through immunohistochemical techniques.

      III. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon
      O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene mutations and changes in AGT expression
      will be examined as potential mechanisms for O6BG resistance in non-responding patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carmustine followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and apply topical carmustine
      to the total skin surface (excluding the lips, eyelids, and ulcerated lesions) 1 hour after
      completing O6-benzylguanine infusion on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.
