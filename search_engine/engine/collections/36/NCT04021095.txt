    
      A proof-of-concept (POC) proposal to study the feasibility of customized head protection
      prototype device (HPPD) using 3D printed externally-applied moulded skin prosthesis
      integrated to the craniectomy bony skull defect. The proposed material is a bio-compatible,
      light-weight rigid /semi rigid material which can be fitted to the skull defect and
      interfaced with the subject's bony rim using soft, deformable material (e.g. silicon) and
      attached using an elastic head band or other acceptable means. The prosthesis is removable
      for skin and prosthesis cleansing and ventilation.

      Study Specific Objectives:

      (i) Primary Objectives

      These are to:

        1. test the feasibility and safety of customised 3D printed HPPD,

        2. integrate the prostheses to the skull defect in removable manner and discharge patient
           with appropriate education,

        3. to systematically monitor subjects for symptoms, compliance, complications and
           subjective feedback during the outpatient phase where progressive wear of HPPD and
           monitoring of acceptability will be monitored.
