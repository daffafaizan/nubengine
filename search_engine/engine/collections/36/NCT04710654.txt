    
      Functional constipation (FC), which is characterized by conditions such as excessive
      straining and difficulty in defecation, infrequent bowel movements, and incomplete
      defecation, is a common bowel disease that causes activity limitation and decrease in quality
      of life in children and adults, regardless of an organic etiology.

      In the literature, there are studies showing the effectiveness of different physiotherapy
      approaches such as behavioral therapy, exercise, neuromodulation applications, kinesiotape,
      abdominal massage in FC, and investigate and compare the effectiveness of connective tissue
      manipulation (CTM) and interferential (IF) current stimulation applied in addition to
      behavioral therapy and exercise program. But there was any study which compare the
      effectiveness of these physiotherapy methods with each other and IF current stimulation at
      different frequencies (100 Hz and 0-100 Hz). In addition, there are no randomized controlled
      studies comparing the current effects of IF applied at 100 Hz and 0-100 Hz in individuals
      with FC.

      The treatment methods to be applied in this study are behavioral therapy, physical activity
      and exercise program, CTM and IF current stimulation applied at a frequency of 100 Hz and
      0-100 Hz.

      The diagnostic method to be used is based on the Rome IV FC Criteria and the Bristol Stool
      Form Scale.
