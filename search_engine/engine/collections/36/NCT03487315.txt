      exercised induced anaphylaxis. Gold standard for diagnose food allergy is double blind
      placebo control food challenge, but it is a high risk procedure. The accuracy of skin prick
      test and specific IgE assay showed unsatisfactory results. It might be explained by these
      tests may not detect all of the major allergens in wheat allergic patients. Previous studies
      showed that the major allergens of wheat dependent, exercised induced anaphylaxis are omega5
      gliadin, followed by high molecular weight glutenin. For IgE-mediated wheat allergy, the
      major allergens varied among studies, including omega5 gliadin, glutenin, alpha/beta/gamma
      gliadin, and the water-soluble part of wheat allergens. There is no study to direct compare
      the major allergen between patients who have low wheat specific IgE and very high wheat
      specific IgE. Also, there is no data about the major allergens of wheat anaphylaxis in Thai
      population.
