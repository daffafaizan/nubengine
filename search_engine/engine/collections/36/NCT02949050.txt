      above) and an additional 20 into the control group. Patients will be matched for the level of
      symptomology (based on symptom score surveys) and residing/working on corn-crop farms. The
      premise for this study is the cross-reactivity of putative immunogenic sites between timothy
      grass pollen and corn pollen. based on consensus genetic sequences. Thus, the hypothesis is
      the use of Timothy grass extract containing immunotherapy would diminish symptomology to
      corn-based occupational rhinitis. Enrolled patients will have signed IRB approved consent
      forms and have undergone SCIT for 1 to 2 plus years (treatment group) or not undergone SCIT
      therapy for the same time period (control group). Potential contribution to symptom scores
      from other sources (e.g. Ragweed) will be analyzed by assessment of local pollen
      counts.Efficacy assessment will compare prospective symptom score results and retrospective
      quality of life survey scores between the treatment and control group responses.
