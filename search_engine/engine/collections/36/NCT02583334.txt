      medicine or Western medicine clinics in China Medical University Hospital(Taichung and other
      affiliated branches). After diagnosis by rheumatologist, these patients will be randomized to
      receive verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment, three times a week, for 4 weeks (12
      treatment in total). Visual analogue scale will be done for every visit. Laboratory
      biochemistric analysis and other questionnaires including Visual Analogue Scale, Fibromyalgia
      Impact Questionnaire, SF-36 health survey, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression
      Inventory-II will be completed at baseline, 2, 4 weeks after initiation of intervention
      (complete acupuncture treatment), 4 weeks after completion of acupuncture completion (8
      weeks). PET image examination (optional; this item depends on patients' own will) and
      instrumental examinations including heart rate variability and traditional Chinese medicine
      four examinations will be given before and after intervention. We expect that the efficacy of
      verum acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in improving pain, fatigue, physical
      function and quality of life. The effectiveness of acupuncture can be detected by
      questionnaires. Moreover, we will further speculate the mechanism by analyzing laboratory and
      image data.
