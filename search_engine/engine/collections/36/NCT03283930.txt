    
      Objective: The goal of this protocol is to test the efficacy of a computer-based attention
      bias modification training (comparing active vs. placebo) as an augmentation of individual
      cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders.

      Study Population: A total of 120 children and adolescents (8-17 years old) will be recruited
      to participate in this treatment trial.

      Design: Participants' psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses will be assessed by clinical
      interview. Participants will engage in 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy in
      addition to being randomized to receive either an active or placebo version of a
      computer-based attention bias modification training.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures to be examined are change in scores on the
      Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale across treatment.
