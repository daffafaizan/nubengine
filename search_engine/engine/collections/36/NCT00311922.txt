      Americans have poor quantitative skills. Numeracy, the ability to understand and use numbers
      and math skills in daily life, may be particularly important to patients with diabetes
      because caring for diabetes often requires self-management skills that rely on the daily
      application of math skills, such as counting carbohydrates, interpreting blood glucose
      monitoring, applying sliding scale insulin regimens, and calculating insulin to carbohydrate
      ratios. Presumably diabetes patients with poor numeracy have more difficulty with
      self-management and are at risk for poorer clinical outcomes, but to date, there are no
      published studies that rigorously examine the role of numeracy in diabetes. We have recently
      completed the initial development of a new scale to measure numeracy in patients with
      diabetes: the Diabetes Numeracy Test (DNT).

      The aim of this research will be to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a new
      diabetes educational intervention that teaches self-management skills that compensate for
      poor numeracy skills among a sample of patients with diabetes and low numeracy. We
      hypothesize that a group of patients with poor numeracy who are taught self-management skills
      that accommodate their poor numeracy will have: (1) improved treatment satisfaction and
      perceived self-efficacy, (2) improved performance in self-management tasks, and (3) improved
      glycemic control compared to a control group that receives usual education.
