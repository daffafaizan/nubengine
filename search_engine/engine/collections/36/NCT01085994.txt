      reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with respiratory tract infections
      presenting to the primary care setting or the emergency department. However, it remains
      unclear if a similar strategy can be effectively and safely implemented in the critical care
      setting. We attempt to address the controversy on this issue, by collecting, analyzing and
      interpreting the currently available relevant evidence. To this end, a systematic review and
      meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials reporting on the outcomes of critically ill
      septic patients managed with or without a procalcitonin-based algorithm will be performed.
