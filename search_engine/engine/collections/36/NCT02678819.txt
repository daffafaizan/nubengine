      since the dawn of time, human beings are aware that managing complex situations will always
      be an inexhaustible source of mistakes. This is particularly true in anesthesia and intensive
      care in which situations are often complex and stressful, thus leading to mistakes or
      inadequate management. Improvement might arise from the use of cognitive aids.

      The investigators designed a smartphone application including 5 scenarios of anesthesia and
      intensive care crises (malignant hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local
      anesthetics, severe and symptomatic hyperkaliemia, ventricular fibrillation), easy to use
      with a manual validation of every simple step. Investigators seek to compare the technical
      and non technical management of these crises with and without this wearable cognitive aid.
