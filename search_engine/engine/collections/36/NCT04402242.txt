      levels. The system monitors the physiological responses to pain using a relative pain index
      from 0-100, called the Nociception Level (NOL®) index. In the NOL index, 0 represents no
      nociception or pain and 100 represents high nociception or pain level.

      The PMD-200 system consists of a monitor and a specific finger probe containing 4 sensors.
      The sensors included are Photoplethysmography (PPG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR),
      Accelerometer for movement (ACC) and Thermistor for peripheral temperature (TMP).

      The PMD-200™ is intended to be used for assessing the nociception level in anesthetized
      patients. The device is European Conformity (CE) marked and commercially available.

      Meier et al. recently published a randomized trial involving 80 patients for major abdominal
      surgery, one group receiving routine care and the other NOL-guided analgesia. In the latter
      group, the remifentanil concentration was reduced when NOL values were below 10 or increased
      when NOL values were above 25 for at least 1 minute. In both groups, propofol was titrated to
      have bispectral index values between 45 and 55. Remifentanil administration was reduced in
      the NOL-guided group: 0.119 ± 0.033 vs 0.086 ± 0.032 μg.kg.min (p < 0.001). In the NOL-
      guided group, 2 out of 40 (5%) patients had hypotension (mean blood pressure less than 55 mm
      Hg) compared to 11 out of 40 (28%) in the control group (p = 0.006) and 16 out of 40 (40%)
      patients received vasoactive drugs vs 25 out of 40 (63%) (p = 0.044).

      Previous results cover a small number of patients treated in a single center. The purpose of
      this study is to confirm this result within a multicenter study involving a larger group of
      patients. Confirmation of a reduction in the dosage of remifentanil allowed by the monitoring
      of nociception by the NOL will open the way to a double control of the administration of
      anesthetic agents: control of the administration of hypnotics by the bispectral index (BIS)
      and control of the administration of opiate by the NOL.
