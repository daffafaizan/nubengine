    
      Since the introduction of the first recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      preparation Gonal-f in the year 1996, a pure drug is available as raw material, which is
      independent of human urine due to biotechnological methods and consequently can be produced
      free of contaminating proteins. In accordance with the recommendations of European Medicines
      Agency (EMEA) in February 1999, on the basis of data from clinical studies, Gonal-f should be
      regarded as the more effective preparation in comparison to urinary FSH. Serono has developed
      a dose calculator, the CONSORT calculator, after analyzing the data from clinical studies for
      Gonal-f. This non-interventional study is planned to examine the consistency of the dose
      recommended by the doctor for the first stimulation day with the dose recommended by the
      CONSORT calculator. All subjects, who undergo stimulation with Gonal-f in preparation for a
      technology of the assisted conception in accordance with the permitted indication, will be
      included in this non-interventional study.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

        -  To examine, how far the dose recommended by the doctor for the first stimulation day
           varies from the dose recommended by the CONSORT calculator
