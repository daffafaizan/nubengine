    
      Background & Significance:

      The dietary supplement being investigated is a formula containing a combination of eight
      probiotic strains. The combination formula was developed to support general gastrointestinal
      and immune health. Each of the strains in the formula have previously been studied in human
      subjects, including several clinical populations. However, the present eight strain
      combination formula has not previously been evaluated in human subjects.

      Research Design & Methods:

      This prospective study will evaluate the tolerability of the eight strain formula in healthy
      adults over a 10-day period. The primary aim of the study is to assess tolerability as
      determined by the frequency of study participants who withdraw from the study due to adverse
      events.
