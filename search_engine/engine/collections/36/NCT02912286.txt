      canals disinfection. The conventional endodontic needle is commonly used because of its ease
      in use and good control of needle depth and irrigant volume. However it carries a higher risk
      of extruding the solution periapically because of positive pressure used in solution
      delivery.

      Passive ultrasonic irrigation is a noncutting irrigation technique that is done with
      ultrasonically activated files with continuous or intermittent flow of irrigant. It was shown
      that it is effective in removing remnants of pulp tissue, dentin debris and planktonic
      bacteria.

      The vibringe (Cavex Holland BV, Haarlem, the Netherlands) is an irrigation device that
      combines manual delivery and sonic activation of the irrigant.

      The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative pain after root canal treatment
      following irrigation by endodontic needle, sonic and passive ultrasonic irrigation
      techniques.
