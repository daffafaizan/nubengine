      sessions of both sham and anodal tsDCS (2 mA) over tenth thoracic vertebra for 20 min
      (reference electrodes on the head vertex). Treatment order was randomly assigned. A evaluator
      rated the pain using the visual analogue scale for pain, Patient Global Assessment and
      Present Pain Intensity.
