      accounting for about 3-6% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is clinically prevalent in the
      elderly and men, commonly with gastrointestinal tract involvement. Since about 80% of
      patients present with advanced stage disease at diagnosis, the prognosis is very poor. Mantle
      cell lymphoma is less frequent in Korean than in Western countries, accounting for about 2%
      of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, with very poor treatment outcome as Western countries.

      In Korea, the clinical information about patients with MCL is very scarce so far and does not
      reflect recent treatment patterns. Firstly, the incidence in Korea is relatively lower than
      that in Western countries, with only about 100 patients a year. Secondly, due to substandard
      national health insurance regulations in Korea, it was not until recently that ibrutinib for
      relapsed/refractory MCL was approved for coverage by the National Health Insurance. In this
      context, the study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in
      patients with relapsed or refractory MCL in Korea.
