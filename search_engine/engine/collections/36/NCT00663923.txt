      criteria,will be treated by photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) using excimer laser.It breaks
      chemical bonds within corneal stroma.It's wavelength is 193 nm that is in the ultraviolets
      range with high energy and very low tissue penetrance. The right or left eye of every patient
      would be allocated randomly to one of the study groups using RandList 1.1. In spite of recent
      advances in excimer laser machines and surgical techniques,correction of astigmatism is not
      more successful compared to myopia. In this study we will compare two methods of laser
      correction of astigmatism regarding to visual acuity,residual error and aberrations.
