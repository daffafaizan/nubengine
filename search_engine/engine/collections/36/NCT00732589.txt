      pain has been shown to affect stroke outcome in a negative way.It interferes with recovery
      after stroke:it can cause distress and reduced activities and can markedly hinder
      rehabilitation.Suprascapular nerve block has been shown to be effective as an analgesic for
      different indications such as shoulder capsulitis.The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of this technique conjunction with a rehabilitation program to reduce
      shoulder pain in hemiplegic patients.
