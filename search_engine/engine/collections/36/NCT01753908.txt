      I. To determine whether isothiocyanate-rich broccoli sprout extract (ITC-BSE) modifies
      biomarkers in breast tumor cells.

      II. To determine whether the intervention alters proliferative and apoptotic markers (Ki-67
      and cleaved caspase-3).

      III. To determine whether the intervention down-regulates the expression of estrogen receptor
      (ER) including both ERalpha and ERbeta.

      IV. To determine whether the intervention induces NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1)
      expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine tolerability of ITC-BSE and compliance in breast cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive broccoli sprout extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14
      immediately prior to surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-14 immediately prior to surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
