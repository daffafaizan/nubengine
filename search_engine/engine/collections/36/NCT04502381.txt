      angioinvasion associated with mucormycosis prevents efficient drug delivery at the diseased
      site. Inhaled amphotericin B achieves drug levels in lung tissue and has been shown to be
      useful in several diseases including chronic pulmonary and allergic bronchopulmonary
      aspergillosis. Further inhaled forms of amphotericin B are associated with less
      nephrotoxicity and other systemic adverse effects. The role of inhaled amphotericin B in
      pulmonary mucormycosis has been previously demonstrated in murine models and anecdotal
      reports. The study hypothesis is that combined therapy with inhalational and intravenous
      amphotericin B is likely to result in better outcomes as compared with intravenous
      amphotericin B alone for treatment of pulmonary mucormycosis
