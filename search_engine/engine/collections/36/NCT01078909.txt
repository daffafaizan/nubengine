      injury, irritation or infection. Prolonged or chronic inflammation is involved in the
      etiology of several diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, rheumatoid
      arthritis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. The evidence
      base clearly demonstrates benefits of diet in ameliorating inflammation and reducing the
      burden of chronic disease. With respect to marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids and various
      markers of inflammation related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), both population studies and
      randomized controlled supplementation trials have yielded mixed results.

      Some studies have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between dietary eicosapentaenoic
      acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) and increased membrane (phospholipid) EPA and DHA.
      Red blood cell (RBC) EPA + DHA content has been proposed as a potential, modifiable marker
      for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. It is well established that these fatty acids are
      precursors of series-3 prostanoids, thromboxanes, 5-series leukotrienes, and novel lipid
      mediators such as resolvins and protectins that have anti-inflammatory effects. We
      hypothesize that nutritionally-relevant intakes of omega-3 fatty acids are able to blunt the
      usual response to an inflammatory stimulus. We propose to test this hypothesis using both in
      vivo (i.v. endotoxin challenge) and ex vivo (endotoxin-stimulated monocytes) models in a
      6-month, dose-response study with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid supplements in healthy
      volunteers.
