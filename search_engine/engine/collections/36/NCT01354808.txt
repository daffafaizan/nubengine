      closely associated with the risk of post-PCI myonecrosis and ischemic events occurrence. In
      the ACCEL-AMI (Adjunctive Cilostazol versus high maintenance-dose ClopidogrEL in patients
      with Acute Myocardial Infarction)study, adjunctive cilostazol increased platelet inhibition
      compared with double-dose clopidogrel. Meanwhile, statins can reduce the extent of
      myonecrosis via limiting inflammation and myocardial infarct size by activating
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), ecto-5'-nucleotidase, Akt/endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase (eNOS), and the downstream effectors inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Inhibition of PI3K, adenosine receptors, eNOS, iNOS, or COX-2
      abrogates the protective effects of statins. In animal study, the combination of low-dose
      statin with cilostazol synergistically limits infarct size. Multiple studies have shown that
      cilostazol can influence inflammation and RISK pathway using the similar pathway with statin.
      This study will be performed to evaluate the role of adjunctive cilostazol in platelet
      inhibition, inflammation, and myonecrosis compared with standard treatment.
