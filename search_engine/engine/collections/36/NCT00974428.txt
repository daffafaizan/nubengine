    
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of the joints. The main symptom of OA is pain
      and later followed by stiffness and decreased function of the joints. It is estimated to
      affect more than 100 million people worldwide, substantially decreasing their quality of
      their life. Treatment that can relieve the disease symptoms and more particularly the pain
      level can greatly improve the quality of life and function of patients suffering from OA of
      weight-bearing joints such as the knee. Wobenzym® N is a fixed compound made of plant and
      animal enzyme products with the non-enzymatic component rutin recommended for the treatment
      of musculoskeletal disorders. The Wobenzym® N formulation contains, per tablet: pancreatin
      100 mg, trypsin 24 mg and chymotrypsin 1 mg (from pancreas); bromelain 45 mg; papain 60 mg;
      and rutin 50 mg.

      Over 50 clinical studies have been conducted using similar oral proteolytic enzyme
      preparations-- Wobenzym® and Phlogenzym®-- with consistently positive findings related to
      rheumatoid arthritis, sprains and strains, reduction of C-reactive protein, sports injuries
      and joint and muscular pain, as well as OA of the knee. Several comparative studies conducted
      with Phlogenzym®, an oral enzyme-rutin combination containing bromelain 90 mg, trypsin 48 mg
      and rutin 100 mg, have proved the product to be effective and safe in the treatment of OA as
      compared to NSAIDs. [For review, see Leipner, et al. Biodrugs 2001;15(12):779-89.]
