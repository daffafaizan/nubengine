    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients are evaluated for porphyria type and factors contributing to
      the clinical expression of their particular form of the disease. Testing includes erythrocyte
      porphobilinogen deaminase, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, plasma porphyrins, and urinary and
      fecal porphyrins and precursors.

      Selected patients are entered into other porphyrin research protocols in this and other
      institutions, including analysis of DNA to identify specific mutations in genes for heme
      biosynthetic pathway enzymes.
