      The investigators want to learn more about the safety and side effects of XL888 and hope to
      find out what dose of the drug can be given safely without serious side effects. Based on
      research done in a laboratory on tissue samples (cells collected from living things), the
      researchers think that XL888 might help to make vemurafenib work to fight cancer cells in the
      body for a longer period of time.
