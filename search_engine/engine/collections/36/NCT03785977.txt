      younger and younger patients. One issue that has not been well evaluated is the contribution
      of these devices to airway dead space in young children and infants. Volumetric capnography
      is the only non-invasive technology available at the current time to evaluate airway
      deadspace. Volumetric capnography essentially monitors the flow of CO2 over time and from the
      expired waveform one can determine different respiratory parameters including dead space.
      This is clinically important in young children as the clinician begins to evaluate whether or
      not to use an endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway in these patients. To perform this
      investigation the study team will use volumetric capnography to examine the airway dead space
      associated with these devices during and elective general surgery and urologic procedures in
      healthy children between the ages of 0 and 6 years of age (roughly 5-20 kg).

      Participants in the study will be given ETT or Air-Q as an intervention, but the investigator
      does not assign specific interventions to the study participants.
