      anecdotally based on in vitro or extrapolated evidence. It is important to acknowledge that
      there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these agents, and their efficacy
      for COVID-19 is unknown. FDA-approved drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,
      lopinavir/ritonavir, monoclonal IL-6 antibodies, JAK inhibitors, thalidomide, and the new
      investigational drug remdesivir, have been proposed for repurposing to fight COVID-19 and its
      complications.

      A medication risk stratification strategy will be used to simulate the impacts of different
      potential repurposed drugs for COVID-19 and the Medication Risk Score (MRS) which is used as
      a predictive tool for ADEs. A retrospective study will be conducted using de-identified drug
      claims data for commercially insured patients.
