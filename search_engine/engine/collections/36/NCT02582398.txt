      brain between seasonal affective disorder patients and healthy controls using positron
      emission tomography. In addition, the investigators aim to demonstrate the impact of light
      therapy on MAO-A distribution by investigating patients and controls in the winter before
      bright light therapy, in the winter after bright-light therapy, and in the summer. Bright
      light therapy will be placebo controlled, randomized, and double blinded.
