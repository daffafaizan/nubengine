      high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for the
      patients with multiple myeloma.The investigators already investigated the thalidomide-based
      chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM. The combined regimen consisted of
      cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) for induction treatment. CTD
      chemotherapy resulted in a favorable response with 79.4% overall response rate including
      42.6% complete response (CR) or very good partial complete response (VGPR), and tolerable
      toxicity in MM patients. Moreover, CTD chemotherapy did not affect the yield of the stem cell
      collection.The investigators also published that the clinical efficacy and safety of a
      four-drug combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone was
      assessed for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma Vel-CTD chemotherapy.
