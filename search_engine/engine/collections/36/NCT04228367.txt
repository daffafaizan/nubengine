      obligations according to Medical Device Directive and MEDDEV 2.12/2 and the Medical Devices
      Regulation (MDR 2017/745). The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of
      confirming the safety and performance of the JuggerStitch Device used for meniscal repair
      according to the product labelling (IFU).

      The objectives of the study are to calculate the overall clinical success rate and the
      performance, and confirm the safety of the JuggerStitch Meniscal Repair Device. The primary
      endpoint of this study is defined by the absence of reoperation due to meniscal tear. This
      will be measured against the success criteria of the absence of reoperation in 90.2% of the
      cases at one year.
