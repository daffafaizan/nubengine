      of small proteins known as cathelicidins are known to be responsible for immune defense
      against such infections. People with AD or psoriasis seem to be missing these proteins from
      their skin. The purpose of this study is to determine if the amount of cathelicidins and
      other small proteins in saliva is a predictor for the amount found in the skin.

      This is a single visit observational study. People with AD or psoriasis, as well as healthy
      participants, are being recruited for this study. Participants will provide a detailed
      medical history and undergo a physical examination. In addition, saliva and blood collection,
      and skin punch biopsies will be performed.
