      but associated with higher frequency of toxicities. IL-2 given at lower doses have
      demonstrated similar results than higher doses but it requires further study. RCC is highly
      vascular and expresses high levels of VEGF. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed
      against the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) responsible for angiogenesis.

      The study is designed to evaluate a response defined as time to progression, safety and
      toxicity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Tissue correlation to evaluate the
      impact of vascular VEGF on clinical outcome will be retrospectively performed
