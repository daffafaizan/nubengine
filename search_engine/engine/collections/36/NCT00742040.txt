      pediatric cardiac medication and overall their safety in children is widely accepted.
      Pediatric formulary recommendations for ACEi suggest starting with a low initial dose (0.1
      mg/kg), to avoid hypotension, and up-titration for a maintenance dose. However, side ranges
      are quoted for maintenance doses and no guidance is given as to the best method of
      up-titration, The physician is left uncertain of the optimal dose and how best to achieve it.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to be in a position to provide physicians caring for
      children with heart disease information about how to safely up-titrate this widely used
      medication, and by doing so to improve dosing in the wider pediatric population.
