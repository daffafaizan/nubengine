    
      Adult patients affected by PD and suffering from motor fluctuations will be screened for
      participation.

      If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the participant will enter in the baseline
      assessment phase and undergo 1 night baseline PSG and 1 week baseline actigraphy. The patient
      will then start the treatment with 50 mg/day of Safinamide per os for 2 weeks (escalation
      phase). Then, safinamide will be increased up to 100 mg/day and, if tolerated, the treatment
      will last for 10 weeks (maintenance phase). At week 12 (end of treatment), the
      questionnaires, actigraphy and PSG will be repeated. A safety follow-up visit is scheduled 4
      weeks after study treatment completion.

      The treatment will be continued thereafter in all patients if medically indicated.
