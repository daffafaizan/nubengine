      sequence with a total of 12 minutes scanning time to our clinical screening breast DCE MRI
      examination before contrast medium injection and at the end of scan. This additional scanning
      sequence may provide faster and better quantitative tissue characterization comparing to
      conventional MR sequences. There is no investigational contrast agent in this study. We
      propose that the additional MRF sequence may provide faster and more accurate tissue
      characteristics imaging for clinical evaluation of breast tissue. Patients will be enrolled
      in with scheduled high risk screening DCE MRI (n=30). The MR imaging will be performed in the
      clinical 1.5T MR scanners in UNC as normally done for the patients MRI schedule. We only add
      an additional MRF sequence within the MRI exam just prior to the contrast enhancement scan.

      Quantitative measurement of the breast tissue will be performed after the MR exam. The
      region-of-interest (ROI) of normal breast parenchyma was recorded. The ROI will be saved and
      encoded to the T1 map, T2 map in MRF, T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging. A large
      variety of imaging ROI-based quantitative measures will be calculated among normal glands in
      bilateral breasts to evaluate different ROI characteristics among different patients and
      between bilateral breasts in each patient.
