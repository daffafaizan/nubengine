      investigational product designed to activate a man's immune response, so they can detect
      prostate cancer cells and initiate an immune response against prostate cancer antigens.

      If patients decide to participate and are eligible, they will be enrolled in the study and
      will receive active product (CreaVax-PC). In detail, patients will receive CreaVax-PC
      injection at intervals of 3 weeks, maximum 6 times during 21 weeks. PSA increase rate is a
      primary evaluation variables and tumor suppression effect is secondary evaluation variables.
      We also evaluate time to progression, overall survival and immune response.
