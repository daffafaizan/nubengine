      are imperfect and as a result many men undergo unnecessary treatment for a disease that would
      not have caused their deaths. An improved method to risk stratify men with prostate cancer
      prior to definitive therapy may reduce the over-treatment rate, while maintaining or
      improving mortality.

      Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a novel imaging modality that uses low-intensity,
      near-infrared light to characterize tissue. DOT analyzes the light being reflected and
      transmitted through tissue to generate three-dimensional images of chromophores and light
      scattering. As such, DOT serves as a functional imaging modality, measuring both tissue
      vascularity and architecture. The investigators believe that DOT will be able to detect
      prostate cancer in men suspected of the disease and will also be able to risk-stratify
      patients found to have prostate cancer to help guide treatment options. DOT may be able to
      directly measure two factors important in the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer: the
      Gleason score and microvessel density (MVD).
