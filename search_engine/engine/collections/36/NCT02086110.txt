      the intestinal flora of children with autism spectrum disorders. This study is divided into
      two parts, each five weeks long, with a two week break in between. During one part of the
      study, a prebiotic (milk oligosaccharides from bovine colostrum) will be given. During the
      other part of the study, the synbiotic composed of the prebiotic and probiotic
      (bifidobacterium infantis) will be given. Stool will be analyzed at the end of each study arm
      to determine content of bifidobacteria.
