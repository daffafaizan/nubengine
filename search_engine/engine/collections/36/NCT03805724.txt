      gingivitis patients (group 1), 40 from chronic periodontitis patients (group 2) plus 40
      samples from healthy volunteers (group 3). Diagnosis of parasitic stages will rely on direct
      microscopic detection using permanent stains, Trichrome stain and haematoxylin and eosin
      stain in addition to direct wet mount examination.
