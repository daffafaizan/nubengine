      routine laboratory values (including antibody-profile and iron status), diagnostic
      procedures, significant comorbidities, therapeutic managements (e.g. thoracic ultrasound,
      HRCT), and disease outcomes over 10 years.

      In addition, blood biobank samples for translational research will be collected in a subgroup
      of patients with systemic sclerosis over serial time points to study the systemic
      inflammatory and profibrotic phenotype of patients. In summary, this registry will monitor
      the disease course of pulmonary manifestations of patients with CTD and may be
      hypothesis-generating and provide new insights in underlying inflammatory/pro-fibrotic
      patterns.
