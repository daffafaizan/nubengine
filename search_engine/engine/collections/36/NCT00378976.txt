    
      Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is common among HIV infected persons. HSV-2 reactivation
      is associated with increased plasma and genital HIV-1 levels, and in vitro, HSV-2 upregulates
      HIV transcription.

      The trial assessed whether HSV-2 suppression reduces rectal and plasma HIV-1 levels in HIV-1,
      HSV-2 co-infected men who have sex with men (MSM).

      Conducted in Lima Peru, 20 antiretroviral naive HIV-1 and HSV-2 seropositive MSM with CD4
      >200 were randomly assigned to receive valacyclovir 500 mg bid or placebo for 8 weeks, than a
      2 week washout period, followed by the alternative regimen for 8 weeks. Men collected daily
      home anogenital swabs for HSV DNA PCR, had three weekly anoscopy procedures for collection of
      rectal mucosal secretions for HIV-1 RNA, HSV DNA, and weekly plasma HIV-1 RNA by PCR.
      Outcomes were plasma and rectal HIV-1 levels by study arm.
