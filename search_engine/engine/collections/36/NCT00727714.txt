      Cement dust is suspected to be one of the main factors causing increased mortality among
      workers not only in the cement production industry, but also in the construction industry
      worldwide. Our aim is to examine possible changes in lung function, nitric oxide levels and
      systemic inflammatory markers in cement dust exposed workers, during one shift (6-8 hours).

      METHODS:

      All employees from Norwegian cement plants, are invited to participate. The workers will
      perform spirometry, single-breath determination of carbon monoxide uptake, blood samples
      before and after a working shift of 6-8 hours, and again after 24 hours. Information on
      respiratory symptoms, allergy and former respiratory disease as well as exposure information
      will be given on a self-reported questionnaire. Changes in lung function indices, nitric
      oxide levels and serum inflammatory markers will be calculated. Nitric oxide will only be
      measured in non-smokers. We will compare cement dust exposed workers with low-level or
      non-exposed workers (controls).
