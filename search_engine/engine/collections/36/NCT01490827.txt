      available within pre-market approval studies. Safety data will be monitored to ensure
      continued acceptability of risks to study participants, and an attempt will be made to
      include all eligible and willing participants implanted with Argus II. Measures of visual
      function that may contribute to device improvements will also be gathered and evaluated.
