      The development of microvascular complications in diabetes is a complex process, in which
      endothelial dysfunction is of importance. Emerging evidence suggests that arginase is a key
      mediator of endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by reciprocally
      regulating nitric oxide bioavailability. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis
      that arginase activity is increased and that arginase contributes to microvascular
      endothelial function in patients with T2DM and microvascular dysfunction.

      Method

      Microvascular endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation are investigated in
      patients with T2DM (n =12) and healthy age-matched control subjects (n =12) with
      laser-Doppler flowmetry during iontophoretic application of acetylcholine and sodium
      nitroprusside, respectively, before and after intra-arterial administration of the arginase
      inhibitor N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (0.1 mg/min) for 120 min.
