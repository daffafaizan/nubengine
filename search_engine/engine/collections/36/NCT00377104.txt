      I. Determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
      flavopiridol (alvocidib) as consolidation chemotherapy after cytoreduction chemotherapy in
      patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of flavopiridol in these
      patients.

      II. Determine the complete response (CR) and overall response rate (CR and partial response)
      of patients treated with flavopiridol.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes (loading dose), followed by alvocidib IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients
      are treated at the MTD (i.e., recommended phase II dose). Patients undergo blood collection
      at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and cytokine studies (levels of
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6, -11, and -16) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA). Interphase cytogenetics, p53 mutational status, p53/ATM function, V_H
      mutational status, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) overexpression, and
      single nucleotide polymorphisms are also examined.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 months and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
