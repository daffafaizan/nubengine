      to 20 hemophilia A subjects. Subjects will be recruited over 1 year for the 5-day protocol.

      Following a 72-hour washout period, factor levels and bone biomarkers will be followed before
      and after 50 units/kg replacement on Day 1 and 20 units/kg replacement on Day 3. Each subject
      can serve as their Figure 4. Fracture rates in PwH compared to historic controls.
