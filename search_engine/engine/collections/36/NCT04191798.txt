      single-blind, prospective cohort study to be conducted at one investigational site in the
      United States. The study compares at-home telerehabilitation system versus traditional
      outpatient PT following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The telerehabilitation system involves
      a tablet-enabled patient engagement application, the KinexConnect App, to be used in
      conjunction with a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine.
