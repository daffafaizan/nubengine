      Therapy (ACT) as compared to a control psychotherapy, Present Centered Therapy (PCT), for
      individuals with distress and impairment who deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom
      and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). ACT was selected for study because it has a number
      of advantages for this population. It is not tied to any particular symptom constellation, so
      it can be applied to a variety of presenting concerns (Hayes, Luoma, et al., 2006; Öst, 2008,
      Powers et al., 2009), resulting in reduced training burden for clinicians and less need for
      applying sequential treatments to address co-morbidities. ACT has good face validity (i.e.,
      "it makes sense") and conveys a compelling message to young Service Members and Veterans. ACT
      asks individuals to move forward in accordance with one's values regardless of limitations
      rather than struggling against those limitations. ACT appears to be acceptable to patients
      (mean attrition of 15.4% in 13 RCTs (Öst, 2008). ACT is being widely disseminated without
      adequate evidence of its effectiveness for this important population.
