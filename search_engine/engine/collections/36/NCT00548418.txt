      led to improvements in survival, but the prognosis for patients with recurrent, metastatic
      cervical cancer remains poor. There is the need for more effective treatments for the
      management of recurrent/persistent cervical cancer. Angiogenesis appears to play an important
      role in cervical cancer development and progression, therefore VEGF inhibition appears to be
      a rationale therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer. There is increasing evidence that
      combining an anti-angiogenic agent with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation enhances
      anti-tumor activity. This study combines the current most active chemotheraputic regimen for
      cervical cancer (cisplatin + topotecan) with an anti-angiogenic agent.
