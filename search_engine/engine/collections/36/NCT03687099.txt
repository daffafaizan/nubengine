      studied for the prognostic value of PDL1 and IL17 infiltration (in association with Pr
      Ghiringhelli ; INSERM ; Dijon) . However, CD45 is present at the surface of all leucocytes.
      The purpose of this project is to better characterize the nature and functionality of the
      CD45+ cells that infiltrate GBM (lymphocytes and their sub-types, macrophages, microglial
      cells). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded GBM samples will be studied. A panel of immune cell
      antibody will be used for the immuno-histological (IH) study. Furthermore, the investigator
      will compare these data with those obtained by the nanoString technology, a multiplexed
      measurement of gene expression.
