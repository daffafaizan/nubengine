    
      Patients with elevated BP, identified by the electronic medical record, will be recruited for
      study enrollment. Patients will be mailed a telemonitoring kit including an electronic tablet
      equipped with a wireless BP cuff that transmits measurements directly to the UMMC electronic
      medical record and monitored by the UMMC Center for Telehealth. Patients will participate in
      a 6 month intervention period during which they will transmit daily BP recordings with
      regular contact by a Telehealth nurse coordinator who will provide education and encourage
      healthy lifestyle habits. Every 2 weeks BP medications will be adjusted according to an
      evidence-based treatment algorithm managed by the Center for Telehealth pharmacist using a
      standardized physician-approved protocol. Data analysis will track metrics of study
      enrollment, study completion, safety, therapeutic intensification, and BP change from
      baseline.
