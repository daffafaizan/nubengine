    
      This protocol is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a procedure for treating
      chronic (>1 year post) stroke patients who still cannot move the hand affected by the stroke.
      The treatment involves: (1) assisted hand movement by a mechanical device, (2) mechanical
      vibration applied to the surface of the forearm, and (3) stimulation of the brain with either
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcortical direct current stimulation (DCS).
      Subjects receiving TMS during treatment are expected to respond more fully (i.e., increased
      volitional EMG) in the treated hand compared to those receiving DCS.
