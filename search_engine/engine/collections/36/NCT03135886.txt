    
      Using the most recent National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) data
      available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as the
      sampling frame, 51 sites will be randomly selected to participate in the study. Site
      randomization to condition will occur on a rolling basis. Selected sites will be invited to
      participate in the study and randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions
      (17 sites per condition) -- information control, HIV PC, and HIV/HCV PC. The control
      condition will be an HIV testing informational product consisting of the official NIDA/SAMHSA
      Blending Initiative product, "HIV Rapid Testing in Substance Abuse Treatment Programs," ARTAS
      intervention information and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) information that will be
      provided to OTPs to educate and motivate them about the importance of offering on-site HIV
      testing and linkage to care. In the active PC conditions, champions and key OTP staff will be
      provided coaching and support for the implementation of an innovation (i.e., offering HIV
      testing on-site and linking persons living with HIV to care) and for sustaining resulting
      improvements in testing.

      De-identified aggregate client data on HIV and HCV testing and linkage to care will be
      provided by the sites for four 6-month-long time intervals: T1 (up to 6 months prior to
      randomization), T2 (during the intervention/control period, up to 6 months
      post-randomziation), T3 (7-12 months post-randomization), and T4 (13-18 months
      post-randomization). Qualitative and quantitative site-level data will also be collected
      immediately preceding randomization and again during interval T3.
