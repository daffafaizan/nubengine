      dialysis patients. It is believed that increased micro-inflammation plays an important role
      in the pathophysiological process of cardiovascular disease. High porous dialysis membranes
      can better eliminate inflammatory mediators as compared to standard dialysis membranes. In
      this study, the high porous dialysis membrane HCO1100 is investigated for its potential
      capability to improve the cardiovascular status of chronic dialysis patients.
