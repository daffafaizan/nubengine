      disease. However, some mouth bacteria can cause tooth decay and gum disease. The purpose of a
      probiotic tablet for the mouth is to put known healthy bacteria in the mouth. This study will
      compare the effect of the probiotic tablet on the levels of harmful or disease causing
      bacteria in the mouth to a placebo tablet that does not contain any probiotic bacteria.
