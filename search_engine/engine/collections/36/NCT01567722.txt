        -  To obtain high-quality, clinically annotated tissue from patients with human
           immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 malignancy.

        -  To study clinical, genetic, and immunologic parameters that have prognostic significance
           and/or are involved in the initiation and progression of HIV-1 malignancies, including
           complete genomic sequence determination of HIV-associated diffuse large B-cell
           lymphomas, lung cancer, anal cancer, and cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo tumor, lymph node, bone marrow, or skin biopsy, and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells collection. Samples are submitted to the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC)
      Biorepository and transferred to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR). Samples are
      then analyzed by the Genome Science Center of British Columbia (GSC-BC) and the HIV+ Tumor
      Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) for full genomic sequencing analysis that may
      include, but are not limited to, array-based gene expression profiling, comparative genome
      hybridization, and single nucleotide polymorphism studies by flow cytometry, cytogenetics,
      and molecular studies. Patients' clinical data, demographics, and treatment given are also
      collected prospectively in order to record treatment outcome and toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years for data-reporting purposes.
