      women with breast ductal carcinoma in situ and associated neoplastic and preneoplastic
      lesions. II. Determine whether treatment with fenretinide and tamoxifen administered daily
      will cause significant modulation of proposed surrogate endpoint biomarkers in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according to
      histological diagnosis (hyperplasia vs carcinoma). All patients undergo a core biopsy and
      fine needle aspiration of the index lesion and are then assigned randomly to a treatment arm.
      Arm I receives tamoxifen and fenretinide daily. Arm II receives a placebo daily. Both arms
      continue for 14-28 days, until definitive surgery or a second biopsy is performed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study, 50 patients per
      arm.
