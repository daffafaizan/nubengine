      motor recovery after stroke, by combining rTMS and BCI training. Treatments will consist of
      low frequency rTMS applied to the contralesional hemisphere, followed by BCI training to
      encourage activity within the lesioned hemisphere. The primary objective of this study is to
      test the main hypothesis above in a stroke patient population. Subjects will also undergo a
      period of BCI only treatments after completion of the combined rTMS and BCI portion.
