    
      A Phase 2, open-label, randomized, parallel group, multi-centered study designed to evaluate
      the immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose series of avian influenza vaccine plus AS03
      adjuvant according to different regimens, in adults aged 18-64 years. All subjects will
      receive active study vaccine; no subjects are to receive placebo. A total of 312 subjects
      will be enrolled in this study at approximately 3 study centers in Canada. All subjects will
      attend formal study center visits for safety and immunogenicity assessments on Days 0, 21,
      42, and 182. Additional formal study center visits will be scheduled at additional timepoints
      for subjects in particular dose groups. In addition, a telephone call will be conducted for
      all subjects on Day 51
