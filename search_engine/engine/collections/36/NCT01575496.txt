      noise in the absence of internal or external stimuli. Research indicates that tinnitus may
      develop due to maladaptive plastic changes in the auditory cortex and limbic system. These
      changes can be targeted using safe and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques like
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). TDCS alters the excitability of the cortex
      using a weak direct current and may lead to long-term plastic changes, making it a potential
      therapeutic tool for the treatment of tinnitus.

      Transient improvements in tinnitus have been reported after inhibitory stimulation of the
      auditory cortex and after excitatory stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, however the
      effects of a combined stimulation paradigm remain unknown. The investigators hypothesize that
      a cumulative effect will be observed following repeated sessions of tDCS by modulating both
      the excitability of the auditory cortex and prefrontal cortex.
