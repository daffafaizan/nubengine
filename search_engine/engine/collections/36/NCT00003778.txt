      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas
      treated with dolastatin 10.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, prior therapy, histologic subtype, stage of disease at diagnosis, and current status
      of disease (recurrent vs metastatic).

      Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV over 10 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.
