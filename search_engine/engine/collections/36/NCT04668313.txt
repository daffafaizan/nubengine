    
      Altair medical has developed a pre-commercial investigational wearable (chest-worn) biosensor
      which can measure continuous respiratory rate and respiratory events. This sensor has been
      verified to have good correlation with reference impedance plethysmography data.

      Inclusion criteria:

      All inpatients in the QEUH with respiratory failure from any cause.

      Exclusion criteria:

      Lack of capacity to consent

      Physiology data will be correlated with event time-course data including oxygen and breathing
      support requirements, deterioration, hospital discharge and status at 28 days and 90 days
      post discharge.

      A small subset of patients will have further investigations - parasternal EMG; thoracic
      electrical impedance tomography; forced oscillometry and post discharge Altair and Fitbit
      data.

      Study analysis will include machine learning model development with the objective of
      developing risk-predictions for clinically significant deteriorations.
