      beneficial effects in older malnourished individuals living in the community; there will be a
      reduction in hospitalizations, falls and weight loss in association with improvements in
      functional measures and increases in lean body mass. The present study is designed to examine
      the effect of 12 months oral nutrition supplementation and androgen therapy, alone and
      combined, on (i) frequency and length of hospitalisations; (ii) functional status; (iii) body
      composition and weight; (iv) living arrangements; (v) death rate, in community dwelling
      under-nourished men and women, 65 years and older.
