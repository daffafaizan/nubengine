      post-transplantation recurrence. A combination treatment associating interferon-α and
      ribavirin has shown some efficacy, but this efficacy has not been assessed yet in a
      placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. In our study, all included transplanted
      patients will be treated during 1 year with interferon-α and ribavirin. At the end of this
      period, they will be randomized to receive a maintenance treatment with ribavirin or a
      placebo for 1 additional year. Efficacy will be assessed on virological response after 30
      months of treatment.
