      known as warfarin. Recently at least three novel oral anticoagulant agents were used in the
      treatment of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

      Novel oral anticoagulant drugs will require no blood taking for INR monitoring, hence less
      visit and more convenience to patients. Latest studies also showed lesser rate of bleeding as
      compared to warfarin and hence relatively safer.
