      (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation positive NSCLC,who have progressed following
      prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
      (EGFR-TKI) agent. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M
      mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen.
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 by assessment of
      Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
