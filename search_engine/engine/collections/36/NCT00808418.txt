    
      This aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at
      escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose) when combined with a
      fixed dose of docetaxel and concomitant prednisone. This study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of elesclomol and docetaxel.
