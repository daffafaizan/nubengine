      for use in postmarketing surveillance into the foetal effects of maternal medication use in
      pregnancy. This study which recruited women between October 2012 and January 2014 explored
      whether women in participating EU countries were willing to provide information via the
      internet to enable prospective collection of medication exposure data and information about
      other life style factors during pregnancy. The study's main objective was to assess the
      extent to which data collected directly from pregnant women via the Internet and an
      interactive voice response system (IVRS) would provide information on medication use and
      other potential risk factors throughout pregnancy that is suitable for research purposes.

      Pregnant women were recruited for the study using a variety of methods and were asked about
      use of medications, alcohol and tobacco, recreational drugs, herbals and other factors that
      could negatively affect birth outcome. The pilot study revealed that women would indeed
      volunteer to provide information on medication and lifestyle factors during pregnancy, with
      2521 women enrolling from four countries over 8-18 months. The four countries include the
      United Kingdom (UK), The Netherlands (NL), Denmark (DK) and Poland (PL). Of those who
      enrolled in the PROTECT pregnancy study, only 2066 provided any data, with all but one
      providing data via internet.
