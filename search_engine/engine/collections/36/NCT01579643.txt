      because the rejection rate in pediatric PK is 4-5 times higher than in adults. In addition,
      the intraocular inflammatory reaction in infants often leads to synechiae, glaucoma, and
      cataract. Because LALAK does not penetrate the eye and preserves the host endothelium, it
      could reduce the risk of these complications. Keratoplasty must be performed at this early
      age to prevent amblyopia.

      In this study, OCT-guided LALAK will be performed in patients whose vision is limited by
      opacity in the anterior 2/3 of the cornea. The objective is to determine if LALAK will
      provide an equal or better visual outcome than traditional PK without the associated
      post-operative complications.
