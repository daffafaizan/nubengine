    
      A randomised study with an historical control group.

      Initially data on prespecified endpoints are collected for an historical control group of 200
      patients (100 radial and 100 femoral procedures). Hereafter 400 patients are randomized to
      ultrasound guided or conventional sheath insertion (200 radial and 200 femoral procedures).

      Only high-volume physicians who have passed a ultrasound course are allowed to include
      patients.
