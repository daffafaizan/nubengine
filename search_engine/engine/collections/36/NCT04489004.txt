    
      This is an open label, multi-center, randomized parallel control clinical trial. Patients
      with persistent atrial fibrillation are 1:1 randomized into the experimental group (driver
      ablation+ circumferential pulmonary vein isolation) or the control group (stepwise ablation).
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation recurrence rate and other indicators are analyzed to
      demonstrate the role of driver mechanism in maintenance substrate of persistent atrial
      fibrillation and evaluate the clinical outcomes of driver mapping and ablation strategy in
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.
