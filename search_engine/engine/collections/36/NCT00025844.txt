      conditioning, the organism develops fear to the phasic explicit cue (e.g., a light) that was
      associated with the aversive unconditioned stimulus (e.g., a shock) during conditioning as
      well as to the environmental context (e.g., the experimental room). Explicit cue conditioning
      and context conditioning are separate processes mediated by distinct brain structures.
      Whereas explicit cue conditioning is only dependent on the amygdala, context conditioning
      involves the amygdala, the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We
      have been using explicit cue and context conditioning as models of phasic fear and sustained
      anxiety, respectively. However, contextual fear is relatively difficult to study in humans in
      the laboratory because it requires two experimental sessions and the use of different
      experimental rooms. Advances in computer-generated visual stimulation now offer the
      possibility to develop more sophisticated paradigms in the laboratory that could facilitate
      the design of fear conditioning studies. In addition, compared to traditional paradigms,
      computer generated three-dimensional stimulation provides the opportunity to create more
      realistic virtual environment. The main objective of this study is to use virtual reality to
      further our understanding of fear conditioning in humans.
