      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of tretinoin with
      lithium carbonate in subjects with non promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicities associated with the combination of lithium
      (lithium carbonate) and tretinoin.

      II. To determine the ability of lithium to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) activity
      in circulating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and to enhance the retinoic acid receptor
      expression.

      III. To determine the ability of lithium and tretinoin to induce differentiation and/or
      growth inhibition of AML cells.

      IV. To determine the response rate of acute myeloid treatment to treatment with the
      combination of Tretinoin and Lithium.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tretinoin.

      Patients receive tretinoin orally (PO) every 12 hours on days 1-7 and 15-21 and lithium
      carbonate PO three times daily (TID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
