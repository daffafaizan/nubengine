      on pregnancy outcomes of recurrent pregnancy loss with undifferentiated connective tissue
      diseases Design: a multi-center, randomised, open-label, paralleled study. Patients: Pregnant
      patients with recurrent pregnancy loss and undifferentiated connective tissue diseases
      without any known etiology for pregnancy loss (detailed in section 10).

      Methods: 420 selected patients are divided into 3 parallel groups (detailed in section 8).

      Randomization: Patients who present to relevant clinics for management of recurrent
      spontaneous abortion (RSA) will be evaluated for inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria by
      a formed physician. Once patient is eligible for the study, the co-investigator will obtain
      written patient's consent. Participants will be randomized into one of the 3 groups.
      Randomized numbers will be generated by pharmacology research personnel in Renji Hospital.
      Given the different administrated medications, neither the patient nor the provider will be
      blinded.

      Follow-up: Consultation will be scheduled every 4 weeks from confirmed pregnancy until
      delivery. The co-investigator will complete a follow-up survey including clinical, biological
      data.

      Missing data: Patients are willing to drop the study, unavailable, incompliant, with severe
      complications or with severe adverse effects. The missing data will be recorded in detail and
      be analysed with last pregnancy outcome.
