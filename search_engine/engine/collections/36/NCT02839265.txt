    
      Primary Objective

        -  To explore the efficacy of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with FLT3
           ligand immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To establish the feasibility and safety of combining SBRT with FLT3 ligand immunotherapy
           for advanced NSCLC.

        -  To quantify and evaluate potential surrogate outcomes for clinical efficacy of this
           treatment approach, including radiographic responses, immunologic responses, and
           circulating tumor cell levels.
