      approach to stent retrievers in patients presenting with AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.
      Any cleared mechanical stent retriever (SR) or aspiration catheter device that is in common
      use in the operator's region of practice is approved for use. Prior to releasing any sites to
      enroll patients, we will collect the following information on the most recent 20 acute
      ischemic stroke cases, at least five of which must have used direct aspiration as a first
      approach, and at least five of which must have used stent retrievers as a first approach. It
      is permissible to go back in time farther than the most recent 20 cases to fulfill either or
      both of these requirements. There is no requirement for the remaining 10 cases. The
      datapoints to be collected include:

        -  Age

        -  Gender

        -  LVO location

        -  Side of LVO

        -  NIHSS at presentation

        -  Time of onset

        -  Time of hospital arrival

        -  Time imaging completed

        -  Time of groin puncture

        -  Time of revascularization, if applicable

        -  Time procedure terminated, if revascularization was not obtained

        -  tPA given pre-procedure

        -  Time of IV-tPA

        -  Imaging type

        -  Perfusion imaging

        -  Devices used

        -  Passes attempted

        -  Device success

        -  Standard and modified final TICI scores

        -  Outcome measurements: incidence of post-op ICH, discharge and 90 day NIHSS, discharge
           and 90 day mRS, any and all complications Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion
           criteria, consent to participate, and who are randomized will be considered enrolled.
           Treatment arm will be randomly assigned by a central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to
           treatment with either ADAPT or SR thrombectomy. Data on each patient will be collected
           at the time of enrollment and treatment, and at subsequent follow-up visits.
