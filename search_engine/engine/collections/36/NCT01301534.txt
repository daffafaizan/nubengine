    
      Approximately 1700 male patients (DoD beneficiaries) between the ages of 65-75 will be
      selected from their medical records. The information on the attached abstracted data sheet
      will be collected. As part of standard patient care operations, the Family Medicine and
      Internal Medicine Departments will inform patients on the need to receive a AAA screening
      ultrasound, based on their primary care manager's (PCM) preference for clinical notification:

        1. Nurse initiated Telephone Consult (T-Con) (see attached)

        2. Mail-0ut Letter to the patient (see attached)

        3. Provider, Nurse and Technician Education with point-of-care patient referrals , Exam
           Room Flyer

        4. Control group (i.e. usual care)

      The Provider, Nurse and Technician Education will consist of a presentation given by the
      Principal Investigator (see attached PowerPoint) to the Family Medicine and Internal Medicine
      clinic staff and the posting of Exam Room Flyers in each Family Medicine and Internal
      Medicine exam room to prompt and encourage patient referrals for a AAA screening ultrasound.

      Information requested on the attached abstracted data sheet will be used for initial
      identification of patients that should have a AAA screening ultrasound and again 3-4 months
      later to see if these same individuals received the procedure. All informational data sets
      will be totally de-identified by the Research Coordinator, Nellis Air Force Base, prior to
      releasing to the Principle Investigator.

      The data will then be analyzed by Dr. Anneke Bush (WHMC statistician) and the results will be
      provided to the Principal Investigator for analysis.
