    
      This is a randomized, open-label trial that aims to compare the glycemic excursion following
      food intake following post-meal injection of Glulisine (Apidra) insulin and Lispro (Humalog)
      insulin in a real-world setting. Children participating in the Florida Camp for Children and
      Youth with Diabetes will be randomized to receive either Glulisine or Apidra to cover
      carbohydrates after meals. The difference in blood glucose values will be analyzed before and
      2 hours after meals to see if there is a difference in post-prandial hyperglycemia between
      groups.
