      treatments are toxic and contribute to poor outcomes. Conventional therapy combines
      cyclophosphamide with prednisolone but is associated with severe adverse events in 35%, early
      mortality, malignancy and infertility. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a newer
      immunosuppressive drug which has superior efficacy to azathioprine in solid organ
      transplantation. MMF is an effective alternative to cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis. Open
      label studies and retrospective surveys point to the efficacy and low toxicity of MMF in
      vasculitis.

      We hypothesise that MMF not be less effective than cyclophosphamide for remission induction
      in AASV. 140 new patients will be randomised to MMF 3g/day or a European consensus
      intravenous cyclophosphamide regimen, with the same prednisolone dosing. Following a six
      month induction course all patients will receive consensus remission maintenance treatment
      with azathioprine and prednisolone. The primary end-point will be remission rate by six
      months, secondary end-points include relapse rate at 18 months and safety. The trial will be
      conducted in 10 countries by members of the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS). The
      trial duration will be 42 months (24 months recruitment, 18 months follow up).
