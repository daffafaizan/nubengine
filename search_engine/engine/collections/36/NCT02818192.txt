      observational cohort study of 400 prevalent cases of T2D diagnosed <18 years of age. The
      investigators will evaluate the primary BPS risk factors associated with prevalent
      albuminuria using a principal component analysis (PCA) of associations between primary
      exposure variables at enrollment. After confirming the relevant BPS factors in the PCA
      analysis, the investigators will utilize a structural equation modeling approach to confirm
      the developed model.
