    
      The study will be conducted sequentially in 3 Parts. Each participant will participate in
      only one Part.

      Participants will be enrolled in either Part A, Part B, or Part C:

        -  Part A: CP-B participants will receive GZR 50 mg+ EBR 50 mg; NC participants will
           receive GZR 100 mg/EBR 50 mg.

        -  Part B: CP-B participants will receive GZR 100 mg + EBR 50 mg.

        -  Part C: CP-B participants will receive either GZR 50 mg or 100 mg + EBR 50 mg. Study
           progression from Part A to Part B and from Part B to Part C will be based upon a review
           of safety and efficacy in Parts A and B, respectively. Depending upon safety and
           efficacy in Part A, the study may progress directly from Part A to Part C using GZR 50
           mg + EBR 50 mg, without performing Part B.
