      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in
      ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy. This study is a randomized, single blind
      clinical study. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab can
      alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to
      compare the treating effect between bevacizumab and steroid.
