      impaired cognitive function. Although delirium is thought to be common in the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) there are few studies that have evaluated its incidences, risks and outcomes. It
      has been associated with increased morbidity, and mortality and increased cost to the
      healthcare system. In addition to the uncertainty of the incidence of ICU delirium, there is
      a lack of information about the effects that certain pharmacological treatments have on
      delirious patients.

      The standard pharmacological treatments for ICU acquired delirium are haloperidol and
      olanzapine as they have been shown to be equivalent in reducing its incidence. However,
      optimal dose and regimen have not been well defined.

      The rationale for this study is to determine whether haloperidol is superior to olanzapine in
      the treatment of ICU acquired delirium. A secondary objective is to determine the most
      appropriate dosing regimen for the treatmet. The role of alternative agents quetiapine,
      risperidone, loxapine and methotrimeprazine will also be examined in a preliminary analysis.

      Patients who develop agitation or delirium as defined by an Intensive Care Delirium Checklist
      (ICDSC) score of greater than or equal to 4 meeting all the inclusion criteria and no
      exclusion criteria will be eligible for randomization. Once randomized they will be screened
      for ongoing agitation and delirium as well prolongation of the QTc interval greater than 440
      msec, development of extrapyramidal symptoms and development of a seizure disorder.
