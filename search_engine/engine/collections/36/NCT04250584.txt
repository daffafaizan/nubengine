    
      The objective of this study is to determine if the BioAnalytics device, iSlpr™, has a similar
      safety and efficacy profile to a commonly used device, SomnoDent® Classic, in the treatment
      of snoring and mild to moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.

      The target population will be males and females aged from 18 years to less than 75 years, who
      have been diagnosed with snoring and mild to moderate sleep apnoea.

      Participants will remain on study from screening visit to end of study visit; a total of
      approximately 33 weeks.

      This study includes -

        -  a screening period of up to 28 days

        -  a 2 week device initiation period

        -  a 24 week treatment period
