      results after a transplant. Increasing the cardiorespiratory fitness with an exercise program
      during the preoperative period has shown improvements in patients after a surgery. It is
      produced a decreased in his functions, including a loss of muscle mass.

      Prehabilitation is a exercise program before a surgery. This program will improve the
      patient's starting functional status and therefore recovery.

      Physical activity is one of the most powerful predictors of mortality risk. Several studies
      say that a improved cardiorespiratory fitness by exercise before a surgery has a great impact
      in the patients after the intervention in short and long term.
