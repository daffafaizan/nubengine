    
      Prospective multicenter study on the validity of levels of circulating antibodies to
      glomerular neo-autoantigens (alpha-enolase and annexin AI) and implantable antigens
      (anti-DNA, histone, istone3, istone4, C1q) as a surrogate biomarker for the diagnosis of
      lupus nephritis.

      The study will involve the collection of serum from patients with lupus nephritis at onset
      and during subsequent follow-up at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months for the titration of circulating
      autoantibodies.

      As a control the investigators will use the sera of patients with systemic lupus
      erythematosus without nephropathy, collected at the same time intervals.

      The investigators will also assess the antibody positivity in groups of patients with
      rheumatologic disease similar to lupus (rheumatoid arthritis) and in patients with autoimmune
      nephropathy without extrarenal clinical signs.

      Regarding patients with systemic lupus erythematosus the investigators will collect sera of
      both incident and prevalent patients in order to monitor changes in antibody levels in
      conjunction with the development of renal disease.

      Clinical tests (renal function, complete blood count, C reactive protein (CRP), ANA, native
      DNA (nDNA), urine analysis) will be performed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and the surplus of
      blood samples will be used to create the serum bank of the study.

      Samples will be collected in the pediatric nephrology of Giannina Gaslini Children Hospital,
      Genoa (coordinator centre) and in 5 rheumatological (Genoa, Pisa, Pavia, Padova, Brescia) and
      6 nephrological (Milan, Genoa, Parma, Brescia, Bologna and Reggio Emilia) italian adults
      departments .
