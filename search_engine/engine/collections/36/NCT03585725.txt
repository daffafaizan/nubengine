    
      This clinical trial is for men and women ages 18 and older with follicular lymphoma with
      detectable BCL2-t or mantle cell lymphoma with presence of cyclin D1 overexpression (can be
      newly diagnosed or relapsed). The objective of this study is to assess the possibility of
      treating follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma patients with ribavirin and using cell
      free DNA (cfDNA) for BCL2-t and cyclin D1 extracted from peripheral blood to measure
      treatment effect.

      Clinical trials of ribavirin have been conducted in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent with established doses, has resulted in the
      regression of the tumor.

        -  Ribavirin 1000 mg will be administered orally twice daily continuously for 28-day
           cycles.

        -  Patients will be followed for up to 7 months.

        -  Will continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not
           experiencing unacceptable side effects.
