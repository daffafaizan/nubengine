      I. Identify and explore factors influencing the communication of genetic testing results from
      probands (patients with confirmed hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome) to their
      first-degree relatives. (Step 1) II. Identify and explore factors influencing decision making
      and pursuit of cascade testing among first-degree relatives of probands. (Step 1) III.
      Estimate the uptake of cascade testing by first-degree relatives of probands at a safety-net
      hospital and the uptake of cascade testing by first-degree relatives of probands at a
      comprehensive cancer center. (Step 2) IV. Estimate the frequency of reported factors that
      influence communication, decision-making, and pursuit of cascade testing among probands and
      their first-degree family members at a safety-net hospital and at a comprehensive cancer
      center. (Step 2) V. Explore similarities and differences in cascade genetic testing rates and
      reported barriers to cascade genetic testing of first-degree relatives at probands from a
      safety-net hospital and a comprehensive cancer center. (Step 2)

      OUTLINE:

      STEP I: Patients and first degree relatives participate in semi-structure, in-depth
      interviews about genetic testing over 45-60 minutes.

      STEP II: Patients and first degree relatives complete survey questionnaires over 20 minutes.
