      04;112(4)). Patients were randomly allocated to WE group or WE+AA group. In WE+AA group,
      water containing 1% of AA was used during insertion of colonoscopy instead of water alone. A
      bottle of 20ml pure AA was placed abutting the water pump, which make it possible to keep
      patients blinded to group allocation. Endoscopist using a high-definition wide-angle Olympus
      or Fujinum colonoscope performed all of the colonoscopies, with a withdrawal time of at least
      6 min. The observation was initially performed without the assistance of cap or the use of
      magnification or electronic staining (NBI, BLI, LCI or AFI et al.). Scopolamine butylbromide
      or glucogon was not routinely administrated.
