      implementation of remote patient management systems utilizing AHA guideline-based heart
      failure protocols and educational content can successfully address the following objectives:

        -  validate the suitability of the Intel Health Guide to deploy AHA guideline-based patient
           care protocols and health content to patients managing congestive heart failure

        -  confirm that the AHA protocols as deployed on the HGS are supportive for clinicians
           following the AHA guidelines in a telehealth environment

        -  validate and verify that the data intended to be collected was effectively collected

        -  measure patient and provider satisfaction with use of the system
