    
      Patients will be assigned to one of three study groups:

        1. receives the normal standard care;

        2. meets with an oncology nurse educator, in addition to the regular nurses on the
           transplant team. The nurse educator will provide information and answers to patient's
           questions about the stem cell/bone marrow transplant experience; or

        3. is taught mindfulness meditation by a nurse who is trained to be a mindfulness
           instructor and by an audio CD.

      Mindfulness meditation is a technique that may help in coping with the stress and
      difficulties associated with cancer and undergoing a stem cell/bone marrow transplant. It
      involves learning to be in the present moment by paying attention to your breathing, sights,
      and sounds, and to sensations you may be experiencing, or thoughts and feelings you may be
      having.

      Mindfulness meditation has been shown to be helpful to patients in the clinic who have cancer
      and other medical conditions.

      Patients, regardless of random group assignment, will complete a questionnaire 8 different
      times, from before they are admitted to the hospital until 6 months after discharge.

      Patients will also provide two urine samples while in the hospital to measure the levels of
      stress hormones present in the urine.
