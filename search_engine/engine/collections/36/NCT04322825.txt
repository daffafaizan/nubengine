      GFMCS 3-5) wore the suit for 1 hour every second day for 24 weeks. The investigators
      evaluated level of spasticity using the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) and other related
      measures before initiation, after 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Two motor related smart goals were
      defined and evaluated by the goal attainment scale (GAS). GMFM-66 and posture and postural
      ability scale (PPAS) were performed.
