    
      Approximately 168 healthy, malaria-na√Øve volunteers aged 18 - 50 years, divided into 2 groups
      (84 in each group), will receive either one dose of Ad35.CS.01 followed by two doses of
      257049 at monthly intervals or 3 doses of 257049 vaccine at monthly intervals. Of these, a
      maximum of 138 vaccinated volunteers will be challenged with P. falciparum infected
      mosquitoes. The challenge will occur 2 weeks following the third immunization. A group of up
      to 18 infectivity controls will begin participation in the study at the challenge stage.
      These controls receive no vaccine and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to
      provide comparison group for vaccinated individuals.
