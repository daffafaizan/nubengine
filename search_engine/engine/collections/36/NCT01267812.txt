      I. To evaluate the two year disease free survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients
      treated with bortezomib + rituximab after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile, safety, overall survival, time to treatment failure,
      remission duration, and biological markers of mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with
      bortezomib + rituximab after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 3-5
      seconds and rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 3
      months for up to 8 courses and treatment with rituximab repeats every 6 months for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
