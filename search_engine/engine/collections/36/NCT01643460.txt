    
      Pancreatic cysts represent a wide spectrum of lesions. Many cysts are uniformly benign
      (pseudocysts) or have negligible malignant potential (serous cystadenomas). However, others
      represent premalignant (i.e. intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) or mucinous
      cystadenomas [MCN]), or malignant (i.e. invasive IPMNs or mucinous cystadenocarcinomas)
      tumors. Management of pancreatic cysts is challenging but surgery is generally recommended
      for cysts that are symptomatic, premalignant (except possibly branch duct IPMNs) or
      demonstrate malignancy by imaging features and/or biopsy. However, even in experienced
      hospitals, surgical resection or enucleation of pancreatic cystic tumors is associated with
      significant perioperative morbidity and mortality rates of 20-40% and up to 2%, respectively.
