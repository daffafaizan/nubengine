      I. To determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria of adavosertib (AZD1775) in advanced solid tumor malignancies other
      than clear cell renal cell carcinoma with evidence of pathogenic loss of SETD2 using
      next-generation sequencing panel.

      II. To determine the objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 criteria of AZD1775 in clear cell
      renal cell carcinoma with evidence of loss of SETD2 using next-generation sequencing panel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical benefit rate and duration of response of AZD1775 in
      SETD2-deficient tumors other than clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate and duration of response of AZD1775 in
      SETD2-deficient clear cell renal cell carcinoma subgroup.

      III. To characterize the safety profile of AZD1775. IV. To determine whether H3K36me3
      expression by immunohistochemical assay is associated with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
