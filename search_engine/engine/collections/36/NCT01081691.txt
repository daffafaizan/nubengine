    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), placebo controlled, double-blind
      (neither physician or subject knows the name of the assigned study medication) study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, immune response, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      drug), and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) of CNTO 5825. The study
      population will consist of 48 healthy volunteers and 16 healthy atopic volunteers. Five dose
      levels of study agent will be assessed. Participants will be required to stay at the research
      center after study agent administration for the inpatient portion of the study and then
      return for out-patient visits. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and
      include obtaining and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood pressure), and
      the occurrence and severity of adverse events. Placebo (containing inactive substances only)
      or one of five dose levels of CNTO 5825 will be given. Healthy volunteers will be given a
      single IV infusion (directly into a vein) or a single dose of up to 3 injections under the
      skin. Healthy atopic volunteers will be given one dose as as an IV infusion. There will be a
      screening period of up to 4 weeks. All participants will be in the study for 17 weeks after
      dose administration.
