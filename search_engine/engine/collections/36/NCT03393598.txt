      augmentation and is widely used in plastic surgery. However, there is great variability in
      terms of long-term graft retention (survival). Moreover, the recipient site preparation is
      the phase of the procedure which received less attention in clinical and pre-clinical
      investigations. To provide information regarding an effective preparation of the recipient
      site may potentially lead to improvements in fat graft survival.
