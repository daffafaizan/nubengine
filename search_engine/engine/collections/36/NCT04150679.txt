      cholecystectomy biliary injury, group (I) 21 patients, a retrospective group where data was
      collected from the medical records of the patients presented with post cholecystectomy
      biliary injury and managed with hepaticojejunostomy without access loop in a period of 2
      years between January 2013 and December 2014, and group (II) 23 patients, a prospective
      group, where patients presented with post cholecystectomy biliary injury in a 2 years period
      between January 2017 and December 2018 , and managed by hepaticojejunostomy and
      jejunoduodenostomy as a permanent access loop .

      the data collected from both groups included, demographic criteria of patients, type of the
      previous surgery, place of surgery, the class of the biliary injury according to bismuth
      classification, (according to Bismuth classification; type I (Low injury, stump length > 2
      cm), type II) (higher injury, stump length < 2 cm), type III (high CHD injury but confluence
      is preserved), type IV (high injury both hepatic ducts are no more connected.). And any
      diagnostic or therapeutic intervention carried out before surgical management.

      The detailed surgical management; in group I a roux en y hepaticojejunostomy was done, after
      abdominal exploration and identification of the level of injury or stricture a ROUX en Y loop
      of the jejunum was prepared 40 cm post duodenojujenal junction, it was separated and
      anastomosed to the jejunum at a more distal point ( 60 cm ) the proximal end of the distal
      loop was closed in two layers with Vicryl 3\0 the loop was extracted retrocolic towards the
      site of injury where a hepaticojejunostomy was done end( biliary)to side (jejunum with Vicryl
      4\0 size single layer .

      in the second group the same was done but with jejunoduodenostomy side to side at 5-10 cm
      distal to the site of hepaticoduodenostomy as a permanent access loop.

      Follow up data either clinical, laboratory or radiologic were collected, findings of MRCP (if
      needed) was reported as primary outcome.

      Secondary outcome (management of complications), including the operative time needed for
      correction of the complications, early and late postoperative morbidity and mortality.

      The data was analyzed properly using SPSS 18, and presented in a suitable way using graphs
      figures and tables.
