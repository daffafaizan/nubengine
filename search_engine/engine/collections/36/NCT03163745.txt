    
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a serious complication in patient with decompensated
      liver cirrhosis . The incidence in ascetic patients varies between 7-30 % as a consequence
      result of impaired defense mechanism and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in
      cirrhotic patients with ascites Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may complicated by
      hepatorenal syndrome or systemic sepsis and has high recurrence rate - estimated as
      approximately 70% within 1 year of follow up .

      The clinical detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requires a high index of
      suspicion because symptoms and signs of infection are obscure in most of patients.

      About 13% of patients are asymptomatic and a few studies reported the incidence of
      asymptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites The most
      common clinical manifestations defined by Jeffries et al and Castellote et al in 2007 are:
      temperature above 38 °C or below 36.5 °C, chills, abdominal tenderness suggestive of
      peritonitis, developing or worsening hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (defined by
      an increase in the serum creatinine level to above 133 μmol/L) and arterial hypotension
      (systolic arterial pressure below 80 mmHg).

      The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends performing exploratory
      paracentesis in each patient with cirrhosis and ascites .

      A study was done in Poland in 2011, shows the prevalence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
      in asymptomatic inpatients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and found that two of 37
      asymptomatic cirrhotics who were included in the study met criteria of asymptomatic
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (5%) .

      A french study was done in 2013 in asymptomatic cirrhotic outpatients and found that the
      incidence of asymptomatic Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was only 1.2% .

      Another study was done in Pakistan in 2015 and found that the incidence of asymptomatic
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in outpatient patient with cirrhosis was 10%(8 out of 80).

      Another Egyptian study was done in 2016 on asymptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in
      adult Egyptian patient with decompensated cirrhosis and found that 21 (13%) patient was
      asymptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis out of 160 cirrhotic patient ascetic patient
      who fulfill the inclusion criteria .
