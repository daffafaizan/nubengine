      develop diabetic retinopathy which can progress to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is
      associated with an increase of blood flow in the retinal vessels, ischaemia in the periphery
      and macular oedema. It has been shown in previous trials, that the pressure and metabolic
      autoregulation is disturbed in patients with diabetes, and it is believed to contribute to
      the development of diabetic retinopathy.

      In healthy subjects the retinal arterioles will contract during an increase in blood
      pressure, but trials have shown that this response is impaired in diabetics. When the retina
      is exposed to flickering lights, the metabolism increase and the arterioles in healthy
      subjects dilates. In diabetics this dilation is impaired. In this trial we want to
      investigate if an ACE-inhibitor (lisinopril) or calcium channel blocker (amlodipine)
      influence this response in subjects exposed to increased blood pressure vs increased retinal
      metabolism.
