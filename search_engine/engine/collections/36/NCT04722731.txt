        -  Is the CPBC-program effective in preventing childhood anxiety disorders within a period
           of 12 and 36 months respectively, compared to a self-help parenting book?

        -  Is the CPBC-program effective in preventing childhood anxiety symptoms within a period
           of 12 and 36 months respectively, compared to a self-help parenting book?

        -  Is the effect moderated by severity of parental anxiety, child anxiety symptoms at
           baseline, or gender or age of the child?

        -  Is the study effective in increasing parental self efficacy?

        -  Is the effect of CPBC-program mediated by changes in parental criticism and rejection,
           overprotection, parental modelling of anxiety or parental accommodation?

        -  Is the CPBC-program cost-effective?

      DESIGN The first study is a full scale parallel randomised controlled trial (allocation ratio
      1:1). This study will include follow-up assessments after 12 and 36 months and will evaluate
      the relative efficacy of the CPBC-program versus an active control group (self-help book).
      The second part includes a mediation analysis and the third part is a within trial economic
      evaluation comparing the outcomes and costs between the CPBC-program and control using two
      types of analyses (cost-utility analysis and cost-consequence analysis).

      POWER To have an 80% power to detect a significant (p â‰¤ 0.05) small to moderate difference
      (standardised mean difference = 0.4) the investigators will need to recruit 194 children.
      Given an anticipated attrition of 10%, the investigators will aim at including a total of 216
      children. Participants will be recruited through advertisements. The participants will be
      randomly allocated to either (1) CPBC-program or (2) reading a self-help book.
