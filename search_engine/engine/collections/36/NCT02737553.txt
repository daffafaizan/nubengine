      electromechanical morcellation and tissue removal thorough vagina with posterior colpotomy
      according to surgical time, postoperative pain and postoperative sexual function.

      Patients with an indication of myomectomy, between 18 to 40 years old, without prior
      abdominal surgery and without suspicious of malignancy will include into the study.
      Anticipated number of the patients will be 60. Participants will be randomized into two
      groups; group 1 enclosed electromechanical morcellation will be performed to remove the myoma
      out of the abdominal cavity; group 2 myoma will be removed through vagina with posterior
      colpotomy. In group 1, after extirpation of the myoma from the uterus and repair of the
      uterine defect, the myoma will be removed from the abdomen with an enclosed laparoscopic
      electromechanical morcellation with using surgical glove. In group 2, after extirpation of
      myoma from uterus and repair of the uterine defect, myoma will be removed through the vagina
      with posterior colpotomy. In this group myoma will also be removed in a enclosed fashion with
      using endo bag. Tissue removal time (for group 1 removal time is decided time between the
      insertion and removal of the morcellation, for group two removal time is decided time between
      start of the posterior colpotomy and end of the closure of the posterior colpotomy),
      postoperative time and sexual function of the patient and any of the complications will be
      compared. Visual pain score and female sexual function index questionnaire will be used to
      assess the postoperative pain and sexual function, respectively.
