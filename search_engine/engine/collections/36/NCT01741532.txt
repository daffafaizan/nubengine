    
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 18-month study in
      patients with PKAN aged 4 years and older. Participants are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive either deferiprone oral solution or placebo, twice a day for 18 months. Efficacy
      assessments, an MRI scan to measure iron levels in the globus pallidus, pharmacokinetic
      evaluations, and safety assessments are conducted at specified time points. Following
      completion of the trial, eligible patients are invited to enroll in an 18-month extension
      study, TIRCON2012V1-EXT, in which all participants receive deferiprone.
