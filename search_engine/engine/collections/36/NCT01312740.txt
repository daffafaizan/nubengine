      design, to two periods of 4 weeks of an energy restricted diet of 1200 kcal as either a
      conventional diet (LC- CONV) or a special energy restricted diet compensated by proteins
      (LC-P-LGI). The two nutritional periods were separated by a wash-out interval of 8 weeks.
      Before the start of the study, all subjects were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle
      during the experimental period.Anthropometric parameters, glucose and lipid homeostasis and
      inflammatory markers were evaluated before and after each dietary period.Body fat and
      fat-free mass distributions were measured by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, GE
      Lunar Prodigy Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) before and after each dietary period at the
      fasting state.
