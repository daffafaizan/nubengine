    
      This purpose of this study is to examine perceptions and determinants of physical activity
      during the COVID-19 pandemic in cancer survivors. To test our aim, we will recruit up to 1000
      adults diagnosed with cancer within the last five years and ask them to complete an online
      questionnaire battery assessing their self-reported physical activity habits, psychosocial
      outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, social support), and perceptions of
      physical activity engagement during the pandemic. A subsample of participants (n=50) will
      also be invited to participate in an interview to gain further insights into cancer
      survivors' physical activity experiences during COVID-19. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
      will be used to analyze the quantitative survey data, and thematic analysis will be used to
      analyze the qualitative interview data.
