      adopt behaviors which mitigate their symptoms or impairment. For some women, this involves
      wearing a pad and for others, knowledge of restroom locations. Little is known about the role
      of such behaviors in helping women adapt to urinary incontinence (UI), pelvic organ prolapse
      (POP), or fecal incontinence (FI). Additionally, there are no studies that address the
      persistence of these behaviors following treatment as measured by traditional outcomes.
      Results of a pilot study that assessed quality of life (QOL) in women with pelvic floor
      disorders (PFD) indicated that women relied heavily on behavioral adaptation in order to cope
      with PFD symptoms. Subsequently, a draft Adaptation Index was developed with input from
      investigators of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN). This measure was further refined
      by focus groups as part of the 1J06 protocol. The 1J06 study is investigating the properties
      of this tool in subjects with UI and POP. This study focuses on the validation of this
      instrument as a measurement of adaptive behaviors used to reduce symptoms of FI and to
      describe the use of adaptive behaviors among women with FI.
