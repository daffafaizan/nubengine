      within recent 3 months. Omega-3 fatty acid such as EPA or DHA, omega-3 index that calculated
      by sum of EPA and DHA, and ratio of EPA/arachidonic aicd (AA) are frequently reported as
      important biomarkers of its association with cardiovascular accidents. One of the fatty acid
      contents of erythrocyte membrane, oleic acid was increased in patients with acute coronary
      disease compared to control group. Oleic acid of erythrocyte membrane in hemodialysis
      patients with taking omega-3 was significantly decreased compared to group with taking olive
      oil. In addition, control group using olive oil was also meaningfully decreased erythrocyte
      membrane oleic acid compared to baseline levels. In this way, olive oil seemed to have
      similar effect as omega-3 fatty acid. supplement of enough amount olive oil with balanced
      meal may show similar effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

      It is ideal way to intake olive oil in uncooked state with vegetables or breads, but
      practically peoples stir-fry or fry foods in olive oil instead of cooking oil. Ignition point
      of olive oil is 185-205 degrees of Celsius with depending on its oxidation degrees. There is
      a study that the contents of vitamin C in broccoli were scantly changed when broccoli was
      stir-fried in olive oil. It needs to identify the change of erythrocyte membrane contents
      between taking uncooked or natural olive oil and taking fried or stir fried olive oil with
      other foods. Taking meals with olive oil can change erythrocyte membrane fatty acid contents
      including oleic acid in hemodialysis patients.
