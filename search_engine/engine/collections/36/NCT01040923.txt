      murmurs using ultrasensitive acoustic technology. The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit
      score which is used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

      The CardioSond exam will be given to patients who agree to participate in the study upon
      signing of an informed consent form and prior to the administration of beta blocker agents
      and / or vasodilators as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography protocol.

      CardioSond data will be sent to an independent acoustic core lab which will determine data
      quality and produce a flow micro bruit score. CT angiography data will be analyzed by staff
      at North Shore University Hospital.

      A data review panel lead my the principal investigator will examine the results of both the
      CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the accuracy of the CardioSond in detecting
      CAD in the study population at large and in specific patient subgroups.
