      Using molecular genetic research methods (polymerase chain reaction, SSCP, sequencing by
      Sanger method) mutations in the MutYH gene will be studied. For all patients with mutations
      in the MutYH gene, an optimal diagnostic algorithm will be developed. The significance of
      monoallelic mutations in the MutYH gene will be determined. Clinical monitoring will be
      defined. Optimal amount of surgical intervention will be suggested.
