      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate whether FDG-PET imaging can detect lesions that would preclude surgery
      (esophagectomy) in patients found to be surgical candidates by standard imaging procedures.

      Secondary Objective:

      To use the collected data to generate hypotheses to be used in future studies, such as which
      types of previously undetected lesions FDG-PET imaging is best able to identify.
