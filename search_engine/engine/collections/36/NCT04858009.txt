    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess short-term morbidity and disease-free survival outcomes for patients with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma with limited low volume peritoneal metastasis or positive
      peritoneal cytology undergoing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based quantitative cell-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) KRAS mutation assay in identifying patients at risk of peritoneal
      recurrence/progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo HIPEC with mitomycin and cisplatin over 60 minutes in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo additional HIPEC with mitomycin
      and cisplatin up to 5 times.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
