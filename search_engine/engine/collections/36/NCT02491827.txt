      laser probe will be administered through the endoscopic device to characterize in vivo the
      tissue by thousandfold magnification down to the cellular level (so-called optical biopsy).
      Magnification is presented to the neurosurgeon in time to better differentiate between
      healthy and pathological tissue. Post-surgery results of in-vivo Differentiation will then be
      compared to histocytopathological findings.
