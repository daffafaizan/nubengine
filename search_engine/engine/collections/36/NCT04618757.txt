      non-communicable diseases, increases longevity, and reduces medical costs. Yet, the rates of
      physical activity have been steadily decreasing such that physical inactivity is now the
      fourth leading cause of death worldwide. In Singapore, 33% of adults are insufficiently
      active despite Singapore being a highly walkable city with numerous subsidized
      community-based physical activity programs. A review of the literature shows that, to date,
      no study has directly compared cash versus hedonic rewards for health behavior change despite
      theory suggesting hedonic rewards may work better. Furthermore, hedonic rewards can often be
      purchased at lower cost than their cash equivalent. This makes hedonic rewards potentially
      more cost-effective if they are proven to be at least as effective at increasing positive
      behavior change compared to giving the same value in cash.

      Thus, we aim to determine, using a randomized trial with two parallel arms, whether hedonic
      rewards (Arm 1) can be more effective than their cash equivalent (Arm 2) in promoting
      increases in physical activity, assessed via step counts measured by Fitbit, during a 6
      calendar month intervention. We hypothesize that the average proportion of months meeting the
      incentivized step target across participants will be greater for those in the hedonic
      incentive arm as compared to those in the cash incentive arm (primary outcome).
