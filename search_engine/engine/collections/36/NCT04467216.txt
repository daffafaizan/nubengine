      older people. Participants will wear a commercially available head-mounted VR system with
      hand-held controllers to experience the participation of daily activities in a virtual
      environment. Simultaneous physical and cognitive training will be embedded in the training
      system to promote optimal function. Participants will attend physical training in a sitting
      position through cycling on an ergometer and moving the hand-held controllers. Motion sensors
      built into the VR system and ergometer will track these movements to control everyday tasks
      in the virtual environment (e.g., moving around the city). Simultaneously, participants will
      undergo cognitive training by participating in various tasks demanding cognitive functions,
      such as visual-spatial (e.g., wayfinding) and problem-solving (e.g., wallet loss) functions.
      Gamification will be employed to promote the motivation to participate. All training
      activities will be gamified by blending in fun elements, such as difficulty-levelling,
      competition, and e-tokens. Co-participation is allowed to promote interpersonal interactions.
      The prototype enables real-time co-viewing among participants. Other elderly centre members
      and the activity facilitators can share the view of the participants in the game on either a
      large-screen monitor or a tablet computer. They can simultaneously talk about and share their
      gaming experiences.
