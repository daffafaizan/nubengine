      comorbidity. The objective of this study was to investigate how early biomarkers of
      inflammation may be altered in OSA patients. To complete this goal the investigators assessed
      the circulating levels of four inflammatory markers, hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),
      Fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Uric Acid (UA) in a representative
      population of consecutively enrolled, untreated and otherwise healthy subjects with a
      clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea. A secondary objective was to investigate any
      correlation between these markers with clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) parameters of
      these subjects.Subjects who had undergone a PSG for OSA diagnosis were recruited. Patients
      with known comorbidities were excluded from the study. Included patients were grouped
      according to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as mild, moderate and severe. Patients with AHI < 5
      served as control group. Demographic, PSG data, serum levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, ESR and
      UA were measured and compared between groups.
