      elevated following even low-level exertion, is a hallmark feature of the disease. The cause
      of PEM, like the cause of ME/CFS, is not understood. This study aims to utilize a two-day
      CPET to invoke PEM. This provides a unique opportunity to collect data on how key outcome
      measures or disease parameters are altered during elevated symptoms relative to baseline
      within each patient by gathering information before and after symptom provocation.

      A total of 90 participants and 90 controls will undergo CPET testing. Participation will be
      split amongst three different sites (Ithaca, NY, New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA). Subjects
      will be located in urban and rural areas to establish relatively diverse study populations.

      This study is a component of the Cornell ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center (CRC). Blood
      samples taken before and after CPET will be utilized in associated projects with the Cornell
      ME/CFS CRC. CPET data along with the analysis of blood samples has great potential to reveal
      why exercise negatively affects ME/CFS patients and thus perhaps why patients are also
      impaired even before increasing their activity level.
