      influence of participation in a computer game of virtual dodge ball that requires whole-body
      reaching movements to manipulate an on-screen avatar. Further, the investigators will
      gradually reduce the gain of lumbar spine motion of the participant's on-screen avatar across
      the three game sessions such that participants will need to produce progressively larger
      excursions of the lumbar spine to manipulate their avatar's spinal motion. Specifically, in
      game session 1, the spine motion of the avatar is equal to that of the participant (gain=1);
      in session 2 spine motion of the avatar is 5% less than the participant (gain=0.95); in
      session 3 spine motion of the avatar is 10% less than the participant (gain=0.90). The
      investigators will recruit participants with chronic low back pain and kinesiophobia.
      Participants in the GAME condition will complete laboratory sessions on five consecutive
      days. Session 1 (baseline) and Session 5 (post-test) will be used to assess lumbar spine
      motion and expectations of pain and harm during standardized reaching tasks. In sessions 2
      through 4 they will play the virtual dodge ball game. Participants in the CONTROL condition
      will complete baseline and post-test standardized reaching tasks, but will not play the game
      in the intervening three days.
