    
      Up to 74 subjects will receive either PRX167700 or placebo (a dummy treatment) for 15 days.
      Subjects will need to stop taking their usual pain reliever medicines for at least 7 days
      before starting treatment to induce a 'flare' in osteoarthritis symptoms (but they will be
      allowed to continue to use paracetamol for immediate pain relief as needed throughout the
      trial). The effect of PRX167700 or placebo on knee pain will be assessed before and after
      exercise on Days 1, 3, 7 and 14. On Day 15, blood samples will be collected to measure levels
      of PRX167700 and assess its activity.
