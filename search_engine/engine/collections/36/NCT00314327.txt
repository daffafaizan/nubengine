      long-acting injectable form of the second generation antipsychotic, risperidone, for the
      treatment of first episode patients who fail to respond to 12 weeks of treatment with an oral
      antipsychotic. The rationale for using this long-acting medication is that it eliminates
      covert non-adherence, which may be a factor in poor response. In addition, pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic differences between injectable and oral formulations may result in
      differences in treatment response favoring the injectable form. Subjects who have not
      responded sufficiently to treatment with an antipsychotic will be approached for the proposed
      long-acting risperidone trial. Risperidone treatment will be open label with titration based
      upon individual response (within FDA approved dose ranges). Treatment will begin with a phase
      of supplementation with oral risperidone. Subjects will stop their previous antipsychotic,
      start 2 mg of oral risperidone per day for one day and then increase the dose to 4 mg per
      day. Subjects who tolerate one week of oral risperidone will then begin injections of 25 mg
      long-acting risperidone every 2 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. If clinically indicated, the
      dose may be increased up to a maximum of 50 mg as per FDA guidelines.
