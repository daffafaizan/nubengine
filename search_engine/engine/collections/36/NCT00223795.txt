      limits their attempts at exercise and subsequent weight loss. Walking aids such as canes have
      been recommended in the management of knee OA in order to decrease pain by reducing loading
      across the knee and to increase physical activity. Little information is available regarding
      the impact of walking aids on psychosocial function and quality of life in individuals with
      limited mobility. No randomized controlled trials have studied the efficacy of walking aids
      on quality of life, pain, and function in overweight or obese individuals with symptomatic
      knee OA (5,6). The proposed research will evaluate the effects of walking aids in knee OA by
      testing the following hypothesis that the use of a single-point cane ipsilateral and
      contralateral to the affected limb will decrease pain from knee OA by altering gait
      biomechanics and will improve walking function and quality of life in overweight or obese
      individuals with symptomatic knee OA.
