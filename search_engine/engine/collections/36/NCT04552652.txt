      feasibility of cardiac telerehabilitation. The results showed that aerobic capacity and
      quality of life improved similarly in telerehabilitation and outpatient group of
      participating patients. During the research, investigators used the moderate-intensity
      continuous method. The present research focuses on high-intensity interval training, which
      presents comparable or even better results in cardiorespiratory condition effects and
      requires less time than a continuous method in patients with low or medium cardiovascular
      risk.
