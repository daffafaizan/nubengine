      morbidity and mortality. Health disparities exist in the progression of diabetic kidney
      disease, with minorities being more affected even when adjusting for treatment, glycemic and
      hypertensive control, and medical coverage. Secondary prevention of the progression of
      diabetic kidney disease is hindered by a lack of easily modifiable risk factors. Based on
      animal and observational human studies, vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel,
      modifiable risk factor that may interrupt or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease
      through direct effects as well as by helping to ameliorate kidney disease risk factors, such
      as hyperglycemia, hypertension and inflammation. In addition, based on minorities having a
      higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, it may also potentially impact the differential
      progression of diabetic kidney disease in minorities. However, clinical trials evaluating the
      impact of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic kidney disease are lacking. Thus, this pilot
      study funded as an R03 through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
      Diseases (NIDDK) has the following specific aims: (1): To evaluate the impact of vitamin D
      supplementation (vitamin D3 at 400 IU/d versus 4000 IU/d) on the proportion of individuals
      with progression of albuminuria over 12 months in a sample of African American participants
      with vitamin D deficiency in a randomized controlled trial. (2): To identify whether kidney
      disease risk factors such as blood pressure and glycemic control mediate the impact of
      vitamin D supplementation on the progression of albuminuria over 12 months in a sample of
      African American participants with vitamin D deficiency in a randomized controlled trial.
