      consumption and HIV-related pathogenic processes (microbial translocation, immune activation,
      inflammation, HIV replication, and hepatitis). Two study groups will be assembled and
      followed longitudinally over one year to address this objective. Group 1 will include
      HIV-positive, ART-treated, heavy alcohol drinkers who have alcoholic hepatitis. Group 2 will
      include HIV-positive, ART-treated, heavy alcohol drinkers who do not have alcoholic
      hepatitis. Both groups will undergo similar study procedures and follow-up.
