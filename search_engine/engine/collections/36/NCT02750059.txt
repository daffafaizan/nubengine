      Neurological exam: South East Asia Research Collaboration with Hawaii (SEARCH) employs the
      AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)-derived HIV macroneurological examination, a physician
      rated symptoms assessment of cognitive features typical of HAND and peripheral neuropathy

      Neuropsychological assessments: SEARCH employs the HIV neurocognitive battery originally
      developed by Maj et al. designed to minimize cultural bias and tested in Bangkok. All
      subjects will have the full SEARCH battery as previously published, avoiding evaluations
      following invasive procedures.

      Quantification of Drug use: Drug and alcohol use are assessed with a structured interview
      including methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana based on a Thai Red Cross study defining
      frequently abused drugs in Bangkok. Urine is stored at each visit and may be later tested for
      illicit drugs. Evidence of intoxication is documented so that neuropsychological data can be
      censored.

      Lumbar punctures are completed per standard clinical procedures using a SprotteÂ®
      (pencil-point) needle to minimize complications. Standard assessments of CSF and serum,
      protein and cell count are completed and approximately 20cc are collected and
      ultra-centrifuged, Cell pellets of both blood and CSF will be cryopreserved for future
      potential studies, with subject consent. Supernatants are divided into 0.5cc aliquots, and
      frozen to -80oC on the same day. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL)/Rapid
      Plasma Reagin (RPR) will be assessed at baseline and in follow up if risk for new syphilis
      exposure is reported. Participant hospitalization for hydration will be completed, if needed.
      Participants will be compensated for their time based on Institutional Review Board
      (IRB)-approved rates.
