      decompression followed by intervertebral space reconstruction.

      ACDF consists in interbody fusion by replacing disc space with a cage packed with bone
      substitute, and inserted into the anterior portion of the interspace. Fusion is successful in
      approximately 95% of patients with good to excellent clinical results in most of them.
      Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients will develop degenerative changes at adjacent
      levels after surgery.

      TDR consists in total disc replacement with preserved segmental motion decreasing load on
      adjacent levels.

      Worsening of radiological degeneration signs at adjacent levels seems to be an important long
      term prognostic factor for reoperation.

      In this trial, included patients will be randomly assigned to undergo either TDR or ACDF Six
      visits are planned during the study: pre inclusion visit within 3 months before surgery,
      inclusion/randomisation the day before surgery, 3 follow up visits (45 days, 6, and 12 months
      after surgery) and an end of study visit 24 months after surgery (or at time of withdrawal if
      relevant).
