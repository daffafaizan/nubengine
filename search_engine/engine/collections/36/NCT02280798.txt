      preparation for embryo transfer? The clinical results in different publications showed
      different results, some of them described the natural cycle superior as the substituted
      cycles, and in contrast other large series showed superior results in substituted cycles than
      natural but with an increased of pregnancies losses. The recent apparition of endometrial
      receptive arrays technology let us know if endometrial is receptive or not in patients with
      some problems of infertility as implantation failure, for that we want to know if this
      technology would tell us if the different kind of protocols for endometrial preparation
      origin differences that could explain some of the founded results.
