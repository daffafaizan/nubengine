      organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. Exhaled human breath is mainly composed of
      inorganic compounds, inert gases and VOCs. VOCs are exhaled in very low concentrations and
      reflect pathological processes such as inflammation, oxidation, infection and neoplasms. The
      perspective is that metabolic and biochemical processes in several pathological situations
      cause different endogenous VOCs to arise, were they can serve as non-invasive biomarkers for
      certain diseases.

      Primary objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the
      breathing pattern from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls using the
      previously established breathing pattern.

      Secondary objecitves:

        -  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AeonoseTM to distinguish the breathing
           pattern from patients with polyps (e.g. advanced adenomas, sessile serrated lesions).

        -  To determine the influence of colonic cleansing (laxative use) on breathing patterns.

      Study population: Adult patients referred for colonoscopy.

      Estimated sample size: 66 patients with CRC.

      Intervention: Participants will be asked to breath through the AeonoseTM for 5 minutes. There
      are no risks, nor benefits for the participants.
