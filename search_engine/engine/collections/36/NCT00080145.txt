      Safe and effective treatments for PDD are needed.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either risperidone plus parent management
      training or risperidone alone for 24 weeks. Participants who show deterioration at Week 4
      will be offered an alternative mediation treatment, aripiprazole. These participants will
      remain in their original treatment group (either med alone or med plus parent management
      training). After 6 months of treatment (Week 24), participants who respond to their treatment
      will be gradually discontinued from their medication treatment to learn if the response can
      be sustained without continued medication treatment (This phase of the study was ended in
      Nov. 2006) Adaptive and behavioral outcomes are assessed during the study.
