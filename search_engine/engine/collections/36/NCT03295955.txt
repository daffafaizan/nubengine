      postoperative oral antibiotics more than 3 to 7 days after surgery. Currently, there's no
      clinical evidence that postoperative oral antibiotics is necessary or not in transoral
      endoscopic thyroid surgery. The investigator will conduct randomization after transoral
      thyroid surgery with two groups : postoperative oral antibiotics group versus no oral
      antibiotics group.
