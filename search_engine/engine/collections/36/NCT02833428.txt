      The objectives are multiple:

        1. Analyze clinical situation in the pathophysiology of spinal pain.

        2. somatosensory evoked potentials analysis (PES) and motors (PEM) on injuries of the
           spinal cord in the acute phase.

        3. Increasing the mass of data integrated from current standards (volume). The reason is
           not only an imperative of statistical power as in a conventional test but the
           probability of specific events characterize this type of pathology and the consequences
           of their management (monitoring and therapeutic).

        4. Identify new predictive parameters and monitoring of spinal pain.

      5. Design the tools of computer collection, successful storage formats, adaptations of
      collection tools: This is validation of the technical solution (i.e. IA).

      Expected results

      This system will allow to record and analyze a large amount of parameters, largely beyond the
      human resources. Analysis of these data should allow better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of acute trauma of the spinal cord which is an essential prerequisite to
      research new therapies. The realization evoked potentials, ever conducted on this patient in
      the acute phase should also allow the investigators to better understand the mechanisms of
      evolution of the SCI (Spinal Cord Injury).

      Moreover, this model expert system must allow, through the creation of routines, discovering
      new predictive parameters and monitoring, improving the management of these patients.

      This is a completely open system that can be enriched with new parameters as and above all
      enriching also as and when the inclusion of new cases. It therefore offers a theoretical
      field of infinite discovery extremely promising.
