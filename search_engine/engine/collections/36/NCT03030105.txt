      weeks with 6 weeks of single-dose Treatment Visits. The study will consist of a Screening
      Visit (up to 28 days prior to first study drug administration), six inpatient Treatment
      Visits (Periods 1 through 6), and a Follow-Up/Early Termination Visit (7-10 days after the
      last dose of study medication). An additional study visit may be necessary to complete the
      required cognitive test familiarization if not completed during the Screening Visit. Each
      Treatment Visit will occur approximately one week apart, allowing a 6 to 8 day washout
      period.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences based on a computer-generated
      randomization schedule. Subjects will receive all 6 treatments as specified by the treatment
      sequence according to a 6 Ã— 6 Williams Latin square design. The following treatments will be
      administered:

      A. Scopolamine placebo + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo

      B. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo

      C. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 10 mg + donepezil placebo

      D. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil placebo

      E. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + donepezil 10 mg +BPN14770 placebo

      F. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil 10 mg

      During each of the Treatment Visits (Periods 1 through 6), subjects will be admitted to the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) the day prior to each study drug administration (Day -1) and
      discharged the day after study drug administration (Day 2). On the morning of study drug
      administration (Day 1), subjects will be given study drug (BPN14770, donepezil, or placebo)
      with 240mL of room temperature water 2 hours prior to the scopolamine or scopolamine placebo
      sc injection. The timing for study drug administration will be referred to as t-2 (Hour -2).
      Breakfast should be available approximately 30 minutes following the morning drug
      administration. Two hours after study drug administration, the scopolamine or scopolamine
      placebo sc injection will be administered. The time at which the scopolamine or scopolamine
      placebo sc injection is administered will be referred to as t0 (Hour 0).

      Cognitive testing will be performed 30 minutes prior to treatment with scopolamine injection
      and at hours 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 post-scopolamine injection.

      PK samples will be collected during the treatment period to confirm study drug is present.

      Safety assessments throughout the study will include physical exams, ECGs, vital signs,
      chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.
