      students. The problem is truly a public health issue, affecting many and with serious
      consequences. Moreover, the global burden of disease-agenda calls for effective interventions
      with lasting effects that have the potential to improve the mental health of young adults. In
      this study the investigators aimed to determine whether yoga, a popular and widely available
      mind-body practice, can improve student mental health.

      The participants were randomly assigned to a yoga group or waitlist control group in a 1:1
      ratio by a simple online randomisation program. The intervention group was offered 24 yoga
      sessions over 12 weeks. Measurements were taken at week 0 (baseline), week 12
      (post-intervention), and week 24 (follow-up). The primary outcome was psychological distress
      assessed by the HSCL-25 questionnaire. Analysis was performed based on the intention to
      treat-principle.

      The methods were laid out in a protocol, previously published on the website of the study.
      (available at http://yogastudy.tilda.ws/). The planned analyses were very straightforward and
      included a description of the study participants, and simple analyses of each of the a priori
      selected outcome measures. We have not included or excluded any variables post-hoc.
