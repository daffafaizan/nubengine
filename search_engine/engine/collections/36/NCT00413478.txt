      function of the tumor-fighting genes. By blocking the "bad" genes, the tumor-fighting genes
      may be able to work better.

      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have "screening tests." These tests
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will have
      blood drawn (about 3 teaspoons) to check your kidney and liver function (routine blood
      tests). You may have a bone marrow aspiration performed (if you have not had one in recent
      weeks). To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with
      anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Women who
      are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive azacytidine by subcutaneous (just
      under the skin) injection every day for 7 days. This course of treatment will be repeated
      every 3-8 weeks, depending on the results of your routine blood tests.

      Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of azacytidine, depending on if you experience
      any side effects. You will continue to receive treatment on this study unless the disease
      gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects. If the disease gets worse or you
      experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study.

      This is an investigational study. This is an investigational study. Azacytidine has been
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 37 patients will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
