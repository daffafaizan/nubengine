      help patients make informed decisions about dialysis treatment. The Yorkshire Dialysis
      Decision Aid (YoDDA) will help patients' with chronic kidney disease make informed decisions
      between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis choices by a) re-writing dialysis information
      in a more meaningful way for patients, b) restructuring information to make this difficult
      decision more manageable, and c) using prompts to help patients imagine the choices'
      consequences. The research will assess the acceptability of a patient decision aid in paper
      and web versions to patients and their carers, and its impact on patients choices about
      dialysis.

      The programme of research included:

      A survey using qualitative methods of patients with chronic kidney disease and professionals
      providing predialysis services to develop the Yorkshire Dialysis Decision Aid content, and
      integration within usual predialysis care practices.

      A before-and-after study was carried out to evaluate the acceptability of the YoDDA-booklet
      to patients with sustained deterioration of kidney function making dialysis decision across
      the Yorkshire and Humber region, UK.

      An experimental study was carried out on-line to evaluate the acceptability of three versions
      of YoDDA-web (YoDDA; YoDDA+values tasks; YoDDA_patient videos) to people, or carers of
      people, with kidney disease. The study was advertised with flyers within UK renal units and
      notices on the National Kidney Federation's website and members' magazine.
