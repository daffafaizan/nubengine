      between paternal involvement and maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
      This was an IRB-approved cross sectional study. Pregnant women between the ages of 18 - 44
      years old and their partners were surveyed in the outpatient OB/GYN offices of Thomas
      Jefferson University. Women who identified their partner as their main support were included.
      Demographic and health information was collected. A composite support score for each woman
      was generated from a modified version of the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ) on a
      scale from 5 - 35. Support scores were evaluated with women's current smoking and drinking
      status using ANOVA and Student's t-test.
