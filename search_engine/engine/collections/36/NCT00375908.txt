      at < 34 weeks gestation, and for any infant born at > 34 weeks suspected to be at risk for
      neurologic morbidity by having intrapartum chorioamnionitis, nonreassuring fetal heart
      tracing prior to delivery, or a 5 minute Apgar < 7. For each infant born at > 34 weeks later
      confirmed to have neurologic morbidity by head ultrasound or EEG we will draw cord blood from
      a gestational age matched control without intrapartum infection or nonreassuring fetal heart
      tracing prior to delivery. At the time of delivery an umbilical arterial gas and umbilical
      venous sample for a type and screen, RPR and hematocrit are routinely drawn. The remainder of
      the cord blood is discarded. After the routinely done arterial blood gas and umbilical venous
      blood sample are obtained the remainder of the umbilical cord blood, which would otherwise be
      discarded, will be collected using a 23 gauge or larger needle into a heparinized tube. The
      sample will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the plasma layer separated. The sample will be
      placed into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes in 500 ul aliquots. Proteomic techniques including mass
      spectrometry, 2-dimensional electrophoresis, and chromatography, will be used to analyze the
      proteome from the brain injured and control groups. Specific proteins will be identified, and
      differences in expression compared between the 2 groups.
