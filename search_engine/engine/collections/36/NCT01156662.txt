      revascularization in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A
      meta-analysis of trials comparing primary PCI to fibrinolytic therapy showed a mortality
      benefit to the invasive approach. However, although TIMI III flow is achieved in the culprit
      epicardial vessel in the majority of patients, lack of tissue-level reperfusion is observed
      in approximately 30% of patients as manifested by persistence of chest pain and ST-segment
      elevation. Many strategies have tried to overcome this problem, from mechanical thrombectomy
      and distal protection devices to myocardial preserving agents. The purpose of present study
      is to investigate the efficacy of the thrombus aspiration using Export Aspiration Catheter
      (Medtronic Corporation, California, USA) during primary PCI in acute myocardial infarction.
