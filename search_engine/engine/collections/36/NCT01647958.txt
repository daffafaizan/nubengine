      EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the treatment of chronic GERD
      patients with medically refractory GERD symptoms other than heartburn.

      Primary hypothesis: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly improving
      daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at 6-month
      follow-up. Secondary hypotheses: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly
      improving daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at
      12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will have
      normalized or 50% improved esophageal acid exposure compared to baseline at 6-month
      follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will be completely off PPIs at 6-, 12-, 24-,
      36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up compared to baseline. The majority of crossover patients will
      be completely off PPIs at 6-, 18-, 30-, 42- and 54-month follow-up compared to baseline. A
      statistically greater proportion of crossover patients treated with TIF will be free of daily
      bothersome symptom(s) or will experience clinically significant improvement at 6-, 18-, 30-,
      42- and 54-month follow-up.
