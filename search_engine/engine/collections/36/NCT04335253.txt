    
      Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I/IIa clinical study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and antitumor activity of EOS884448 in participants with advanced
      cancers. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. The first part is a dose-escalation to
      determine the MTD, the RP2D, and the safety of EOS884448 in participants with advanced
      cancers. The subsequent expansion part will further explore safety, PK, PD responses, and
      antitumor activity of EOS884448 at the RP2D as monotherapy in participants with selected
      cancer types.
