      prognosis than those with either incomplete resection or without surgery. However,whether
      patients with stage II or III thymoma could benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy after complete
      resection remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adjuvant
      radiotherapy after complete resection can improve survival for stage II or III thymoma.
