      non-surgical mechanical periodontal treatment on psoriasis. The study population consisted of
      92 periodontitis patients with psoriasis who had untreated periodontal disease. Two
      randomized groups were formed from these patients. Immediate periodontal treatment (test
      group, n = 46) and delayed periodontal treatment (control group, n = 46). Clinical
      periodontal measures, saliva interleukin 2, interleukin 6 and secretory immunoglobulin A
      levels and PASI scores were performed at baseline and 8th week in control and test group.
