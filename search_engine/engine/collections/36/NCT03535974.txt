    
      Clinical trial with double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design; enrolls approximately
      30 euthyroid patients with benign thyroid nodules, who will receive for 6 weeks a
      spirulina-based supplement, and for another 6 weeks placebo.

        -  The sequence of administration supplement - placebo is unknown to the doctor or the
           patients

        -  The supplement and placebo are placed in identical capsules and vials by DVR Pharm

        -  The respective capsules are administered twice a day Thyroid ecography will be performed
           three times for each patient, and blood tests including TSH, free T4, free T3 and
           ceruloplasmin/Copper will also be performed 3 times for each patient.

        -  Echography and blood tests will be performed for each patient initially, after 6 weeks,
           and after 12 weeks It is expected that a decrease in the thyroid nodules occurs with the
           supplement administration.

        -  there will be a direct comparison of the nodules dimensions on the ecographic
           examinations, in millimeters, and of the blood levels of the molecules which reflect
           thyroid function
