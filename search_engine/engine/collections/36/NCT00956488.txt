      walker, cane, or AFO will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study. 20
      subjects will be enrolled at Carolinas ALS/Neuromuscular Center at the Carolinas HealthCare
      System. Eligible subjects will return for 26 sessions, each lasting between 1-2 hours. At
      Session 1 (4 weeks pre-treatment), assessments of muscle strength, spasticity, gait, and
      balance will be performed, which will take between 30-60 minutes. At Sessions 2-25, patients
      will do supported treadmill ambulation training at a very low speed 3 times a week for 6
      weeks under the supervision of the physical therapist. Each session will have 30 minutes of
      direct ambulation with the suspension system and treadmill over a 60 minute period of time.
      Additionally, at sessions 13 and 26 (4 and 8 weeks post-treatment), the assessments of muscle
      strength, spasticity, gait, and balance will be repeated. Needle EMG to assess denervation
      potential will be performed at base line and at the conclusion of the study. The study will
      last a total of 26 weeks for each patient.
