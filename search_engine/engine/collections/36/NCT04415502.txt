    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease of synovial joints.
      Characterized by periods of flares with high disease activity involving both a systemic
      immune response and tissue-specific inflammatory events that can lead to erosive joint and
      bone destruction and subsequent disability . Currently, diagnosis of RA is based mainly on
      the extent of tenderness and swelling of the joints , levels of acute-phase reactants such as
      C-reactive protein (CRP) ,erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) , high titers of rheumatoid
      factor (RF) and high titers of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) in
      the plasma .Recently, reported increased levels of collagen triple helix repeat containing 1
      protein (CTHRC1) are strongly associated with the severity of murine proteoglycan-induced
      arthritis and collagen antibody-induced murine arthritis (CAIA) , further CTHRC1 expression
      in murine experimental arthritis is increased in the synovium and specifically detected in
      activated murine , located at the synovial intimal lining and at the bone-pannus interface
      .Of interest,The expression pattern of CTHRC1 in pannus, its role in the function of FLS
      relevant to cartilage damage in RA, and CTHRC1's association with disease severity in murine
      arthritis raised the question of whether CTHRC1 could be used as a marker for RA diagnosis
      and monitoring of disease activity in patients .
