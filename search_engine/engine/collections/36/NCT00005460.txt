    
      BACKGROUND:

      The study was needed because evidence in 1991 suggested that cardiovascular risk factors
      which had been identified by studies of middle-aged populations did not have the same
      predictive value in the elderly; especially the "oldest old" aged 75 and above.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study analyzed data that had been collected over the years. At the time of the analysis,
      mortality follow-up was complete for over 99 percent of subjects, and incident morbidity
      information was available for myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and stroke. The
      database included measurements which allowed: 1) prospective analyses of the effects of
      putative cardiovascular risk factors on disease incidence in the elderly, 2) prospective
      analyses of the impact of change in risk factors on events in the elderly, 3) exploration of
      risk factors not classically associated with cardiovascular events in younger populations but
      which may be important in the very old, and, 4) cross-sectional description of putative risk
      factors in an aged population.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
