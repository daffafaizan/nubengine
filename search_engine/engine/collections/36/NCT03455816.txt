    
      Randomized study in people with type 1 diabetes in intensive insulin therapy MDI with
      analogues and with HbA1c> 7% to the usual clinical follow-up options (CG) vs use of Social
      Diabetes App (GI) for 6 months.

      The current clinical research project considers the effectiveness of a free diabetes app with
      a CE mark, "Social Diabetes", which incorporates the addition of a glucometer ("Glucomen
      Areo") it allows using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology the automatic introduction
      of data, evaluating the impact on metabolic results and other related psychosocial variables,
      in people with diabetes 1.

      The substitution of the usual face-to-face medical visit every 3-4 months by the
      incorporation of an app system has a similar effect in terms of glycemic control (measured
      through HbA1c) in patients with DM1 treated with multiple doses of insulin per day (MDI). )
      and inadequate metabolic control (HbA1c> 7%). In addition, it could save costs and
      consumption of health resources, and improve both the quality of life and the satisfaction of
      people with DM1.

      The present study will be carried out under the usual conditions of clinical practice.

      No pharmacological intervention, other than the usual clinical practice, will be applied to
      the included patients.

      The people with diabetes 1 included in the study have a profile of "expert patient" having
      completed their diabetological education program at basic and advanced level (count of
      rations, calculations of ratios and sensitivity indexes) in such a way that the application
      will only be an aid in your daily decision making (mathematical calculations of ratios, IS,
      and recommended insulin doses, which you usually have to do "by hand").
