      stream when it is given as a liquid with a nasal delivery system called CriticalSorbâ„¢.
      CriticalSorb has been developed by Critical Pharmaceuticals to improve the absorption of
      drugs through the nose into the blood stream in the hope that it will replace injections. For
      part of the study a radioactive compound (routinely used in the nuclear medicine clinic for
      diagnosis) will be added to the formulation in order to investigate how the formulation
      spreads through nose after it is sprayed.

      The study is being carried out in postmenopausal females aged greater than 55 years of age as
      osteoporosis commonly affects these women. The study will involve 8 visits.

      The first visit will be to assess eligibility. On visit 2 the participants will receive an
      injection of the teriparatide. On visits 2-6 the participants will receive a nasal dose of
      teriparatide via nasal devices at different dose levels, blood samples will be taken to
      measure drug levels following dosing.

      For visits 5 and 6 the nasal dose will have a radioactive marker added and gamma camera
      imaging will also be carried out. These visits will also compare two different nasal devices.

      Visit 7 will be a follow up visit. There will be one further visit during the study to
      acquire a MRI scan of the head that will assist analysis of the scintigraphic images.
