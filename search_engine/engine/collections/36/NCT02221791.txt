      days, separated by a 2-week washout. During each visit the participants will, in random
      order, be allocated to one of the three interventions:

        1. High flavan-3-ol chocolate (70g) plus placebo capsule;

        2. White chocolate (70g) plus 100mg of epicatechin in capsule form;

        3. White chocolate (70g) plus placebo capsule; Measurements of vascular function will be
           taken before, and 2 hours after consumption of the supplements. In order to determine
           flavonoid bioavailability, 24-hour urine samples will be collected and 7 blood samples
           will be taken over a period of 8 hours.

      The primary study parameter is the percentage change in Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) as a
      result of a high-flavonoid cocoa or epicatechin challenge. Additional study parameters
      include plasma flavonoid and nitric oxide concentrations as well as pulse wave analysis
      parameters.
