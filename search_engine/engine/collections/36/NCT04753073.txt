      be precursors to cervical cancer (CC), the world's third most common cancer in women (270,000
      deaths / year), which radical therapies are often associated with lifelong severe physical
      and emotional stress. Cross-sectional studies found a prevalence for CIN of 62 per 1,000
      women and incidences of 1.2 (CIN I), 0.8 (CIN II) and 0.7 (CIN III) per 1,000 women per year
      (highest incidence of CIN between 20 and 24 years) age). The standard therapy for the
      treatment of CIN III by LEEP excision is associated with an increase in mortality of 17%. CIN
      III, in particular, is associated with a significant decline in quality of life,
      psychological well-being and sexual health, although on average only about 12% of CIN III
      lesions progress to invasive CC. The resulting over-treatment (in around 8-9 out of 10
      patients) with invasive procedures is a serious problem for affected women, health care
      providers and the health economy.

      The NIPP treatment is a tissue-sparing, pain-free, easy to carry out and outpatient treatment
      method without anesthesia and hospitalization. A non-randomized, one-arm feasibility study at
      the Department of Women's Health (649 / 2017BO1) already showed the effectiveness of a NIPP
      treatment.

      Clinical implications for CIN III:

        -  A previous NIPP treatment should significantly reduce the invasiveness of the LEEP
           excision.

        -  If the oncological safety of NIPP treatment is comparable (histological complete
           remission of CIN III), NIPP is to be established as a safe alternative to LEEP excision
           in the future.
