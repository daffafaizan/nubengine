      envisaged in the study. The assignation to conventional or reduced Alemtuzumab (MabCampath)
      dose will be done depending on the age and risk of suffering GVHD, in function of variables
      coming from general experience.

      High risk of GVHD criteria:

      Gender incompatibility: male patient of female donor. HLA incompatibility: non identical high
      resolution typing in HLA A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 (identity less than 10/10 alleles by high
      resolution) Age of patient more or equal than 55 years

      Conventional doses in high risk (at least one criterion of GVHD high risk):

      100 mg de Alemtuzumab IV total dose in 5, 20 mg fractions, days -8, -7, -6, -5 and -4.

      Reduced dose in low risk cases (no criteria of GVHD high risk):

      50 mg de Alemtuzumab IV total dose en 5 fractions of 10 mg, days -5, -4, -3, -2 and -1.
