      Pre-procedural biopsies will be obtained, if possible. Pretreatment genetic expression,
      proteomic, or metabolomic patterns from the tumor samples will be assessed. Imaging
      characteristics from tumors will be extracted using automated software-the study will apply a
      computational analysis system with the capability to extract and analyze imaging
      characteristics and correlate them to genetic expression, proteomic, and metabolomic tumor
      characteristics. Imaging findings will be correlated to clinical outcomes and genetic,
      proteomic, and metabolomic findings to determine association. Imaging findings and genomic,
      proteomic, and metabolomic tumor characteristics will be correlated to clinical outcomes
      (time to recurrence, overall survival, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year survival).
