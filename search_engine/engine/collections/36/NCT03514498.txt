      following general anesthesia for dental surgery in comparison to children without ASD
      (controls) undergoing dental surgery. In this pilot study, we will investigate this
      hypothesis through the following objectives:

        1. to determine in a clinical study if anesthesia induces post-operative persistent adverse
           changes children with ASD as compared with typically developing controls;

        2. to determine the potential mechanism for the adverse effects of anesthetics on patients
           with ASD compared to healthy controls, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be
           isolated from blood samples (PBMCs), before genomic DNA isolation for mitochondrial
           content analysis.
