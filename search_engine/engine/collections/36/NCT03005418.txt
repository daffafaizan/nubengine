    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi cohort, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 40
      adult patients with life or limb threatening vascular trauma which requires surgical repair.
      There will be a limb cohort and a torso cohort. The limb cohort will include patients who
      require repair of a vessel contained to the upper or lower extremity. The torso cohort
      includes patients who require repair of vessels within the thorax (excluding the heart),
      abdomen, and retroperitoneum. Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular
      Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical
      techniques. There is no control arm.

      The active study duration for each study participant will be 36 months from HAV implantation
      or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier. Follow up after month 12 will involve the
      capture of information on assessments performed at "standard of care" routine clinic visits
      or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her physician with physical exam and
      ultrasound at month 24 and month 36

      The total expected duration of the clinical study is 61 months (24 months of enrollment and
      36 months of follow up).
