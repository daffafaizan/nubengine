      from the regional education registry; four allocated to treatment arm and four to control
      arm.

      A total of 28 seventh grade classes were included in the study; 14 served as treatment and 14
      as control arms. All students present in these classes on the initial visit were invited to
      take part in the study [Treatment=379; Control=255].

      The treatment arm received the new tobacco prevention program (DFND) whereas the control arm
      received only the regular tobacco prevention program administered by the Department of
      Education. DFND was delivered by trained health educators over 5 weeks, two sessions per
      week. Two follow up surveys were administered; at one week and at two years
      post-intervention. Study outcomes were current tobacco use, knowledge about tobacco, attitude
      toward not using tobacco, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) of tobacco use. Covariates
      included sex, parent education, academic performance, absenteeism, student allowance, and
      religiosity.
