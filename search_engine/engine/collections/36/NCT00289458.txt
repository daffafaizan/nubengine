      significantly impairs their ability to walk, climb stairs, shop or participate in exercise
      programs. This can result in social isolation, depression and loss of confidence in their
      ability to manage independently in the community. A decline in physical and psycho-social
      function leads to increased risk of falling. It is crucial to identify high-risk fallers as
      well as the best interventions to decrease that risk; hip fractures from falls are
      devastating, resulting in death or admission to long-term care for the majority who sustain
      them.

      Exercise programs designed to improve balance, strength and mobility can help to improve
      function and decrease risk of falling. However, individuals with hip OA may have difficulty
      participating in these programs due to pain. Aquatic exercise offers an activity alternative
      to improve mobility, strength and decrease fall risk. As well, the addition of a group
      program designed to enhance confidence in movement may further reduce the risk of falls by
      improving independence to be more active at home and in the community.

      This project will evaluate the effect of aquatic exercise and aquatic exercise combined with
      a group educational program on decreasing fall risk in older adults with hip OA. Determining
      optimal fall prevention programs may avert death and loss of quality of life for older
      adults, clearly an important contribution to preventative health care.
