      otoneurological clinical practice. It is characterized by violent, short and relapsing
      vertiginous crises that arise when the patient assumes certain positions of the head in the
      space and is accompanied by a usually "typical" paroxysmal positional nystagmus. In most
      cases we cannot trace the exact causal agent, so we mainly identify two forms: primitive
      forms and secondary forms. BPPV therapy is essentially physical, and it is based on specific
      maneuvers which make the otoconial mass come out of the semicircular canal. Recent studies
      showed the existence of a seasonal trend of BPPV related to fluctuations in Vitamin D levels.
      Based on these considerations this clinical trial was designed in order to evaluate the
      possible efficacy of the administration of Vitamin D (VertistopÂ® D) in preventing recurrence
      of BPPV.
