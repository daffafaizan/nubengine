        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with
           radiotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma,
           glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, or intrinsic pontine glioma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide (ATO).

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Patients
      concurrently receive ATO IV over 1 hour, 1-5 times weekly, for approximately 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ATO until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-36
      months.
