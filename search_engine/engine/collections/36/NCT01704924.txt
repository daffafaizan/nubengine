      abdominal surgery. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy has been observed to decrease
      seroma and infection rates in high risk patients. This study aims to quantify the effect, if
      any, that negative pressure wound therapy has on closed incisions. The technology may provide
      benefits even in lower risk patients.
