    
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary aim of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety of multi-drug chemotherapy
      (with the addition of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] agent erlotinib
      [erlotinib hydrochloride]) and concomitant radiotherapy followed by resection and
      consolidative erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer as judged by
      the dose limiting toxicities. Correlative endpoints include an analysis of pre-treatment
      tumor cyclin D1 expression and EGFR expression/amplification.

      III. Correlate pathologic complete response with changes in fludeoxyglucose F 18
      (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) - pre and
      post-chemoradiation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week and
      receive fluorouracil intravenously (IV) continuously and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO)
      QD on days 1-38. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29.

      SURGERY: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with potentially
      resectable disease (i.e., complete response, partial response, or stable disease) undergo
      surgery to remove the tumor.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients with tumors that
      demonstrate positive immunohistochemistry for EGFR and/or cyclin D1 (in the pretreatment
      biopsy or in the residual tumor in the esophagectomy specimen) receive consolidation
      chemotherapy comprising erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
