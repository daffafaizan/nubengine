      myocardium in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Paradoxically,
      restoration of the blood flow to the ischemic area may result in further injury to the
      myocardium.

      This phenomenon is described as 'ischemia/reperfusion injury' and the pathophysiological
      mechanisms are not fully elucidated. A cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning as
      well for postconditioning (short repetitive cycles of reperfusion and re-occlusion) has been
      demonstrated in experimental studies and in pilot studies on patients with acute STEMI
      treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Aim of this study is to compare for the first time the combination of intrahospital pre- and
      postconditioning versus exclusive postconditioning versus control. The primary endpoint of
      this study will be the salvaged area at risk assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
