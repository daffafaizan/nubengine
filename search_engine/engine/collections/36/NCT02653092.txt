      hypogonadotropic hypogonadal phenotype. Reduced LH, FSH, estradiol (E2) and progesterone
      secretion are well documented during the menstrual cycles of obese women compared to normal
      weight women (NWW).4,5. Decreased gonadotropin secretion associated with obesity is related
      to reduced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH6. This reduction in pituitary sensitivity suggests
      mediation by circulating factors such as cytokines, insulin, or other pro-inflammatory
      signals known to be elevated in obesity. We have recently discovered that the combination of
      hyperinsulinemia and circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), but neither agent alone, can
      acutely decrease gonadotropin secretion in NWW as well as men, establishing a direct causal
      linkage for the central hypothesis of this proposal: that chronic pituitary suppression
      partially mediates obesity related subfertility. Our working model is that the combination of
      excess, possibly pro-inflammatory (omega-6) circulating FFAs and insulin resistance
      associated with obesity, cause decreased pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, with a resulting
      relative sex steroid deficit that further exacerbates the obese phenotype. We have named this
      phenotype the reprometabolic syndrome. We propose to examine the interrelationships among
      obesity, reproductive dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction in a mechanistic fashion. We will
      induce the hypogonadotropic hypogonadal phenotype of obesity in NWW, who will be primed with
      a high-fat diet (HFD) designed to increase circulating FFAs and produce short-term insulin
      resistance and higher insulin levels.1,7-11 Before and after priming, we will test the
      additive effects of lipid excess, insulin, and inflammation on the reproductive and metabolic
      axes.
