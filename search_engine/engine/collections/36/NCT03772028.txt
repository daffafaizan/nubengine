      combination with HIPEC (treatment arm) improves outcome compared to primary cytoreductive
      surgery without HIPEC (standard arm) with acceptable morbidity, in patients with FIGO stage
      III epithelial ovarian cancer who are eligible for primary cytoreductive surgery with no
      residual disease, or residual disease up to 2.5 mm.
