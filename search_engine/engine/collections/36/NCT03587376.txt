      (54861911ALZ2002 [NCT02260674], 54861911ALZ2003 [NCT02569398], or 54861911ALZ2004
      [NCT02406027]) with atabecestat. In this study, participants will only have blood drawn. The
      primary hypotheses for this study is that adverse event of elevated liver enzymes observed in
      some participants is caused by a T-cell dependent inflammatory response. Participants will be
      monitored for adverse events and will be called 1 day after the blood draw to assess for any
      adverse events.
