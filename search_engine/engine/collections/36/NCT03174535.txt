      events. Risk assessment is important for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. To date, no
      study has been conducted to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke endpoint events by
      establishing risk accessment models combining TCM and modern medicine indicators.

      The present study aims to develope a risk assessment model of ischemic stroke endpoint events
      combining multi-dimensional TCM indicators with modern medicine indicators. The proposed
      study is a registry study based participant survey conducted in 7 hospitals nationwide in
      China. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 3000 study patients diagnosed with
      ischemic stroke will be recruited. 1-year follow-ups are carried out on-site in hospitals and
      by telephone to track endpoint events. Comparative analysis of prevalence of endpoint events
      and other TCM or modern medicine features in different groups is conducted using frequency
      analysis and chi-squared tests, and expressed with composition ratios. Comparative analysis
      of quantitative scores of the scales and related syndromes or symptoms is conducted using
      rank-sum test. Correlation analysis of endpoint events and TCM or modern medicine factors
      will be performed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.
