      control to optimize the complete training process. Coaches and athletes are confronted with
      numerous potentially effective recovery methods, e.g. cooling, warming, active recovery,
      compression, massage or power naps. However, the effectivity of these methods has rarely been
      investigated under controlled scientific conditions. Based on the state of the art,so far
      hardly any definite practical conclusions regarding effective recovery methods can be drawn,
      especially regarding sport-specific strategies and settings. Currently, cold water immersion
      is a particularly popular recovery strategy. However, there are hints that repeated cooling
      interventions after training can impair the training effect. This could potentially be caused
      by a faster reconstitution of homeostasis due to cooling. For fast recovery of performance,
      this effect would be desirable, but at the same time these homeostatic disturbances are the
      basis of signal processes leading to training adaptations.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if regular cold water immersion after strength
      training has a negative influence on the desired training-induced performance enhancement.
