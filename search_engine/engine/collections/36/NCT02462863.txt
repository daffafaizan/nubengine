      levels in type 2 diabetes and provide the basis for safe and effective treatment. This should
      result in an increased resistance to infection, decrease in cardiovascular disease and
      improve mortality as will be shown in subsequent studies.

      Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate proof of concept that supplementation of a normal (diabetic)
      diet with oral arginine and fish oil will reverse or at least improve glucose control, and
      improve hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship of plasma amino acid profiles and concentration
      of selected fatty acids in cellular (RBC) membranes to the resolution of type 2 diabetes.
