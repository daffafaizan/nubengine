      treatment. 18F-FDG PET has been considered as a powerful neuroimaging technology used by
      physicians to assess patients for epilepsy. However, imaging quality, viewing angles, and
      experiences may easily degrade the consistency in epilepsy diagnosis. In this work, the
      investigators develop a framework that combines radiomics analysis and deep learning
      techniques to a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) method to detect epileptic foci of
      pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using PET images.

      Methods:Ten PET radiomics features related to pediatric temporal bole epilepsy are first
      extracted and modelled. Then a neural network called Siamese network is trained to quanti-fy
      the asymmetricity and automatically locate epileptic focus for diagnosis.The performance of
      the proposed framework was tested and compared with both the state-of-art clinician software
      tool and human physicians with different levels of experiences to validate the accuracy and
      consistency.
