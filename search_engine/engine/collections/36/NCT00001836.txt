      investigation for detecting and quantitating coronary artery calcification. However, EBCT is
      expensive, and the asymmetric gantry geometry makes it less useful for routine scanning;
      thus, EBCT is not readily available to the general population. Recent reports have shown that
      "volumetric" (also known as "helical" or "spiral") scanners, which are much more commonly
      available than EBCT, can detect coronary artery calcifications. Updated software available to
      the NIH which will allow for EKG gating of volumetric scans should improve the quality of the
      images, and thus improve the ability to accurately quantitate coronary calcification by
      volumetric scanners. We would like to compare the results of volumetric scans with that of
      standard EBCT in order to characterize similarities and differences between the two scanning
      techniques. We propose to obtain EBCT and volumetric CT scans of the coronary arteries in a
      group of patients with known or suspected coronary artery calcification, including subjects
      of sufficiently advanced age, and to calculate the calcium score by each method. Our primary
      analysis will be a comparison of the sensitivities of the two methods.
