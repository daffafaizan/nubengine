    
      A prospective study of 600 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and symptoms who
      underwent TAVI at the Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Norway between January 2012 and
      July 2019.

      Demographics, clinical data including cardiovascular risk factors, arterial and
      echocardiographic parameters were prospectively collected. The data on all-cause mortality
      will be collected. Echocardiograms (immediate before TAVI, at discharge after TAVI and at
      6-12 months follow-up) will be analyzed. The main scientific objectives are:

      To assess survival benefits of TAVI according to baseline risk profile. To determine the
      echocardiographic predictors of left ventricular mass regression and left ventricular
      function recovery.

      To evaluate global LV load (Zva=valvular-arterial impedance) following TAVI. To assess the
      impact of various types of blood pressure responses immediately after TAVI on clinical
      outcomes.
