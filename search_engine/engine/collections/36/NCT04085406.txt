      medicine and a significant source of patient suffering and disability, leading to opioid
      misuse and addiction. Previous neuromodulatory therapies for CLBP have focused primarily on
      spinal etiologies and intra-spinal mechanisms of pain transmission. However, existing
      pharmacological and neuromodulatory therapies have not been successful in treating CLBP. This
      project aims to address critical gaps and the unmet therapeutic needs of CLBP patients by
      using the Abbott Infinity DBS System; a next generation DBS device with directional steering
      capability implanted bilaterally in the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) to engage networks
      known to mediate the affective component of CLBP. The objective is to (1) Assess the
      preliminary efficacy of DBS of the SCC in the treatment of medically refractory CLBP; (2)
      Demonstrate the safety and feasibility of SCC DBS for CLBP; and (3) Develop diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI)-based blueprints of response to SCC DBS for CLBP. The overall impact of this
      proof-of-concept pilot trial includes validation of the concept that suffering from CLBP
      results from pathological activity in affective brain networks, that these networks can be
      accurately engaged using a next-generation directional DBS device in a safe and feasible
      manner, and the discover of neuroimaging biomarkers of response to SCC DBS for CLBP.
