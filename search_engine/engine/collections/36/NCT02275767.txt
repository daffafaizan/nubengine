      cortical bone allograft, cancellous bone allograft, or a combination of both cortical and
      cancellous bone allograft. This entire protocol involves procedures that are standard care.
      All materials are FDA-approved materials being used in an FDA-approved manner. The study is a
      3-arm, parallel-design, randomized, prospective clinical trial. The test group subjects will
      have extraction sockets grafted with a combination of 50% cortical/50% cancellous FDBA. This
      test group will be compared to two active control groups - one using 100% cortical FDBA and
      the other using 100% cancellous FDBA. The null hypothesis is that there will be no
      significant difference in formation of new vital bone between treatment groups (primary
      outcome).

      Each subject will provide a single non-molar tooth site for study treatment. After tooth
      extraction, the graft material will be placed and covered by a non-resorbable membrane.
      Following 18-20 weeks of healing, the dental implant will be place, at which time a core of
      bone will be removed from the site as part of the preparation for the implant. The core
      biopsy will then be evaluated for the primary histologic outcome of % vital bone formation
      and secondary histologic outcome of % residual graft material.
