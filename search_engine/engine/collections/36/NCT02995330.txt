      will be treated with a standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of
      Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV Days -6 to -2; Cy 14.5 mg/kg IV Days -6 and -5; Total body
      irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy Day -1. On Day 0, patients will be infused with non-T-cell depleted
      bone marrow from a related female donor. Patients will receive GVHD prophylaxis consisting
      of: Cy 50mg/kg IV on Days +3 and +4; tacrolimus (IV or PO) beginning on Day +5 [dose adjusted
      to maintain trough level of 5-15 ng/mL] through day+180; Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg
      PO TID, with a maximum dose of 1g TID beginning on Day +5 through Day +35. Patients will
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) 5 mcg/kg/day beginning on Day +5 and continued until ANC â‰¥
      1500/mm3. Lastly, to produce maintenance tumor antigen stimulation, patients will be
      maintained on continuous LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy (if not previously surgically
      castrated) to suppress endogenous testosterone production throughout the treatment period;
      testosterone cypionate 400 mg IM will be administered on Day +60, +90, and +120 (every 30
      days x 3 doses). Patients who achieve biochemical CR will stop LHRH agonist/antagonist
      treatment at day 180. Patients will be followed for 3 years post-BMT.
