      dietary intervention with moderate in fat content (~35% energy as fat) for 12 weeks on the
      improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors in centrally obese shift workers. Forty centrally
      obese shift workers (waist circumference â‰¥94 cm) were randomized (1:1) to the experimental
      group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 20). Eligibility criteria included: aged between
      30-60 years, working rotating shifts for at least 5 years and working night shifts minimum
      five times a month. Excluded criteria was described in the point "Eligibility". Written
      informed consent was obtained from all of the participants, and the local ethic committee
      approved the study. The dietary intervention was mainly based on the simple rearrangement of
      shift workers' diets by replacing food items including SFA (e.g. butter) with those being
      sources of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), mainly canola oil (given to the diet as spread or
      this oil was added separately to main meals)
