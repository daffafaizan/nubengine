      with mucosal healing and 2) restoration of normal growth and development. Current therapy in
      most cases includes induction of remission with corticosteroids followed by maintenance of
      remission with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or mesalamine. With this approach, the goals of
      achieving mucosal healing with normalization of growth are not achieved in a significant
      number of children. GH therapy is now used in several chronic childhood diseases which are
      complicated by growth failure despite adequate GH secretion. These include chronic renal
      failure (CRF), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), and Turner's syndrome. However, despite a
      comparable frequency and magnitude of permanent growth failure, the efficacy of GH therapy in
      this respect has not yet been determined in a controlled trial for CD. Moreover, whether GH
      therapy may also directly reduce disease activity and promote intestinal healing is not
      known. This represents a significant clinically unmet need in this patient population.
      Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed to both improve final adult height and
      enhance intestinal mucosal healing in children with CD.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of growth hormone (GH) therapy
      upon colon mucosal healing in a 12 week randomized trial in children with Crohn's Disease
      (CD). Children with active CD will be randomized to GH + prednisone (GP) or prednisone alone
      (P) for a 12 week period. This study also involves a 52 week extension phase where all
      participants that meet eligibility will be given the opportunity to take or continue taking
      growth hormone for 52 weeks.
