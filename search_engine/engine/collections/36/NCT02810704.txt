      tolerances of individuals who face decisions about different drugs and strategies for deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) prevention after total hip (THA) and knee
      (TKA) replacement. Indeed, clinical equipoise exists to ethically support such a randomized
      trial that has great potential to change current practice. We have selected the three
      prophylaxis methods that represent current orthopaedic practice in North America and
      collectively account for more than 80% of all hip and knee replacements; a) enteric coated
      aspirin (regimen with lowest bleeding risk; clinical PE and all-cause mortality rates
      comparable to more intensive anticoagulants), b) low intensity (INR Target 2.0) warfarin
      (time honored and one of the most common North American regimens; low bleeding risk [1-2%]),
      and c) rivaroxaban, a new oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor (regimen with lowest PE and DVT
      rate but higher bleeding risk [3-5%]). Prophylaxis will continue for 30 days, in accordance
      with clinical guidelines, and pneumatic compression will be utilized in hospital in
      conjunction with each treatment group. Each regimen is commonly used in contemporary
      practice, supported by observational and clinical trial data, and endorsed by the American
      College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)
