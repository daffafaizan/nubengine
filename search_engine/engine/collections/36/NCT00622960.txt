      medical nutrition therapy is an integral component of diabetes management, nutrition
      recommendations for diabetes have often been based on clinical experience and expert
      consensus, rather than on carefully controlled clinical trials. The expert consensus on
      medical nutrition therapy is that carbohydrate and monounsaturated fat together should
      provide approximately 60-70% of total energy intake. This recommendation accommodates parties
      on both sides of a debate over what constitutes the optimal macronutrient composition of a
      diet for type 2 diabetic patients. On one side are proponents of high carbohydrate, low fat
      diets who contend that this regimen promotes the lowering of total- and LDL-cholesterol and
      is less calorically dense than diets containing a higher percentage of fat. On the other side
      are advocates of high monounsaturated fat, Mediterranean-type diets who cite data from
      short-term studies indicating that this approach decreases postprandial levels of plasma
      glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, and increases HDL-cholesterol more than isocaloric high
      carbohydrate diets. However, there is concern about the potential for high fat diets to
      increase energy intake and weight gain among free-living subjects. To make definitive,
      scientifically-based diet recommendations, it is essential that controlled long-term trials
      be conducted to demonstrate the health effects of specific percentages of monounsaturated
      fats and carbohydrates in the diets of persons with type 2 diabetes.
