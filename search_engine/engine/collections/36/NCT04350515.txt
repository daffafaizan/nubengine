      perceived as unjust. Nonetheless, there is little empiric evidence of unjust behaviour by
      others in the interpersonal context that triggers embitterment reactions. Ostracism, is an
      act where a person is excluded from a social environment without any reasons. This
      experimental labor study examines how the experiences of this form of social exclusion
      influences individuals depending on their self-evaluated embitterment. That is,
      fairness-behaviour is assessed as well as changes in hearth rate variability.
