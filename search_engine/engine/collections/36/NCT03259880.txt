      from a self-limiting mild illness to rapidly progressive multiple organ failure. Statistics
      suggest that 10-20% of patients with AP develop severe AP (SAP),1 which usually has an
      unfavourable disease progression and is associated with a poor prognosis. (Banks PA,
      Bollen,et al.).

      The two most common and important causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (40-70%) and
      alcohol (25-35%) (Tenner S et al., 2014) Gallstone pancreatitis is usually due to an
      obstructing stone in the pancreatic duct near the sphincter of Oddi ( Bhatia M et al .,2005).
      In alcohol-related pancreatitis, it is believed that the acinar cells of the pancreas are
      susceptible to damage by ethanol and underlie the etiology of the disease ( Tonsi AF et al .,
      2009). Another common cause, iatrogenic pancreatitis, may occur after endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in up to 5% of patients. Other etiologies of acute
      pancreatitis include medications, infections, trauma, hereditary, hypertriglyceridemia and
      autoimmune disease.

      According to the American College of Gastroenterology, a patient must have two of the
      following three features present to make a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis The diagnostic
      criteria used for acute pancreatitis includes:

        1. Clinical criteria - history of pain in abdomen radiating to the back and relieved on
           bending forward associated with tenderness/guarding in the upper abdomen.

        2. Radiographic evidence - Computed Tomography findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis
           such as pancreatic edema, pancreatic necrosis, peripancreatic fluid collections

        3. Biochemical - Serum amylase concentration greater than 180 Somogyii units (by the
           Somogyii method).
