        2. apply pre-defined measures to each group(arm) ( summarized in arms and interventions

        3. induction using propofol 2mg/kg

        4. After bispectral index (BIS) goes below 60 & patient become unconsciousness, inject

        5. intubate patient between 3 and 4 minutes after propofol injection

        6. measure blood pressure ( systolic, diastolic, mean ) & heart rate at 1,2,3,4,5 minutes
