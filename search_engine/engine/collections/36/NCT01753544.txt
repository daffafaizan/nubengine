      of the endoscope. Acetic acid (1.5%) and indigo carmine dye are sprayed onto the lesion to
      clarify the margin. Markings are made 10 mm outside the tumor margin using a laser fiber with
      a power setting at 30 W. After marking, a mixture of sodium hyaluronate with indigo carmine
      and epinephrine (1:25000) is injected into the submucosa outside the marking dots. A
      circumferential mucosal incision and submucosal dissection are performed by a thulium laser
      fiber with a power setting at 30 to 40 W. Activation of the laser beam is controlled by
      stepping on a foot pedal. Hemostasis during procedure is also attempted using the thulium
      laser. When hemostasis is not achieved properly, additional use of hemostatic forceps or a
      hemoclip will be considered.
