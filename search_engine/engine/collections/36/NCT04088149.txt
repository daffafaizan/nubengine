      Considering 20% dropout rate (based on evaluable versus treated patients), approximately 15
      subjects will be enrolled, and at least 12 subjects will be evaluable. Cohort 1 will recruit
      the first 3 evaluable subjects assigned to receive low dose of GXNPC-1. The following 3
      evaluable subjects will be enrolled sequentially and treated with high dose of GXNPC-1 in
      cohort 2. In cohort 3, another 6 evaluable subjects will be enrolled to take high dose of
      GXNPC-1. There will be 2 parts of this study including GXNPC-1 preparation and GXNPC-1
      treatment in chronic stroke subjects, respectively.
