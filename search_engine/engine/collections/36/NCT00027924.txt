      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
      (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated with fludarabine and busulfan. II. Determine
      the incidence of donor stem cell engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. III.
      Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with
      this regimen. IV. Determine the incidence of persistent or recurrent CML or MDS in patients
      treated with this regimen. V. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine IV on days -9 to -6
      and oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -5 to -2. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis
      comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine orally or IV twice daily
      on days -1 to 100 followed by a taper until day 180. Patients are followed every 6 months for
      2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
