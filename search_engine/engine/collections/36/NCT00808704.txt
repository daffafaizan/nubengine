      health problem worldwide. Moderate to severe HIE of newborn infants is associated with a high
      rate of death or long-term disabilities. Historically, treatment has been purely supportive
      including stabilizing cardio-respiratory functions and treating convulsions.Recent
      multi-center trials assessing the effects of hypothermia demonstrated improved outcome in
      term neonates with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, hypothermia was
      not effective beyond 6 hrs after brain injury.

      Systemically administered EPO was neuroprotective in neonatal brain injury models. Clinical
      study on adult stroke showed improved outcome. However, treating HIE with EPO raises a series
      of questions such as: i) Can the patient population of this study readily be compared with
      those in the hypothermia trials? ii) What are the pharmacokinetics of EPO, including issues
      of dosage and timing, and does administered EPO cross the blood-brain-barrier? iii) How does
      the effectiveness, side effects and potentials of EPO therapy compare with induced
      hypothermia?
