      midline and endline) in a sample of 1,440 children between 6 and 24 months of age, mainly to
      asses the program's impact on child nutrition and health outcomes; ii) a panel study
      following a cohort of 2,880 children over 3 years mainly focusing on the evaluation of
      household welfare outcomes. The study will be conducted in the 96 communes where the
      Jigisemejiri program is being implemented, situated in 5 regions of Mali: Sikasso, Koulikoro,
      Segou, Mopti and Kayes. Data will be collected at baseline (2014, T=0), midline (2016, T=~24
      months) and endline (2018, T=~48 months).

      The program is implemented for 48 months. The experimental group receives the cash transfer
      and group counselling intervention for 36 months. During the last 12 months the experimental
      group does not receive any intervention. The control group receives no intervention during
      the first 36 months, but receives the cash transfer and group counselling during the last 12
      months. In a subsample of communes from the experimental group, villages were randomized to
      either receive Preventive Nutrition Packages (PNP) or nothing. The impact of PNP is analyzed
      by comparing villages that received PNP and villages that did not receive PNP during the last
      12 months of the program.
