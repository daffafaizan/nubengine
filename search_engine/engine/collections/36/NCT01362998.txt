      sections who are candidates for regional anesthesia. Exclusion criteria include morbid
      obesity (BMI > 40), age less that 18 years, history of sleep apnea, and abuse of or
      intolerance to opioid analgesics.

      All patients will also receive 100 micrograms of fentanyl once epidurally during the Cesarean
      section, and they will receive ibuprofen every six hours for the first 24 hours after the
      Cesarean section. The patients will be visited twice a day postoperatively for two days. The
      epidural morphine will be expected to last only approximately 20 hours, while the fentanyl
      infusion will be kept in place for two days after the procedure. Additional analgesics, such
      as intravenous morphine or PO oxycodone and tylenol, will be available for breakthrough pain.
