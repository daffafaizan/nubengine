      mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be formulated as a
      naked plasmid DNA vaccine (WUSM-MGBA-01). The hypothesis of this study is that the
      mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and capable of generating
      measurable CD8 T cell responses to mammaglobin-A. The primary objective of this study is to
      demonstrate the safety of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the immunogenicity of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine as measured by ELISPOT analysis,
      a surrogate for CD8 T cell function.
