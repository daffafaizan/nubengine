      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign the consent form will be evaluated with the
      following exams before and after inspiratory muscle training: manovacuometry, spirometry,
      diaphragmatic ultrasound and an anthropometric evaluation. After inspiratory muscle training,
      all patients will also perform polysomnography again to check for apnea-hypopnea index
      change.The patients screened will be randomized and allocated into two groups, intervention
      and control. In the intervention group, the patients will perform the exercises with the
      inspiratory muscular training apparatus called Powerbreathe with progressive load, according
      to its inspiratory muscular force. The control group will perform the same exercises, with
      the same apparatus, but without load.Patients in the intervention group will perform
      inspiratory muscle training as follows: in the first and second weeks, the patients will be
      instructed to perform the breathing exercises three times a week, performing four sets of six
      repetitions with one minute rest, with load of 50% of the maximum inspiratory pressure that
      will be preset in the Powerbreathe device by the study collaborators. At the end of the
      second week, they will perform reassessment of inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximal
      expiratory pressure, with a 75% load adjustment of the PIM in the Powerbreathe device, and
      the patients being instructed to perform the same series and repetitions with frequency of
      exercise in five times in the week in the third and fourth week. At the end of the fourth
      week, they will perform a reassessment of the inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximal
      expiratory pressures, with a 75% load adjustment of the MIP in the Powerbreathe device and
      the patients being instructed to perform the same series and repetitions with frequency of
      exercise in five times in the week on the fifth and sixth week. At the end of the sixth week,
      they will perform a reassessment of inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximal expiratory
      pressure, with a 80% load adjustment of the MIP in the Powerbreathe device and the patients
      being instructed to perform the same series and repetitions with frequency of exercise in
      seven times in the week in the seventh and eighth week. The no-load (control) inspiratory
      muscle training group will perform the same series, repetitions and frequency of breathing
      exercises and reassessments of the intervention group, but there will be no load adjustment
      on the Powerbreathe appliances of this group.
