      a risk that the early relationship is disturbed. There is no known treatment that is both
      effective and harmless. Acupuncture releases different neurotransmitters and hormones, gives
      pain reduction and affects digestion. Acupuncture in infantile colic has not been studied in
      a scientific way even though the method is used in many countries. In this randomised study
      we will investigate if acupuncture affects symptoms in infantile colic.
