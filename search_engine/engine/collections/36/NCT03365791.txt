    
      This was a phase II, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      the combination of PDR001+LAG525 across multiple tumor types that are relapsed and/or
      refractory to available standard of care therapies. There were 7 tumor cohorts assessed: 1)
      Small cell lung cancer, 2) Gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma, 3) Castration resistant
      prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC), 4) Soft tissue sarcoma, 5) Ovarian adenocarcinoma, 6)
      Advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and 7) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL).

      Participants were treated with the combination of PDR001 with LAG525 once every 3 weeks (Q3W)
      via intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Participants received study treatment for a maximum of 2
      years, or until disease progression (assessed by investigator per Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or the Revised Response Criteria for
      Malignant Lymphoma criteria (Cheson et al 2007)), unacceptable toxicity, death or
      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason.
