    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the number of days from surgery to initiation of radiation and adjuvant therapy
      with the addition of celecoxib compared to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall pain control and management for patients on celecoxib compared to
      placebo.

      II. To assess functional outcomes for patients on celecoxib compared to placebo.

      III. To assess the effect of celecoxib therapy on Quality of Life (QoL) compared to placebo.

      IV. To assess the average number of treatment days missed during adjuvant therapy for
      patients on celecoxib compared to placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) or via feeding tube twice daily (BID) starting
      5 days prior to surgery and continues until the completion of radiation therapy (up to 6
      months in total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO or via feeding tube BID starting 5 days prior to surgery
      and continues until the completion of radiation therapy (up to 6 months in total) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
