      Sangre Por Salud Biobank at Mountain Park Medical Center. These include men and women age
      18-85 of Hispanic/Latino descent, who are not pregnant or have given birth in the previous 12
      months, or who are nursing, and who have not been diagnosed with cancer in the previous three
      years. Two groups of patients are included, representing those who have not been diagnosed as
      having diabetes, and those with diabetes. Subjects undergo entry physical examination and
      standard metabolic phenotyping, with the non-diabetics also undergoing a 2-hour glucose
      tolerance test. Blood samples are also banked and available for other studies, such as the
      one now being described.

      For the current study, 5 ml of blood will be coded and delivered in an anonymized form. Buffy
      coat cells will be isolated and infected ex vivo with a viral construct including the wild
      type CCK1R tagged with a fluorescent tag. Cells will be placed in culture overnight and
      harvested for quantitation of receptor expression and determination of CCK responsiveness and
      cholesterol content. These data will be correlated with selected relevant clinical,
      biochemical, and morphometric data.
