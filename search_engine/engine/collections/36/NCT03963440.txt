      the care prescriber, leaving patients to manage and monitor their health. Long-term adherence
      to care programs, including physical exercise, is paramount for these patients in order to
      maintain a beneficial long-term effect, which is the case in non-specific chronic low back
      pain. However, evidence shows that compliance levels following a physical exercise
      prescription are low, limiting the benefits this could bring.

      Currently, EARS is validated for chronic low back pain in its English version. To our
      knowledge and to the knowledge of the questionnaire's author, E.Godfrey, there are no other
      studies that have examined the validation of EARS in the French language for chronic low back
      pain.

      Patients will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires after completing the
      non-opposition form. The management of non-specific chronic low back pain also requires
      evaluation through questionnaires, in accordance with the usual practices of the services
      participating in the study. No intervention will be taken.
