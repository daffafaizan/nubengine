      as high as 50%. Contributing to this error rate are the complexity of pediatric weight-based
      dosing, confusing formulations of liquid medications, and a reliance on non-standardized
      dosing tools such as kitchen teaspoons and tablespoons to administer medications. Families
      with low health literacy are at particular risk for medication administration errors. Health
      literacy promoting interventions to improve medication administration such as dissemination
      of a pictogram-based medication list have been shown to work for common over-the-counter
      medications such as acetaminophen, but their effect on administration practices for common
      medications prescribed in the pediatric emergency department (PED) has not been evaluated. Of
      the 50,000 patients seen in the PED each year, approximately 85% of patients are discharged
      with a prescription for medication. This makes the PED an ideal setting to implement a health
      literacy intervention to reduce medication administration errors at home. The investigators
      are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an educational module focused on
      how to administer antibiotics at home and test whether there is an improvement in care
      practices.
