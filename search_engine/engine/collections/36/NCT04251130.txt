    
      This is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study using the radiotracer [18F]-PI-2620 to
      determine the relationship of tau pathology to both cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical
      and biomarker data of NACC cohort participants who are Cognitively Normal or MCI. All
      subjects will already be part of the longitudinal cohort study, known as the "NACC" cohort,
      of the PMC/ADC (protocol 068200). Participants will provide informed consent for this
      protocol before beginning any study procedures. After screening assessments, participants
      will undergo PET scan imaging with [18F]PI-2620. There will be one follow-up [18F]PI-2620 PET
      scan approximately 18 +/- 6 months after bas eline scan.
