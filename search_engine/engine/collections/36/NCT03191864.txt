    
      FLUTE is a phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial
      of APT-1011 versus placebo in 100 adult subjects (â‰¥18 years of age) diagnosed with EoE.
      Efficacy (including histologic, endoscopic, and symptomatic response), safety, and PK of
      APT-1011 will be examined. Participants will be given an electronic diary to record symptoms
      and medication intake daily.

      FLUTE will be conducted in several parts (Screening [4 weeks], followed by a 4-week Baseline
      Symptom Assessment, and 2 treatment parts [Part 1: 14-week Induction and Part 2: 38-week
      Maintenance]), with a follow-up visit to occur 2 weeks after the final dose of study drug.

      In Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive
      placebo or one of 4 active doses of APT-1011. All subjects will receive one tablet 30 minutes
      after breakfast and one tablet at bedtime (HS). The dosing groups include: 1.5 mg HS
      APT-1011, 1.5 mg twice daily (BID) (total daily dose of 3 mg) APT-1011, 3 mg HS APT-1011, and
      3 mg BID (total daily dose of 6 mg) APT-1011, and placebo BID.

      In Part 2, all subjects classified as histologic responders at Week 12 will continue to be
      treated according to the dosing group to which they were randomized, and non-responders will
      receive single-blind 3 mg BID. All subjects who are histologic non-responders at Week 26 will
      stop treatment at Week 28 and enter the 2-week follow-up and exit the study. Histologic
      responders at Week 26 will continue on the same dose until end-of-study at Week 52.

      Subjects will complete a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the final dose of study drug. All
      subjects must have a final EGD within 3 weeks prior to completing the Follow-up Visit unless
      the subject withdraws consent or has a contraindication to EGD.
