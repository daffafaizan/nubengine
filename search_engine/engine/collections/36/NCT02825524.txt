      after endoscopic ampullectomy for adenoma. Such lesions conduct to a difficult therapeutic
      problem because surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy or trans-duodenal resection) has significant
      morbidity compared to non-invasive lesions. The use of endoscopic destruction techniques of
      dysplastic lesions, including radio-frequency could be an interesting alternative to reduce
      the risk of invasive cancer with less morbidity. Ablation with radio-frequency (RF) is a
      technique of local tissue destruction in use in many applications, percutaneously or
      intraoperatively for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma smaller and more recently for
      the endoscopic treatment of high-grade dysplasia of Barrett's esophagus. An RF probe has been
      developed for an endo-biliary application (Habib EndoHPB, Emcision) and 2 preliminary studies
      have reported the use in humans, in the indication of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. These
      two studies have confirmed the feasibility of the technique, with few side effects and
      probable anti-tumor efficacy demonstrated by expanding the area of stenosis after treatment.
