      safety concerns in the catheterization laboratory. Patients undergoing diagnostic angiography
      +/- ad hoc PCI or planned PCI, will be randomised to conventional settings (15 FPS and 15
      PPS) or low frame rate settings (7.5 FPS and 15 PPS) or low Cine settings (7.5 FPS and 10
      PPS). The patient radiation dose, patient radiation dose area product (DAP), and fluoroscopy
      time will be measured.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Demographic and procedural variables will be presented as percentage (categorical variable)
      or mean Â± SD (continuous variable). Patients will be randomized into three arms - a control
      arm and two intervention arms. The angiographic radiation protocol will adhere to standard
      practice in both fluoroscopy and cine images at 15 frames/second. The intervention arm will
      consist of two groups. Group 1 with fluoroscopy images set at 7.5 frames/second and cine
      images set at 15 frames/second and group 2 with fluoroscopy set at 7.5 frames/second and cine
      set at 10 frames/second.

      Sample size calculations are based on assuming a reduction in radiation dose in group 1 of
      10% and in group 2 of 20%. At 5% significance and 80% power, a sample size of 200 patients
      will be required in each intervention arm. Allowing for a 10% attrition rate, a sample size
      of 220 patients will be required in each intervention arm with 100 patients in the control
      arm.
