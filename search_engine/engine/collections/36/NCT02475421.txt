      degradation of glucagon differ between healthy control subjects and patients with type 2
      diabetes. Furthermore, the investigators wish to examine whether obesity is an independent
      factor for altered glucagon metabolism. Thus, by examining glucagon elimination in obese
      subjects with and without type 2 diabetes and in lean subjects with and without type 2
      diabetes the investigators will be able to describe the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of
      glucagon in a broad spectrum of individuals with different levels of insulin resistance and
      beta cell dysfunction.
