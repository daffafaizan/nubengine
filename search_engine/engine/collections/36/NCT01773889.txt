    
      The aims of this study are to:

        -  Assess the efficacy of adding pegylated IFN-α2b to denileukin diftitox to treat selected
           advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancers

        -  Test the immune-modulating effects of adding pegylated IFN-α2b to denileukin diftitox in
           ovarian cancer patients and relate them to clinical efficacy

        -  Identify any toxicity associated with pegylated IFN-α2b plus denileukin diftitox
           treatment in these patients

        -  Identify practical means to dose the immunomodulating agents denileukin diftitox and
           pegylated IFN-α2b based on immunopharmacodynamic metrics
