      Day 5/6 (depending on the timing of the loading dose), and a follow-up phase for a total of
      28 days post randomization. Participants will have assessments completed at Day 7, Day 10,
      Day 14, and Day 28. Depending on discharge date, assessments will be completed either while
      hospitalized or during outpatient visits. The duration of the participant's participation
      will be approximately 28 days. The study will be performed in 2 parts. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups in part 1, and to one of 3 treatment groups in
      part 2. Treatment groups will be evaluated for PK and safety after a target of approximately
      24 participants have been enrolled in part 1 and before initiating part 2 (approximately 90
      participants in part 2). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established
      to monitor the safety of participants and will review data in an unblinded manner on a
      regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study and
      to evaluate whether efficacy objectives are met. The committee will meet periodically to
      review interim data. Based on the recommendations of the IDMC following interim
      analyses/reviews, an increase in duration may be implemented.
