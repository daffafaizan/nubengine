    
      This is a randomized phase 2 trial with 2 groups (control group vs experimental group).
      Patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LR-NPC) assigned to the control
      group will receive standardized CIRT with a dose of 63 gray equivalent (GyE) in 21 fractions
      (fx). This regimen was obtained from our previous phase 1 (dose escalation) study. For
      patients assigned to the experimental group, a predictive model will be used to predict the
      chance of developing mucosal necrosis after salvage carbon-ion radiotherapy, and
      individualized dose prescription will be given. A dose of 60 GyE/20 fx, 63 GyE/21 fx and 66
      GyE/22 fx will be given to patients with high, moderate and low risk of developing mucosal
      necrosis, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the 2-year
      progression-free survival (PFS) between 2 groups. The secondary endpoints include 2-year
      overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival, regional progression-free survival,
      distant metastasis-free survival, toxicities and quality of life.
