    
      Design: Randomized controlled, pragmatic clinical trial with two groups and 3 months
      follow-up.

      Unit of randomization: Patient. Unit of analysis: Patient. Setting: A Primary Health Care
      Center in the Spanish Autonomous Community of Madrid.

      Population: Pre-frail patients aged 65 years or more with chronic pain. Intervention:
      Multicomponent structured physical exercise program. Control group: Usual care. Variables:
      Perceived Health Related Quality of Life (EuroQol 5D-5L), Pain Intensity (Visual Analogue
      Scale), Frailty (SHARE-Frailty Index), Physical Performance (Short Physical Performance
      Battery, SPPB), Depression (Yesavage).

      Analysis: Mean change differences after 3 months in EQ5D dimensions between groups with CI
      95%. Mean differences or proportion differences will be calculated according to variable
      characteristics between groups with appropriate statistical test.
