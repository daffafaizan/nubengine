      red, and cracked skin. The symptoms typically start in childhood with changing severity over
      the years. The pathogenesis of AD is characterized by excessive type 2 helper T cell mediated
      inflammatory responses, resulting in B lymphocyte mediated increase in serum level of
      immunoglobulin E (IgE). Subsequent degranulation of mast cells by IgE releases various
      inflammatory mediators, which recruit the lymphocytes and eosinophils into the lesion.

      Current clinical management of AD includes topical corticosteroids and systemic
      immunosuppressants. However, these drugs have been reported to carry the risk of side-effects
      and severe.

      Several recent studies including ours have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      could suppress allergic responses in AD. MSCs have been known to interact with cell types of
      both innate and adaptive immune systems, which results in the suppressive effect on
      proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells including T cells, B cells,
      dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Indeed, a number of studies have reported that the
      immunomodulatory ability of MSCs can be usefully applied for the treatment of autoimmune and
      inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis. Therefore, MSCs has
      possibility as a new drug for AD.
