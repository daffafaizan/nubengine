    
      Intragastric balloon (IGB) implantation is a widely used technique to treat overweight
      subjects and those with mild obesity. The effectiveness of the air filled balloon
      (Heliosphere BAGÂ®) in improving weight loss, reduction of BMI, percentage of body weight
      loss, percentage of excess weight loss and complications six months after placement is
      notable. Several methods are available for IGB placement and new techniques are being
      developed to reduce discomfort during and after the procedure. Thus, the use of an IGB as an
      effective method to avoid bariatric surgery is proposed. However, the precise protocol to
      balance complications and discomfort while maximizing weight loss is still to be established.

      Our secondary objectives will be:

        -  Describe the weight loss, changes in the BMI and excess weight loss between the
           implantation of the first IGB until its removal;

        -  Describe changes in the components of the metabolic syndrome;

        -  Describe changes in blood pressure;

        -  Estimate the rate of early explant;

        -  Describe the conditions of surgery;

        -  Describe operative complications;

        -  To describe safety in the perioperative period, in the immediate postoperative period
           and in the late postoperative period
