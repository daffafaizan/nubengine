    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the efficacy
      of acetazolamide prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of altitude related adverse health
      effects (ARAHE) in lowlanders with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travelling to
      altitude. Participants living in the Bishkek area, Kyrgyzstan (760m), will be transferred by
      car within 4h to the Tuja Ashu high altitude clinic (3200 m), and stay there for 2 days.
      Acetazolamide 375mg/day (or placebo), will be administered before departure at 760 m and
      during the stay at altitude. Outcomes will be assessed during the stay at 3200 m.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 90 patients will have completed the study or
      after the first year. The Peto's method will be used to correct the P-values.
