      either the Genvoya group or the EFV-TDF-3TC group. ART will be initiated on the day of HIV
      diagnosis. Participants who are found to have a contraindication to their assigned treatment
      regimen will change ART, and be classified as a failure for their assigned treatment arm.
      Participants in the EFV-TDF-3TC group with CrCl of 30-50 mL/minute, or with baseline
      mutations that significantly reduce the susceptibility of EFV will switch to Genvoya.
      Participants in the Genvoya group who are diagnosed with TB after enrollment will be switched
      to an ART regimen that can be administered with rifampin. If the study physician determines
      that a treatment change is indicated due to intolerability or side effects, the relevant
      clinical data will be presented to a safety committee that is blinded to group assignment.
      The ART regimen will be changed if the safety committee determines that it is indicated, and
      the participant will be considered a failure to their assigned treatment group. Patients will
      be followed for 48 weeks.
