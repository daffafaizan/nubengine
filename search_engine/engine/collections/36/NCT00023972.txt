        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive locally advanced or
           metastatic cancer of the exocrine pancreas treated with exatecan mesylate and
           gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone.

        -  Compare the measures of clinical benefit in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the anti-tumor efficacy of these regimens in this patient population.

        -  Determine the safety profile of exatecan mesylate and gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to performance status (60% vs 70-80% vs 90-100%), extent of disease (locally
      advanced vs metastatic), and prior radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer (yes or no). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f) IV over 30 minutes immediately
           followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for up to 7 weeks
           followed by one week of rest (course 1). For all subsequent courses, patients receive
           gemcitabine once weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 340 patients (170 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 18 months.
