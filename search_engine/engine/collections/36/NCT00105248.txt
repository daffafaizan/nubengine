      ambulatory care and for the prescription of antibiotics, despite the mostly viral origin of
      ARTI. Antibiotic prescriptions for ARTI increase unnecessary drug expenditures and are the
      main reason for increasing drug resistance of common bacteria. Evidence from intervention
      studies shows that merely providing physicians with guidelines and educational material for
      the management of acute respiratory tract infections is not enough to reduce antibiotic
      prescriptions for these conditions. The main reasons for antibiotic prescription in ARTI are
      non-medical and related to the physician patient relationship, patients' expectations and
      beliefs about the benefit of antibiotics. Therefore patient-centered communication could be a
      promising approach to reduce the rate of antibiotic prescription in ambulatory care.

      Comparison: General practitioners (GPs) trained in patient-centered communication in addition
      to evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ARTI compared to GPs just
      introduced to evidence-based guidelines.
