    
      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, two-arm feasibility study of
      oral ketamine versus placebo for the treatment of depression in depressed patients with
      cancer undergoing curative intent cancer therapy. Approximately 20 patients with cancer about
      to undergo cancer therapy will be randomized 1:1 to receive study treatment with one of the
      following regimens:

      Arm A: nightly oral administration of 1.0 mg/kg ketamine Arm B: nightly oral administration
      of placebo (after completion of Arm B, patients will have the option to receive a nightly
      oral administration of 1.0 mg/kg ketamine and follow study procedures over again)

      Consenting patients will undergo screening procedures, and if eligible, a baseline interview
      and brief questionnaires regarding depression, mental and emotional health, and quality of
      life assessments.

      Study treatment will be administered for 12 weeks unless the patient experiences unacceptable
      toxicities, exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms, or withdraws consent. Patients
      on the placebo treatment arm will have the option to receive ketamine and follow all study
      procedures over again with the ketamine drug after completion of the placebo treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete psychosocial measurements every two weeks while on study
      treatment and monthly during a five-month follow-up period.
