        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and
           paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Provide access to trastuzumab and paclitaxel for these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes and paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour weekly. Patients receive trastuzumab alone during course 1 and then in
      combination with paclitaxel during subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks until
      patients achieve a sustained complete response of 8 weeks or disease progression occurs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
