      (BMS), primarily through a notable reduction in the risk of repeat revascularisation.
      However, durable polymer DES have been associated with an increased risk of late and very
      late stent thrombosis and the anticipated development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis. In
      addition, in-vivo study suggest that different types of polymer among current DES might have
      different responses to acute thrombogenecity after stent implantation.

      Patients with STEMI are associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes due to
      re-infarction and stent thrombosis throughout long-term follow-up. Underlying unstable lesion
      which includes ruptured plaque and thin-cap fibroatheroma behind stent strut is a predictor
      of neoatherosclerosis formation.

      There is no dedicated randomized trial to comparing biodegradable-polymer versus durable
      polymer-DES in terms of acute thrombogenecity and long-term healing at 3 years after primary
      PCI.

      Therefore this study is designed to compare the acute thrombogenecity and frequency of
      neoatherosclerotic lesions and other aspects of long term arterial healing at 3 years among
      patients treated with either a biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy) or a
      durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Xience Alpine) for STEMI.
