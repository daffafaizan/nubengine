    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the complete response rate including morphologic complete remission (CR) and
      morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) as defined by the
      International Working Group Criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine CR + CRi duration, event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), patients
      successfully proceeding to allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant, and adverse events (AE).

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      RE-INDUCTION: Patients who do not achieve remission receive liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 5-8 weeks after the start of the last induction, patients who
      achieve CR receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1
      and 3. Treatment repeats every 45 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months for up to 5 years.
