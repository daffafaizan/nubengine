      cetuximab plus chemotherapy. After first-line progression, second-line non-cetuximab
      treatment were used. After second-line progression, ctDNA is test, and patients with RAS
      wild-type are enrolled in the study to compare cetuximab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy
      alone as third-line treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint is the disease control rateï¼Œwhich will be
      assessed by local multidisciplinary team with the use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4
      cycles and then every other 4 cycles up to 12 cycles.
