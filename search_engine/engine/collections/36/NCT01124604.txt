    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team works on a medical research study), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-control (participants
      are randomly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing treatment that does
      not contain the test drug), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the
      same time) comparison study in participants with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of knee
      or low back pain. The study duration will be of 14 weeks, which consists of a screening
      period of 1 week during which the participants will be evaluated for study eligibility, a
      treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up period of 1 week. The treatment period will
      consist of titration period (from the initiation of the study treatment to determination of
      the individual's maintenance dose) and maintenance period (from completion of the titration
      period to the completion of the treatment period). An optimal dose (maintenance dose) will be
      determined for each participant during the titration period and the treatment will be
      continued at the maintenance dose to assess the efficacy and safety. Tapentadol hydrochloride
      ER tablets 25 to 250 milligram or placebo will be administered orally twice daily. Efficacy
      and safety of the participants will primarily be evaluated by change from baseline in average
      pain intensity score based on 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and Clinical Opiate
      Withdrawal Scale (COWS), respectively. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
