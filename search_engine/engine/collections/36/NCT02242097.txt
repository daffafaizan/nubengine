      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate after 2 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess toxicity. II. Determine rates of conversion from partial response (PR) to complete
      response (CR).

      III. Determine median overall survival (OS) after 4 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare minimal residual disease (MRD) results overtime by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      and correlate these with PFS and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 4 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      patient preference.

      After completion of study treatment, patients who completed 4 years of treatment are followed
      up at 30 days. Patients who did not complete 4 years of treatment are followed up for up to 4
      years post-first dose of treatment (every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4
      years).
