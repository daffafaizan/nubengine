      normal mechanisms to maintain adequate blood pressure in the non-anesthetized state are
      significantly altered by anesthetic agents, which may lead to hypotension. This can lead to
      hypoperfusion of vital organs, organ damage, and states of increased metabolic duress. In
      response to this it has become standard of care to attempt to maintain blood pressure levels
      within 20% of baseline in most patients under anesthesia. Maintaining the baseline blood
      pressure is important as patients may have pathology such as coronary artery disease, carotid
      stenosis, and renal artery stenosis, and hypotension may compromise the perfusion of these
      organs. Vasodilation also plays a key role in hypotension due to general anesthesia.
      Therefore, the intravenous (IV) administration of Ang II may be an effective treatment of
      hypotension in this patient population.The objective of this study is to determine the
      infusion rate of Ang II that is necessary to return systolic blood pressure (SBP) to within
      5% of baseline or greater in patients with essential hypertension taking ACE inhibitors,
      ARBs, or different classes of antihypertensive agents and further to determine the plasma
      levels of different RAAS components
