      tinnitus. Zinc deficiency is more likely to occur in the elderly . The primary objective of
      this study is to establish the effectiveness of zinc for the treatment of tinnitus in
      individuals 60 years of age and older. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive
      zinc daily or a placebo. After 4 months and a 1-month wash-out, the subjects will be crossed
      over to the other group. 116 patients were tested. Tinnitus loudness and the Tinnitus
      Handicap Questionnaire are the outcome measures.
