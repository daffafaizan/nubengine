      immunogenicity of QIV-IB, the Butantan Institute quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate. As
      active controls, two trivalent influenza vaccines with different Influenza B strains, one
      with influenza B/Victoria strain (TIVV-IB) and other with influenza B/Yamagata strain
      (TIVY-IB) The study is designed to build a safety database of the quadrivalent influenza
      vaccine in adults to detect adverse events with a frequency of 1:1000 or higher and safety
      databases for elderly and pediatric age groups to detect adverse events with frequency of
      1:100 or higher.

      In terms of immune response, the study aims to demonstrate superiority of HI (Hemagglutinin
      inhibition) GMT (Geometric Mean Titer) of the QIV-IB for the Influenza B strain that is not
      present in each trivalent vaccine control. Regarding the Influenza A and B strains common to
      QIV-IB and both trivalent vaccine controls, the study aims to demonstrate non-inferiority on
      those strains.

      Finally, a lot-to-lot consistency test will be performed in a sub-group of adult
      participants.
