           Gy on days 36-38 as a boost to the primary tumour (3 fractions of 1.8 Gy).Three-
           dimensional CT planing and a four field box technique with high energy photons (15 MV)
           will be used. All fields will be treated daily. Multileaf collimators will be used to
           shape individual radiation fields. Patients will be irradiated in a prone position with
           a full bladder and by using belly board to minimize exposure of the small bowel.
