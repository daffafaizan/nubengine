      kidney function that are independent of, and enhanced by, high dietary protein intake. Kidney
      function will be measured by the kidney's ability to filter blood and by the amount of
      protein in the urine. The hypothesis will be tested in the following manner: The first part
      of the study will involve a crossover design comparing kidney function in obese people with
      stable weights on a low and high protein diet ("Low/High Protein Study"). The second part of
      the study will compare kidney function in obese people before and after weight reduction
      surgery ("Before/After Surgery Study"). Since certain changes in kidney function may lead to
      kidney disease over time, it is important to confirm the effects of obesity and dietary
      protein intake on the kidney, especially with the current rise in obese people and the
      popularity of high protein diets.
