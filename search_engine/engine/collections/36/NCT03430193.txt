    
      The purpose of this prospective study

      To develop a standardized fragility fracture integrated rehabilitation management (FIRM)
      based on the critical rehabilitation pathway for fragility fractures.

        1. Standardization of initial evaluation for fall and re-fracture risks before
           rehabilitation

        2. Standardization in initial screening for prevention for common complication after
           fracture and early diagnosis

        3. Evidence based standardization in rehabilitation after fragility fracture

        4. Development for safe return to normal daily life
