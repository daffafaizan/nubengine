      leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. Recently, some studies have evaluated the relationship
      between the concentration of some cytokines and prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      XCL1 is a lymphotactin that belongs to a cytokine subfamily called C or Î³ with only one
      cysteine in the N-terminal residue. It has been found with significant expression of receptor
      mRNA XCL1 (XCR1) in T and B lymphocytes and related to hematological neoplasms. For these
      reasons, XCL1 could be a efficient marker of prognosis in patients with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.
