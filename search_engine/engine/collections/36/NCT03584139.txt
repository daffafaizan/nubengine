      number of vitreorential disorders are being successfully managed with pars plana vitrectomy
      (PPV). Cataract is one of the most common complications seen in phakic patients following
      PPV, and the incidence of it ranges from 4 to 80%, even up to 100% in various studies.

      Although phacoemulsification in previously vitrectomized eyes is a relatively safe procedure
      comparing with extracapsular cataract surgery, it is still more challenging than in eyes
      without previous vitrectomy because of the anatomical differences after PPV. Intraoperative
      difficulties such as abnormal anterior chamber deepening, unstable posterior capsules, and
      weakened zonules have been reported.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new simple iris hook assisted
      maneuver in phacoemulsification, then compare the incidence of intraoperative and
      postoperative complications of this technique with traditional phacoemulsification and
      phacoemulsification with 25-gauge vitreous irrigation. The latter two surgery methods are
      currently popular for cataract in vitrectomized eyes.
