      days. This is to obtain a sufficient number of motile sperm. A recent investigation, analyzed
      the quality (number and motility) of a sperm sample produced after an abstinence duration of
      4 to 7 days, followed by a second sperm sample 2 hours later. The second sample (after 2
      hours) was able to produce sperm cells with a higher motility. Not only has this short
      abstinence duration of 2 hours a positive effect on the motility, it will also reduce the
      sperm DNA damage, which again has a positive effect on embryo development. Because
      participants need gametes of high quality to obtain embryos with a high quality, the
      investigators want to investigate what the effect is of abstinence duration on embryo
      development.
