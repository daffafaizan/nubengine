      ALK-positive NSCLC who initiate treatment for the first time with brigatinib in a routine
      clinical practical setting. The study will characterize the safety and effectiveness of
      brigatinib for its approved indications under real world use.

      collected, at the centers from routinely scheduled and emergency visits until end of follow
      up, and recorded into electronic case report forms (e-CRFs). All participants will be
      assigned to a single observational cohort.

      This multi-center study will be conducted in the South Korea. The overall duration of this
      study is approximately 6 years. Data will be collected over and up to a 24 month-surveillance
