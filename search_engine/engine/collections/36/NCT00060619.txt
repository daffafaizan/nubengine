      most common types of RPS are recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) and migraine. Similar patterns of
      pain are described in children with RAP and migraine, and similar factors (particularly
      stress) may initiate both types of RPS.

      This study will assess a new biobehavioral model for evaluating and treating children with
      RPS. This model relates precipitating, intervening, and functional status factors in chronic
      and recurring pain in children. The model proposes that stress is a precipitant of pain. This
      study will evaluate the model in children who receive therapy for RPS that is based on stress
      management strategies. The therapy includes relaxation training, cognitive coping skills
      training, thermal biofeedback, and parent education. It will be compared to a control
      treatment program of hand-cooling biofeedback and supportive therapy.

      Consenting participants will be randomized to receive either biobehavioral therapy or control
      therapy. Participants will have 6 study visits over the course of 2 months. The first study
      visit is an evaluation visit; the remaining five study visits are treatment visits.
      Participants will be followed for 24 months and will be asked to complete mail-in forms at
      Months 3, 6, 12, and 24.

      Participants will be recruited through local pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, and
      pediatric gastroenterologists. Brochures about the study will be sent to these physicians to
      pass on to their patients informing them about the study. Children in the control group will
      be recruited through Children's Hospital outpatient clinics.
