      to compare the differences between anteriorly placed (front of leg) femoral external fixator
      pins and laterally placed (side of leg) femoral external fixator pins.

      Specifically, we are evaluating how this placement affects the quadriceps muscle and knee
      function. The parameters that will be assessed are knee function, pain, and range of motion.
