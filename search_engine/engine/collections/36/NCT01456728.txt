    
      Helicobacter pylori colonises an estimated 50% of the worldÂ´s population. Despite clear
      clinical guidelines on the treatment of this infection there is a drive to find alternative
      ways to control this infection in a wider perspective without the complications of induction
      of antibiotic resistance in the pathogen. A good alternative is to use probiotics.

      Lactic acid bacteria and in particular lactobacilli have been studied for their effects in
      humans infected with H. pylori with some success in reducing the infection load. Studies
      using supplementation with L. reuteri in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic H.
      pylori-infected subjects show a clear reduction of infection load after 4 weeks of use and
      this was concomitant with a reduction in symptoms associated with the infection. Further,
      dietary supplementation with L. reuteri during and after the period of H. pylori eradication
      therapy has also been shown to reduce the side effects of this therapy without affecting the
      degree of eradication.
