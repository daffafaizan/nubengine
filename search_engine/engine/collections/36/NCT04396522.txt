    
      Specific aims:

        1. Can serial body composition data be useful for predicting outcomes of patients with
           pneumonia? (developing sepsis, organ failure, admission to ICU, length of ICU, survival,
           length of stay in hospital, prolonged mechanical ventilation,..)

        2. Can serial body composition data be integrated into both immune status alternatives
           (e.g., white blood cell (WBC) count, segment/monocyte ratio, pulse pressure) in such
           critical illness and monitoring responses (SOFA score, labs) for severe pneumonia
           patients?

        3. Can serial body composition data reflect clinical variables in patients with pneumonia,
           and even altered by nutrition intake? (e.g., compare association between nutrition
           intake amount and groups stratified by body composition, blood pressure, nutritional
           intake, â€¦)
