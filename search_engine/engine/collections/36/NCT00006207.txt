      disease pathogens. Two Phase I clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and
      tolerance of the gel, PRO 2000/5, in sexually abstinent volunteers. Both demonstrated that
      multiple application of the gel was safe and well tolerated in healthy, sexually abstinent
      women but no clear association between the use of the gel and epithelial disruption was
      indicated. Because genital ulceration and inflammation may increase the risk of HIV
      infection, additional clinical evaluation of PRO 2000/5 gel is warranted, especially for
      study participants with active sexual behavior.

      Participants apply PRO 2000/5 gel intravaginally either once or twice daily for 14 days.
      HIV-negative participants in sexually active cohorts (Cohorts A1-A4) are instructed to engage
      in vaginal intercourse at least twice a week. Participants in the HIV-positive cohort (Cohort
      B1) abstain from sexual intercourse for the dosing period. Researchers conduct physical exams
      to see if the gel is having any harmful effects on the woman's vulva, vagina, or cervix.
      Women and their male partners are questioned about gel usage.
