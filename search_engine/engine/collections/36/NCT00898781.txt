        -  To assess frequency of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with metastatic
           ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and colon cancers.

        -  To assess the variability in number of CTCs between patients with the same tumor type.

        -  To correlate the number of CTCs with extent of tumor burden as measured by tumor
           markers, imaging, and the number of metastatic sites and proliferation and apoptotic
           markers.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected before treatment and analyzed using molecular detection
      techniques to detect circulating cancer cells. Samples are assessed by immunofluorescence for
      markers of proliferation and survival (e.g., EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, AKT, phosphorylated
      AKT, cytokeratins, MAPK, Src, and FAK).
