      few patients properly dispose of unused opioids and the majority of opioids are stored in the
      home in unlocked containers as opposed to being properly disposed of. Improper disposal of
      opioid medications is a concern due to the potential for nonmedical use and has the potential
      to cause injury or death for patients and their family members that can access the
      medications. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates of proper opioid disposal in
      patients receiving an educational brochure compared to an automated text message delivered
      directly to patients' cell phones alongside the brochure, compared to no education on the
      subject. There is evidence that an educational brochure significantly increases proper
      disposal rates, albeit only to about 25%. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of
      an educational pamphlet on proper opioid disposal in the total joint arthoplasty population,
      and to see if the addition of a text messaging system can increase further increase proper
      disposal rates.
