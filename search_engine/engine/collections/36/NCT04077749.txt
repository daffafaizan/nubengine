    
      Patients who use a chronic indwelling urinary catheter to drain their bladder will be
      randomized to receive intravesical instillations of a Lactobacillus solution or sterile
      saline at the time of a scheduled monthly catheter exchange. Bacterial colonization and
      frequency of urinary tract infections will be compared between the two groups.

      The Lactobacillus solution will be derived from the combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      (GR-1®) and reuteri (RC-14®) species, which is offered as an over the counter probiotic
      capsule sold under the brand name of Femdophilus and manufactured by CHR-Hansen of Denmark
      (phone: +45 45747474; email: info@chr-hansen.com). The contents of the capsules will be
      dissolved in 50 mL of normal saline at room temperature within one hour prior to
      administration and left indwelling in the patient's urinary bladder for 30 minutes.
