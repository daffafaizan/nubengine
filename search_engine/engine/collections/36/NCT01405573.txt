      increasing incidence. No systemic therapy has proven effective in patients with advanced HCC
      until 2007, when results of the SHARP trial were presented. In this trial, the orally active
      multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (800 mg/day) significantly prolonged survival compared with
      placebo in patients with advanced HCC and good liver function (Child A). The same authors
      concluded that the effect of the drug in the population of patients with more impaired liver
      function should be further studied.
