    
      This was to be a 2-phase study consisting of

        1. A Phase 1, dose escalation study of veliparib to determine a RPTD for combination with
           concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin-based CRT and paclitaxel/carboplatin-based
           consolidation chemotherapy; followed by

        2. A Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded study to determine whether veliparib improved
           outcome relative to placebo when added to paclitaxel/carboplatin based CRT followed by
           consolidation paclitaxel/carboplatin in adults with previously untreated Stage III
           NSCLC.

      In the dose escalation phase (Phase 1) of the study participants will be assigned to
      ascending doses of veliparib in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and thoracic
      radiotherapy for 7 weeks following a traditional "3 + 3" design. The first cohort of at least
      3 - 6 participants will receive veliparib 60 mg twice a day (BID) throughout CRT. Dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) events will be collected for each dosing cohort until a new dosing
      cohort is opened or until the RPTD is identified. Participants will also receive a
      consolidation dose of veliparib of 120 mg BID + carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to two
      21-day cycles. Once the concurrent CRT RPTD is identified, an additional cohort will be
      enrolled to explore the tolerability of a consolidation dose of veliparib at 240 mg BID +
      carboplatin + paclitaxel for up to two 21-day cycles.

      Following the dose escalation portion of the study, the RPTD will be determined by the
      sponsor and the Phase 2 portion of the study will begin with patient randomization in a 1:1:1
      ratio to concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin/radiotherapy/veliparib followed by consolidation
      paclitaxel/carboplatin/veliparib, concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin/radiotherapy/veliparib
      followed by consolidation paclitaxel/carboplatin/placebo, or concurrent
      paclitaxel/carboplatin/radiotherapy/placebo followed by consolidation
      paclitaxel/carboplatin/placebo. Randomization will be stratified by tumor volume (≤ 90 versus
      > 90 cm³) and smoking history (current smoker versus former smoker versus never smoked).

      Phase 2 was not carried out since during the study there was a change in standard of care for
      patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable Stage III NSCLC.
