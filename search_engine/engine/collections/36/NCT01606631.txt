      infectious diseases. They are one of the top ten causes of death in industrialized countries.
      The adrenergic system is heavily involved in this pathological/physiological context. If the
      effect of various therapeutic strategies allowing the care of the SS/TS was widely estimated,
      the impact, positive or negative, therapeutic prescribed in the long term or more punctually
      - but be that as it may before the arisen of the sepsis - on the evolution of a community
      acute infectious pathology towards the SS/TS, had only little studied.

      The main objective of this study is to estimate the possible protective role of a long-term
      prescription of a beta-blocker on the arisen of the SS/TS in patients having an acute
      infectious pathology of community origin.

      The secondary objective will be to estimate, at the patients having developed a SS/TS, the
      impact of this long-term prescription of beta-blockers on the mortality in intensive care
      unit (ICU).
