      heart failure (HF) events and cardiovascular death comparing to placebo in patients with
      reduced ejection fraction further to standard of care. However, hypotensive patients who
      generally have higher risks comparing to normotensive patients, were under represented in the
      DAPA-HF. The investigators aimed to evaluate clinical effects of dapagliflozin on hypotensive
      HFrEF patients receiving chronic sacubitril/valsartan (Sal/Val) treatment.

      This is an investigator-initiated, interventional, prospective. open-label study. The
      inclusion criteria were (1) chronic symptomatic HF with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      class II-IV and LVEF less than 40%, (2) treatment with stable and maximal tolerable dose of
      Sac/Val, beta-blocker with or without mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), (3)
      6-minute walking-distance (6MWD)≥ 100meters and ≤425 meters at enrollment, (4) systolic blood
      pressure ≤100 mmHg at enrollment. The exclusion criteria were (1) type 1 diabetes mellitus,
      (2) patients previously treated with any sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i).

      After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, if the participants had type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, the participants will receive dapagliflozin 10mg daily directly. If the
      participants did not have history of diabetes mellitus, the participants will be allocated to
      either receiving dapagliflozin 10mg daily or receiving standard heart failure treatment
      without dapagliflozin.

      Vital signs and laboratory tests were examined at baseline, 2-week, 4-week and 12-week.
      Six-minute-walking-test, five-level EuroQol five dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and
      visual analogue scale (VAS) were collected at baseline and at 12-week.
