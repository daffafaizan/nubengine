      training (ET) and health literacy counselling (HLC) over 12 months intervention in patients
      undergoing chronic outpatient hemodialysis as compared to usual care (UC). The primary
      endpoint is change in Sit-to-Stand (STS60) test, from baseline to after 12 months
      intervention. The ET consists of both resistance and endurance training, focusing on
      improving patients' health status and physical functioning. Health literacy counseling aims
      at improving education, proficiency and self-awareness of the patient.

      All patients undergoing hemodialysis in participating centers (clusters) for at least four
      weeks are eligible to participate in the study. Irrespective of randomized center (cluster)
      group assignment, all dialysis and overall medical treatments will remain unchanged and
      follow standard of care and center routine without adaptations to the training intervention.
