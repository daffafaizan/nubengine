      Primary

        -  Determine the combined effect of exercise and dietary counseling on the weight loss and
           quality of life of obese patients with stage I or II endometrial cancer in remission.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility and acceptability of lifestyle interventions in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age and
      body mass index (25-29.9 vs â‰¥ 30). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo weekly contact with a dietitian; exercise intervention for 6
           months; and physician counseling at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients
           undergo quality of life assessments and clinical assessments at baseline and at 3, 6,
           and 12 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo quality of life, exercise, and clinical assessments at baseline
           and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
