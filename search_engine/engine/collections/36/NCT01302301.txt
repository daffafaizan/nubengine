      partial myotomy in patients suffering from primary esophageal motility disorders.

      Under general anesthesia patients will have upper endoscopy. Submucosal injection and mucosal
      incision is created for entry into the submucosal space. A submucosal tunnel is then created
      using a needle knife or blunt dissection as appropriate. Dissection will continue distally
      beyond the lower esophageal sphincter. The inner circular muscle fibers will then be divided
      to achieve an adequate myotomy length. The mucosal entry is then closed appropriately.

      Results will be compared to historical data of conventional Heller myotomies.
