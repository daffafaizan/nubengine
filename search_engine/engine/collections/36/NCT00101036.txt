      I. The goal of this study is to determine the objective response rate of GW572016 in patients
      with biliary cancer and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall survival of patients entered onto study. II. Quantitative and
      qualitative toxicities of the patient population treated with GW572016.

      III. Determine the progression free survival of patients. IV. To perform molecular and
      pharmacogenomic correlative studies that will identify specific patient subsets that benefit
      from GW572016 therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor site
      (biliary tree cancer [includes ampullary, bile duct, and gall bladder cancer] vs
      hepatocellular cancer).

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.
