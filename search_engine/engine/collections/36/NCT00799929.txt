      38 years and a desire to undergo their first IVF cycle will be included in this outpatient
      clinical trial. The participation in this study will be approximately six months with a total
      of 20 to 25 visits. After successful completion of the pre-screening tests participants are
      randomized into one of the two arms of the study: Arm A - mini IVF protocol, and Arm B -
      conventional IVF protocol.
