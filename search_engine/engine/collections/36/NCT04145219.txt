      in children (5-11 years of age) with House Dust Mite allergic rhinitis based on the total
      combined rhinitis symptoms and medication score during the last 8 weeks of treatment.

      In addition, the trial will evaluate safety and tolerability of the treatment, and assess
      whether treatment has an impact on asthma symptoms and medication use, immunological
      parameters, and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life (QoL).

      The trial is a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-national
      phase III trial conducted in Europe and North America. The treatment period will be
      approximately 1 year.
