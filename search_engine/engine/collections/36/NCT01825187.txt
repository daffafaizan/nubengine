      the world. There are two main ways to repair an inguinal hernia, open or laparoscopic. Open
      compared to laparoscopic, is more invasive and leads to more scarring and longer recovery
      periods. Laparoscopic repair is done by making a small cut in or just below the umbilicus and
      has become an accepted standard for inguinal hernia repair and has become the technique of
      choice for recurrent inguinal hernias.

      During laparoscopic repair, the placement of a prosthetic mesh aids in reinforcing the
      abdominal wall and allowing for tension free repair. Meshes also helps to lower the
      recurrence rate. The most safe and effective type of mesh prosthesis currently being used in
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs are polypropylene meshes. There is some emerging
      evidence that "lighter weight" forms of polypropylene meshes may improve quality of life
      outcomes following surgery for inguinal hernias. Further evaluation is needed to support this
      evidence.
