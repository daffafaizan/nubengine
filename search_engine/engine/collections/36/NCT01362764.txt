    
      This is an open-label (volunteer and study staff will know the identity of the assigned
      treatment) study of two abiraterone acetate suspension formulations, compared to the
      abiraterone acetate tablet formulation in healthy volunteers. Approximately 30 healthy
      volunteers will participate in this study. Each volunteer will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6
      possible treatment sequences. The study consists of a screening phase (within 21 days before
      the first study drug administration of the first period); an open-label treatment phase
      consisting of 3 single dose treatment periods; and end-of-study or withdrawal assessments
      done upon completion of the 72-hour (Day 4 of Period 3, or upon withdrawal) sampling to
      evaluate how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is
      removed from the body over time. A 7- to 14-day washout period will separate the study drug
      administrations. The duration of participation in the study for an individual healthy
      volunteer will be from 41 days to a maximum of 55 days (including screening). Safety will be
      monitored. Volunteers will receive a 250 mg dose of abiraterone acetate as a tablet,
      suspension Formulation 1, and suspension Formulation 2 according to their treatment sequence.
      Abiraterone acetate tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, divided, dissolved or
      crushed and will be taken with 240 mL of noncarbonated water. For the suspensions, the
      volunteer will drink the contents of the vial. The vial will be rinsed with 10 mL of water,
      and the volunteer will be asked to drink the rinse water.
