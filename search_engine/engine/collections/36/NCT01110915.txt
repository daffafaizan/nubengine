      heart rates, improve cardiac output, prevent symptoms, or protect against arrhythmias related
      to cardiac impulse formation or conduction disorders. The IPG is indicated for use in
      patients who may benefit from rate-responsive pacing to support cardiac output during varying
      levels of activity and has been modified for use during an MRI exam.

      Subjects will have required follow-up visits after implant, at 2 months, 9-12 weeks, 3
      months, 4 months, 6 months and every 6 months thereafter until the study ends. The MR scans
      will occur at the 9-12 weeks visit.
