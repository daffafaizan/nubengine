      delivery (AID) study system using an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm versus
      SAP (which may or may not include PLGS; to be referred to as SAP) therapy in people with type
      1 diabetes for 13 weeks in each arm of the study. A Pilot Phase using the study system for
      10-14 days will be conducted prior to the crossover trial.
