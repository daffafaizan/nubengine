      neurodegenerative disease. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, blinded (as to side of
      injection), safety study of two escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells expressing
      GDNF (CNS10-NPC-GDNF) delivered unilaterally to the lumbar region in ALS subjects with
      moderate leg involvement.

      Subjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in
      one of two sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of
      one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The
      remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least two
      weeks between surgeries.

      Specific aims:

      Safety, as evaluated by:

        -  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events

        -  Clinical laboratory assessments, as clinically indicated (hematology, chemistry,
           immunology)
