      is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders for a woman. The demands of
      pregnancy and childbirth make patients vulnerable to psychiatric disorders such as postpartum
      depression (PPD), anxiety, and stress disorders. Women with postpartum psychiatric disorders
      have high mortality rates. The most common postpartum psychiatric disorder is PPD. PPD occurs
      any time in pregnancy or in the first four weeks after delivery. It may lead to complications
      such as emotional lability in the mother. This situation may also effect the child.

      Postpartum depression (PD) has become the most frequent complication of childbirth. Its
      prevalence has been estimated as 10%-15% and its formation is affected by several factors
      such as lack of social support, previous history of depression, and personal vulnerability.
      There are several studies about PD in the literature, some discuss about the relation of pain
      and PD, some discuss about the relation of epidural anesthesia and PD. However, there is no
      study that compares different anesthesia methods (general anesthesia vs spinal anesthesia) on
      development of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery.

      The aim of this study is to compare the different anesthesia methods (general anesthesia vs
      spinal anesthesia) on development of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery. The
      secondary aim is to decrease the ratio of postnatal depression after cesarean delivery.
