      safety and effective concentration of Posaconazole tablets for prevention of pulmonary fungal
      infection in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 360
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients receiving Posaconazole tablets are expected
      to be enrolled. Posaconazole tablets will be taken orally from the day of transplantation
      (300 mg Q12h D1) followed by 300 mg Qd, until 90 days after transplantation. The total
      duration of the study is estimated to be 24 months, with each patient participating for an
      estimated 3 months. The relationships between UGT1A4*3 genotype and drug serum concentration,
      IFD incidence, Aspergillus infection rate, IFD-related mortality rate, IFD-free survival
      rate, and overall survival rate will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of Posaconazole
      tablets in preventing invasive pulmonary fungal infection in patients with hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation. Safety of Posaconazole tablet will be validated by the overall
      incidence and severity of adverse events in patients.
