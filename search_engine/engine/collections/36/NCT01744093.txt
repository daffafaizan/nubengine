      in HIV-infected patients, likely due to multiple factors, including an increased prevalence
      of smoking, chronic inflammation and immune activation, oxidant stress and respiratory
      infections. Our preliminary data suggest that several lung matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
      are upregulated in HIV-infected smokers, which could contribute to accelerated emphysema by
      virtue of their ability to degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane components. Our
      Specific Aim is to determine the safety, tolerability, and biologic effects of twice daily
      doxycycline for 6 months in HIV-infected subjects with COPD. To address this aim, we will
      conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of doxycycline 100 mg
      twice daily in 30 HIV-infected subjects with COPD (2:1 doxy:placebo). The primary endpoint
      will be safety/tolerability and secondary endpoints will include change in FEV1, reduction of
      MMP activity in epithelial lining fluid and cells obtained by bronchoscopy and doxycycline
      levels in blood, ELF and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellets. In addition to providing
      novel insights into the biologic effects of doxycycline in the lung, the pilot study will
      inform selection of endpoints for a phase II trial, which ultimately will address an unmet
      medical need for novel interventions for COPD/emphysema in HIV-infected patients.
