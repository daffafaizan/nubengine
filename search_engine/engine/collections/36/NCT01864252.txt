      patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as treatment for ischaemic heart
      disease. With the rise of interventional procedures, patients who are coming to have CABG
      surgery are higher risk1. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to reduce
      perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients having CABG even when cold blood
      cardioplegia or intermittent cross clamp fibrillation is used as cardioprotective measures.
      These patients have a general anaesthetic with multiple infusions including Glyceryl
      Trinitrate (GTN). The use of GTN in these patients is based on theoretical assumptions of
      coronary vasodilation pre operatively along with maintaining graft potency postoperatively.
      We intend to investigate the effect of GTN in patients undergoing cardiac surgery being
      subjected to RIPC in its role as a Nitric Oxide (NO) donor. Exogenous NO has been shown to be
      cardioprotective in animal models.
