      problems, systemic atrioventricular valve (SAVV) regurgitation, and congestive heart failure
      (CHF), all at young age. However, there is variation in time of onset of these adverse
      events. We want to evaluate ventricular and valvular function at rest, markers of RV fibrosis
      and cardiac reserve.
