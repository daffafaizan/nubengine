    
      In Part A of the study (DMD115501, original protocol), 21 subjects entered the study at 3 US
      sites and completed up to 14 weeks of treatment, and up to 22 weeks of follow-up. This
      protocol amendment, Part B of the study will include up to 13 more US and Canadian centers,
      and up to 51 more subjects. In total the study will enroll approximately 72 subjects. All
      subjects will commence Part B at screening and follow the study schedule.

      The primary dosing arm is drisapersen 6 mg/kg as SC injection(s) once a week. For subjects
      who have previously experienced significant safety or tolerability issues or who experience
      these during the study, there is the potential of an alternate intermittent dosing arm that
      will be given as a regimen of 6 mg/kg/wk for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of treatment. For
      subjects who experience or have previously experienced significant safety/tolerability
      issues, intravenous dosing will be made available.

      This study does not have a minimum duration of participation. Subjects will have varying
      times of study participation depending on when they enter from one of the eligible studies,
      and will be permitted to continue in this study until such a time that they withdraw based on
      protocol-defined criteria, or BioMarin stops the study.
