      resistance (IR), with hyperinsulinemia (HI) as a compensatory response. The possibility that
      HI can precede and contribute to insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MS) has been
      suggested but not tested in humans. While IR and HI are closely associated, demonstrating a
      primary role for HI in T2D is key to the development of new treatment strategies for this
      disease. One group in which HI could play a bigger role in T2D is African Americans (AA) who
      are known to be more hyperinsulinemic than Caucasian Americans (CA). Racial disparities in
      T2D treatment outcomes adversely affect AA. Our main hypothesis is that suppression of HI
      will contribute to the prevention and treatment of T2D, especially among AA. Our goal in this
      pilot study is to show that consumption of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) in the diet will
      decrease basal insulin secretion and HI, and will lead to improvement in the insulin
      sensitivity index (Si). 24 subjects (12 AA, 12 CA) will participate in a clinical trial in
      which they will receive MCT for 6 weeks. Insulin secretion dynamics and insulin sensitivity
      will be assessed by use of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (FSIVGTT) and Bergman's minimal model analysis.
