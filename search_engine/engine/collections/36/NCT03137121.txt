      significantly affect the patients' quality of life. Chronic nausea is a particularly
      distressing symptom present in >60% of patients with advanced cancer. A number of palliative
      care studies have evaluated treatments of nausea with limited success. Olanzapine with its
      unique formulation and decreased drug interactions compared to many other drugs appears to be
      a reasonable candidate for further evaluation. Olanzapine has significant potential for use
      in the prevention and treatment of nausea in a palliative care setting with a once-daily
      dosing.
