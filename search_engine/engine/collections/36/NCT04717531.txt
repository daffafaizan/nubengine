    
      Investigational Medical Products (IMPs) will be pyrotinib (B), trastuzumab (H), pertuzumab
      (P), docetaxel (T), epirubicin (E), and cyclophosphamide (C).

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at baseline and 2 cycles after neoadjuvant
      therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (THP*2). Non-objective response patients
      will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 2 cycles of pyrotinib and trastuzumab with
      docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of pyrotinib and epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide
      (THB*2-ECB[epirubicine, cyclophosphamide, and pyrotinib]*4, cohort A), or 2 cycles of
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab with docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide (THP*2-EC*4, cohort B).

      During the neoadjuvant therapy, the side effects and all the events were recorded and
      analyzed. After surgery, the efficacy of pCR rate and ORR were analyzed. And long time
      follow-up will also be performed to analyze EFS, DFS, DDFS, and ORR.
