      potential benefits of moderate intensity exercise in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). Participation in competitive athletics is associated with an increased
      risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with structural heart disease, including
      HCM. This has appropriately led to the establishment of national guidelines based on expert
      opinion that discourage participation in high intensity competitive sports, burst exertion
      (e.g., sprinting), or isometric exercise (e.g., heavy lifting). Non-competitive, low to
      moderate intensity exercise is allowable, although many physicians and HCM patients are still
      understandably apprehensive. Data on the safety of a recreational exercise program, and how
      to gauge appropriate intensity level, are desperately needed so that HCM patients can reap
      the well established health benefits of regular physical activity. Limited, but compelling
      animal data suggest that moderate intensity exercise is not only safe, but may also prevent
      or even reverse cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocellular disarray, and apoptosis associated
      with HCM. There are no published studies on exercise in patients with HCM, although large
      clinical trials in heart failure have shown exercise training to be safe, to improve peak VO2
      and quality of life, and to lower cardiovascular mortality. The pilot randomized control
      trial proposed here is the first to determine the safety of moderate intensity exercise
      training and explore its potential benefits in patients with HCM.
