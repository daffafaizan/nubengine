      Subutex®/Suboxone® at one of three dose levels, depending on the dose level for that subject
      on entry to the study: 8 mg/day, 16 mg/day, or 24 mg/day.

      During the 7-day, active drug-controlled, double-blind Transfer Period (study days 1-7),
      participants are randomized to either Subutex®/Suboxone® or RBP-6300 active drug at dosing
      levels equivalent to the level during the Run-In Period plus placebo matching the other drug.

      This is followed by a 3-day single-blind Subutex®/Suboxone® Transition Period in which
      participants receive the same dose given during the Run-In Period.
