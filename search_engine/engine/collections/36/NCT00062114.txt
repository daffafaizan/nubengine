        -  Determine the efficacy of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab, in terms of
           overall response rate (complete, unconfirmed complete, and partial) and duration of
           response, in patients with transformed CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the event-free survival and time to treatment progression in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV followed within 4 hours by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      IV (for imaging) over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo 1 (or 2 if needed) imaging scan
      between days 2-5. In the absence of altered biodistribution, patients receive rituximab IV
      followed within 4 hours by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 8.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months for 2 years.
