      will shrink with hormonal therapy. In some cases cancer returns or continues to grow despite
      very low levels of circulating male hormones, which is called Androgen-Independent Prostate
      Cancer (AIPC) or Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Mycobacterium w is known to share
      multiple antigen including PSA. It administration is associated with antigen specific
      generation of cell mediated immunity. Docetaxel is found to useful in management of
      metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer, which is associated with improved survival,
      tumor progression free survival with reduction in pain, serum PSA and improvement in quality
      of life. Cyclophosphamide 300mg/sq.m will be used to eliminate T-regulatory cell responsible
      immuno suppression. The vaccine Mycobacterium w will be administered on a day following
      cyclophosphamide. For better initiation of immune responses Docetaxel will be given seven
      days following first dose of Mycobacterium w.
