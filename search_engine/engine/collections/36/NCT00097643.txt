      service utilization and cost data were already available, as well as cognitive, functional,
      and health status measures. The participants were randomly placed into one of four treatment
      groups: exercise, health promotion, combination exercise and health promotion, and routine
      medical care. Assessments for physical performance, emotional well-being, and physical and
      emotional health status were conducted at screening, baseline, after 3 months
      (post-treatment), and at 6, 12, and 18-month follow-up by interviewers blind to treatment
      assignment.
