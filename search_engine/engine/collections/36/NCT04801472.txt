      dental rehabilitation plan elaboration and radiological guide confection. Two dosimetric
      computer-tomography scans, with or without radiological guide, will be conducted. Virtual
      dental implants will be visualised by the dental surgeon on scanner images (with or without
      radiologic guide). After volume delineation and dosimetry calculations, the optimal treatment
      plan will be validated. Patients will be followed throughout radiotherapy and during 18
      months following the end of radiotherapy for evaluation of toxicity, quality of life and
      dental implant survival rate.
