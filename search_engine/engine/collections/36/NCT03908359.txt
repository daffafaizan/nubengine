    
      Patients with congenital cataract that requires surgical intervention are enrolled.

      Then the patients are assigned to two groups: Group I: the participants receive a minimal
      invasive lens surgery, while in Group II, the participants receive a traditional cataract
      surgery. A secondary intraocular lens implantation is performed when the patient is two years
      old for both Group I and Group II. Investigators then compare the visual acuity, incidence of
      high intraocular pressure, incidence of visual axis opacification, uveitis and iris/pupil
      abnormality between two groups, to evaluate and compare the prognosis of minimal invasive
      lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for treating congenital cataracts.
