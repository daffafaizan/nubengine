      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and flavopiridol in patients with
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety profile and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of flavopiridol with and without gemcitabine in these
      patients.

      III. Determine, using pharmacodynamic assays, the activity of flavopiridol as a cdk inhibitor
      in these patients.

      IV. Determine, using pharmacodynamic assays, the markers of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Some patients receive an initial dose of alvocidib IV over 1-7 hours on day 1 (course 0).
      Beginning 1 week later and for all subsequent courses, all patients receive gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 60-150 minutes on days 1 and 15 and alvocidib IV over 1-7 hours on days
      2 and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride and alvocidib
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the
      MTD is determined, up to 10 additional patients receive treatment at that dose.

      Patients are followed at 30 days after study completion.
