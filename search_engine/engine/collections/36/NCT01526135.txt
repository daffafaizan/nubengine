      disease-free survival at 3 years. Disease-free survival is the time delay between the date of
      randomization and the date at which the 1st cancer-related event such as local relapse,
      distant metastasis, a second cancer or death from any cause is observed. Patients without
      event at the time of anlaysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit.

      Locoregional relapse is a disease relapse occurring at the site of primary resection, in the
      pancreas or in the associated regional lymph nodes.

      Metastatic relapse is the distant disease recurrence involving any possible sites of relapse
      (peritoneal, hepatic, pulmonary, and distant lymph nodes).

      Secondary criteria Overall and specific survival Overall survival is the time delay between
      the date of randomization and the patient's death, irrespective of its cause. Patients who
      are still living at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up
      visit.

      Specific survival is the time delay between the date of randomization and the patient's death
      due to the treated cancer or a treatment-related complication.

      Metastasis-free survival Metastasis-free survival is the time delay between the date of
      randomization and the date of the 1st distant event occurrence (peritoneal, hepatic,
      pulmonary, and lymph nodes). Loco-regional events will be discarded and patients still living
      without metastasis at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up
      examination objectively assessing this type of event.

      Tolerance Patients evaluable for toxicity must have received at least one course or injection
      of the treatment.
