        -  Identify predictive factors of efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising
           fluorouracil-based regimens in patients with stage III colon cancer.

        -  Investigate possibility of "personalized treatment" with adjuvant chemotherapy based on
           the predictive factors identified.

      OUTLINE: Patients' tumor tissue samples are collected for protein expression levels of
      thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), VEGF, EGFR,
      mRNA-expression levels of TP, DPD, thymidylate synthase (TS), and orotate phosphoribosyl
      transferase (OPRT) by ELISA, Human Duo Set, and RT-PCR assays.

      Patients' enzyme expression levels are compared with their clinical data.
