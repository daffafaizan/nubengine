      radiation to patients with infra-diaphragmatic oligometastatic disease including quality of
      life assessments and patient-reported outcome measures. Further, the investigators assess
      clinical response among patients with oligometastatic disease (OMD), defined as up to five
      metastases in up to three different organs.
