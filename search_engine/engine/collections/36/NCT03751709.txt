      combining the investigational use of Haplo-Mismatched Cellular Therapy (HMCT) in combination
      with blinatumomab. Investigators plan to give HMCT starting on day 15, after the initial CRS
      caused by blinatumomab has resolved. The investigational treatment will start with 1% of the
      typical HMCT dose (10e6 CD3+ cells/kg) and will employ a modified dose escalation design as
      an additional safety measure. The primary end points will be DLT of the combination of
      blinatumomab and HMCT.
