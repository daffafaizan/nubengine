      and performance is a condition that increases with old age. Sarcopenia can be seen in 5-13%
      of patients hospitalized in ICU where various treatment methods are used to prevent this
      weakness, the rate increases in patients with sepsis/ septic shock. Muscle treatment methods
      are used to prevent sarcopenia in similar patients hospitalized in ICU. It is predicted that
      "neuromuscular electrical stimulator-NMES" treatment may increase muscle mass and strength in
      patients who's can not be exercised actively. In this study, the contribution of NMES
      treatment to prevent the development of muscle weakness in patients with a diagnosis of
      sepsis/ septic shock followed in intensive care units (ICU) was evaluated.

      Patients and methods: In our single-center, prospective clinical study, 80 patients with a
      diagnosis of sepsis/ septic shock who were hospitalized in ICU were included. The effects of
      NMES and muscle strengthening and standard physiotherapy exercises on the development of
      ICU-AW were observed. The day when our patients were diagnosed with sepsis was recorded as
      the first day of the study. Anthropometric and ultrasonographic measurements of bilateral
      biceps brachii and bilateral rectus femoris muscles were recorded on the following days i.e.
      3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Sarcopenia was defined by anthropometric and ultrasonographic
      measurement, and all patient outcome data were recorded.
