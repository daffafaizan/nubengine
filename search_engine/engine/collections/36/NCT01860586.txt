      retinal detachment (RD) repair, accounting for up to 75% of all primary surgical failures.
      Characterized by the proliferation of cells on the preretinal or subretinal surface, PVR
      ultimately leads to contraction, foreshortening, and ultimately recurrent detachment of the
      retina. Several PVR risk factors have been identified, including pre-existing uveitis, large
      retinal tears, multiple retinal breaks, detachments involving greater than two quadrants of
      the retina, vitreous hemorrhage, and choroidal detachment. Given the absence of a proven
      medical therapy for PVR and prior studies establishing VEGF as a potential therapeutic
      target, further clinical evaluation is warranted. Herein, we report outcomes of a
      prospective, non-randomized, historical-control pilot study evaluating the effect of serial
      intrasilicone oil bevacizumab injections on outcomes of PVR-related RD repair.
