      shot). The participant will need to give themselves a shot in their stomach (similar to
      diabetics giving themselves insulin) twice a day for twelve weeks. The study requires a
      screening visit to determine eligibility and discuss the study. At this visit a blood draw
      for heart and liver function and a six minute walk will be done. There will also be two other
      outpatient visits and two inpatient stays, for 48 hours, in the General Clinical Research
      Center (GCRC) at St. Marys Hospital. During the two in-patient stays in the GCRC, blood and
      urine samples will be done to get heart and kidney function as well as a research echo. After
      enrollment, the study lasts for twelve weeks. There is a one week visit in outpatient setting
      getting a blood draw and a 6 week visit in outpatient setting to get a blood draw, 24 hour
      urine collection and resupply the study medication. There is a one week visit in outpatient
      setting getting a blood draw and a 6 week visit in outpatient setting to get a blood draw, 24
      hour urine collection and resupply the study medication.
