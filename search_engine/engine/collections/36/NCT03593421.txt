      administered 14 doses. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will be evaluated at day 42 and and
      day 84. The suitability of a patient to receive a kidney transplant will also be monitored up
      to 6 months after Day 84. Safety and tolerability will be assessed at each of the increased
      doses and throughout the treatment duration. Exploratory analysis of blood indices will be
      carried out and changes based on history, physical and laboratory exams will be assessed
      according to the 12 systems.
