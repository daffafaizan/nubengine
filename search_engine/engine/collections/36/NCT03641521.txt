    
      This study was a nonrandomized, controlled trial to determine whether a series of 6 weekly
      parent-child vegetable cooking skills classes and parent-led strategies informed by
      behavioral economics (1/week) (intervention group) improved dietary and non-dietary outcomes
      of a racially and ethnically diverse sample of low-income children (ages 9-12) more than a
      vegetable cooking skills program alone (control group).
