      1,720 subjects in high bleeding risk with coronary artery disease will be enrolled in no more
      than 40 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1
      randomized to 1 month or 6months of DAPT after implanting Firehawkâ„¢ coronary stent. Clinical
      follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years after index
      procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events (NACCE), a
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA)
      and major bleeding ([BARC] definition) at 12 months. Subjects that complete of 12 months
      follow-up will be regarded as having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study
      endpoints contain cost-effectiveness at 12 months, ARC defined stent thrombosis (ST) ; NACCE
      ;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events
      (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target vessel failure(TVF) , major bleeding at
      30 days,6,12 and 24 months of follow-up.
