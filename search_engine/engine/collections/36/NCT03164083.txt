      divided into two groups of case and control. All subjects will undergo bone marrow
      aspiration. Mesenchymal Stem Cells will be isolated from bone marrow and stromal Vascular
      Fraction fram lipoaspirate, cultured and transplanted back to the knee joint. Patients of
      case group will receive cell injection 1 and 4 months after bone marrow aspiration. Placebo
      will be administered in this group 6 months after the first injection. Patients of control
      group will receive placebo 1 and 4 months after bone marrow aspiration. They all receive cell
      injection 6 months after first placebo injection. Follow up visit will occur at 2 and 6
      weeks, and 3 and 6 months after the first injection. Radiological exams will be performed
      before and 6 months after the first injection by MRI. Clinical quantitative assessment will
      measure joint function by the WOMAC index and pain by the visual analogue scale
