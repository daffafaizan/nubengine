    
      EUS-BAAF procedure The procedure will be performed with a linear echoendoscope (PENTAX 3.8
      EG-3870 UTK) and a HITACHI HI VISION Avius ultrasound processor, after deep sedation by the
      anesthesiology service. BAF Acquire # 22 needles (Boston Scientific, Malborough, MA) will be
      used. 3 passes will be made to the tumor, each pass will consist of 10-15 movements of the
      needle back and forth in a fan within the solid lesion, under complete ultrasound control
      (ESGE 2017- Gastrointest Endoscopy Clin N Am 22 (2012) 155 -167). Doppler will be used to
      avoid any vascular structure in the path of the needle.

      The passes will be in three different ways to compare.

        1. Capillary with suction (puncture with gradual withdrawal of the stylet, applying dry
           suction with a 10 ml air vacuum syringe after removing the stylet)

        2. Capillary without suction (puncture with removal of the stylet gradually, without
           suction after removing the stylet)

        3. Moist suction (Before the puncture, the stylet is removed from the needle and irrigated
           with 1-2 ml saline solution to replace the air column with liquid, then the solid lesion
           is punctured and suction is placed with a vacuum syringe of 10 ml of air)

      The quality of the biopsy will be evaluated by the pathologist independently and without
      knowing how the sample was obtained.
