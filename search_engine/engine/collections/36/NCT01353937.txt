      infection and diminishes blood supply to the skin, the lifetime risk of a person with
      diabetes developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is as high as 25%. Current strategies focus
      independently on the fibroblast dysfunction (growth factors such as PDGF/Regranex® Gel), on
      the chronic infection (debridement, antibacterial dressings) or on the blood supply (VAC®).

      This project is different from the other projects because we propose to combine two drugs in
      a dual approach to first improve the fibroblast function using PDGF/Regranex® Gel and second
      to induce neovascularization in DFU by recruiting progenitor cells into the wound through a
      combination therapy of subcutaneous AMD3100 (Plerixafor/Mozobil®) with topical PDGF/Regranex®
      Gel. By contrast to novel stem cell therapies where cells are extracted, processed ex vivo
      and engrafted into the wound (exogenous stem cell therapy), here we propose to keep the stem
      cells in vivo (endogenous stem cell therapy).

      Specifically, the first aim of the study will be to launch a prospective evaluator-blind
      pilot phase I/II safety and efficacy study to evaluate the clinical effect of AMD3100
      (Plerixafor/Mozobil®) treatment with topical PDGF/Regranex® Gel compared to historical
      controls (standard of care and PDGF). AMD3100 (240 µg/kg SC) will be administered daily for 2
      weeks. Our primary endpoint will be the measure of the percentage of change in area of the
      wound at 4 weeks (surrogate endpoint). In a second aim, we will measure the effect of AMD3100
      treatment with PDGF using a quality-of-life index dedicated to DFU (DFS-SF).

      Because we are addressing the underlying physiopathology in a dual approach, because we are
      avoiding the need for ex vivo processing and because both drugs are FDA approved, we believe
      that this novel therapy yields great promise in the treatment of DFUs.
