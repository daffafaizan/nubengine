      paraneoplastic syndrome. The key to the cure of TIO is surgical resection of the culprit
      tumor. Over the last decade, 68Ga-labeled SSTR-based imaging has made a significant impact in
      detecting the culprit tumor of TIO 68Ga-DOTA-TATE is the most used SSTR PET tracer for the
      detection of TIO and it was recommended as first-line imaging method for localization of the
      causative tumor.

      However, false positive, including fracture and/or inflammation, in 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT is
      a challenge in image interpretation, which may make the causative tumor indistinguishable in
      multiple suspicious lesions. There is no effective way to identify multiple suspicious
      lesions with intensive increased uptake on 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT.

      68Ga-DOTA-JR11 is a SSTR2 specific antagonist used for PET tracer. However, the SSTR2
      affinity of 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 is lower than 68Ga-DOTA-TATE, which means that the uptake of
      68Ga-DOTA-JR11 by suspected lesions may be lower than that of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE. The purpose of
      this prospective study is to compare the sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE
      PET/CT for detecting the responsible tumor of TIO and investigate if 68Ga-DOTA-JR11 PET/CT
      can identify the culprit tumor of TIO in multiple suspicious lesions.
