    
      This is a multicenter、singe arm、prospective study.

      Study population:

      Moderate to severe cancer pain (4-6 on the standard Numerical Rating Scale [NRS], range 0-10)
      patients with unsatisfactory pain control because of intolerable nausea、vomit or dizziness
      during accept CR Oxycodone treatment.

      Therapeutic schemes:

        1. CR oxycodone dose titration scheme: adjusting the dose of CR oxycodone every 24 hours
           according to the NRS and adverse event;

        2. Increasing the dose frequency scheme; Patients with moderate to severe pain accept CR
           oxycodone treatment and if any follow situations appears, then change the dose frequency
           from every 12 hours to every 8 hours or 6 hours.

      Patients are satisfied with the pain control, but unable to tolerate nausea、vomit or
      dizziness, and can't get satisfactory pain control if reducing the CR oxycodone dose.

      Patients are unsatisfied with the pain control, but can't increase the CR oxycodone dose
      because of intolerable nausea、vomit or dizziness.

      Primary end point:

      The effective rate of treatment: the rate of patients who get satisfactory pain control
      without intolerable adverse event in two consecutive day .

      Secondary end point:

      The time of reach effective treatment； The degree of pain reduction; The incident rate of
      adverse drug reaction The reduction rate of adverse drug reaction The change of plasm
      concentration after change the dose frequency; The relationship between peripheral blood gene
      and analgesia effect; The relationship between peripheral blood gene and adverse event;
