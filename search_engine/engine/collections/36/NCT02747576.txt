    
      Comprehensive social-cognitive and behavioral data will be collected and structural and
      functional brain imaging will be completed in an attempt to determine if disruptions to brain
      integrity and function caused by prior treatment of medulloblastoma directly influence
      social-cognition and behavior in survivors. These outcomes will be compared between survivors
      and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy community controls.

      Participants who meet eligibility criteria and consent will undergo neurocognitive
      (intelligence, attention, memory, processing speed, motor, executive function, and
      visuospatial) and social cognitive evaluations (affect recognition, prosody, social memory,
      withdrawal/isolation, loneliness, social anxiety, visuospatial, and executive function).
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be completed during affect identification
      tasks to assess activation of the core face perception network. Magnetic resonance with
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be obtained to quantify water diffusion within white
      matter tracts to assess white matter integrity and its association with functional outcomes.
