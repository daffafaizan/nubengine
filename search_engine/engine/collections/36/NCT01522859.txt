      worldwide. The current management of patients with COPD includes well established
      interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation and inhaled therapies which have demonstrated
      variable impact on reducing rates of exacerbation and improving health related quality of
      life.

      Telehealth is a home monitoring system used to record clinical observations and carry out
      question and answer sessions. It has been proposed that Telehealth medicine may offer an
      alternative strategy to the overall management of these patients.
