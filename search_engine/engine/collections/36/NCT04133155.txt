      there is no globally established 2 nd-line regimen after the failure of FOLFIRINOX. Although
      gemcitabine-based regimens are recommended by multiple guidelines and widely used in daily
      practice, further analysis is needed to reveal the magnitude of clinical benefit with these
      regimens. Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (Nab-P+Gem) is another standard 1 st-line regimen
      for PDAC, but there are limited data as 2 nd-line therapy in PDAC. Therefore, the
      investigators are conducting a multicenter retrospective analysis of 2 nd-line nab-P+Gem
      after progression on FOLFIRINOX in patients with advanced PDAC.
