    
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and acetabular dysplasia represent the two most common
      causes of secondary osteoarthritis of the hip1-3 and the two main indications for Hip
      Preservation procedures. Most patients with these pathologies will undergo Hip Arthroscopy,
      either alone, or combined with bony realignment procedures. Hip arthroscopy has grown
      exponentially over the past 15 years and is currently being leveraged in the diagnosis and
      treatment of a wide range of hip joint problems.

      In an effort to improve surgical techniques, make surgeries faster and reproducible, mitigate
      complications and increase patient safety, surgeons modify and improve commercially available
      and commonly used non-significant risk devices with the above goals in mind.

      For these reasons, the Principal Investigator (PI) modified and improved two devices for hip
      arthroscopy. These include the modified (1) hip capsule side fixed slotted cannula for
      continued access to the hip joint and (2) bone graft delivery tool set for grafting
      subchrondral cysts arthroscopically during hip arthroscopy procedure. After utilizing these
      modified devices clinically, the PI has been impressed with their impact and thus aims to
      demonstrate that the modifications provide significant improvements in surgical flow and
      technique, minimize surgical time (per technical phase), minimize surgical costs, result in
      an absolute low incidence of surgical complications, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
