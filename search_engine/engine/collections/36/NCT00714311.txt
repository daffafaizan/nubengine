      the community and is characterized by a pervasive instability of interpersonal relationships,
      self-image, and affects, as well as a marked impulsivity; up to 10% of the patients commit
      suicide.

      Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) is one psychotherapeutic approach among five that
      have been manualized and evaluated in RCTs. So far, TFP has not been compared to a control
      condition which is a crucial step in the evaluation of the efficacy of a psychosocial
      intervention.

      This study is an RCT that compares one year of outpatient TFP to treatment by experienced
      community psychotherapists for borderline personality disorder.
