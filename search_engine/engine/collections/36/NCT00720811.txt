    
      This is an open, cluster randomised multicentre two arm trial in the three countries of
      Burkina Faso, Ghana and Uganda. Clusters are villages (catchment populations) of individual
      community health workers (CHWs). Within the study areas, clusters that are more than 5 km
      from a designate health facility where CHWs referred cases for special care will be excluded.
      A cluster randomized design was chosen over an individually randomized design to reduce
      contamination, facilitate supervision, reduce costs, and to ensure that the CHWs maintained
      the correct treatments based on the tests in the Intervention arm and the presumptive
      treatment in the Control arm.
