    
      The intent of this worldwide registry/observational study is to understand the utility of the
      MediGuide™ technology in real world clinical practice during CRT implantation and
      study-specific-EP procedures. The study should provide an understanding of the effect of
      MediGuide™ technology on:

        -  The amount of fluoroscopy time and the radiation exposure

        -  Total procedure time

        -  Peri-procedural clinical event rate

      Additionally, this study will address the following

        -  Identification of procedural challenges which may aid in developing future MediGuide
           tools

        -  Evaluation of newly available MediGuide tools during the study

        -  Correlation between MediGuide operator experience and the radiation exposure amount and
           time
