      part of the population. Although atopic dermatitis responds well to twice daily mid-strength
      corticosteroids, it is not optimal to expose a patient to the long term use of topical
      corticosteroids. Side effects of long term steroid use include skin atrophy, striae,
      tachyphylaxis, adrenal suppression, bacterial infections, and contact allergies to name a
      few. Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% and Eletone™ cream are both alternative topical
      therapies FDA approved for use in patients with atopic dermatitis. Each has an independent
      mechanism of action that has been shown in clinical trials to deliver itch relief, reduce
      eczema flares and maintain remission, thus providing an adequate treatment option when
      topical steroids are not preferred or contraindicated. Thus far, no study has evaluated the
      efficacy of these two products head-to-head. This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral
      comparison study in 20 subjects with atopic dermatitis. It is designed to assess and compare
      the efficacy Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% and Eletone™ cream in patients with atopic
      dermatitis. Subjects will apply Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% twice daily for four weeks on
      a chosen target eczematous area located on one side of the body and then apply Eletone™ three
      times daily on a symmetrical target eczematous area on the opposite side of the body. A
      randomized list will be created to determine which side the subject applies each medication.
      Patients will be clinically evaluated every two weeks by the investigator on a Physician
      Global Assessment (PGA) scale. Part of this clinical study consists of the use of patient and
      self-assessment questionnaires and the use of non-identifying digital photography of target
      lesions.
