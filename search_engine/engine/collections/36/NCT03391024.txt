      computerized navigation can accurately estimate subsurface anatomy and in the future,
      potentially guide the placement of pedicle screws during spinal surgery. The specific
      research aims are as follows: i) an intraoperative non-contact optical imaging system can
      quantify the entry point and trajectory of pedicle screws implanted by the spine surgeon; and
      ii) intraoperative optical imaging can predict the entry point and trajectory of pedicle
      screws as verified by post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans.
