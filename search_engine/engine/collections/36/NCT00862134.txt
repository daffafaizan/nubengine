    
      A randomized phase II, multi-center, open-label, study of docetaxel versus docetaxel/PR104.

      Following informed consent, subjects will undergo baseline evaluation with history, physical
      exams, blood work and disease assessment. Selected subjects will undergo PET imaging with F18
      fluoromisonidazole (F18-FMISO) and Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) for assessment of hypoxia and
      glucose metabolism, and pharmacokinetics of PR104.

      Subjects will be randomized between arm 1 consisting of docetaxel, 75 mg/m^2, administered
      intravenously (IV), every 21 days (an approved dose and schedule) and arm 2 consisting of
      docetaxel, 60 mg/m^2 with PR104 at 770 mg/m^2, IV, every 21 days. Subjects randomized to
      PR104/docetaxel will receive prophylactic G-CSF. One cycle will be 21 days in duration.
      Subjects will be evaluated weekly. A disease assessment will be performed every six weeks.
      Subjects with progression will be removed from study. Subjects with a response or stable
      disease may continue on study if this is considered beneficial by their physician.
