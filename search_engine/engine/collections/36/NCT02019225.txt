    
      The TiME Trial is a cluster-randomized, parallel-group pragmatic clinical trial for patients
      initiating treatment with maintenance hemodialysis. Facilities will be randomized in a 1:1
      distribution to the Intervention arm or the Usual Care arm. Facilities randomized to the
      Intervention arm will adopt the practice of recommending dialysis session durations of at
      least 4.25 hours for all patients initiating hemodialysis treatment regardless of body size
      or dialysis solute clearance measurements. Facilities randomized to Usual Care will maintain
      their existing approaches to prescribing dialysis session duration. Participants will be
      followed for up to 3 years. The primary endpoint is mortality; major secondary endpoints are
      hospitalization rate and quality of life. Pragmatic features of the TiME Trial include 1)
      high generalizability due to non-restrictive eligibility criteria and broad representation of
      participating facilities, 2) implementation of the intervention by clinical care providers
      rather than by research personnel, and 3) reliance on data obtained through routine clinical
      care rather than through research activities.
