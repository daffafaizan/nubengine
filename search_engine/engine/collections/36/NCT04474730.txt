      the capacity to monitor BMT patients' physical activity and other patient reported outcomes
      at an ongoing basis within the inpatient BMT setting at the University of Kentucky Markey
      Cancer Center (UKMCC). The central hypothesis in this project is that the Apple Watch-based
      system designed based on user-centered design principles and the proposed study method will
      yield high feasibility.
