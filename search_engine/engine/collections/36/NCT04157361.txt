      provide valuable information about respiratory as well as systemic diseases. Finding
      non-invasive methods for early detection of lung injury, inflammation and infectious
      complications in chronic diseases like Cystic fibrosis (CF) or Bronchial asthma (AB) would be
      highly beneficial. Investigators propose to establish EBC "breathprints" revealing molecular
      signatures of pulmonary inflammation and specific respiratory bacterial infections of CF
      patients and AB. Investigators hypothesize that the analysis of EBC can reveal biomarkers
      specific for severity of the inflammation, and infection caused by opportunistic pathogens
      such as P. aeruginosa (PA). With these breath-prints, investigators also propose to establish
      correlations between respiratory microbiota using traditional methods and CF lung disease
      severity. Together, the studies will advance the development and validation of EBC as a novel
      tool for the proper diagnosis of AB and monitoring of CF disease activity, treatment efficacy
      and PA or another opportunistic infections.
