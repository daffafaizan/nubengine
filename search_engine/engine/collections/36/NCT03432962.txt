      24-hour dietary assessment tool, aiming to reduce the burden of dietary assessment; providing
      data entry by participants using automated coding of food items. myfood24 includes a large
      branded food database.

      Objective To assess the effect of using brand level nutrient information compared to generic
      food codes on estimated nutrient intakes.

      Design A 24 hour recall was collected using myfood24, which contains a food and nutrient
      database of over 40,000 items with both branded and generic foods. Participants freely
      selected their foods generating the 'free choice recall'. After the online recall was
      completed, they provided further details of brands consumed. The free choice recalls were
      recoded forming an 'all branded' and an 'all generic' recall. Estimated nutrient intakes from
      the three different methods of food coding were compared to assess the impact of brand-level
      information.
