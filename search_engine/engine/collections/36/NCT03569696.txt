      line standard therapy is based on the hypothesis that the stimulation of immune system by
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade will also facilitate the eradication of
      minimal residual disease (MRD), that is not apparent by positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging, and eventually will prevent relapse and improve survival. The Study will include
      adult patients, age ≥18, with high risk (IPI≥3) ABCL, in CR according to PETCT, as defined by
      the Lugano Criteria, following first-line rituximab (R) and anthracycline-containing regimen.
