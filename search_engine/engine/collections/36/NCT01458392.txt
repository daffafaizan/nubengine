      The study drug, dalantercept, is designed to work by blocking the growth of those blood
      vessels and preventing cancer cells from growing. The purpose of this study is to find out if
      dalantercept can cause SCCHN tumors to shrink or stop growing. This study will also evaluate
      the safety of dalantercept in patients with SCCHN.
