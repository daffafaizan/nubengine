      technique described by Barker et al. To accomplish this they have designed a randomized trial
      that will include patients that require an open abdomen strategy according to their attending
      physician either due to a traumatic or a medical cause. Once the surgeon decides to leave the
      abdomen open, one of the nurses will pick up an envelope from the randomization box and read
      out loud the patients allocation (Vacuum pack or Double sylo bag-mesh protocol) . During
      subsequent surgeries the patient must continue with the same strategy for a minimum of 21
      days or until fascial closure. The patients will be followed during their whole hospital stay
      to determine complication rates and fascial closures.
