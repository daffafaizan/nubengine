      open label, single site study in a broad cross-section of patients with known or suspected
      somatostatin receptor positive tumours. All participants will be imaged with
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT or PET/MRI for uptake by somatostatin receptor positive tumours. Up
      to seven [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scans may be performed per participant, as clinically indicated.
      A safety evaluation will be conducted on the first 10 consecutively enrolled participants
      (safety sub-group), consisting of vital signs, haematology and serum biochemistry profile
      (pre-injection and post-imaging), and an adverse event (AE) assessment (up to 24 hours) after
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE imaging. The safety evaluation for subsequent [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scan
      visits for participants in the safety sub-group and for the remaining participants will
      consist of an AE assessment while in the Nuclear Medicine department. The efficacy evaluation
      will include [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scan clinical accuracy compared to standard of care CT or
      MRI.
