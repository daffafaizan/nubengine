      over time of a single, chemotherapy intervention in both the human and porcine population.
      Four villages will be selected to be treated against T solium adult (in humans) and larval
      forms (in pigs), and two villages will receive no intervention and will serve as control
      villages. Pigs in control villages will be followed during 3 months only, and then the human
      and porcine populations will receive the intervention treatment. The effect of this
      intervention will be measured by the prevalence of infection in pigs and parasitic burden of
      infected pigs at month 3, 6, 9, and 12.
