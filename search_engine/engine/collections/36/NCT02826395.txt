      cancer. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. Study
      participants will receive 11C-Sodium Acetate and will undergo a PET/CT imaging study. All
      patients referred by Oncologists and Urologists will be screened by a UCLA Nuclear Medicine
      physician and then accepted for scanning if clinically appropriate. The following steps will
      take place.

        1. Informed consent will be obtained.

        2. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxymetry) will be
           recorded.

        3. Participant will be injected with 20 - 40mCi of 11C-Sodium Acetate intravenously (i.v.).

        4. PET/CT Scans will be performed with or without oral and IV contrast. All investigational
           scans will be read by at least one board-certified nuclear medicine physician with
           established expertise in PET/CT of at least 5 years' experience. Fifteen minutes after
           injection of 11C-Sodium Acetate, the investigators will acquire a scan. Emission images
           will be acquired for 3-5min/bed position. Intravenous and oral contrast will be given
           for the CT portion of the study.

        5. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxymetry) will be
           recorded following the completion of the scan.

        6. Within 24-48 hours of PET/CT imaging, a follow-up telephone call or email will be
           conducted to discuss any side effects or reactions to the investigational agent.
