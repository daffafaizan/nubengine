    
      This research study will assign a specific drug treatment based on lab tests performed on the
      participant's tumor from tumor tissue taken from a biopsy done when he/she was first
      diagnosed or if taken when he/she relapsed or progressed. All participants will get
      Temozolomide and Etoposide to start. Then depending on review of the participant's tumor
      tissue he/she will also receive one of the following: Sorafenib, Everolimus, Erlotinib, or
      Dasatinib.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the feasibility of obtaining and using
      information from studies done on tumor tissue in order to help make treatment decisions for
      patients with relapsed or refractory pediatric brain tumors. The investigators also want to
      find out the effects this therapy has on the participant and the participant's brain tumor.
