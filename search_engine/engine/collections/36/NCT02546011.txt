      the investigators will approach the patient and inform her about the study. If the patient
      agrees to the study then the baby's heart tracings and contraction pattern will start to be
      monitored using the traditional device. If the patient would be receiving continuous fetal
      heart rate monitoring, then after at least 2 hours of monitoring with the traditional device,
      the traditional device would be replaced with the Monica device for 2 hours. After the Monica
      device is used for 2 hours, then the traditional device would be used once again. The entire
      length of the patient's participation in the study should be nor more than 6 hours.

      The data collection sheet shows all data elements to be collected from the medical record. In
      addition it is standard of care that the monitoring strips become part of the medical records
      and these will also be reviewed as per the data collection sheet. Time it should take to
      review a patients medical record will be about 1 hour.

      Total time of patient's involvement will be 7 hours.
