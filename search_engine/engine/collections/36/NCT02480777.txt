      cells can enhance recovery of sensory and motor function. Emergency expanded access for a
      single patient was granted, as the patient was an ideal candidate for sural nerve repair
      augmented by autologous Schwann cells which could be harvested either from a relatively small
      segment of sensory nerve or as in this case from local debridement of injured nerve at the
      epicenter of the nerve injury. The cells were expanded using cell culture techniques and
      placed along with the sural nerve grafts wrapped by an FDA approved collagen matrix
      (Duragen). This study is being conducted at the Jackson Memorial and the University of Miami
      health systems. As a research subject the patient will be in this study for a total of 5
      years from the date receiving Schwann cell transplant augmentation of sural nerve autografts.
