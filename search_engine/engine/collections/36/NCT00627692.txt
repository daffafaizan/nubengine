    
      This is a multicenter, Phase II, dose-escalation trial with a 4 week double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment period. There will be four treatment cohorts (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2
      mg, or 4 mg) with 25 subjects in each. The first cohort of 25 subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive either 0.5 mg R108512 or placebo in a 4 to 1 ratio, respectively, for
      four weeks. After two weeks of treatment, the safety and tolerability of this dose will be
      evaluated for each subject by an independent (external) safety committee. If, at the
      completion of treatment, the safety committee grants approval to proceed to a higher dose,
      the second cohort will be randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg R108512 or placebo for
      four weeks. In a likewise manner, each dose will be evaluated for safety and tolerability
      before the next cohort will be treated with a higher dose. No subject can participate in more
      than one treatment cohort.

      Subjects will be instructed not to change their diet or lifestyle during the trial. Subjects
      will be allowed to continue the use of routine stool softeners and fiber supplements during
      the trial; however, all existing stimulant or osmotic laxative medication will be withdrawn.
      If, during the trial, the subject does not have a complete bowel movement for three or more
      consecutive days, he/she will be allowed the use of his/her usual stimulant or osmotic
      laxative or an enema as a rescue medication. No laxatives or enemas should be used within the
      24 hours before and 24 hours after the start of double-blind treatment.
