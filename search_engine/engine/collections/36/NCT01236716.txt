      (gp60)/caveolin-1 (CAV1) and SPARC(secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), achieving
      high intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation. It is reported that CAV1 is overexpressed in
      squamous cell cancer(SQC), so it is possible that nab-PC is more highly active than GC in SQC
      of lung.
