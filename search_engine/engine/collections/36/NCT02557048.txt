    
      Background:

      Although head and neck masses represent a common entity in children, malignancy is uncommon.
      Only very limited data are available in the literature on the incidence of childhood cancer
      of the head and neck worldwide.

      Data from the United States National Cancer Institute database suggest that the head and neck
      are involved in 12 % of all childhood malignancies. The most common pediatric head and neck
      malignancies include Non Hodgkin lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, thyroid
      malignancies, nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs), salivary gland malignancies, and
      neuroblastomas.

      Patients & Methods:

      A hospital-based study, involving Pediatric cancer patients, those diagnosed with malignant
      tumors of the head & neck, in the period from 2001 January till 2015 December, and received
      treatment at the pediatric oncology department, their medical records will be retrospectively
      reviewed for data collection.

      Clinico-laboratory data for each hisopathologic disease entity of various head & neck
      malignancies will be gathered. The demographic distribution for each disease entity in
      accordance with gender & age, and site preferences in these disease entities will be
      recorded. Treatment received & treatment outcomes will be verified and absolute frequencies &
      relative incidence of these disease entities will be calculated.
