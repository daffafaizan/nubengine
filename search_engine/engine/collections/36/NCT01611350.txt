      unimproved wood stoves in rural areas, replacing dirty and inefficient household wood stoves
      in Uganda provides a tremendous opportunity to improve health. Impact Carbon has been
      implementing an improved cookstove program in Uganda since 2005 which has now commercially
      sold more than 80,000 stoves. However, the program has not been successful in selling clean
      burning household wood stoves due to challenges related to the four categories of major
      barriers discussed above. Targeted research addressing these barriers will allow the team to
      test new sales and marketing methods to increase uptake of fuel efficient cookstoves. This
      has the potential to significantly reduce indoor air pollution as more households adopt fuel
      efficient cookstoves.
