    
      An open-label randomized controlled clinical trial, two cohorts. Patients who met the
      inclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled into the trial. Upon enrollment, all patients
      will undergo screening, a set of clinical examination, instrumental investigations and
      laboratory tests, including CT of the affected bone with the assessment of nonunion.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be subjected to bone reconstructive surgery with
      nonunion excision and bone grafting with either investigational bone substitute mixed with
      shredded autobone (in a ratio of 50/50) harvested during the surgery or pure shredded
      autobone from iliac crest.

      The clinical study results will be evaluated at the time points of 1, 15, 45, 90, 180 days
      with clinical examination, instrumental investigations and laboratory tests. Control CT will
      be carried out for the primary outcome measure at 90, 180, 360 days after surgery.
