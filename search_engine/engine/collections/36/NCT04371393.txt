      trial. Randomization will be stratified by clinical center and by moderate versus severe
      ARDS. The study is designed to have three interim analyses for stopping accrual early for
      efficacy and futility when 30%, 45% and 60% of the 300 patients have reached the primary
      endpoint using Bayesian predictive probabilities.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to intravenous infusion of MSCs
      (remestemcel-L) plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care for the treatment
      of COVID-19 related ARDS:

        -  Group 1: 2x10^6 MSC/kg of body weight plus standard of care, administered twice during
           the first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1
           day)

        -  Group 2: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte) plus standard of care, administered twice during the
           first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1 day)
           (control)

      MSCs and placebo will initially be administered intravenously in the dose defined above at
      randomization. The rate of infusion may be tailored to the patient's respiratory status and
      fluid status, but the duration of infusion should not exceed 60 minutes.

      Patients will be followed for 90 days post randomization, with assessment of pulmonary
      symptoms at 6 and 12 months.
