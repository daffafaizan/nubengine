    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the degenerative joint disease that most often requires treatment
      and at the same time the one associated with the greatest social costs. In addition, the
      disease has many personal costs and is greatly contributing to reduced functionality and
      autonomy of older adults.

      It is recommended both nationally and internationally that the treatment of knee OA should
      include multiple treatment modalities. Clinical guidelines recommend that exercise, weight
      loss and patient education is the first step in treatment and that insoles and
      pharmacological treatment can be included as a supplement. If this non-surgical treatment is
      ineffective surgical treatment, especially surgery with insertion of total knee replacement
      (TKR), may be indicated. There are effects of both non-surgical treatment and TKR, but no
      studies exist, which examine the effect of surgery with insertion of TKR in addition to the
      recommended non-surgical treatment of knee OA.
