           outcome of ECFs patients.

        -  Subjects are randomized to one of 3 groups:

             -  Group 1: Autologous PRFG-treatment [PRFG + Standard of care (SOC)]

             -  Group 2: Commercial FG-treatment [FG + Standard of care (SOC)]

             -  Group 3: Control (SOC only)

        -  Study will include three phases:

             -  Phase 1: Screening, consent and enrollment

             -  Phase 2: Patients will receive either PRFG, commercial FG, or SOC only for 14 days

             -  Phase 3: Follow up: for patients with closed fistula within 14 days, we will follow
                up them for 6 months. For patients whose fistulas were still open will be treated
                with other therapeutic option and follow up for 6 months after closure.
