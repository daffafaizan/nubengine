      pill) is for women with high body mass index ("BMI" - the ratio of your height and weight
      BMI"). Previous studies of birth control traditionally do not include women above a certain
      BMI number, so safety and efficacy is not clearly understood in this population, yet the pill
      is still widely used in women with high BMI.

      Reproductive-aged, ovulatory women of obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), will be placed on oral
      contraceptives for 2 months, then randomized into two intervention arms for an additional 2
      months. At several key time points, synthetic steroid pharmacokinetics, gonadotropins (LH,
      FSH) and ovarian hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone), ovarian follicular activity by
      ultrasound monitoring, and cervical mucus testing will be monitored.
