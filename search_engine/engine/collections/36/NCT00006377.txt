      weeks for 3 courses, followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 9 courses, and
      then carboplatin IV once every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
