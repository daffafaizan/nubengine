      pain and PCA use following gastric-bypass surgery relative to sham and an active control, in
      a mood- independent manner. Note that the active control is still mentioned in the aims and
      hypotheses, but was apparently removed from the study design.

      To determine the effects of timing (one immediately following surgery and one 4 hours later)
      and dose of TMS (0, 1, or 2 sessions of active rTMS) on post-operative pain and PCA use; To
      determine the effects of TMS on post-surgical recovery time (time to discharge) and clinical
      outcomes at 1-month, 3- months and 6-months follow-up. Again an active control is mentioned,
      though this was removed from the design. It appears that this aspect of the proposal was not
      edited to reflect the new study design.

      In the new design, 108 participants received two 20 minute sessions of 10 Hz rTMS (110% of
      motor threshold) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (one immediately following
      surgery and one 4 hours later). Participants were randomly assigned to receive two sessions
      of real rTMS, two sessions of sham, 1 real then 1 sham, or 1 sham then 1 real rTMS
      treatments.
