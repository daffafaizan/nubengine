      wait leading up to surgery is a potentially long and anxious time. Since no treatment is
      happening during this period anyway, this study will allow patients to receive CQ during this
      waiting period. This study will compare CQ treatment before surgery with the standard
      approach during this time, which is no treatment.

      Although CQ is widely used for the treatment of arthritis and malaria, CQ is considered
      investigational for use in breast cancer.

      The study will NOT interfere with the routine assessments as part of the pre-operative care,
      NOR will it delay the date of surgery.

      This study compares the effects of the CQ to placebo. Participants will be randomized 1:1 and
      be provided with the blinded placebo or QC (500mg daily) during the wait time. Biomarker
      testing will be performed on the initial biopsy tissue and at the time of surgery as well as
      blood work. There is also an opportunity for participants to enrol in the optional sample
      collection for future research.
