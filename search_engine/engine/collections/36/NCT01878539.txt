      outcomes with this treatment. Self-management, or the capacity of patients to control their
      INR (International Normalized Ratio)level and adjust their treatment, is an effective
      strategy of treatment. Capacity of patients to self manage is determined by a range of
      factors. The identification of these factors would improve the design of self management
      programmes and in turn increase the number of patients able to self-manage. The objective of
      our study is to identify those factors that determine the ability of patients on oral
      anticoagulant therapy to achieve self-management of their treatment.

      METHOD: This will be a three year quasi- experimental prospective study with a control group.
      333 patients on anticoagulant therapy from five health centres of the Basque Health Service
      are to be followed up for a period of six months each after the intervention, to assess their
      ability to self-test and self-manage. The intervention will consist of a patient training
      programme involving the provision of information and practical training concerning their
      condition and its treatment, as well as how to use a portable blood coagulation monitoring
      device and adjust their anticoagulant dose.

      DISCUSSION: Training programmes for self-management are effective in terms of enabling
      patients to acquire the necessary skills, though the level of success seems to depend on
      various patient-related factors. Given the proven benefits of self-management, it would be
      useful to properly characterise these factors and use this information to successfully
      increase the percentage of patients on on oral anticoagulants able to self-manage their own
      treatment.
