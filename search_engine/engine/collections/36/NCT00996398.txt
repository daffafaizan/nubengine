      controls. The volunteers were immersed at two temperatures (detailed below) and these
      sessions were separated by six to ten days. The order of the testing was randomly assigned
      using a random number generator. Ethical approval of the design of this trial was gained from
      the University of Limerick's Research Ethics Committee and signed informed consent was gained
      from each participant before any data collection took place.
