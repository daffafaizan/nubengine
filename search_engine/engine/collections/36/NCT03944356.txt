    
      Melanoma is a disease of significant metastatic potential if not detected very early.
      Oncogenic mutations in BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) are found in
      approximately 40% of melanomas and result in constitutive activation of the MAPK
      (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway.

      Treatment with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib plus the MEK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase
      kinase) inhibitor trametinib showed improved overall survival in patients with unresectable
      or metastatic BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma (COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies). In an adjuvant
      setting treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib significantly reduced the risk of melanoma
      recurrence in patients with high-risk, stage III BRAF V600-mutant melanoma, with improvements
      in OS (Overall Survival), DMFS (Distant Metastasis Free Survival), and FFR (Freedom From
      Relaps) (COMBI-AD study). Based on these results, adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib therapy
      was approved in 2018 by the EMA.

      Compared to the metastatic situation, issues of compliance and treatment adherence may be
      more relevant in adjuvant treatments, as patients are free of disease and potentially cured
      even without adjuvant treatment. As the routine administration of drugs including dosing,
      treatment interruptions, and early termination in clinical practice may vary from procedures
      defined in clinical trials, this study aims to assess the usage of adjuvant dabrafenib and
      trametinib in the routine clinical setting.
