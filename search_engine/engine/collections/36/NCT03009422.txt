    
      20 healthy patients diagnosed will cutaneous leishmaniasis with more than one lesion will be
      recruited.

      Half of the lesions will be treated with intra-lesional injections of Pentostam, and the
      other half by CO2 laser with topical application of Pentostam.

      Each lesion will recieve 3 treatments, one month apart between treatments. The patients will
      scale pain level of each treatment. Final scar appearance will be assessed by two
      dermatologists, without knowing what treatment was applied to each lesion.
