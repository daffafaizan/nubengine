      condition has become established, treatment should take the form of a mixed intervention
      model, incorporating preventive, rehabilitational and compensatory or adaptive approaches,
      aimed at enhancing the patient's performance within the environment. Physiotherapy and
      occupational therapy are key disciplines in the composition of multi- and inter-disciplinary
      teams for the care of stroke patients. In this clinical trial we evaluate the effectiveness
      of two programmes of ergonomic intervention in the home, with respect to levels of
      functionality (performance of activities of daily living) and the quality of life of
      post-stroke patients, by reference to a control group.
