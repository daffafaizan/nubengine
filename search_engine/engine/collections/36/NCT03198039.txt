      cardiac surgery. Investigators will test the feasibility of implementing a meditation program
      in the perioperative period. Patients will be randomized to one of three groups: those who
      complete Isha Kriya (IK) meditation before and after surgery, those who complete
      postoperative IK meditation only, and those who receive the standard of care with no
      meditation intervention. In addition to testing feasibility, the investigators will explore
      whether a meditation program can affect recovery after surgery. Patients enrolled will be
      followed postoperatively for up to one month to assess their cognitive function, pain, and
      sleep. Blood will also be collected for analysis of biomarkers of inflammation.
