      A-determine a prognostic threshold for diaphragmatic excursion measures able to predict the
      use of mechanical ventilation (invasive or not) in the first four hours.

      B-to study the association between CDA values and persistence of respiratory distress during
      the first 4 hours of care among patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.

      C-to study the association between CDA values and respiratory re-exacerbation or a continuing
      need for mechanical ventilation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency
      room D-to study the association between diaphragmatic excursion measures made after initial
      emergency care (at 4 hours; =CDH4), and the persistence of respiratory distress at 4 hours,
      in patients who at 4 hours are not mechanically ventilated.

      E-to study the association between CDH4 values and respiratory re-exacerbation during the 24
      first hours after admission to the emergency room among patients who, at 4 hours, are not
      mechanically ventilated F-to study the association between changes in values of diaphragmatic
      excursion measure before and after initial emergency care (CDA â†’ CDH4) and respiratory
      re-exacerbation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency room among
      patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.

      G-analyze patient outcomes by subgroup according to diagnosis (decompensated COPD, OAP, lung
      disease, asthma, pleural disease).
