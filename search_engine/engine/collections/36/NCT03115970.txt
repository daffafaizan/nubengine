      predictive factors. In prehospital care, lactate level is more sensitive marker and have
      better prognostic value in severe trauma than basic vital signs. Worse outcome is associated
      with levels between 2 - 4 mmol/l. Measurement of lactate level in venous or capillary blood
      is quick and simple method with minimal risks and with no special needs for medical staff
      training. In spite of good availability of this method in the Czech Republic the method
      feasibility has never been analysed in patients with severe trauma.
