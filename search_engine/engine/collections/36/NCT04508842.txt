      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion
      of Dual-STAR-T cells.Dual-STAR-T cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of
      6E5、1E6、2E6、3E6 cells/kg.The purpose of current study is to evaluate the clinical safety and
      efficacy of CD19/CD22-Dual-STAR-T cells therapy in patients with refractory and relapsed
      B-ALL.Safety and efficacy of Dual-STAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The primary
      endpoint is the safety of Dual-STAR-T cells including the effect ratio of CRS and ICANS, ORR.
      The secondary endpoint is the Dual-STAR-T cell proliferation ratio and Dual-STAR gene copied
      number in peripheral blood（PB）， and progression free survival(PFS ), overall-survival(OS) and
      duration of overall response(DOR).
