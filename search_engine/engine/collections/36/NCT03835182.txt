      life and well being. Chronic low back pain also results in many missed days of work and so is
      an economic burden as well as a social one. Subacute and chronic conservative treatment of
      low back pain secondary to a herniated disc of the lower back includes education, lifestyle
      modifications, and maintenance of a normal body mass index. Physical therapy includes range
      of motion, strengthening and aerobic exercises alongside use of physical therapy modalities
      such as superficial heating, low frequency analgesic modalities such as TENS and deep heating
      modalities such as ultrasonic waves and short wave diathermy.

      In Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation departments in Turkey, diathermy is commonly used as
      an adjunct to exercise in the inpatient treatment of disc herniation of the lumbar region.
      However, systematic reviews of the effects of diathermy in the form of ultrasound and short
      wave emphasise the necessity for further studies of their efficacy in the treatment of pain
      and impact on functionality and quality of life.

      Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to compare the efficacy of ultrasound and
      short wave diathermy in treating pain, improving disability and quality of life in patients
      with chronic low back pain secondary to disc herniation of the lumbar vertebrae.
