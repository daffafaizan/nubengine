      airspace enlargement, its inhibition may result in an interesting targeting point in view to
      find specific therapies in obstructive diseases. There is abundant evidence in animal models
      that shows how MMP-12 blockade inhibits the development of emphysema and airway remodeling.
      Unfortunately, the results have not been conclusive in human models.

      In the last years, pulmonary imaging biomarkers that measure airspace enlargement have been
      developed. In particular, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), quantified by inhaled
      hyperpolarized gas MRI, reflects alveolar airspace size. ADC provides information consistent
      with histopathological findings that may be used to estimate lung disease progression and
      treatment response.
