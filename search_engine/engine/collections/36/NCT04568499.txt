      COVID-19 cases presenting for care at International Medical Corp [supported] health
      facilities in Juba, South Sudan and the Kivus in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
      (DRC). This research seeks to assess risk factors for poor outcomes and characterize clinical
      disease progression of COVID-19 cases in resource-poor humanitarian contexts in Africa.
      Specifically, this study aims to characterize risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes,
      including both co-morbidities with evidence from high income settings, as well as prevalent
      conditions in humanitarian settings (e.g., acute malnutrition, malaria, HIV) for which data
      is not yet available. This research also aims to determine how the progression of confirmed
      COVID-19 cases in resource-poor African settings may differ from other settings where data
      are available.
