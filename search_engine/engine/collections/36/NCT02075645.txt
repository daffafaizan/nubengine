    
      A multi-centre prospective cohort study, which examines the effect of a team training
      educational intervention for pediatric resuscitation team members. The study uses
      simulation-based training as the primary teaching method to evaluate the effect of team
      training on team performance, as measured by adherence to PALS guidelines. By re-testing
      participants again after 6-12 months, the study will examine long-term retention of these
      skills.

      The investigator anticipates sustained, improved team performance after team training. If
      this proves to be true, the long-term goal is to disseminate this training widely across
      Canada, in order to benefit all paediatric resuscitation teams, and ultimately their
      patients.
