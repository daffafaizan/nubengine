    
      The purpose of the CARLHA-2 study is to determine if the combination of apalutamide with 6
      months of LHRH agonists and radiotherapy results in an improvement of progression-free
      survival (PFS) in comparison to the combination of 6 months of LHRH agonists with
      radiotherapy in high-risk postprostatectomy biochemically relapsed prostate cancer patients.

      Radical prostatectomy must have been done at least 6 months before inclusion and is not part
      of this study.

      Patients after radical prostatectomy and biochemical relapse will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either 6 months of LHRH agonists + SRT or 6 months of LHRH agonists + SRT +
      6 months of apalutamide.

      The stratification variables include Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), negative
      resection margins, extension to seminal vesicle(s), and PSA doubling time.
