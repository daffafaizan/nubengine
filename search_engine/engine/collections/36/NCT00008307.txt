        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery in patients with hematologic malignancies or
           genetic disorders treated with fludarabine and melphalan followed by allogeneic or
           syngeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the chemotherapeutic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relapse and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -6 to -2 and melphalan IV on days -3 and -2.
      Patients with a non-HLA-identical family member may also receive anti-thymocyte globulin on
      days -4 to -1. Patients undergo allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
      cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising
      mycophenolate mofetil twice daily beginning on day -3, methylprednisolone beginning on day 5
      and continuing over 8 weeks, and cyclosporine IV or orally beginning on day -3 and continuing
      until at least 6 months post-transplantation.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then at 1 year post-transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-6 years.
