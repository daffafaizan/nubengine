    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of concurrent capecitabine and standard
           external-beam irradiation in patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effects of concurrent treatment on cosmesis and wound healing at 1
           year.

        -  To determine the short-term (1-year) risk of recurrence of breast cancer in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week and concurrently
      receive oral capecitabine twice daily, 5 days a week Monday through Friday, for approximately
      6-7 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at approximately 1 week, 1 month, 6
      months, and 12 months.
