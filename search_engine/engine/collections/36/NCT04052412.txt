      activation imaging biomarker, to measure T-cell activation before and after treatment with
      programmed death (PD) PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition plus radiation
      therapy in NSCLC patients. Early preclinical and clinical studies have shown promise for
      immunotherapy treatments for several malignancies [1]. Immunotherapy is expected to grow in
      importance; however, it presents difficult challenges for response assessment. For instance,
      successfully treated tumors may actually increase in size after therapy due to inflammation
      and only later shrink [2]. RECIST criteria [3] designed to detect early effects of cytotoxic
      agents by size reduction, or the more recently proposed immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) [4] do not allow an early assessment of immunotherapeutic response since both depend
      on tumor size change. Furthermore, FDG PET is confounded by inflammatory effects causing
      hypermetabolism [5] [6]. Thus, it is imperative to develop new imaging and analysis protocols
      to evaluate immune-checkpoint blockade approaches. A method that evaluates T cell activation
      would permit an assessment of a basic first step in the process of assessing immunotherapy
      efficacy.

      There are two main goals associated with this project. We propose to 1) assess the [18F]-AraG
      biodistribution and kinetics, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor(s) and tumor
      draining lymph nodes on [18F]-AraG PET/CT imaging before and after 1 course of immunotherapy
      and 1 course of immunotherapy plus radiation 2) correlate (potential) change in [18F]-AraG
      uptake within the tumor(s) or tumor draining lymph nodes with clinical and pathologic
      response in patients treated with immunotherapy.
