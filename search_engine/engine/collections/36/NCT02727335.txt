      patients treated in the PROFILE 1005 and 1007 clinical studies but also patients who have
      been treated with crizotinib in the named patient ATU followed by the cohort ATU (Expended
      Access Cohort). Under the ATU program and according to ATU regulations, a limited set of data
      is collected and furthermore the follow up is stopped as soon as the ATU program closes. Thus
      it is not possible to have access to long term data and post progression data. Our project is
      to collect data from the patients from the ATU program (named patient and cohort) and if
      possible patients treated after the marketing of crizotinib, before, during and after
      crizotinib therapy. Centers selected for this observational study will be those of the IFCT
      network that took part in the ATU program.

      This will allow an accurate analysis of crizotinib therapy under "real life" conditions. It
      should be emphasized that this information is generally neither available from clinical
      trials nor from ATU programs.
