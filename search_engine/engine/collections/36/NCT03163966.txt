      response observed in autoimmune diseases. These findings point to the EP4 receptor as a
      rational target for the development of novel Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs
      (DMARDs)/immunomodulators which, in addition, have direct anti-inflammatory properties. The
      potential for CR6086 to act as a DMARD was extensively demonstrated in a series of widely
      accepted models of arthritis in rodents, where oral CR6086 was effective in all the
      parameters examined, including oedema, clinical arthritis score, and histology. CR6086
      performed much better than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, that lack the
      immunomodulatory properties of an EP4 receptor antagonist and are scarcely effective), better
      than first-line csDMARDs such as MTX, and similarly to immunosuppressive bDMARDs such as
      TNF-blockers, or tsDMARDs such as JAK inhibitors.

      In the present study, CR6086 (or placebo) will be administered in a dose-response fashion for
      12 weeks to DMARD-na√Øve patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis, in combination with oral
      MTX. The treatment duration and study design will allow to test the effects of the new
      treatment on clinical outcomes of disease activity, laboratory biomarkers and imaging
      parameters.
