      calculating the index of autoregulation Mx. This measurement is continuous with online
      calculation. So, the possible changes over the whole time of surgery can be detected.
      Furthermore, the measurement of AR at the ICU will be performed daily at the same time over a
      measurement period of 60 Minutes and the time course of AR after liver transplantation will
      be described.
