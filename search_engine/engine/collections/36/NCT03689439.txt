      incidence of bone metastases is about 20-30ï¼… in NSCLC patients. According to the NCCN
      guidelines, early lung cancer patients should also undergo bone scan or PETCT before surgery
      to determine the presence of bone metastases. However, all of the above methods use
      radionuclide reagents as tracers, which pose health hazards to patients and their contacts,
      including medical personnel. A retrospective study conducted by our center showed that only
      0.95% of patients with cT1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer had preoperative bone metastases.
      In patients with early stage lung cancer whose lesions are pure ground glass nodules, the
      probability of developing bone metastases is zero. The low risk factors for bone metastases
      from this retrospective study included preoperative examination of patients with CEA <5 ng/ul
      and no bone-related symptoms. In patients with primary NSCLC who underwent CEA <5 ng/ul
      preoperatively, no bone metastases occurred; in patients with negative bone-related symptoms,
      the incidence of bone metastases was only 0.18%. In the case of such patients, if the bone
      scan is performed, not only the potential damage to the patient is increased, but also the
      waste of medical resources and the burden on the patient from the perspective of health
      economics.

      Therefore, our center is expected to conduct this prospective one-arm observational clinical
      trial. According to the low-risk factors derived from retrospective studies, bone
      scintigraphy was performed in patients with GGO lesion and other low risk factors of bone
      metastasis, and the incidence of bone metastasis was obtained. The necessity of bone
      scintigraphy in cT1N0M0 NSCLC patients would be evaluated.
