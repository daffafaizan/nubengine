      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is characterized by the
      development of an obstructive abnormality which has been considered to be insensitive to
      bronchodilator treatments. However, this knowledge stems from measurements of forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) which is relatively insensitive to changes in small airway
      caliber. Moreover, it is known from studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that
      symptoms improve after bronchodilator treatment even when FEV1 is minimally increased and
      correlate with the reduction of lung hyperinflation, which is the major consequence of severe
      expiratory airflow limitation. Therefore, measurements of airway caliber by parameters not
      affected by volume history and absolute lung volumes are preferable for assessing the effect
      of bronchodilator interventions.

      In the current study, the bronchodilators responsiveness will be assessed by using not only
      spirometry but also measurements of absolute lung volumes and the forced expiratory flow of a
      partial maneuver (V'part) started from submaximal lung inflation, thus free of volume history
      effects.
