    
      Setting/Participants:

      The study will be performed at a single center - Allegheny General Hospital (AGH) in a
      setting of referral-based outpatients within the Allegheny Health (AHN) network.

      25 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors and hepatic cirrhosis eligible for liver
      SBRT will be enrolled in this study.

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      MRI cellular imaging of hepatic parenchyma with SPION will be performed on a 1.5T MRI (Elekta
      MR-Linac) on the day of radiotherapy planning. Hepatic SPION accumulation will be quantified
      and delineated to designate volumes for conformal avoidance on the MR-Linac during liver
      SBRT. This quantitative assessment will be compared to the already established methodology
      using CT/SPECT images developed at AGH. Treatment outcomes and toxicity due to improved
      conformal avoidance of functional normal liver volumes will be assessed for these patients.
      Dose-response of tumor and hepatic parenchyma to SBRT will be examined using MR-Linac
      imaging, pathologic criteria and molecular profiling of explanted livers in a subset of
      patients who received liver SBRT as a bridge to transplant.

      Main outcome of the study:

      Development and evaluation of a novel MRI-Linac based functional treatment planning platform
      with DICOM-compatible applications for visualization and subsequent conformal avoidance of
      residual, functionally active hepatic parenchyma in patients undergoing liver SBRT to primary
      and metastatic malignancies with the assessment of tumor and hepatic parenchyma response
      using MR imaging correlated with both pathologic and genomic criteria in a subset of patients
      receiving SBRT as a bridge to liver transplant.
