      constructive interference pattern that increases the therapeutic effects in the irradiated
      tissue. Patient suffering pain from diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome will receive
      conventional or interferential laser therapy. This is a comparative randomized and double
      blind clinical study. Two identical lasers in near infrared range will be used. Frequency of
      sessions: daily. Irradiated technique: manual, contact and punctual. Pain will be evaluated
      by visual analog scale at rest and during analytical wrist movement. Disability will be
      evaluated by the DASH and BOSTON questionnaire. Evaluation will take place at pre and
      post-treatment times.
