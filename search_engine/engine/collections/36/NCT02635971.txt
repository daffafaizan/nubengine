      To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
      treated with transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) of chemotherapeutics or systemic delivered
      chemotherapy.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      To compare the progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), quality of
      life (QoL), and adverse effects of treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients with
      TAI or systemic chemotherapy.

      Exploratory Outcome Measures:

      To evaluate the correlation between prognosis and expression of serum microRNAs of the
      patients.
