      ability to function in everyday life. Depression can happen to anyone, but it is more of a
      risk in people with Parkinson's disease, a progressive brain disorder that is caused by a
      loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. As many as half of people with Parkinson's may suffer
      from depression. These individuals experience different symptoms than those who have
      depression alone. For example, they are prone to higher rates of anxiety, sadness without
      guilt or self-blame, and lower suicide rates despite high rates of suicidal thoughts.
      Depression treatment can help people with Parkinson's disease who are depressed to manage
      both diseases and improve the quality of their lives. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of atomoxetine, an antidepressant medication, in reducing symptoms of
      depression in people with Parkinson's disease.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. All participants will report to the study site at
      baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 8. Psychiatric, neuropsychological, and neurological assessments
      will be performed, including evaluations with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology
      (IDS) scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. All participants
      will be offered continued routine psychiatric care with the study physician upon completion
      of the study.
