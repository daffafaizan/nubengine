      Primary objective

      The trial will have two main objectives:

        -  To detect an improvement in survival for ERCC1+ve patients treated with a non-platinum
           chemotherapy compared to platinum-based treatment.

        -  To establish non-inferiority or improvement in survival for ERCC1-ve patients treated
           with a platinum-based chemotherapy compared to non-platinum treatment.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To examine progression-free survival, response rate and quality of life between the two
           treatment regimens, according to ERCC1 status.

        -  To investigate whether the treatment effect differs according to histology (squamous vs.
           nonsquamous);gender (males vs. females); performance status

        -  To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis based on all patients, and according to ERCC1
           status.
