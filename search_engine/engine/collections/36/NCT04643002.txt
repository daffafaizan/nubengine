      for participants treated in each arm. Patients will continue study treatment until disease
      progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, participant request to stop treatment,
      Investigator decision, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Patients
      who discontinue the study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression will be
      followed-up every 4 weeks until confirmation of disease progression. For patients who
      discontinue study treatment with confirmed disease progression, follow-up visits will be done
      every 3 months (12 weeks) from the date of last IMP administration until death or final
      cutoff date, whichever comes first. Adverse events and survival status will be collected.
