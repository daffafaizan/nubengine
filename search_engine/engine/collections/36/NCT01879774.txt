      patients. The prevalence of hospital-associated hyponatremia is estimated to be up to 40%.
      Especially mild to moderate hyponatremia (125-136 mmo/l) without apparent symptoms has
      seldomly been accurately assessed but rather seen as clinically irrelevant. Cognitive
      limitations, unstable gait and motoric disorders as well as depressive conditions were
      described in smaller studies and single case reports.

      In terms of the question, if a therapeutic influence is also reasonable in slight symptomatic
      hyponatremia it is necessary to establish an accurate phenotyping of patients with
      hyponatremia, which quantifies the individual cognitive, motoric and psychological qualities.

      Patients with hyponatremia will be examined on the basis of standardized neuropsychological
      and neurological tests. Following questions are to be answered with this study:

        1. Which cognitive, motoric and psychological functions are impaired due to hyponatremia?

        2. Is there a correlation between the extend of hyponatremia and the different test
           results?

        3. Is there an intraindividual difference in test results during hyponatremia and normal
           sodium concentrations?
