    
      This is a phase 4, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate whether
      patients receiving hemodialysis and treated with peginesatide can be converted to epoetin
      alfa using a predefined conversion table while achieving stable hemoglobin. The study will be
      conducted in two phases. Hemodialysis patients treated with epoetin alfa 3 times a week (TIW)
      will first be converted to peginesatide administered every 4 weeks (Q4W). After 24 weeks,
      these participants will be converted back to epoetin alfa administered TIW for 32 weeks. The
      primary endpoint will be the mean hemoglobin during the last 8 weeks of the epoetin alfa
      period.
