      factors for MRSA infection are present, or there is a high incidence of MRSA locally.
      Prolonged exposure to vancomycin, however, has been linked with the risk of
      vancomycin-associated kidney failure. Studies have reported that a MRSA nasal swab may be
      used to predict the presence of MRSA pneumonia. Specifically, pneumonia patients with
      negative MRSA nasal swabs are 95-99% likely to not have pneumonia due to MRSA. There is
      limited data, however, evaluating the use of a MRSA nasal swab to guide vancomycin therapy.
      Accordingly, in this study, pneumonia patients in the intervention arm will have empiric
      vancomycin discontinued following a negative MRSA nasal swab. In the control arm, patients
      vancomycin will not be discontinued based on the MRSA nasal swab result. The rate of clinical
      resolution will be compared between these two study arms.
