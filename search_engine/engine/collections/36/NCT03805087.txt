      arterial occlusion is performed using coils placed in the terminal branches of the superior
      rectal arteries The emborrhoid technique has been modeled after elective transanal
      Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation, which has been shown to be safe and effective
      for hemorrhoidal disease.

      To date, there are few reports regarding emborrhoid, particularly lacking in long-term
      follow-up. Additionally, all procedures reported so far have used a transfemoral access
      route, which requires at least one day of hospital stay.

      The aims of this study are:

      To increase data regarding safety and efficacy of the Emborrhoid technique To report changes
      in the quality of life of patients at short and long-term To quantify recurrences at one-year
      follow-up To validate the use of the radial access for the Emborrhoid technique To validate
      the Emborrhoid technique as a "one-day" hospital procedure
