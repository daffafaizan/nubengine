      estimated that in 2009 there will be 1,300 new cases of cervical cancer and that 380 women
      will die of this disease. The corresponding 2009 data for Ontario is 500 new cases and 140
      deaths. In Canada, cervical cancer screening with the Pap test allows for the diagnosis and
      curative treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix or early cervical cancers. Symptoms
      of cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding and discharge. Unfortunately these are often
      associated with more advanced disease.

      The costs associated with health care are increasing. PET is an expensive imaging modality.
      Given that resources for health care are not unlimited, there needs to be high quality
      evidence of an intervention such as PET's efficacy.
