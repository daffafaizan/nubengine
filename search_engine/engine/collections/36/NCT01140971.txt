      highest rate in the world so we need urgently efforts to reduce this fact. Several studies
      have shown that maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher in cesarean deliveries. On
      the other hand an abdominal delivery cost much more than a vaginal delivery.

      A clinical trial to assess the performance of two simple and sheep methods can provide
      evidence based on local experience. Our results alow us to recommend both methods for
      clinical practice with a good possibility to reduce cesarean rates and without adverse
      events.
