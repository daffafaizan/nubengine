      pediatric participants, aged â‰¥ 2 to < 15 years old, with Sickle Cell Disease. The study will
      be conducted at approximately 50 international clinical sites, and will enroll approximately
      224 participants. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive voxelotor or
      placebo. All participants younger than 12 years of age and randomized to voxelotor will
      receive a dose based on their body weight, to provide exposure corresponding to the adult
      dose of 1500 mg/day.
