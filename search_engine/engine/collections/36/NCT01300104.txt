    
      In the present feasibility study it will be established whether it is possible to enroll
      participants for this particular kind of intervention among this particular patient group,
      and if compliance with the intervention is possible to gain by the tools planned: individual
      counselling with a dietician and a physiologist, interviews on diet, exercise tests and
      diaries on diet, exercise and steps taken.

      Furthermore, the investigators will investigate if we are able to detect effects of the
      lifestyle intervention according to cancer progression, the metabolic profile, inflammation
      and quality of life among the participants (24 men) within the short intervention period (6
      months) for this particular feasibility study.

      Biomarkers of effect and compliance are measured in blood, urine and prostate tissue samples.
      Metabolomics and the following biomarkers are measured in blood and urine samples: Alkyl
      resorcinols, enterolactone, tnf receptor 2, e-selectin. ICAM1, IL1-alpha, IL6, triglycerides,
      HDL/LDL, s-insulin, HbA1c, C-peptide, CRP, IGF1, GLP1, cholesterol, cathepsin and glucose.
