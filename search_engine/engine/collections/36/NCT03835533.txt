      safety and antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapy combinations in participants with
      mCRPC who have received prior therapy. The platform study will consist of 2 stages: Stage 1,
      an initial stage to evaluate safety, biomarkers, and clinical activity of a combination and
      Stage 2, an expanded cohort, when warranted, based on the safety, clinical activity, and/or
      biomarker results from Stage 1. The Sponsor intends to modify and/or add new combinations to
      the protocol as data emerge from this and other trials.

      Participants must provide consent for archival tissue from a prior biopsy or surgery for
      prostate cancer and must consent to baseline and on-treatment biopsies, if medically
      feasible. Participants will be assigned to receive one of the enrolling combination study
      interventions and will be monitored for safety and response.
