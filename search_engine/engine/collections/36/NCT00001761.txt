    
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerance, and immunologic effects of
      interleukin-10 (IL-10), in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. A secondary objective is
      to determine if IL-10 demonstrates sufficient anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of
      Wegener's granulomatosis to warrant further study in a larger trial. In this study, IL-10
      will be given either alone or in combination with standard therapeutic agents, usually
      consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and/or prednisone. Patients will be eligible to
      receive IL-10 when there is evidence of active disease. IL-10 will be administered by
      subcutaneous injection at a dose of 4 Âµ (Micro)g/kg/day for 28 days.
