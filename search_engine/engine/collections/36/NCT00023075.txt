      disorders with progressive upper motor neuron symptoms, including primary lateral sclerosis,
      hereditary spastic paraparesis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (H-MRS) is able to evaluate certain cerebral metabolites that reflect the
      functioning and integrity of neurons. The objective of this protocol is to study metabolic
      changes in the motor cortex and corticospinal tract using MRS in these disorders to
      characterize the pathology, the progression of the diseases, and assess the utility of MRS to
      follow the response to therapies.
