      treatment of hyperlipidemia, additional supplements may be required to lower cholesterol to
      levels that have been associated with decreased coronary events. Specifically a target has
      been to lower low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) to levels below 100 mg/dl. Red yeast rice has
      been found to be effective in lowering cholesterol in the context of the Change of Heart
      Program, where participants are encouraged to make significant lifestyle changes. This has
      been documented in two recent trials that we have published in the past year in the Mayo
      Clinic Proceedings (July 2008) and The Annals of Internal Medicine (in press). Clinically, we
      have found it necessary to add a phytosterol supplement to red yeast rice to lower LDL-C
      levels below 100 mg/dl. There has been a great deal of interest in phytosterols in both the
      lay and medical press in the past several years. This over the counter supplement lowers
      cholesterol by acting in the intestine to decrease the absorption of cholesterol. As it is
      not absorbed, there have not been any reports of significant side effects. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the lipid lowering effects of red yeast rice with and without adding
      a phytosterol. Some participants will attend the Change of Heart Program and take these
      supplements. Another group of participants will take the same supplements, with their usual
      medical care, but not enroll in the Change of Heart Program. The study will last one year,
      and participants will have been intolerant of statins in the past.
