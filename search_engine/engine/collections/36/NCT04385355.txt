      necessity and transmucosal abutments will be connected the day of the surgery. The control
      group will receive conventional transmucosal abutments while the test group will receive TCP
      abutments, with a narrower design.

      Results will be evaluated initially 6 and 12 months after the connection of the definitive
      prostheses, and finally 3 years later.
