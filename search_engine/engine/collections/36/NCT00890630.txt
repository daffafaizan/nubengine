    
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing two methods of induction of labour for
      pregnant, GBS-negative women presenting with prelabour rupture of membranes at term.

      The intervention consists of the insertion of a double-balloon intracervical catheter at the
      time of induction, followed immediately by oxytocin infusion. The control consists of
      standard therapy: oxytocin induction. Our primary outcome is feasibility, and our secondary
      outcomes are length of first and second stages of labour, rate of vaginal delivery,
      intrapartum fever, chorioamnionitis, NICU admission, suspected or proven neonatal sepsis, or
      serious neonatal complication.
