      omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3FA) on on lipid profile levels and oxidized low density
      lipoprotein

      This study will be conducted to investigate effect of VD3 and omega-3FA alone and with each
      other on lipid profile levels and oxidized low density lipoprotein in Jordanian people with
      vitamin D deficiency.

      This randomized, controlled clinical trial will be designed to test effects of 50,000 IU VD3
      weekly and 300 mg omega-3FA daily for eight weeks, separately and with each other, on on
      lipid profile levels and oxidized low density lipoprotein
