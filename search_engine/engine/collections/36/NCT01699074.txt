      curve compared to negative control, as well as will dose dependently decrease postprandial
      glycemia. It also assumes that use of KWG will dose dependently decrease aortic and brachial
      blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, and mean arterial pressure, and improve left
      ventricular ejection duration(ED) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) compared to
      control. Finally, it expects to notice an effect on subjective satiety levels and have no
      significant adverse effects compared to control.
