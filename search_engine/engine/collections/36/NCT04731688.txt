      studied from early pregnancy until approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Major assessments will
      occur at baseline (13-16 weeks gestation), 27-29 weeks gestation, 35-37 weeks gestation, and
      approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Safety assessments will be collected every 4 weeks after
      enrollment. Participants will be equally randomized within site (50 individuals at Pennington
      Biomedical Research Center and 50 individuals at California Polytechnic University) and
      obesity grade 2 or 3 to either: Provider Directed Group or Weight Maintenance Group.
