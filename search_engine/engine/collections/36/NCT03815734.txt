    
      Motor imagery (IM) consists of a complex cognitive operation by which an action is simulated
      without doing it physically.

      Many studies support the usefulness of motor imaging in rehabilitation after manual surgery.

      An approach based on motor imagery may be useful in trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis, and
      may be used to promote motor recovery after surgical treatment.
