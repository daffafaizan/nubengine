      two doses of Sepranolone (UC1010) in preventing menstrual migraine attacks in adult women
      with migraine occurring between Day -2 and Day 5 of the menstrual cycle in comparison to
      placebo. Study treatment will be self-administrated as subcutaneous injections during the
      luteal phase of three consecutive menstrual cycles. Effect will be assessed by comparison of
      symptoms recorded daily by the patients using an electronic migraine diary and a validated
      rating scale for assessment the physical and functional impact of menstrual migraine symptoms
      (MPFID). Preceding the treatment period, the diagnosis of Menstrual Migraine will be
      established by verifying menstrual migraine in at least two out of three menstrual cycles of
      daily symptom ratings by the patients. This period will also constitute the baseline data.
      The effect of study medication will be assessed as the change in symptoms from baseline to
      during treatment. The reduction in average number of menstrual migraine days per menstrual
      cycle during the treatment period cycles vs. the three menstrual cycles of baseline will
      constitute the primary endpoint.

      The study will also include a follow-up (no treatment) cycle before patients final visit.

      The study is conducted in three European countries (Sweden, Finland and Denmark) and will
      randomize 84 patients.
