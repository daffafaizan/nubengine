      caused by the absence of all or significant parts of one sex-chromosome. Major developmental
      consequences include severe short stature, ovarian failure and distinctive cognitive and
      behavioral traits, with renal and cardiovascular defects affecting a minority. Adults with TS
      have excessive rates of osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes mellitus and experience
      morbidity and mortality several-fold higher than the general population. Many of the problems
      of TS result from haplo-insufficiency for X-chromosome encoded genes, most of which remain
      unknown. Previous studies attempting to correlate genotype with phenotype in TS have been
      limited due to small numbers of subjects, limited genetic methodology and incomplete
      phenotypic characterization. This study aims to correlate TS phenotypes and genotypes using
      advanced clinical and genetic diagnostic methodologies, with the goal of identifying
      X-chromosome genes and epigenetic mechanisms causing the different features of TS. For TS
      subjects with a 45X genotype, the parental origin of the single normal X-chromosome will be
      traced to identify genomically imprinted features of the disorder. X chromosomal structural
      defects will be analyzed using high-resolution physical mapping in relation to emerging
      sequence data from the Human Genome Project. The elucidation of genetic mechanisms in TS will
      help improve the diagnosis and treatment of girls and women with this disorder and will
      further our understanding of gene dosage effects in general.
