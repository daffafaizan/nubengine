      randomized controlled trial.

      Method: The toe rising test, the "too many toes" sign, and the navicular drop test was used
      to select 30 participants with flexible flatfoot. Participants was randomly assigned either
      to an experimental group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 15). The experimental group
      received short foot exercises (SFE) and insoles, and the control group received only insoles.
      SFE was implemented 30 times for a duration of three minutes each day over the course of six
      weeks. The exercise progressed from sitting to standing and finally to one leg stance
      position within every two weeks. The participants wore shoes containing orthotic insoles for
      eight hours per day for six weeks. The EMED-x system was used to measure plantar pressure
      distribution (force, area, and pressure) at baseline and at two-week intervals throughout the
      six-week intervention. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) was used to evaluate
      restriction in participants' functional abilities, and the navicular drop test (NDT) was used
      to assess the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) height. Both variables were measured at baseline
      and at the sixth week.

      Statistics: Mixed-effects ANOVA was used to test for significant interactions between the two
      groups across time and within-subject observations of the outcomes.
