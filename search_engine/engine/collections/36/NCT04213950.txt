      are omitted or incorrectly administered. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
      (ACIP) recommends that patients who are exposed to rabies virus should receive prompt and
      thorough wound cleansing followed by administration of human rabies IG and rabies vaccine.
      Previous research identified three opportunities to improve adherence to CDC guideline
      recommendations for rabies PEP: (1) infiltration of rabies IG into and around the wounds, if
      anatomically feasible, (2) administration of rabies IG at an anatomical site distant from
      rabies vaccine administration, and (3) avoiding administration of rabies IG into the buttock.

      STUDY DESIGN: This quasi-experimental, quality improvement study evaluates adherence to 6
      quality indicators, which are based on CDC guideline recommendations, for patient selection
      and delivery of rabies IG before and after implementation of the rabies PEP quality
      improvement bundle. The quality improvement bundle includes EHR enhancements, ED staff
      education, and patient education. Patients who receive at least one dose of rabies IG or
      rabies vaccine at a study site during the study period will be included in this study. The
      historical control group includes patients treated prior to bundle implementation. The
      post-implementation group includes patients treated within 12 months following bundle
      implementation. The primary outcome is full adherence to all 6 quality indicators for rabies
      IG selection and delivery.
