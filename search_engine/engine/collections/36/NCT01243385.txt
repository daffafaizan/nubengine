        -  To determine the activity and safety of metformin hydrochloride as first-line therapy in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Previously collected and post-treatment tumor tissue may be analyzed for PTEN status and
      PI3kinase-dependent pathway activation via immunohistochemistry. Blood samples may also be
      collected periodically and analyzed for biomarkers, pharmacogenetics, pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.
