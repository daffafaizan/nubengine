      generalised spraying, will be compared through an open-label cluster randomised trial
      consisting of two trial arms with 30 clusters per arm. Clusters will be artificial constructs
      made up of groups of spray localities or complete wards to comprise populations of about
      5,000 to 10,000 persons. The unit of randomisation will be the cluster.

      The intervention arm of the trial will receive IRS delivery through targeted reactive
      spraying in the neighbourhood of recent local cases only; the reference (control) arm of the
      trial will receive IRS through generalised annual spraying of all structures as per standard
      current practice.

      Comparison will be on the basis of non-inferiority by showing that malaria incidence in the
      targeted IRS arm is no higher than malaria incidence in the generalised IRS arm within a
      specified margin of difference, and on the basis of superiority showing that the proportion
      of houses sprayed, of those targeted for spraying, is higher in the intervention than the
      reference arm. Neighbourhood investigation in response to each locally acquired case in the
      intervention arm, and comparison neighbourhoods in the reference arm will include testing for
      antibody sero-conversion to malarial antigens to assess whether cases arise in communities
      with long term exposure to malarial parasites.
