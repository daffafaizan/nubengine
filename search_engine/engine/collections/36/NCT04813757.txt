      among patients with SAIS is altered scapular movement, characterized by insufficient upward
      rotation and posterior tilt. These deficits are believed to decrease the subacromial space
      and diminish length -tension relationship among the deltoid and rotator cuff musculature. The
      scapular assistance test (SAT) is a physical examination manoeuvre aimed to detect patients
      in whom insufficient scapular upward rotation and posterior tilt contribute to the generation
      of shoulder symptoms. The SAT may, therefore, serve as an indication for the need of scapular
      focused intervention. Given the inconsistent results of scapular focused interventions among
      patients with SAIS, the purpose of this study is to assess the outcome of a scapular-focused
      intervention, particularly geared toward increasing scapular upward rotation, among patients
      with SAIS that exhibit a positive SAT as well.

      Methods: Fifty patients with SAIS and a positive SAT referred to the "Meuhedet" outpatient
      physical therapy clinic in Ashdod will be recruited for this study. Following baseline
      assessment, patients will be randomized into 12 sessions over a 6-week period. The
      intervention group will receive manual therapy and an exercise program focused on increasing
      scapular upward rotation while the control group will receive manual therapy and an exercise
      program focused on scapular muscle an rotator cuff strengthening with no special emphasis on
      scapular upward rotation. Repeated measures analysis of covariance will be conducted to
      detect differences in pain intensity, shoulder -related disability and scapular upward
      rotation following the intervention
