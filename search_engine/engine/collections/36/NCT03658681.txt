      different test meals consisting of saturated or polyunsaturated fat. The amount of fat will
      be identical in the test meals, but the fat quality will vary. The test meals are in the form
      of muffin and spread.

      All participants will consume two muffins and minimum 20 g of spread a day for three
      consecutive days, consisting of either a high proportion of saturated fat or a high
      proportion of polyunsaturated fat. At day one (visit 1 and 3) and day four (visit 2 and 4) of
      the intervention week, the participants will perform a postprandial glucose test (OGTT, 75 g
      glucose in 100 ml water) at Oslo Metropolitan University. Blood samples will be taken before
      and at different time points after the glucose test. One week prior to the intervention week
      and during "wash-out" (11 days), the participants will consume the control products which are
      high in saturated fat.

      At the screening visit (visit 0) the participants will be asked to limit the intake of
      dietary fat and fiber from oat and barley one week prior to visit 1 and during the study.
      Otherwise, participants will be asked not to change their diet and exercise habits during the
      study period. Individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria will also be invited to
      participate in a cross-sectional study for investigating the gut microbiota in a healthy
      population.

      An OGTT will be performed at visit 1, 2, 3 and 4.

      The participants will receive test meals after screening and before visit 1, 2, and 3.
