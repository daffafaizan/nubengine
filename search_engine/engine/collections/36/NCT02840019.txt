      resonance (MR) techniques for fetal imaging, and to also implement and test new MR
      technologies that would improve fetal imaging in general. This involves the development of
      new pulse sequences and image acquisition schemes that "freeze" fetal motion and hence
      provide improved image quality and robustness for both structural (T1- and T2- weighted,
      susceptibility and FLAIR imaging) and physiological imaging (diffusion, perfusion,
      spectroscopy, resting-state functional MRI, etc). The scope of this project also includes
      testing of newly developed radio frequency (RF) receive-only coil arrays that would
      inherently provide the means for faster imaging of the fetus, and thus complement the
      software developments.
