      extraction of third lower molars depending on whether the operator uses the naked eye,
      surgical loupes or surgical microscope systems. Methods: Data will be analysed through the
      index RULA (rapid upper limb assesment) to define whether there is a change in exposure to
      the risk of MSDs (Muskoloskeletal disease).

      Posture assessment will be based on 3-D data of the upper body, which can discriminate
      spatial displacements up to 2mm in translation and 1 degree in rotation.

      The surgical intervention will be performed under local anesthesia (mepivacaine 20 mg/ml with
      adrenaline 1:100000) and by the use of microscope (OPMI Movena S7) or surgical loupes or no
      magnifying system.

      During this session the following data will be collected for the study:

        1. Demographic data (baseline)

        2. Medical and dental history

        3. Parameters related to the lower third molar

        4. Radiographic tests

        5. Marker operator position

        6. Pre- and postoperative photographs

      Each patients will be recalled for follow-up visits at 7 days. During this session will be
      carried out the removal of stitches and data will be recorded as follows:

        1. VAS pain and trismus.

        2. Number of painkillers taken

        3. Control photographs

        4. Posse Scala
