      brain tumors and co-culture experiments. Tough RNA-seq, ATAC-seg and subsequent analysis to
      monitor the differential gene expression through different time points followed by stimuli.
      The study will compare the obtained results with sequencing data from microglia of
      full-fledged human tumor samples (glioblastoma and low grade gliomas). Additionally it will
      evaluated the immunologic characteristic of the tumor through cytokines levels analysis
      (TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ, TGF-β e IL-1ra).
