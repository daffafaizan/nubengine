      Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients, or their caregivers, recognize
      the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at
      preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the
      incorporation of a written self-management plan is essential. Patients must possess,
      understand, and follow a written plan if they are to respond appropriately to changes in
      asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled studies examining the efficacy of the
      written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and effective
      component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive these
      plans. If patients and physicians are to increase their use of written plans, the barriers to
      the use of these plans need further investigation.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The three primary outcome measures of this study are as follows: 1) reduction in asthma
      symptom frequency; 2) reduction in urgent, unscheduled, and emergency visits for asthma; and
      3) improved quality of life. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.

      The following four secondary outcome measures will also be examined: 1) hospitalizations due
      to asthma; 2) days with activity restriction; 3) the proportion of patients in the
      intervention group who are given the model written plan form during the initial visit; and 4)
      the proportion of patients in the intervention group who have the model treatment plan at the
      end of the follow-up period. These outcomes will be measured over a 12-month period.
