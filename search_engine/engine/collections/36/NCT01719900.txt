      weight loss in an overweight and obese adult population.

      Primary objective - To determine the effects of a 12 week intake of 15g/day of pea hull fibre
      on weight loss supported by body composition measures.

      Secondary objective - To measure glucose control and appetite regulation in overweight and
      obese adults consuming 15g/day of pea hull fibre compared to a placebo control with the use
      of plasma HbA1c and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

      Tertiary objective - To examine mechanisms of action of pulse fibre supplementation by
      determining the impact of pulse fibre supplementation on gut microbiota, serum metabolomics
      and fecal short-chain fatty acid and bile acid concentrations.
