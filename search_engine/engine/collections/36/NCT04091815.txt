    
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol is a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to
      achieve early recovery after surgical procedures by maintaining preoperative organ function
      and reducing the profound stress response following surgery, now widely accepted in
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      In laparoscopic colorectal surgery, the ERAS protocol involves an accurate interview with the
      patient in the preoperative phase aimed at smoking and alcohol cessation, the reduction of
      preoperative fasting with administration of oral carbohydrates before surgery, use of
      intestinal preparation for selected cases only, the prophylaxis of thromboembolism, a correct
      antibiotic prophylaxis, the prevention of intraoperative hypothermia and hypotension,
      prevention of volume overload, preference for minimally invasive surgery, multimodal
      analgesia with reduced opioid requirements, local anaesthetics for wound infiltration,
      prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, very limited use of the nasogastric tube,
      early removal of the urinary catheter, multimodal analgesia to minimize opiate consumption,
      early postoperative mobilization and early postoperative feeding, to promote rapid recovery
      of gastrointestinal functions.
