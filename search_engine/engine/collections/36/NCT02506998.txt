      disruption of peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy human donors. DLE have been reported
      to improve clinical response in allergies, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.

      The therapeutic effect of DLE is related to an immune modulatory effect that changes innate
      signaling pathways, such as Toll Like Receptors, and Nuclear Factor -kappa B; production of
      cytokines might also be modified with the use of DLE, including Tumor Necrosis Factor a,
      Interleukin (IL)-6, and induction of Interferon-g secretion, driving immune response to a
      T-helper Th1 immune-regulatory response, and thus helping to reduce allergy symptoms.
