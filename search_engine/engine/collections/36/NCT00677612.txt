      peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL
      response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the
      safety, clinical and immunological response of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated
      twice a week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination day, VEGFR1 peptide (1mg) and VEGFR2 peptide
      (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. The
      patients will also receive oral chemotherapy (Tegafur/Uracil/Folinate) simultaneously.
      Repeated cycles of the vaccine and the chemotherapy will be administered until patients
      develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the phase I
      study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide vaccine. In the following
      phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical response of this vaccine therapy.
