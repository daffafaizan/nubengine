      for their appointment. Participants continued to see the intervention group, PCP, and other
      medical providers as determined by their health providers independent of this study's
      protocol. Another PDQ was collected at an intended 6 - 12 months later. Demographic
      information was collected by manual chart review in the electronic medical record NextGen
      (NextGen EHR, Nextgen Healthcare, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA).

      Variables collected included age, sex, race, BMI, insurance type, preferred language,
      presence of another pain diagnosis (e.g. knee pain), active mental health diagnosis
      (including substance abuse), diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes, and morphine equivalent
      dose (MED); one post-hoc variable was recorded: timing of follow-up survey in relation to the
      2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, defined as before/after March 1, 2020. Intervention
      type was analyzed as an independent variable since the study was not designed as a comparison
      of interventions. All data was stored in an encrypted Excel database on a password-protected
      laptop. Consent forms were stored in a locked cabinet accessible only to the PI.

      Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis. PDQ
      scores at baseline and follow-up were tested for statistical significance using paired
      t-tests. Univariate analysis was performed on individual categorical variables and change in
      PDQ using two-sample t-tests. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine
      associations of these factors to the outcome. Variables were excluded from regression models
      if there was a subgroup size of six or less.
