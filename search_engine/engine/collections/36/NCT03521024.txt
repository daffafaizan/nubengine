      abutments and crowns over zirconia implants because of their cushioning effect and elastic
      modulus (5.1GPa), which absorb occlusal forces and avoid overload of the underlying bone from
      the direct transmission of biting impacts ; which could optimize and preserve
      osseointegration with time. Zirconia implants with high performance polymers restorations can
      be considered a good alternative for replacing natural teeth.

      For many years lithium disilicate has been the esthetics standard used in Veneers ,Inlays ,
      onlays, occlusal veneers, partial crowns,minimally invasive crowns and Implant
      superstructures due to its natural-looking tooth colouring and excellent light-optical
      properties.

      Due to the promising esthetics of high performance polymers as it can be veneered with
      different veneering materials it would successfully restore esthetics.
