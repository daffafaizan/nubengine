    
      This is an exploratory phase 1b/2, global, multicenter, single-arm, 2-part (phase 1b and 2)
      study of conatumumab in combination with panitumumab in patients with Metastatic Colorectal
      Cancer.

      The objective for Part 1 is to identify a tolerable dose of conatumumab in combination with
      panitumumab based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in patients with Metastatic
      Colorectal Cancer.

      The objective for Part 2 is to evaluate the objective response rate stratified by Kirsten Rat
      Sarcoma Virus Oncogene (KRAS) status (wild-type versus mutant) in patients with Metastatic
      Colorectal Cancer treated with the combination of panitumumab and conatumumab (tolerable dose
      identified in part 1).
