    
      Part 1 is a dose-escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose based on
      dose-limiting toxicities and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of
      Andes-1537 for Injection in patients with advanced unresectable solid tumors that are
      refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available. Part 2 is an
      open-label, dose-expansion study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary
      efficacy of Andes-1537 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In part 2, patients will be
      enrolled and receive the recommended phase 2 dose established in part 1 based on the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy data.
