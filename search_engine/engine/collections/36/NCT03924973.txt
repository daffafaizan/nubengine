      allocated to the ESDM treatment group or the treatment as usual group. The aim of IDEA-2 is
      to follow-up this population for 3 years after the initial 2 years of intervention, that is,
      5 years after initial inclusion to IDEA.

      Investigators hypothesize that children who received ESDM 12 hours per week will have a
      significant decrease of autism symptoms and will have a better scholastic level 5 years after
      initial inclusion to IDEA.
