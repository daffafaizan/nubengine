        -  exposed / unexposed type

        -  in superiority

        -  with two comparative groups (endometriosis / without endometriosis)

        -  Ratio of distribution of subjects in study groups = 1: 2

      ENDOBST is a comparative prospective multicenter study presentation exposed - unexposed type.
      The study aims to compare the outcomes of pregnancy in the whole exposed group to controls
      and then according to the three disease phenotype (superficial, ovarian, and deep
      endometriosis).

      Endobst aims to test the hypothesis that women with endometriosis have an increased risk of
      preterm delivery (primary endpoint) and an increased risk of pregnancy complications
      (secondary endpoints) when compared to diseases-free women. Comparisons will be performed
      according to disease phenotype.

      These analyzes will be conducted after taking into account factors likely to influence the
      occurrence of preterm birth such as particularly social characteristics (education level,
      employment status), age and body mass index of women, pathological medical and obstetrical
      history and behavioral factors (tobacco).

      Secondary analyzes will be conducted to investigate the link between endometriosis, and other
      adverse pregnancy outcomes (premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction),
      complications related to the surgical treatment endometriosis prior to pregnancy.

      Regarding the previous surgical treatment, the subgroup of women operated for their
      endometriosis will be compared to the subgroup of non-operated endometriosis in women and
      free subset of women. Particular attention will be paid to the phenotype of endometriosis and
      the nature of previous surgical treatment for pregnancy to control bias indication inherent
      in observational studies. These associations will be studied from multivariate regression
      models.
