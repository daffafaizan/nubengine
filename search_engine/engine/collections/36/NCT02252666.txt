      movement disorders, and will be tailored to the address issues unique to individuals with
      advanced MS.

      The study will enroll a total of 6 subjects having advanced MS that present with significant
      seated and standing balance, posture, or movement control deficits due to MS.

      Subjects will complete twice-daily lab training for two weeks (5 days/week). Each lab
      training (morning and afternoon) includes 1.5 to 2 hours of instruction in balance, posture
      and gait activities; therapeutic exercise for isolated muscle control; transfer training; and
      relaxation training.

      Activities are performed in 20-minute sessions with concomitant electrical stimulation of the
      tongue. The intervention is customized according to each subject's particular symptoms and
      tolerance. If a subject is not able to perform this amount of training, the training will be
      adapted to a level that is tolerable.

      After these 2 weeks, subjects will continue to perform these same intervention activities at
      home for 4 weeks. They will return to the lab for 1 week of training and testing, then
      perform home training for 4 weeks. This cycle is repeated for a total of 5 cycles.

      After the 6 months have been completed, subjects may choose to participate in an optional
      second phase of the study. The second phase includes an additional 12 months of participation
      in which subjects perform the intervention activities at home training and return to the lab
      on time per month for 2 hours of testing and 2 hours of training.

      If successful, this study would indicate that CN-NINM intervention may reduce the symptoms of
      advanced MS.
