      dystrophy affecting children, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular
      dystrophy (BMD) and subtypes of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2).
      Pharmaceutical treatments for the cardiomyopathy of muscular dystrophy, including
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, afford
      significant benefit and demonstrate cardiac remodeling in clinical studies. Further studies
      are needed to identify and characterize more sensitive indicators of cardiac dysfunction in
      muscular dystrophy subjects to better stratify subjects for entry into clinical protocols.
      Using the framework of the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) and
      the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium, this pilot study will assess
      cardiac outcome measures in children obtained by gadolinium enhanced cardiac Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and echocardiographic methods that can be reliably implemented across
      a consortium of clinical sites devoted to the study of pharmaceutical treatments for muscular
      dystrophy. These cardiac MRI scans will be shared with the PITT1109 research protocol in all
      subjects that are enrolled in both studies.
