    
      This research study is a Pilot Study, also known as a Phase I-II study, which means it is the
      first time investigators are examining this study intervention for patients with lung
      recurrence of Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue
      sarcoma, Wilms tumor or other primary renal tumor (including clear cell and rhabdoid). This
      study tests the most appropriate dose, safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of lung
      recurrence of these cancers in children. Standard radiotherapy is typically used to treat
      Ewing sarcoma and is used to treat lung recurrence. SBRT is being used to treat adults with
      small inoperable lung cancers; in such cases, SBRT has been shown to be effective and
      well-tolerated. SBRT is also used to treat bone metastases in adults and children.
