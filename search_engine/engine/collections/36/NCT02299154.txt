      aims to prospectively examine the memory problem perceptions of patients with memory
      complaints [MCs] and their accompaniers during the diagnostic process. The investigators plan
      to recruit 125 patients with MCs who come for the first time at the Research and Resources
      Memory Center in Nancy, France. Participants have to express MCs and must be free of dementia
      diagnosis at the first visit. Participants also need to be accompanied by an accompanier and
      both have to be fluent in French. This study has been approved by our local Ethics Committee
      (Committee for the Protection of Persons) and the French Health Security Agency. After giving
      their informed consent, patients and accompaniers are followed up throughout the diagnostic
      process with three visits : at their first visit, at one month after the first visit, and at
      six months after the diagnosis disclosure.
