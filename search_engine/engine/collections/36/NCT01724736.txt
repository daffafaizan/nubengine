      including digested food components, absorption of fat, metabolism of drugs, and conversion of
      indigestible foods or partially digested food ingredients to molecules that may signal
      physiological host mechanisms. The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of liquor or chime
      and microbiota. A change in that habitat may result in microbiota community shifts and
      consequential changes in brain-gut regulatory interactions. NM504 is a cobiotic formulation
      composed of 3 (generally recognized as safe; GRAS) food ingredients. One ingredient is a
      conventional prebiotic fiber. A second ingredient can be fermented but it also is included to
      change the viscosity of the biome while protecting the mucosal barrier. The 3rd ingredient is
      an antioxidant with poor bioavailability that alters the redox potential of the biome,
      selecting for some and against other microbiota growth. In a placebo-controlled
      double-blinded intervention this trial will investigate the effect of NM504 on the intestinal
      microbiota as well as markers of glucose regulation in 20 prediabetic adults. The
      intervention periods last 28 days. Examination of participants will happen at the beginning,
      weekly and at the end of intervention and will contain anthropometry; blood samples; fecal
      samples; oral glucose tolerance test; meal tolerance test; and scales to assess appetite,
      hunger, mood, and bowel habits.
