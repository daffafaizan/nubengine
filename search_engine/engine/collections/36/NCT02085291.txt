      patients with septic shock. Numerous studies focus on the effect of mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) titration on microcirculation, however, by what strategy is better for microcirculation
      in septic shock patients with previous hypertension is still a matter of debate. The goal of
      this study was to assess the effect of different strategies for MAP titration to
      individualized level on microcirculation in hypertensive septic shock patients.
