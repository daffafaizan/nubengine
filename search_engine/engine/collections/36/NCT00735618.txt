      part of your nervous system that controls the body functions that you do not have to think
      about. Researchers want to find out if a "guided relaxation" session will make your heart
      rate more variable, with more rhythm changes.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will first answer a brief
      questionnaire that will measure several symptoms, such as pain and anxiety (worry). This
      questionnaire will take less than 5 minutes. You will also be asked questions about your
      alcohol and smoking history, and if you have ever used relaxation or meditation techniques in
      the past. This will also take less than 5 minutes.

      You will then be asked to lay on your back, on a hospital bed or exam table. Electrodes will
      be placed along your chest, the same way they are placed for an electrocardiogram (ECG--a
      test to measure the electrical activity of the heart). You will be asked to rest for 15
      minutes, and then your heart rhythm will be recorded for 5 minutes. After this first
      recording, you will begin the relaxation program by listening to an audio recording for about
      15 minutes, using headphones. After the relaxation program has ended, your heart rhythm will
      be recorded for another 5-minute period while you are resting.

      You will then be asked to complete the same questionnaire as before.

      The entire procedure will take about 45-60 minutes. After this second questionnaire, your
      participation on this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 20 people will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
