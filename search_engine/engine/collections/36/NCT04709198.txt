      critically ill patients. Malnutrition, muscle wasting, and frailty are multidimensional
      clinical conditions in critically ill patients and are associated with adverse outcomes.
      Although malnutrition, muscle wasting and frailty are linked, the exact relation between them
      is unsure. As a result of evaluating these conditions together, it is planned to develop new
      treatment strategies and to improve the clinical results of patients by determining the
      relationship between medical nutrition therapy.
