      placebo supplementation in clinically-stable schizophrenic patients being treated with
      statins (n=30 each) for 4 months using a randomized, double-blind design. The National
      Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines will be used to select
      those patients with CAD risk to participate. Clinical assessments and comprehensive
      assessment of the risk for CAD, including plasma total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-
      (HDL2- and HDL3-), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- (LDL-Real-, Lp(a)-, and IDL-), and VLDL-
      (VLDL1,2- and VLDL3-) cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, as well as plasma homocysteine and
      high sensitivity C-reactive protein, will be conducted at baseline, 1 month, 2 months and 4
      months after supplementation. It is anticipated that patients who receive EPA supplementation
      will have significantly greater reduction in plasma triglycerides and LDL4-cholesterol, and
      increases in HDL2-cholesterol measures, as well as improvements in psychopathology severity
      than those patients receiving placebo. If indeed EPA is effective in decreasing the risk of
      CAD, any psychiatric benefits from EPA supplementation will be a further boon to the patients
      and the treatment team. A tremendous advantage to the clinical use of EPA includes low cost,
      no significant side effects, and ease of use.
