    
      This European CRT Survey was initiated by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and the
      European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) of the ESC in order to describe current European
      practice and routines associated with CRT-P/CRT-D implantations based on sample of patients
      enrolled in 13 countries. The data collected following implantation provides information
      including clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, implantation routines and
      techniques, adverse experience, and assessment of adherence to guideline recommendations. The
      single follow-up visit at 1 year (9-15 months) will provide information regarding short-term
      clinical outcomes.

      The primary objective of this Survey is to describe current European practice based on a
      broad sampling in 13 countries. The information collected will enable practice between
      centres and countries to be compared and permit benchmarking with national and international
      practice. The survey provides valuable quality assurance assessment for individual centres,
      permits limited economic analyses and broadly evaluates adherence to guideline
      recommendations.

      The following 13 European countries contributed patients to the survey: Austria, Belgium,
      France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
      and UK. Two national coordinators, one each from the fields of heart failure and
      electrophysiology, were selected and given the responsibility to facilitate recruitment in
      their respective countries.
