      risk. AIP has been shown to be associated with impaired glucose metabolism. This study aimed
      to evaluate the relationship between AIP and parameters of glucose metabolism.

      Methods: This observational study involved 448 healthy individuals who were at risk for
      diabetes. They were sent to hospital for diabetes check. According to the 75 g oral glucose
      tolerance test participants were categorized into the three groups; non-diabetic,
      prediabetic, and diabetic based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
      The association between the diabetes group, AIP and parameters of glucose metabolism was
      analyzed.

      The accuracy of registry data compatible with medical records. Statistical analyses were
      carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Windows version 15.0 (SPSS,
      Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics for each variable were determined. Normality
      of the data distribution was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For continuous
      variables, non-parametric statistics (Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis), and parametric
      statistics (t-test, ANOVA analysis) were used as appropriate. Statistically significant
      differences between the groups were determined by the chi-square test for categorical
      variables. Associations between the variables were explored using the Pearson correlation and
      Spearman's rho (for data that was not normally distributed). Linear regression analysis with
      backward elimination was also performed to define variables associated with AIP.
