      combination with high dose interferon in preventing regional relapse in patients with
      malignant melanoma with any number of nodes with clinical extracapsular extension or previous
      nodal basin recurrence. II. Evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy in prolonging relapse
      free and overall survival in this patient population. III. Evaluate the toxicity of this
      therapy in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior nodal basin
      recurrence, site of disease, and extracapsular extension. Following surgery, patients are
      randomized to receive either interferon alfa-2b alone or five treatments of radiotherapy
      followed by interferon alfa-2b. Patients receive radiotherapy 2 days a week for 2.5 weeks.
      Patients receive interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes daily for 5 days for a total of 28
      days, followed by subcutaneous injections 3 times a week for 48 weeks. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 167 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
