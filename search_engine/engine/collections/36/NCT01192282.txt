    
      Genital Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted viral
      disease in the world.1,2 HPV infection on genital epithelia is associated with a range of
      disease spectra, from visible lesions such as genital warts, cervical, vaginal, vulval, anal
      and penile intraepithelial cancers and their precursors, or they may co- exist in the latent
      form in apparently normal epithelium.3,4 It is established that genital warts are associated
      with low-risk HPV genotypes, with the causative agents being HPV-6 and HPV-11 in almost 100%
      of cases.5 However, recent studies have shown that 20 to 50% of lesions also contain
      co-infection with high-risk HPV types.6,7

      Although genital warts are not life-threatening, they cause significant psychosocial
      morbidities resulting in low self-esteem, negative self-perception, embarrassment and
      anxiety.8,9 Genital warts also represent not only a health problem for the individual, but
      also an economic burden for society as they carry a high and immediate financial burden and
      health care cost due to their generally recalcitrant response to conventional therapies.9
      With this in mind, immunization with HPV 6/11/16/18 recombinant vaccine holds promise for
      reducing overall burden on clinical HPV-related diseases.

      Genital warts are a common cause for referral to the Colposcopy Clinic of Groote Schuur
      Hospital, Cape Town which is a tertiary hospital serving the wider Cape Town area and the
      Western Cape Province. With an increasing number of cases seen requiring multiple clinical
      visits for treatment and a high number of recurrent and persistent cases, we undertook this
      study to examine the nature of the disease from a clinical point of view, response to various
      therapies, the impact of HIV and the types of HPV causing or associated with genital warts in
      women referred to our clinic.
