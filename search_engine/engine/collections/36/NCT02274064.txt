      after their donation using the donor databases of New York Blood Center and Hoxworth Blood
      Center. Eligible donors will be contacted via email and invited to participate in the study.
      Interested donors will be randomly assigned to either the Intervention condition where they
      will receive a motivational interview and implementation intention intervention phone call or
      to the Control condition where they will receive a standard donor recruitment phone call.
      Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the telephone contact using online
      questionnaires, and donation attempts will be tracked for one year. The investigators will
      use survival analysis to examine the effects of this intervention on retention during this
      one-year follow-up. Path analyses will also be used to examine potential mediators of the
      intervention effect. The investigators hypothesis is that donors who receive the motivational
      interview and implementation intention intervention will have larger increases in positive
      donation attitudes and perceived behavioral control which will contribute to enhanced
      intention and donation attempts.
