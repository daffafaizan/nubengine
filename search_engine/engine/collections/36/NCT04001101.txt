    
      This is a randomized phase II study with a primary objective to compare the objective
      response rate (ORR) for anti-PD-1 therapy alone versus anti-PD-1 therapy and limited
      metastatic site radiation, in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or
      mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic solid tumors. The anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab,
      received recent FDA accelerated approval for the use in patients with metastatic MSI-H or
      dMMR solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment or without satisfactory
      alternative treatment options. FDA approval for pembrolizumab was based on the results of
      five multi-cohort, multi-center, single-arm trials, which together showed an ORR of 39.6%
      among 149 patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers. Importantly, there is mounting preclinical and
      clinic evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of combining radiation therapy with
      systemic immunotherapy, although no prospective comparative data, to the best of our
      knowledge. In this study, the investigators will focus on patients with MSI-H/dMMR tumors,
      given their baseline responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibition, and test the hypothesis
      that ORR will be improved with radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy compared to anti-PD-1 therapy
      alone, through a randomized phase II trial design.
