      best primary therapy for patients who lack a fully matched related donor for HSCT. Good
      survival outcomes have been seen with IST, but initial and late failures, CSA dependence,
      persistent cytopenias and secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) / Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) in a portion of patients leave considerable room for improvement. MUD HSCT survival in
      SAA has markedly improved, but a direct comparison of this approach with IST is necessary to
      determine whether this approach is feasible and will lead to better Event Free Survival. This
      trial will address the feasibility of randomization, test whether patients can be evaluated
      in a timely fashion and safely begin therapy with MUD HSCT or IST, and give a preliminary
      assessment of the safety of up-front MUD HSCT. If successful, this trial will lead to a
      future prospective trial comparing directly IST to MUD HSCT in this disease.
