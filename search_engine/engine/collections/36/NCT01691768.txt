      conducted at the CAPRISA eThekwini and CAPRISA Vulindlela Clinics and their neighboring
      public sector family planning services in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Up to 700 consenting
      sexually active, HIV-uninfected women aged 18 years and older who previously participated in
      an antiretroviral (ARV) prevention study will be enrolled and followed for a maximum 30
      months. All women will be provided with 1% tenofovir gel but will be randomised to either
      receive their gel through a public sector family planning services with 2-3 monthly provision
      (intervention arm) or through the CAPRISA research clinics with monthly provision (control
      arm).

      All women in the trial will be provided with the standard package of HIV prevention and
      reproductive health services. Participants in both study arms will be provided with a supply
      of single-use, pre-filled applicators of 1% tenofovir gel. While in the study, participants
      will be advised and supported to follow the CAPRISA 004 pre- and post-dosing strategy, namely
      BAT24, where the first dose of tenofovir gel is applied within 12 hours before anticipated
      coitus and a second dose as soon as possible but within 12 hours after coitus, with a maximum
      of two doses of gel in a 24-hour period.

      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of an implementation model
      for tenofovir gel provision through family planning services.
