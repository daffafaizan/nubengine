    
      A randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind, clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation
      ratio, will be carried out involving patients diagnosis of distal radius fracture (aged 18
      years and above). Both assessor and statistician will remained blinded.

      Standard rehabilitation program for distal radius fracture treatments will received for both
      the control and experimental groups for a period of 12 weeks. The experimental group, in
      addition, will received a proprioceptive training program during the same intervention
      period, which will be conducted twice weekly (24 sessions).

      The severity of pain with activity will be measured according to the visual analog scale
      (VAS). PRWE questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. Patient's
      occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
      (COPM) and proprioception with Joint position sense (JPS) and force sense (FS) testing. All
      outcome measures will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 3
      weeks and at 12 weeks following the end of the intervention.

      Participation in the study will be voluntary and patients will be included if they satisfied
      specific inclusion criteria.

      All procedures will be follow in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible
      committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki
