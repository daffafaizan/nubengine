      applied in elective colorectal surgery. However, no direct evidence has been showed that
      whether it is safe to do so in gastric cancer patients who are fit for elective radical
      gastric resection.

      This study aims to discuss the impact and safety of oral administration of 5% glucose
      solution 250ml 2-3 hours before elective gastric cancer surgery. It is an equivalence study,
      which refers to a single-center, prospective, single blind, and randomized controlled study
      design. Eighty-eight patients with gastric adenocarcinoma are going to be enrolled in the
      study, who will be allocated into control or treatment group. Patients in control group
      follow the traditional routine of 6-8 hours preoperative fasting, while those in the
      treatment group will orally intake 250ml 5% glucose solution 2-3 hours before surgery. The
      primary end-point is the preoperative gastric residual volume. The secondary end-points
      include preoperative PH of gastric fluid, assessment of perioperative psychosomatic
      conditions, rate of perioperative complications, level of insulin sensitivity, recovery of
      bowel function, and the length of hospital stay, etc.
