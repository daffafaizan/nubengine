      assigned to one of three groups: control group (CON) (n = 46; 23 girls), coordinative
      exercise (CE) (n = 41; 22 girls), and cardiovascular exercise (CVE) group (n = 48; 23 girls).
      Participants performed all necessary tests according to the study protocol one week before
      the intervention. Adolescents were familiarized with the tests on a separate day before the
      first assessment. A second set of tests was performed one week after the 10-week exercise
      intervention.

      The exercise intervention period was 10 weeks. Exercises were led by a Physical Education
      teacher. Experimental groups had common physical education classes twice per week for 45
      minutes each, and additional exercise sessions were held three times per week for 45 minutes
      after school.
