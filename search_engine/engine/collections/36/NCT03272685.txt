    
      This randomized, open label, controlled, multi-site study will simulate a "real world"
      tobacco environment by providing participants access to an experimental marketplace where
      they will be given vouchers for a specified number of points that can be exchanged for study
      cigarettes (varying in nicotine content described below) and non-combusted tobacco/nicotine
      products (smokeless tobacco, snus, electronic cigarette, medicinal nicotine replacement) and
      at the end of the study can exchange unspent points for money.

      Subjects (N=250 in each group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) very low nicotine content
      cigarettes (VLNC; 0.4 mg/g) along with non-combusted tobacco/nicotine products or 2) normal
      nicotine content cigarettes (NNC; 15.8 mg/g) along with non-combusted tobacco/nicotine
      products.

      Smokers will undergo an orientation visit for screening and then enter a three phase
      experimental trial:

        1. Phase 1 - Baseline: Two week baseline assessment period during usual brand cigarette
           smoking.

        2. Phase 2 - Marketplace Adaptation: Two week period where subjects have access to the
           marketplace that provides their preferred usual brand cigarettes and selected
           non-combusted tobacco products to allow the subject to adjust to the marketplace prior
           to randomization;

        3. Phase 3 - Intervention: Randomization to a marketplace with access to either VLNC or NNC
           cigarettes plus non-combusted products for a 12 week period.

      Biomarker samples are collected at baseline, end of Phase 2 and end of week Phase 3 (week
      12).
