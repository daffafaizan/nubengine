      randomized by running number (blind) into 2 groups including active and placebo group.
      Baseline demographic, disease characteristics, nocturnal questionnaires and wearable
      nocturnal sensors data were collected before drug titration. In active group, participants
      received the rotigotine transdermal patch titration from 2 mg/day to maximum dosage which
      participants had no side effect or 16 mg/ day every week. In placebo group, participants
      would get the placebo patch titration as the active group. After participants got maintenance
      dosage, participants would get the physical examination, nocturnal questionnaires and
      wearable nocturnal sensors as before study.
