      Primary

        -  Investigate the efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy after prior
           surgical resection or radiosurgery of 1 to 3 brain metastases from solid tumor in
           patients with good performance status and controlled systemic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated on this
           protocol.

        -  Determine time to neurologic progression in patients treated on this protocol.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated on this protocol.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      center, number of brain metastases (single vs multiple), type of primary tumor (stable
      systemic cancer vs synchronous or unknown primary), WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and
      treatment (prior surgical resection vs planned radiosurgery).

      Patients who have undergone complete surgical resection are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms within 4 weeks after surgery.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

        -  Arm II: Patients do not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients planning to undergo
           radiosurgery are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo radiosurgery followed by adjuvant WBRT within 4 weeks after
           surgery.

        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo radiosurgery alone. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at
           8 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion if study treatment, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (85 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.
