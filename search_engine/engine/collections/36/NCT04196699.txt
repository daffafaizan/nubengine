      nursing consultation and tele-monitoring in Lebanon. It will be conducted at the HÃ´tel-Dieu
      de France (HDF) hospital, one of the largest university hospitals in Beirut, and will use
      quantitative and qualitative methods in pre- and post-intervention to collect data over a
      period of 3 months. Data will be collected by two researchers. A consent form will be signed
      by each participant prior to the intervention. Patients will be informed about the purpose of
      the study, the course of the intervention, and the freedom to withdraw from the study at any
      time. Their consent for the video recording will also be taken.

      This study is the first to evaluate the application of telehealth to optimize COPD management
      in Lebanon. The results of this study will provide evidence regarding the efficacy and
      feasibility of this approach for Lebanese patients with moderate to severe COPD.
