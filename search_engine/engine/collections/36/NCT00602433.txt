      research study questionnaire once. Blood samples are collected after an overnight fast.
      Samples are analyzed for circulating levels of total and bioavailable testosterone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone binding globulin. Serum luteinizing hormone,
      follicle stimulating hormone, fasting glucose, and insulin levels are also assessed.
