      in up to 50% to 70% of patients with uveitis.

      Preoperative complications, including anterior synechiae, posterior synechiae, and pupillary
      membrane formation, may increase surgical challenges. In addition, recurrent inflammation
      increases the incidence of postoperative complications and often affects the visual
      prognosis. In recent years, phacoemulsification with intra ocular lens (IOL)implantation has
      become the main surgical method for treating uveitis (complicated cataract), and the visual
      prognosis of patients who undergo this procedure is usually favorable.

      Surgical treatment may be effective but is associated with higher rates of complication than
      in non uveitic eyes. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is the most common complication cataract
      surgery in the general population. Although, in most cases, the macular edema is
      self-limited, in rare cases it can lead to long-term visual deterioration that is difficult
      to treat.

      Another common complication after cataract surgery is posterior capsule opacification (PCO) ,
      leading to symptoms of glare or blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, or impaired posterior
      segment exam. Factors that are critical in the development of PCO include surgical technique,
      type of implanted intra ocular lens (IOL) either foldable hydrophilic acrylic, hydrophobic
      acrylic or silicone and postoperative control of uveitis
