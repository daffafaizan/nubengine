    
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV)
      ferumoxytol in pediatric participants with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol in
      pediatric participants with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.

      Due to significant challenges with enrollment for both studies, Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was
      combined with Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and enrollment continued under Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251.

      Participants were enrolled by age cohorts in a stepwise manner following a safety review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Board of 1 age cohort prior to enrollment of a subsequent age
      cohort, with progression from oldest to youngest: Randomization was stratified by the
      following age cohorts: 12 to <18 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years, and 6 months to <2
      years.

      Participants who completed the combined AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies had the
      option of participating in this extension study.
