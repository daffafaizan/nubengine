      during mechanical ventilation is known. However, no studies demonstrate its utility during
      epidural analgesia for labor.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate lung function and atelectasis in pregnant women with
      or without epidural analgesia, during labor and after delivery.

      Only adult consenting patients ASA I & ASA II (American Society of Anaesthesiologists) are
      included in the study. According to institutional protocols lumbal epidural catheter is
      inserted and tested at the start of the labor, while patients' parameters are monitored.

      Refusal to epidural analgesia, technical difficulties to insert the epidural catheter or any
      medical contraindication will result in inclusion of these patients in the control group.

      Measurement with EIT is not invasive and harmful neither for the mother nor for the child.

      It consists of putting a belt around the chest; this belt is linked to a monitor which
      measures the impedance of the different lung regions.

      Electrical impedance measurements will be done for short periods of maximum 5 min. each as
      follows:

        1. Placement before injection of local anesthetics through the epidural catheter in the
           study goup; in the control subset placement of the belt will be done when an epidural
           anesthetic would have been considered.

        2. 1 hour after placement of the belt

        3. 1 hour after delivery

      These periods will be compared.
