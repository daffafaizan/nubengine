    
      Study designed to assess the vascular benefits of drinking Cocoa that is rich in polyphenols.
      Vascular beds studied will include kidney, brain, eye, and periphery (finger). Time course of
      the effects will be studied in healthy normal (including elderly), and also in subjects with
      Type I and Type II diabetes. Renal blood flow will be determined by PAH/In u test clearance.
      Cranial ultrasound will be used to measure brain blood flow. Retinal blood flow will be
      assessed by specialized ultrasound/doppler device. Peripheral blood flow is measured by
      plethysmography. Urine and blood samples will be assayed for routine physiologic parameters,
      including hormone assessment, and also for the presence of cocoa metabolites.
