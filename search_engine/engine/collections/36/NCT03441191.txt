      Audio-visual Stimulation program (AVS) for sleep promotion in older adults with
      osteoarthritis pain. In this study, the AVS program was tested in a randomized controlled
      design. Specifically, this pilot study examined a 30-minute audio-visual stimulation program
      that gradually ramped from 10 Hz down to 2 Hz, to be used at bedtime for delta brainwave
      induction, in a randomized controlled design. The placebo control AVS program consisted of
      30-minutes of constant dim light that slowly changed in color, and a steady monotone at
      ultra-low (<1 Hz) frequency (outside of the entrainment range).

      Method: A total of 30 older adults (mean age 68 Â± 5.1, 90% women) with comorbid insomnia and
      osteoarthritis pain participated in this 2-week study. Participants were randomly assigned to
      either AVS active program or AVS placebo control program. After the baseline assessment
      (which included questionnaires [sleep, pain, depression], and quantitative
      electroencephalogram (QEEG) during AVS induction), participants were asked to self-administer
      their group specific AVS program nightly at bedtime for two weeks. Post-treatment
      questionnaires (sleep, pain, depression) were then collected.
