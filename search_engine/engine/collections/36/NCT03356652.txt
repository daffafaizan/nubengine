      delivery for acute correction of electrical dyssynchrony using a noninvasive mapping of
      global electrical activation.

      Study Hypothesis: Tailor-made configuration of CRT delivery is feasible and able to improve
      responder rate compare to single method of CRT delivery in candidates with known poor
      response to CRT.

      Primary outcome measure: Responder rate of greater than 10% of LV end systolic volume
      reduction in patients undergoing tailor-made approach of CRT delivery at 6 months. The
      responder rate is to compare with pre-defined level of 40% for single method of CRT delivery
      namely biventricular pacing with LV lead in coronary sinus.

      Sample Size: The total required sample size is 93 patients with device implanted.
