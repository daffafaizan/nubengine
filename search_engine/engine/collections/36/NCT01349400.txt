      Germany, 44.000 incisional hernia repairs per year are performed. Incisional hernia repair is
      not a low risk operation associated with high recurrence rate and high percentage of
      postoperative pain. Treatment of incisional hernias represents a significant surgical and
      socioeconomic problem. Until now, surgical treatment is recommended for patients with
      incisional hernia independent of symptoms due to the risk of an acute incarceration with
      serious complications. Studies defining the exact indications for incisional hernia repair
      and describing the natural course of an incisional hernia including the risk of an acute
      incarceration are not available to date. Randomized controlled trials having been performed
      in the past few years show that observation is a reasonable option in mildly symptomatic
      inguinal hernias. In this study, watchful waiting vs. surgical repair of oligosymptomatic
      incisional hernias are compared in a prospective-randomized setting for the first time. The
      aim is to determine pain and discomfort, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and the
      frequency of incarceration. The investigators hypothesize that pain intensity during everyday
      activities is not different in the compared groups and that incarceration frequency is low.
      If this was the case, a watchful waiting strategy could be applied in oligosymptomatic
      incisional hernias and risks and costs for surgery could be saved.
