      compliance enhancement therapy known as Medication Management Therapy (MMT) as an adjunct to
      Ignition Interlock in the management and treatment of DWI. Subjects will be recruited from a
      local Interlock provider. This program of research will collect pilot data for a study to
      determine whether pharmacotherapy, previously recognized as effective, can be successfully
      combined with existing counseling treatments and sanctions for persons convicted of a repeat
      DWI alcohol offense. We will investigate the extent to which this combination of sanctions
      and treatment will significantly decrease attempts to drive after drinking among offenders,
      and whether the effect persists following discontinuation of Vivitrol.
