      disease amongst young people. Subjective sleep complaints are often a core symptom of
      depression and highly prevalent with 60-90% of depressed adolescents suffering from disrupted
      sleep. This sleep disruption often takes the form of insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling or
      staying asleep, or waking too early) or hypersomnia (prolonged sleep episodes or excessive
      daytime sleepiness). The aim of the trial is to examine the efficacy of a simple behavioral
      sleep restriction two weeks in duration on mood and sleep in adolescents ages 14 to 17 years
      with and without major depressive disorder. During this period sleep is objectively measured
      using actigraphy and monitor mood using self-report. The results of the study will inform
      whether a simple behavioral sleep restriction beneficially impacts mood and sleep.
