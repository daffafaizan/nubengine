      source. Procalcitonin is a better blood marker of infection than White blood cell count and
      possibly than C-reactive protein. This could lead to a reduction in antibiotic prescription.
      Our objective is to evaluate the impact of Procalcitonin result on antibiotic prescription in
      children 1 to 3 month old with fever without source and our hypothesis is that it will lower
      the antibiotic prescription rate.
