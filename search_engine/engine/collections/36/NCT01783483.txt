      greater sternal stability that leads to superior sternal bone healing, less postoperative
      pain and narcotic usage, and improved functional outcomes compared to wire cerclage. The
      health economics analysis is an interesting component of this study, in which cost and
      billing data will be collected from participating sites and analyzed in terms of
      cost/effectiveness for patients and healthcare system.
