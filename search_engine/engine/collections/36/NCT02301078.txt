      histolyticum are two non-invasive treatment options for patients with Dupuytren's disease.
      While PNA has been offered for decades, injectable collagenase is relatively new. The
      effectiveness of each treatment has been compared in the literature; however, recovery, in
      terms of pain and short-term function has not been formally evaluated. The objective of this
      study is to objectively compare short-term function and pain outcomes associated with each of
      these two procedures in patients presenting with untreated Dupuytren's disease.
