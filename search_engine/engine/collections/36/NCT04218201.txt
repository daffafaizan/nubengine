    
      This cluster randomized trial, conducted in primary care clinics and randomized at the level
      of the PCP, will compare the STOP intervention to enhanced usual care (EUC) for 12 months.
      Patients who are eligible and enroll will receive the intervention according to the
      assignment of their PCP. In the EUC arm, PCPs conduct primary care as usual, without support
      of the nurse care manager. Patient participants receive an educational pamphlet about
      overdose prevention and watch a brief video on "healthy living" that is not specific to
      substance use. In the STOP arm, PCPs and their enrolled patient participants receive the STOP
      intervention, consisting of a NCM, brief advice about health risks of opioid misuse, and
      telephone health coaching. Patient participants in either arm who are found by clinical
      providers to have developed a moderate-severe OUD at any time during the study can be offered
      medication for OUD and linked to treatment by clinical staff in the EUC arm, and the NCM in
      the STOP arm, to formal assessment and MOUD treatment.
