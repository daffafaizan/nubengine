      wounds on follow-up, and general subject satisfaction with the appearance of the healed
      incisions following use of BandGrip. Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled at a single center.

      Subjects who have undergone arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder and require closure of one
      or two skin puncture sites will be enrolled. Following incision closure subjects will be seen
      at the time of BandGrip removal (approximately 7-14 days after closure) and at 30 days for
      assessment of the incisions.

      The incidence of wound closure for each treated puncture site, defined as continuous
      approximation of wound margins from the time of wound closure until the day of removal of the
      wound closure device without dehiscence or need for reclosure.
