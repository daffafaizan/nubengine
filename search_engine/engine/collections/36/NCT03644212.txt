      vitamin D deficiency were enrolled. Sixty-three women were treated with oral vit D3 for 8
      weeks (16 with PCOS and 47 controls) and 16 women were not treated (6 with PCOS and 10
      controls). Serum 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25 OH-D), sRAGE, and AMH concentrations were measured
      at baseline and after vit D3 supplementation in the treated group, and 8 weeks apart in the
      non-treated group. Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Pearson correlation were
      used as appropriate.

      Main outcome measure: Changes in AMH concentrations following vit D3 replacement.
