      is secreted from intestinal L-cells into the splanchnic circulation, it is (i) subject to
      rapid breakdown and (ii) submitted to a high liver extraction. Highest concentrations of
      GLP-1 are therefore found in the splanchnic blood rather than in the systemic circulation. An
      oral delivery system would mimick the physiological path of endogenous secretion. Objective:
      We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of a single dose (2
      mg) of oral GLP-1 administered prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in 16 healthy
      males.
