      replication , but Peg-IFN-α also play an important role in immune regulation . In hepatitis B
      infection, Treg cells play an important role in immune regulation.Peg-IFN-α recommended as
      the first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and even HBsAg
      disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which may be related to the functional
      activation of Treg cells in the case of hepatitis and the function enhancement of Treg cells
      during Peg-IFN-α therapy. This study was aimed at investigating the changes of Treg cells
      frequency and function, and the expression of costimulatory molecules during Peg-IFN-αand
      nucleoside analog(ue) therapy.Meanwhile, the investigators wanted to verify whether Peg-IFN-α
      suppressed the virus, which led to the decline of Treg cells frequency and function;negative
      regulation of Tregs for immune cells diminished, hence, the function of immune cells
      recovered.
