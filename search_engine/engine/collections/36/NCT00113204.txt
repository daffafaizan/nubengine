      recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a
      central role in regulating protein homeostasis. Hsp90 regulates the stability of key proteins
      (called "client proteins") and keeps them in the appropriate three dimensional shape so they
      can perform their cellular functions. In addition, many of the proteins stabilized by Hsp90
      are oncoproteins and cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and
      cancer cell survival. Thus Hsp90, a single molecular target that is a central integrator of
      multiple pathways important to cancer, is an ideal novel target for oncologic therapy.
      Selective inhibition of Hsp90 will affect multiple downstream mechanisms to disrupt tumor
      growth and selectively kill cancer cells. The anti-neoplastic effects of Hsp90 inhibition
      have been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo for a variety of different hematologic and
      solid tumors including multiple myeloma.
