    
      Clinically controlled study comprising 15 people with known nickel allergy and 15 healthy
      persons as control group. At the Department of Allergy and Dermatology, Gentofte Hospital,
      test participants will be exposed to nickel sulfate in a patch test on their back, which will
      create an eczema reaction in people with nickel allergy and induce skin resident T-cells. The
      resident T-cells will enhance further exposure. The eczema is healed over 3-4 weeks, after
      which the same areas are again exposed to nickel sulfate at different concentrations in a
      patch test. Skin biopsies of the exposed areas are taken and the immune phenotype is analyzed
      trough Nanostring RNA technologies of around 600 immunerelated genes.
