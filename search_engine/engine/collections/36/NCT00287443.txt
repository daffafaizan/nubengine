      Hispanic adolescents (ages 15-17, Tanner 3 or 4) from the CF Centers at University of Texas
      Southwestern and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Information obtained from these
      subjects will be compared to 12 prepubertal and 12 adolescent Caucasian children with CF
      recruited from the same CF centers. We will categorize the subjects according to glucose
      tolerance (OGTT), as well as insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using the IVGTT and
      the Minimal Model, as modified for children. We will also compare the historical information
      of socio-economic status and family history. Clinical status will be characterized by
      measuring pulmonary function and modified NIH scores, in addition to measuring levels of
      circulating cytokines. Gluconeogenesis (GNG) will be quantified by measuring the
      incorporation 2H into the 2nd, 5th and 6th carbons of glucose. Whole body protein turnover
      (WBPT) will be measured using [1-13C]leucine. Nutritional status will be determined by
      three-day food journals, and intake will be compared to energy needs, utilizing indirect
      calorimetry to measure resting energy expenditure. Subjects will be recruited from the CF
      centers at the University of Texas- Southwestern and the South Central CF Consortium.
