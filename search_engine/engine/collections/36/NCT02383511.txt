    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the plasma concentration of SMT C1100 calculated at each time point for each
      subject (sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), percentage of coefficient of
      variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum for the parent and the major
      metabolites).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of SMT C1100
           in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) by assessing the participants adverse
           events, ECG results, vital signs and laboratory tests.

        2. To evaluate the diurnal variability in the steady state PK of SMT C1100 calculated at
           each time point for each subject (sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD),
           percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum, and
           maximum for the parent and the major metabolites).

        3. To evaluate reductions in creatine phosphokinase as a potential pharmacodynamic (PD)
           marker of SMT C1100 activity and clinical benefit.
