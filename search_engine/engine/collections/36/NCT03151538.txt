      arch which is lower than normal range or occurs extra pressure on arch. It is separated two
      group such congenital (flexible and rigid) and acquired. The etiology of pes planus is that
      hallux rigidus, plantar calcaneonavicular ligament rupture, collapse of medial longitudinal
      arch, pathology of ligament and tendon, shortness Achilles tendon and juvenile hallux valgus.
      The most common causes of pes planus are outgroup of leg muscles (peroneal) spasticity,
      plantar fasciitis and tibial tendon insufficiency. Symptoms of pes planus are indicated heel
      pain, gait abnormalities, decreased dorsiflexion range of ankle, plantar ulceration, limited
      mobility of 1.metatarsophalangeal joint and spasm of peroneal muscle. There is a high
      prevalence rates among males and occur positive correlation between with pes planus and BMI.
      Evaluation methods of pes planus are X-ray, heel height, gait analysis and Achilles strain.
      The most commonly used method are line that medial malleolus, 1st metatarsal head and the
      navicula is on the same line, and the footprint technique from ink rubber plates. Treatment
      of pes planus is maintained medial displacement calcaneal osteotomy operation with the
      transfer of the flexor digitorum longus. Non- invasive treatment methods are given such as
      peroneal muscles and Achilles stretching exercises. 25 degree angle inverted foot orthoses
      are commonly used because of increasing stance phasic in treatment. Peroneal neural
      mobilization, play training and stretching exercises are often used treatment method of pes
      planus. Main purpose of this study is that assess effects of mixed training program with
      playing on pes planus and increased femoral anteversion angle in pre-school students.
