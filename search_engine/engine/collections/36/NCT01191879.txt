      necrosis such as troponin. While troponin measurement is highly sensitive for myocardial
      necrosis it has several limitations that influence its clinical use. First, since the
      troponin test is reliable only after 4-6 hours from symptoms onset, it has only limited value
      in the assessment of patients presenting earlier. Second, several clinical situations, most
      commonly renal dysfunction, are associated with increased troponin level and therefore may
      decrease the specificity of the test. Third, since troponin rise indicates myocardial
      infarction it is not useful in the common situations where there is myocardial ischemia
      without necrosis.

      The P53 is a tumor suppressing gene activated in different stressful situations including
      hypoxia. This activation is associated with accelerated transcription (up to 30-50 folds from
      baseline) of different genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and in stopping the
      cell cycle. A study on pregnant women demonstrated high levels of fetal mRNA of these genes
      in maternal circulation. This gene expression correlated with other signs of fetal stress
      associated with hypoxia. Myocardial ischemia is another stressful event associated with
      tissue hypoxia. Nevertheless, the association of this gene expression with myocardial
      ischemia has not been investigated yet.
