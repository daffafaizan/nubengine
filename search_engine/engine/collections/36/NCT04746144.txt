      Nephew) from the same surgeon from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients completed
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) before the operation and then at 1, 2, and 4 years
      postoperatively.These included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Joint Replacement
      Survey (KOOS JR) 7-item score; questions from the Cincinnati Knee Rating System related to
      the overall knee condition, pain, and swelling; selected questions from the Veterans RAND
      12-Item Health Survey; questions about general fitness level; and questions regarding patient
      expectations before and after surgery. Patients were asked to list all physical,
      recreational, and work activities they participated in after surgery. An experienced research
      associate interviewed the patients postoperatively, with data reduction and patient ratings
      blinded to the treating surgeon and therapist.
