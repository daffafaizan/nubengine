      participants will be recruited for the study. It is an open-label randomized clinical study
      with 2 arms (for 2 different species of sand fly: Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus
      duboscqi). Participants will be randomized to each arm with 6 participants in each arm. This
      study will take place at the Translational Research Facility (Q Block), Hull York Medical
      School & Department of Biology, University of York, York.

      The participants will be followed up to 21 days post-sand fly bite. There will then be a
      focus group once all participants have completed their follow-up.
