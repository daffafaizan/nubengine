    
      This is a national multicenter randomized open-label superiority study of the use of
      Degarelix compared to LHRH agonists among men with advanced prostate cancer and pre-existing
      cardiovascular disease. Patients will be stratified based on baseline endothelial function
      and presence prostate cancer metastasis.

      Study population: Subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease with locally advanced or
      metastatic prostate cancer and scheduled to start Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).
      Patients already on ADT will be excluded. subjects will receive either two initial loading
      doses of 120mg Degarelix for 1 month followed by 80mg monthly for eleven additional months or
      an LHRH agonist at the discretion of the treating Urologist/Oncologist for 1 year. Follow-up
      visits will occur every 3 months. A blood sample for Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cardiac
      biomarkers and rectal examination will be performed each visit. At baseline 6 and 12 months
      EndoPAT2000 measurements will be taken.
