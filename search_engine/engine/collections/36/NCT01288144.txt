      pregnancy. These women face an increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes1 and may
      benefit from lifestyle interventions and screening to detect early disease. However, studies
      have shown that less than half of women are screened appropriately in the postpartum period.
      This performance gap may reflect both lack of communication between obstetric and primary
      care providers and lack of knowledge of appropriate screening guidelines. The investigators
      plan to assess a quality improvement initiative, using administrative and clinical data, to
      identify women with a history of GDM and implement decision support to enhance quality of
      care.
