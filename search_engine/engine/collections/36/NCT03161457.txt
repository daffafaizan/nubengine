      randomise approximately 150 subjects as outpatients.

      The primary objective is to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of JHL1101
      and MabThera (rituximab). The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of JHL1101 versus MabThera, to investigate the
      pharmacodynamics profile of JHL1101 versus MabThera, and investigate the efficacy of JHL1101
      versus MabThera.
