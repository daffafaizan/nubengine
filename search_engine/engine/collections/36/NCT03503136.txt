      randomly assigned to one of the four groups: Group A: TPF+P-RT; Group B: TNF+N-RT; Group C:
      TPX+P-RT; Group D: TNX+N-RT. In induction chemotherapy, patients will receive docetaxel(60
      mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin or nedaplatin (60 mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2 on
      Days 1 to 5) or capecitabine (625 mg/m2 bid, on Days 1 to 14) every three weeks for three
      cycles before the radical radiotherapy. Concurrent cisplatin or nedaplatin (100mg/m2 on day
      1) was given every three weeks for two cycles during radiotherapy. Patients are stratified
      according to the treatment centers and stage. The primary endpoint is progression-free
      survival (PFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free
      survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), toxic effects, and quality of
      life (QOL). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the
      safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
