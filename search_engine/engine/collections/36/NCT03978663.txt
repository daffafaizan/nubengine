      (non-inflammatory) breast cancer or stage IIb (triple negative or Her2+) breast cancers will
      be approached to participate in this single arm trial. Patients with staging investigations
      ruling out distant disease will be approached to participate and will undergo pre-treatment
      image guided core biopsy and blood samples for molecular correlative studies, followed by
      hypofractionated radiation (delivered prone) to entire tumor with dose constraints to skin,
      critical organs and contralateral breast, plus a 0.5 cm PTV. As much of the tumor that can
      receive planned dose of 8 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions every second day, with fall off dose
      to 4 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions for PTV margin. Two weeks following completion of
      radiation, patients will undergo a second image guided core needle biopsy of tumor and blood
      sample. They will then begin standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline and taxane
      based), followed by a third tissue biopsy under image guidance of any residual tumor and
      blood sample and then standard surgery (breast conserving or lumpectomy). This will be
      followed by standard whole breast radiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions). Herceptin therapy and
      hormonal therapy will be administered as per clinical standard when indicated. Primary
      outcome will be measured as pathological complete response to treatment, and secondary
      outcomes will include toxicity, immune markers (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-1 and
      PD-L1 up-regulation and changes to the circulating lymphocyte counts.
