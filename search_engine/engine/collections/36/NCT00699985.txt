      90 Revised (SCL90-R). BD diagnosis was based on the new International Criteria for Behcet's
      Disease (ICBD). Non-BD patients were patients mimicking BD. All patients were asked to
      complete the SCL90-R when they attended the clinic for their routine follow-up. The
      demographic information and disease manifestations including ocular and neurological
      involvement were registered. For those with visual impairment, SCL90-R was applied by an
      interviewer. Frequencies and descriptive analysis were measured in both BD and Non-BD groups.
      Means and standard deviations (SD) of visual acuity were calculated. Data collected from
      SCL90-R did not have normal distribution in any dimension. The mean values of raw numbers,
      global severity index (GSI), the positive symptoms total (PST) and the positive symptom
      distress index (PSDI), were compared by Mann-Whitney U (M-W U) test.).To detect any bias in
      results due to data collection method, self reported data and reviewer collected data were
      compared.
