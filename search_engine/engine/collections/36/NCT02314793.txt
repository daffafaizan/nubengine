    
      Part 1 is a single ascending dose investigator-blinded study in healthy young male and female
      subjects. Six doses of ASP2205 or matching placebo will be given to separate cohorts
      consisting of 8 subjects each, with 6 subjects receiving ASP2205 and 2 subjects receiving
      matching placebo. ASP2205 or matching placebo will be given as a single oral dose under
      fasted conditions.

      The effect of a high-calorie high-fat meal (breakfast) on the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of ASP2205 will be evaluated in a separate cohort of 8
      subjects in an open-label manner.

      Part 2 is a multiple ascending dose subject- and investigator-blinded study comprising 3
      cohorts with each 12 healthy young (aged 25 to 55 years) female subjects and 1 cohort with 12
      healthy elderly (aged 65 years or older) female subjects who will receive ASP2205 or matching
      placebo. Nine subjects in each cohort will be treated with ASP2205 and 3 subjects will be
      treated with matching placebo (ratio 3:1).
