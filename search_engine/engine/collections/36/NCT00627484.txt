      caloric restriction with gastric banding (BND) or a very low calorie diet (VLCD) will be
      examined at baseline weight, and when 6-10% total body weight has been lost. We will measure
      insulin sensitivity with an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and fasting levels of
      hormones that regulate food intake and insulin sensitivity, such as ghrelin, peptide YY
      (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and leptin. Fat mass and skeletal muscle mass will be
      measured by dual photon absorptiometry (DXA). We will also measure the hormonal and thermic
      response to food with a liquid test meal and energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry. This
      measures how many calories are burned at rest and the in response to food. Subjects with
      diabetes will continue to be studied with the same protocol on an annual basis out to 5 years
      in order to determine the rate of remission of diabetes and the durability of this effect as
      subjects tend to regain some body weight over time.

      Subjects with diabetes will also be followed every three months for the first year after the
      initial weight loss for HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. The results of this study may lead
      to new understanding about changes in insulin sensitivity, body composition and hormonal
      profile, as well as changes in energy expenditure with weight loss after bariatric surgery or
      with simple caloric restriction. With this greater understanding, new treatments for obesity
      and diabetes, that do not require surgery, may be developed.
