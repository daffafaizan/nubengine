      Manual therapy (MT) studies of techniques like mobilization, manipulation, and therapeutic
      exercise, has been demonstrated effectiveness for the treatment of pain and disability in the
      neck. These investigations have thought of this treatments as individual interventions. Thus,
      multimodal ways of treatment to improve patients with nonspecific chronic neck pain are
      necessary.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal treatment protocol
      compared to a unimodal treatment protocol in the medium-term, on patients with chronic
      non-specific neck pain.

      Subjects are randomly allocated into three groups: MT group; MT+Educational therapy (ET)
      group; and MT+ET+Exercise group. Each subject receive a 4 weeks period treatment (8
      sessions). Outcome measures include physical, somatosensory, and psychosocial
      characteristics; which are measure at 0, 4, 8, 16 weeks by a blinded assessor.
