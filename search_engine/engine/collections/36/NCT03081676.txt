    
      A total of 6 experimental days will be performed. The following is an outline of an
      experimental day:

      Participants will meet after a 10-hour fast. A tablet of glimepiride 1.0 mg or placebo will
      be administered 90 minutes before the initiation of the experiment (-90 minutes) The mean FPG
      will be calculated from blood samples -105, -100 and -90 minutes. Two intravenous cannulas
      will be inserted in a cubital vein of each arm. One intravenous cannula will be used for
      infusions of glucose, arginine and GIP and the other will be used to collect venous blood.
      The forearm from which blood samples are drawn will be placed in a heating pad (50°C)
      throughout the experiment for arterialisation of venous blood.

      At time 0 minutes, a glucose clamp will be established at the FPG level for 60 minutes and
      hereafter a post-prandial clamp period of 1.5 × FPG for another 60 minutes. At time 120
      minutes, a bolus of 5g of L-arginine (given as 50% arginine HCl) will be infused during 30
      seconds. The post-prandial clamp will be maintained for another 10 minutes until time 130
      minutes to prevent reactive hypoglycaemia. Throughout the experiment (0-130 minutes) a
      continuous infusion of either GIP (1.5 pmol/kg/min), GLP-1 (0.5 pmol/kg/min) or placebo
      (saline) will be administered.

      During the experiment PG will be kept stable by a continuous 20%-glucose infusion. The rate
      of infusion will be regulated according to PG determined by bed-site measurements every 5
      minutes. After 60 minutes, a post-prandial clamp will be established by a bolus infusion over
      one minute using 50%-glucose to target 1.5 × FPG (the amount of glucose to be administered
      will calculated as follows: (1.5 × FPG - FPG) × 35 mg glucose × weight in kilogram).
