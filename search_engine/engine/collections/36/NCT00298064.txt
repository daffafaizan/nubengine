    
      This study is done to gather preliminary data for determining the best way to test EGFR
      expression in patients with cervical cancer who will receive treatment with EGFR inhibitors
      in the future.

      This study is designed to obtain preliminary data of genomic and phenotypic alterations of
      the EGFR pathway in high grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (HG-SIL) and invasive
      cervical cancers (CC) to be used later for therapeutic guidance and to evaluate genomic
      (over-expression, amplification, point mutations, etc.) and phenotypic alterations of other
      transduction pathways interacting with the EGFR pathway.
