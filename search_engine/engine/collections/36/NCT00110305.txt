    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), active controlled
      (participants are assigned to either a recognized effective treatment or the study
      medication) study. This study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (4 weeks), treatment
      phase (96 weeks), and follow up phase (4 weeks). In the treatment phase, participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: (1) TMC278 25 mg, (2) TMC278 75 mg, (3)
      TMC278 150 mg, or (4) efavirnez (control group); along with investigator selected 2
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) until Week 96. TMC278 will be assigned
      by double-blinded fashion (participant and investigator are not aware of the TMC278 dose what
      participants will receive) and efavirnez will be assigned by open-label fashion (all people
      know what treatment participants will receive). After Week 96, 3 optional open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) extension periods will be conducted to collect
      long term safety and effectiveness data of TMC278. 3 optional extension periods are: first
      optional extension period (all participants will receive TMC278 75 mg + 2 NRTIs from Week 96
      to Week144); second optional extension period (all participants will receive TMC278 25 mg + 2
      NRTIs from Week 144 to Week 240); and third optional extension period (all participants will
      receive TMC278 25 mg + 2 NRTIs from Week 240 until TMC278 is commercially available).
      Participants on efavirenz group will have the option to continue on efavirenz + 2 NRTIs until
      the total treatment duration of 240 weeks. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical examination, and vital
      signs which will be monitored throughout the study. The maximum duration of the study will be
      104, 152, or 248 weeks, plus the optional third extension period.
