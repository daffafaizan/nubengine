    
      The Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Cohort Study, initiated in 2002, is study of
      adults with IBD who have been tracked prospectively through annual clinical interviews and
      semiannual surveys. The participants were drawn from a validated population-based research
      registry, which identified and recruited individuals using an administrative definition of
      IBD from the comprehensive health data base of Manitoba Health, the single insurer that
      provides health care to all residents in the province.

      The cohort consisted of 388 adult enrollees with recent IBD onset who completed the baseline
      survey and interview in 2002 to 2003. Participants were followed every 6 months with surveys
      and annually with interviews. Diagnosis and disease type were verified by chart review. It
      has been demonstrated that the Cohort is representative of the provincial IBD population as a
      whole, with comparable age distribution, sex distribution, disease duration, and rural/urban
      residence.
