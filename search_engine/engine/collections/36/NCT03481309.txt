      magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. Electromyography will be
      recorded on right abductor digiti minimi muscle to find the motor threshold and measure motor
      evoked potentials for each healthy participant. In addition, electroencephalography (EEG)
      data will be collected on the scalp with a high-density EEG net. Eighteen healthy
      participants will be in this study. Each participant will be seated in a reclining chair and
      applied non-invasive magnetic and electrical stimulations on the scalp. At baseline, the
      participant's resting motor threshold (RMT) will be estimated by adjusting the intensity of
      TMS applied on the left motor cortex to achieve motor-evoked potentials of about 50 uV with
      10 TMS pulses at a rate of 0.25 Hz. Then a 3-condition, 3-session, 6-sequence randomized
      crossover experiment will be used to characterize and compare three versions of tDCS
      stimulation: anode, cathode, sham. Before and after a 10-min tDCS condition is applied, TMS
      pulses at 120% of RMT intensity will be applied for 10 minutes and TMS-evoked potential and
      motor-evoked potential amplitudes will be measured. Each session has at least 1-day gap to
      remove outlasting effects. We will also be collecting structural magnetic resonance imaging
      (sMRI) to target primary motor cortex precisely.
