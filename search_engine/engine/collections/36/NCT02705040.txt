      shown to lose their bone mass at the same rate by more than 65 of age, and osteoporosis in
      men causes higher mortality in men than those in women. Thus, osteoporosis in men has
      recently aroused public attention. Androgen deficiency was the main cause leading to
      osteoporosis. Bone structure is maintained by a dynamic balance of osteoblast-mediated bone
      formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) play
      critical roles in regulation of bone formation and resorption. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
      non-coding small RNAs and participate in regulating activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts
      by postranslationally targeting certain gene expressions. miR-133 and -135 can target BMP-2,
      Runx2, and Smad5 and then regulate osteoblast differentiation. Likewise, miR-141 and -200a
      negatively regulated osteoblast differentiation. Nevertheless, the functional roles of miRNAs
      in osteoporosis in men are still unknown. In addition, miRNA are stable and can be detected
      in the blood as novel biomarkers for certain diseases. A recent study analyzed the levels of
      miRNAs in circulating monocytes of 10 high and 10 low bone mineral density postmenopausal
      Caucasian women and found miR-133a is a potential biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
      In comparison, the roles of blood miRNAs in osteoporosis in men have not been evaluated.
      Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the roles of specific miRNAs in osteoporosis in
      men.
