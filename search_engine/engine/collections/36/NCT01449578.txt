      higher than 150 mg twice daily for their effectiveness in slowing the progression of ALS.
      Exploration of doses of dexpramipexole higher than 150 mg twice daily is justified by
      preclinical and clinical data that suggest that higher doses could potentially be more
      effective in slowing the progression of ALS than the dose of dexpramipexole currently being
      explored in Phase 3 studies (150 mg twice daily).

      This is a Phase 1, single-center, blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, ascending-dose
      study consisting of 2 parts; Part A (single-ascending dose [SAD]) and Part B (multiple
      ascending dose [MAD]). The study will explore safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg and multiple daily doses ranging from 225 mg to 300
      mg BID dexpramipexole in healthy volunteers.
