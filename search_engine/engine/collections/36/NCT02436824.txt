    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety
      and efficacy of AB001 topical patches in patients with chronic low back pain. Subjects
      meeting inclusion criteria are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive AB001 patches or placebo
      patches. Two AB001 or placebo patches will be given topically once daily for 14 days. The
      primary end point is the change of low back pain intensity rated on a visual analog scale
      (VAS) scale on Day 15, the secondary end points include the subject global assessment (SGA)
      of low back pain, the subject global perceived effect (GPE) of study medication, the
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and the pain assessment from subject diary
      (Days 1 - 3 only). Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study, including the
      adverse event (AE) incidence and severity, laboratory test results (hematology and clinical
      chemistry), vital signs, and physical examination.
