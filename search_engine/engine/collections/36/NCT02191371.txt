      receive intravenous (propofol) or inhalational (desflurane) anesthetic.

      Systemic oxygenation can be evaluated by measuring partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
      blood analysis. Microcirculatory parameters can be obtained from vascular occlusion test.
      Among those parameters, recovery slope during vascular occlusion test is known to reflect
      recruitment of microvasculature in response to hypoxic or ischemic insult. In this study, we
      will compare arterial partial pressure of oxygen and recovery slope during one-lung
      ventilation between propofol and desflurane group.
