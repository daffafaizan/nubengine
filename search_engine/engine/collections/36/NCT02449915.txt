      surgery. Unfortunately, patient surveys indicate there has been little improvement in the
      incidence and severity of postsurgical pain in the past two decades. Postoperative pain is a
      common complaint, occurring in 5-15% of patients and has been shown to significantly
      contribute to overall patient dissatisfaction. It can lead to increased consumption of
      opioids, with subsequent nausea, delayed bowel function, and prolonged postoperative
      recovery. In an attempt to address pain related complications with port-site wounds, various
      methods of pain control have been attempted. Currently, no standard of care exists and
      management is based on surgeon and anesthesiologist preferences.

      This study seeks to determine if the injection of liposomal bupivacaine to laparoscopic port
      sites and rectocele repair incisions at the completion of a robotic sacrocolpopexy with
      concomitant rectocele repair will result in decreased postoperative pain compared to
      injection of placebo.
