    
      This protocol represents one aim of a larger clinical project that will advance the
      infrastructure of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) network,
      facilitate expanded clinical and translational pediatric research, and rapidly transform the
      culture of pediatric rheumatology toward universal participation in research. Through the
      creation of sophisticated informatics infrastructure, provision of comprehensive site support
      and the engagement of families, patients, and communities, CARRA will provide the opportunity
      for affected children at every CARRA site to participate in high quality clinical and
      translational research.

      The larger clinical project includes development of a CARRA-wide informatics platform with
      capabilities for capture, storage, visualization, and secure HIPAA-compliant sharing of
      validated disease metrics and relevant subject demographics, utilizing centralized Electronic
      Data Capture (EDC) and phone interviews where appropriate, and ontology-based data storage
      using a distributed database structure based on the NIH-supported i2b2 (Informatics
      Integrating Biology and the Bedside) framework. This will enable efficient, observational,
      disease-related data capture across CARRA sites. The CARRA Registry described in this
      protocol will form the foundational database and will involve the capture of data including
      pediatric rheumatic diseases as described in Appendix A.

      The CARRA Registry will support data collection from the use of consensus treatment plans
      (CTPs), clinical trials, observational disease registries, comparative effectiveness
      research, and other research on patients with pediatric rheumatic disease. The CARRA Registry
      will form the basis for future CARRA studies and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI)
      is serving as the CARRA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for this protocol.
