    
      Following ethics approval by the Ospedale San Raffaele, 84 adults aged between 45 and 80
      years old will be recruited for the study, excluding people with unstable serious disease
      (e.g., heart or lung disease), previous orthopedics pathologies on the same side (e.g., hip
      arthroprosthesis), pregnancy and intake of psychotropic drugs.

      Patients who consent to participate in this study will be randomized into two rehabilitation
      groups after TKA: experimental (virtual rehabilitation) and control (traditional
      rehabilitation). In the experimental arm, subjects will undergo a virtual rehabilitation
      training during the post-surgical rehabilitation period, in addition to passive knee range of
      motion device (kinetec) and functional activity (stairs). In the control arm, subjects with
      similar demographic characteristics to those of the experimental arm, will undergo the usual
      physiotherapy rehabilitation, in addition to passive knee range of motion device (kinetec)
      and functional activity (stairs). Both control and study interventions will be provided 60
      minute daily session.

      General status of patients will be undertaken for the following outcomes at the baseline and
      10 days after surgery (at discharge).

      The primary outcome will be the visual analogue scale (VAS); the secondary outcomes will be:
      the disability knee assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC), the
      health related quality of life assessed by the EuroQol (EQ-5D), the global perceived effect
      assessed by the GPE score, the functional Independent measure assessed by the FIM
      questionnaire, the drugs assumption, the isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings
      assessed by dynamometer, the range of motion (R.O.M.) and proprioception assessed by VRRS.
