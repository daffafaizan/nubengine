      interstitial lung disease respond better to immunosuppressive therapy, and have a better
      outcome compared to patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. This makes it
      imperative to identify this group of patients for management and prognostication.
      Unfortunately some of these patients do not demonstrate overt clinical manifestations of
      connective tissue disease and our current available autoantibody screen does not detect all
      potential autoantibodies present. We would like to test for specific autoantibodies in this
      group of patients to evaluate its clinical utility in identifying covert connective tissue
      diseases associated with interstitial lung disease.
