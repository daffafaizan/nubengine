      International Patient Decision Aid Standards and NIH Guidelines for pilot studies. The study
      design is necessary to achieve the objective of the study, which is to examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the TELL Tool intervention in a pilot randomized-controlled
      feasibility trial to determine intervention viability and inform a larger, efficacy trial.
      There are three Specific Aims that are: Aim 1 determine feasibility of the study procedures
      (e.g., recruitment, retention) by pilot testing the TELL Tool using a 2-arm
      randomized-controlled trial (RCT) with 60 donor-recipient parents using pre- to post-test
      measures for disclosure intention, competence, and anxiety. (A pretesting of the measures
      will be implemented with 8 to 12 donor-recipient parents, who are not participants of the
      pilot RCT, prior to launching the RCT.); Aim 2 survey participating donor-recipient parents
      at 2 additional time points (4 and 12 weeks/months 1 and 3) post-intervention/attention
      control completion to obtain meaningful outcome data about actual parental disclosure to
      their donor-conceived children; and Aim 3 refine the study tools (e.g., TELL Tool, eBook)
      through post-intervention/attention control written evaluations with participating
      donor-recipient parents and cognitive interviews with 10 donor-recipient parents, who are a
      sub-sample of parents from our larger sample of parents, and 10 clinicians. The findings will
      inform the final protocol for a larger, efficacy trial.
