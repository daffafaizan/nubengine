      brain tumors. Radiosurgery is considered to be part of standard of care. Typically for
      standard of care, radiosurgery is given after a patient has healed from neurosurgery, in an
      attempt to destroy any cancer cells that may be left after surgery. Patients who agree to
      participate in this research study will receive radiosurgery before their neurosurgery.

      The timing of radiosurgery (pre-operatively) and the dosing to determine the safest dose is
      considered experimental.

      By giving radiation the typical way, after surgery, a larger area of the brain must be
      covered, which means healthy brain tissue also receives radiation, whereas radiation before
      surgery will specifically target the tumor.
