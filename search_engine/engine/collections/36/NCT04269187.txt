    
      All patients will be subjected to:

        1. medical history.

        2. clinical examination.

        3. diaphragmatic ultrasound : diaphragmatic thickness and excursion will be assessed.

        4. theophyllin treatment; 200 mg/d orally for 12 days then reassessment of diaphragm by
           ultrasound.

        5. weaning trial ; Patients are considered ready for weaning when they meet all the
           following criteria: fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 0.5, positive end expiratory
           pressure (PEEP) â‰¤ 5 cm water , Pa O2/Fi O2> 200, respiratory rate (RR) <30 breaths/min,
           alert and cooperative, and hemodynamically stable in the absence of any vasopressor
           therapy support.(11)

             1. rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) will be measured. It's defined as the ratio
                between the respiratory rate (breaths/min) and tidal volume (TV) (liters).

             2. 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial with a T-piece and zero pressure support (before
                extubation).

             3. extubation is done & follow up for 48 hours
