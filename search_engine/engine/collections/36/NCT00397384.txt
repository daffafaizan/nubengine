      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). II. To identify the recommended dose (RD)
      for phase II of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in combination with cetuximab in patients
      (pts) with incurable gastrointestinal, head and neck, or non-small cell lung cancers that are
      Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild type.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). II. To perform skin and tumor biopsies to
      analyze molecular inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
      pathway, defined as a >= 75% inhibition of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor
      (EGF) receptor or of its downstream effectors tumor protein (p)44/42 mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) or protein kinase B (Akt) or as a >= 25% decrease of marker of
      proliferation Ki-67 (Ki67) from baseline in either skin or tumor tissue in the majority of
      patients.

      III. To identify the optimal biological dose (OBD). IV. To describe any antitumor effect
      observed.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
