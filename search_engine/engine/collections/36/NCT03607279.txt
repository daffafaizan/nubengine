      because of intraoperative bleeding, obstructive uropathy and older age. In particular
      robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) which is in increasing demand as an
      alternative surgical option for retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) is associated with
      postoperative renal dysfunction because pneumoperitoneum during RALP can decrease cardiac
      output and renal perfusion. NGAL may become important for diagnosis of postoperative AKI
      after urogenital oncosurgery.
