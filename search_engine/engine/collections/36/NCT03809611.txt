    
      This was a multi-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study.
      The total duration of the study was approximately 3 months. Approximately 120 presbyopic
      subjects were to be enrolled into the study.

      Presbyopic subjects aged 45 to 55 years were the primary age group in this study.

      Screening and Baseline: Subjects were screened for eligibility followed by a baseline visit
      after which they were randomized to receive either UNR844-Cl (1.5%, equivalent to 1.3%
      freebase) or Placebo, dosed one drop in each eye twice daily, for 3 months.

      Randomized subjects attended the following study visits after baseline: at Week 2, Month 1,
      Month 2 and Month 3.

      The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of UNR844-Cl on binocular
      distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) in presbyopic subjects aged 45 to 55 years with
      the primary endpoint being the change from baseline in binocular DCNVA in subjects aged 45 to
      55 years at Month 3 after UNR844-Cl or Placebo treatment.

      There were two secondary endpoints:

        1. To assess the efficacy of UNR844-Cl on achieving 75 or more Early Treatment Diabetic
           Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters in binocular DCNVA in presbyopic subjects aged 45 to
           55 years with endpoint being the proportion of subjects aged 45 to 55 years achieving 75
           or more ETDRS letters in binocular DCNVA at Month 3 after UNR844-Cl or Placebo
           treatment.

        2. To assess the safety of UNR844-Cl in presbyopic subjects by the frequency of treatment
           emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) in
           all subjects after UNR844-Cl or Placebo treatment.
