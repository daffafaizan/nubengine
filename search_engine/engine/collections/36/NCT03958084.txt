      effect of five interventions on the flexibility of hamstrings in healthy individuals.
      Participants will be assessed pre and post intervention through the extended leg elevation
      test and photogrammetry. The techniques of unilateral lumbar mobilization, proprioceptive
      neuromuscular facilitation, massage, ventosa therapy and foam roller will be applied on
      different days with a 48-hour interval between interventions. The techniques will be compared
      using the repeated measures ANOVA after verification of normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test,
      adopting the significance level of 5% and 95% confidence interval.
