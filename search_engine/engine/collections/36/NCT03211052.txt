      To investigate if neoadjuvant TAK-700 with LHRH agonists and prostatectomy is associated with
      a delay in progression free survival compared to prostatectomy alone

      To evaluate response (CR and PR) after at least 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with the study
      drugs Collection of Plasma, tissue and functional imaging with MRI To evaluate (molecular)
      expression of AR regulated genes and tumour immunohistochemistry. Molecular and protein
      expression will be correlated with intracellular androgen levels and pathologic response to
      ADT

      136 patients will be randomised to this study. 68 patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy
      with TAK-700 and Leuprorelin Acetate followed by surgery and 68 patients will receive surgery
      alone.

      This trial aims to recruit 136 patients with clinically localised prostate cancer. Patients
      will be stratified according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk
      stratification criteria and type of planned surgery. Definitions of risk categories can be
      found in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
