      research study will enroll lung cancer patients into a registry to study changes in DNA (or
      genetic material) that may be associated with development of lung cancer or other lung
      diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We will also study the role of
      eating habits on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as the effects of the disease
      and treatment on quality of patient's lives.
