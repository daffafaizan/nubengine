      with Autism spectrum disorder and normal intelligence: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
      developed to suit adults with Autism spectrum disorder, and recreational activity, enabling
      social interaction. The recreational activity intervention served as a low-impact option,
      easily organised within the community. It is not a placebo; rather it controls for the
      positive effects that come out of a structured social environment and group setting. The
      investigators hypothesized that both interventions would lead to improvement in quality of
      life, well-being and relief in psychiatric symptoms, with a greater effect in the Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy intervention compared to recreational activity. A cumulative follow-up
      was made, within 5 1/2 years after the start of the treatments. Additional questions adapted
      to the patient group were added at this 5 1/2 year time point.
