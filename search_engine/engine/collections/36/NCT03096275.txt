      major branches. However,it is more prevalent in countries and areas along the silk road.Young
      women at child-bearing age is the most prevalent population.It can cause ischemia or
      inflammation of the involved organs and increase the overall mortality rate.Although it may
      be lethal in some patients,it is not well studied due to the rareness of the disease.The
      traditional treatment of TAK is primarily empirical. The most commonly used drugs for
      treating active TAK are glucocorticosteroids(GC) and immunosuppressants including
      cyclophosphamide(CYC), methotrexate(MTX) and azathioprine(AZA) etc. However,no of these drugs
      have been well studied. In addition, the genital toxicity of CYC, the first line medication
      for active TAK, has become the major limitation for its long term use for a chronic disease
      like TAK. Therefore, new immunosuppressants with less toxicity,especially with much less
      genital toxicity and low malignancy risk is essentially necessary. In a pilot study carried
      out by the principal investigator of this study has shown that mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)
      combined with MTX is effective and with few adverse effects. The purpose of this prospective
      open-label study is to compare the efficacy and safety of GC+MMF+MTX with GC+CYC followed by
      GC+AZA for the treatment of active TAK. 150 patients with active TAK will be recruited and
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to GC+MMF+MTX group and C+CYC and AZA group. Patients were followed
      for 52 weeks to assess the efficacy and safety.
