      condition to perform the proposed tests.

      In order to validate the determination methodology of hGH variants and biomarkers, blood
      samples from treatment group subjects are compared to reference blood samples of 450 mL from
      a control group (not receiving treatment) as it is not possible to obtain a basal sample of
      such volume from the subjects receiving treatment.
