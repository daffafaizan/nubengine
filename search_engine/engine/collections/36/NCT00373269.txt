      hyperglycemia,whole blood tissue factor procoagulant activity (TF-PCA) and plasma factorVIIa
      (FVIIa) in ten patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 11 non-diabetic patients at
      baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours (h) after presentation for acute stroke.

      Patients presenting to the Emergency Department with ongoing stroke symptoms and neurologic
      deficit less than 24 hours (h) duration were screened for inclusion into the study. Stroke
      patients were grouped in terms of diabetes status as determined by past medical history.
      Stroke diagnosis was confirmed with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical care,
      including the acute management ofstroke and hyperglycemia, was done at the discretion of the
      Neurology service not involved in the study.
