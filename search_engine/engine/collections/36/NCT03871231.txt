    
      A prospective single-arm feasibility study involving acute testing of UPT electrotherapy in
      subjects with VT/VF during clinically indicated ventricular tachycardia catheter ablation
      procedure or indicated implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant, upgrade, or
      replacement or new CRT-D implant or upgrade to CRT-D.

      The study involves up to two roll in subjects at each participating site followed by an UPT
      evaluation and refinement segment in which remaining subjects are enrolled until arrhythmia
      terminations from UPT delivery are reliably achieved. A prospective evaluation segment will
      be performed to compare UPT against SBS and ATP if sufficient subjects remain once reliable
      terminations from UPT are achieved.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the visits for the Clinically-Indicated Procedure per standard
      of care. A single follow-up at up to 30 days post-procedure is required to assess subjects
      for adverse events.
