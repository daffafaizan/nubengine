      prescribed ICS/LABA FDC before the index date and who initiated Spiriva Respimat, or received
      a higher dose of ICS/LABA FDC, or initiated LTRA, or switched to a new ICS/LABA FDC in the UK
      during the study period (September 2014-December 2017) enabling to assess potential
      channeling of prescribing to different patient populations.
