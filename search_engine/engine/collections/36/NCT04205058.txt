      40% of patients undergoing laparotomy. POI is described as the time between surgery and the
      first passage of flatus and/or stool and tolerance of oral diet. It could be recognised as
      postoperative complication when is defined as two or more of nausea/vomiting, inability to
      tolerate oral diet over 24 h, absence of flatus over 24 h, abdominal distention and
      radiologic confirmation on or after day 4 postoperatively without prior resolution.
      Multimodal approaches have been described to treat POI; among them, the early consumption of
      coffee showed a substantial benefit after colorectal and gynecologic surgery. The objective
      of this randomised placebo-controlled trial is to investigate whether early coffee
      consumption can accelerate the recovery of bowel function after open pancreaticoduodenectomy.
