    
      This is a single center phase I dose escalation trial of a single course of IDEC-Y2B8
      (90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, Zevalin) with autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell infusion
      followed by high dose chemotherapy and AHCT for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell
      NHL. In step one, an imaging dose of IDEC-In2B8 (111In- ibritumomab tiuxetan, Zevalin) will
      be followed one week later by IDEC-Y2B; both will be preceded by an infusion of 250 mg/m2
      rituximab. Imaging will be done immediately (within 1 hr), at 4 - 6 hours and at 1, 3, and 6
      days after 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan.
