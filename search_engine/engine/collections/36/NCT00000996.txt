    
      Doxorubicin is one of the most active of all antitumor agents but at currently used doses
      toxicity is common. When small doses are administered on a weekly schedule, the toxicity of
      the drug appears to be reduced.

      Patients are stratified for non-therapy purposes into 2 groups; doxorubicin is given
      intravenously (IV) every week on an outpatient basis. Patients are monitored carefully, and
      weekly blood samples are taken to determine the effectiveness and safety of treatment.
      Patients are evaluated for toxicity after one dose of the drug and weekly thereafter.
      Patients are evaluated for response to the drug after 4 weeks and monthly thereafter.
