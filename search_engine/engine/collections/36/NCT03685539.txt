      I. To optimize two major parameters of computed tomography (CT) imaging for optimal detection
      of intracranial metastatic lesions.

      Ia. Virtual monochromatic image reconstruction. Ib. Contrast bolus timing. II. To measure the
      detection accuracy of CT compared to the diagnostic standard of care gadolinium-based "Gamma
      Knife (GK)" protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      OUTLINE:

      Within 7 days before the standard Gamma Knife MRI, patients undergo DECT scan over 6 seconds
      at 1.5, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after receiving the contrast agent.
