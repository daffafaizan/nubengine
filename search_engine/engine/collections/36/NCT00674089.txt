      To reduce the infant mortality rate in rural Pakistan through evidence based interventions.

      Aim:

      To evaluate the impact of a community-based neonatal Vitamin A supplementation program on the
      morbidity and mortality in newborns and young infants (1-6 months of age) when administered
      at community level

      Primary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose 50,000 IU of vitamin A supplementation to
           newborn infants within 48 hours after birth in rural Punjab and Sindh in reducing
           mortality (<6 months of age) by â‰¥ 25%.

        2. To evaluate the feasibility of neonatal vitamin A dosing when administered by LHW as
           part of postnatal care package

      Methodology:

      Study Design: Community based, cluster randomized, double blinded, placebo control trial

      Sample size estimation:

      Assuming average infant mortality rate 40 per thousand live births in the proposed clusters
      without intervention (range 30-50/1000 live births), and a targeted 25% reduction in
      mortality in first six months of life, (5% significance level and 80% power) our estimates
      indicate that the trial will require total 360 clusters [180 in each arm]. The average
      population size and birth rate per LHW are 1000 and 30 respectively Study Site: Districts
      Sukkhur and Jehlum. Both the districts, represent a typical mix of peri-urban and rural,
      multiethnic population of Pakistan. Although a public health care infrastructure exists, it
      is notable that almost 60% of the population seeks care from private health sector. Current
      rates of immunizations are poor (approximately 60%) and largely population is illiterate.
