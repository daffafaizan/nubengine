      1) addressing health literacy by reducing the complexity of diabetes content disseminated to
      patients during medication counseling and 2) addressing health literacy by enhancing
      patient-pharmacist communication. The second strategy aims to improve the psychosocial
      support offered to patients by building self-efficacy and addressing negative beliefs about
      medicines and diabetes. Together, the patient and the pharmacist can work together towards
      goal setting, problem solving, and negotiation of competing priorities.

      Currently, with usual care, the pharmacist confirms if patients understand how to take
      medications correctly, adjusts diabetes medications, and monitor patients' hemoglobin A1C
      levels periodically to make sure that patients are capable of managing their diabetes
      appropriately. With the proposed intervention, the pharmacist will identify patients'
      concerns and barriers to medication taking and self-care with diabetes with an emphasis on
      self-efficacy, negative beliefs in medicine and illness. Then the pharmacist will provide
      individualized plans and set specific goals with each patient by strengthening their
      confidence in medication use and health literacy skills in navigating health information for
      diabetes self-care. The methods described for the intervention are in line with the current
      clinic workflow and will not require a substantial change to the current system for
      counseling diabetes patients. Knowledge change often does not lead to behavior change. Hence,
      the intervention will innovatively focus on moving knowledge towards action as the clinical
      pharmacist works with patients in assessing health literacy, identifying their barriers to
      medication use, including lack of self-efficacy, addressing negative beliefs about diabetes
      and diabetes medications; towards problem solving, and developing goals and action plans that
      will improve medication adherence and glycemic control.
