      suspected of having venous thromboembolism. Patients will be diagnosed for VTE (PE or DVT)
      based on local standard of care. Samples will be collected for future testing with new
      D-Dimer assay.

      In case of Low/Moderate PTP score and negative VTE diagnosis, patients will be followed for 3
      months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.
