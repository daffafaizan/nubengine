    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if serum 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is only detected in acute myeloid
           leukemia (AML) patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if the level of serum 2HG impacts leukemia-free survival (LFS).

        -  To determine if the level of serum 2HG impacts overall survival (OS).

        -  To determine if serum 2HG is undetectable at the time of documented clinical remission
           (CR) in IDH-mutated patients.

      OUTLINE: Archived serum samples are analyzed for 2-hydroxyglutarate expression by
      reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results are then compared
      with presence or absence of an IDH mutation, patients' clinical outcome, as well as age, sex,
      white blood cell count at diagnosis, platelet count, bone marrow blast percentage at
      diagnosis, circulating (serum) percentage at diagnosis, cytogenetic risk group, presence of
      FLT3, NPMN1, and/or TET2 mutations, specific IDH mutation, and randomization treatment group
      allocation.
