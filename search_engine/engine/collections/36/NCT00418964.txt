      performed by orthopedic surgeons with approximately 100,000 cases performed per year in the
      United States. A large amount of sports injuries were related to ACL problem. As such, ACL
      injuries and treatment is still widely under intensive study.

      Traditionally, ACL surgery has been focused on using bone patella bone graft and single
      bundle hamstring graft. Problems of knee pain, unstable fixation, rotational instability and
      degenerative changes were reported. Recently, the use of double bundle hamstring graft to
      reconstruct the ACL according its anatomy aiming to improve the rotational stability was
      proposed. However, results about the clinical, functional and radiological outcomes are
      limited.

      The objective of this prospective pilot study is to assess the clinical, functional and
      radiological outcomes of three different ACL reconstruction procedures: Bone Patella Bone
      graft, Single bundle hamstring graft and anatomical Double bundle graft in terms of pain,
      swelling, mobility, quadriceps girth size, stability, proprioception, skin sensation, bone
      mineral density and functional status.

      Subjects to be operated for ACL reconstruction and meeting the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be recruited. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the three surgical groups
      by block randomization. Demographic information, parameters in recovery domain, functional
      domain and stability domain, isokinetic test, motion analysis domain, proprioception and
      radiographical measurements will be made at baseline and at day 1, week 2, week 4, week 8,
      month 3, month 5, 1 year and 2 years post-surgery. The effect of different surgical
      techniques and time on the different outcomes will be analysed by 2-way ANOVA.
