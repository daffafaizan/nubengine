      sclerosis (ALS). The commercially available dosage form is a 50mg oral tablet. This expanded
      access protocol (EAP) is designed to provide access to a dissolving tablet formulation of
      riluzole designed for sublingual (SL) administration, in patients with ALS who, in the
      opinion and clinical judgement of the treating physician, would benefit from treatment with
      BHV-0223.
