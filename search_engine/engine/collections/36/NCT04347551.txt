      motor performance of participants with and without chronic neck pain.

      The objective of this pre/post design study is to apply spinal manipulation of the cervical
      spine to participants with chronic neck pain and participants who are asymptomatic for neck
      pain, and to measure the subsequent changes of movement time of the eyes during an eye
      movement Fitts' task using eye-tracker technology.

      This study will also include a head movement Fitts' task, which has been previously shown to
      identify a reduction in head movement time in participants after receiving cervical spine
      manipulation. The head movement task, which has a biomechanical basis, will serve as a
      comparator to the eye movement task, which has a neurophysiologic basis. Changes in head and
      eye movement time are both measures of motor performance.

      The hypothesis for the eye movement Fitts' task, is that the eye movement time will be
      increase with larger distances between targets and will not be affected by changes in target
      width. It is anticipated that the eye movement time will reduce in the neck pain group
      following spinal manipulation in comparison to the asymptomatic group. We hypothesize that
      during the head movement task, symptomatic participants will experience a decrease in head
      movement time as compared to the asymptomatic group after spinal manipulation. We further
      hypothesize that head movement time will be increase with larger target distances and smaller
      target widths.
