      Furthermore, variability in the international guidelines regarding the choice of first line
      uterotonic in prevention of PPH adds to the confusion. With the widespread availability of
      carbetocin in some developed countries, including Canada, the question of which uterotonic to
      adopt and at which dose becomes even more difficult to ascertain. Studies that have currently
      been published suggest the ED90 doses of carbetocin and oxytocin provide adequate uterine
      contraction with possibly fewer side effects associated with the lower dose regimens. There
      is evidence to suggest that lower doses of both carbetocin provide equivalent uterine
      contractions with a better side effect profile in patients with a singleton pregnancy.
      However, there is no clinical dosing data specifically for patients with twin pregnancy. The
      results of our study will provide guidance to obstetric and anesthetic providers worldwide
      when deciding what dose of carbetocin to use in women with twin pregnancy.
