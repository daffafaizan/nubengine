      how the blood vessel is affected.

      A central role in the mechanism that defines the nature of vessel remodelling is played by
      endothelial cells. EC's are extremely sensitive to the frictional forces exerted on a unit of
      the endothelial area by blood flow. This mechanical stimulus is known as wall shear stress
      (WSS). WSS experienced by EC's in-vivo is unsteady due to the unsteady nature of blood flow
      produced during the cardiac cycle and due to the complex nature of the vascular tree.

      The extent to which this applies to venous cells and tissue remains unknown and it is the
      focus of this study.
