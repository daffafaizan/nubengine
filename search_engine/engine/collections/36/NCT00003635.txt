      lymphocytic leukemia refractory to fludarabine and alkylator therapy. II. Determine the
      safety (including incidence of infection) of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of 506U78 and ara-G, and assess the intracellular pharmacokinetics of
      ara-GTP in patients receiving multiple treatment courses (at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
      only). IV. Determine the response rate, time to maximal response, and duration of response in
      patients treated with this drug. V. Determine two-year survival and progression-free survival
      of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cellular type of
      disease (B cell vs T cell). Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 2
      months for 2 years until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
