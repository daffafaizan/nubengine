      to investigate the efficiency and tolerance of high volumes of HS integrated with chest
      physiotherapy.

      HS was given twice daily with volumes of 4,5 ml in children aged 0-5 years, 6 ml at age 6-16
      years and 9 ml at age > 16 years. The protocol included guidance of standardized breathing
      pattern, upright and sideways positioning and voluntary cough.
