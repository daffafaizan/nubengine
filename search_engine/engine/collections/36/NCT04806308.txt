      otolaryngology attending physicians, residents, and fellows, as well as Children's
      otolaryngology faculties. Pre-survey will be sent prior to the intervention to obtain
      background information and baseline ergonomic assessment conducted by physical therapy
      students. Interventions will include intra-operative stretch breaks that will be implemented
      by surgeons at their convenient time during the surgery. Post-survey will be sent out to
      obtain the subjects' experiences after each intervention.

      Each survey will be sent via email using a secured third-party vendor, RedCap. Results will
      be retrieved only by the research assistants listed on the institutional review board (IRB).
      The survey will not ask for any identifying information and will not publish identifying
      information. The raw data will be analyzed by the PI and research assistant for publication.
      The study should take less than a year for data collection and analysis.
