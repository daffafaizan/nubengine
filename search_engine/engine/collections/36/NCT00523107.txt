      who are under standard palliative care at hospice setting and have no further curative
      options available. Only patients who give consent to participate in this study and meet all
      other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into this study. All
      patients will continue the standard palliative care (SPC) during this study.

      The main aim of this trial is to compare improvement of patient's fatigue status between
      patients with or without PG2 treatment. Patient's fatigue status will be assessed by the
      Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese (BFI-T) Form. Each patient's fatigue improvement response
      will be defined as an improvement in the mean fatigue scores by at least 10% from baseline.
      Other quality of life parameters will be measured by the 11 questions (SS11) of the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and by Karnofsky performance scale. Patient's weight change and its related
      c-reactive protein will be followed. There are two study arms in this trial: 1) the PG2 plus
      SPC arm; and 2) the Placebo plus SPC arm.
