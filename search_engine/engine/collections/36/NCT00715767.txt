    
      Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 16 million people die
      from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for more than one-third of global deaths.
      Almost half of these deaths take place in hospitalized settings. Standard acute medicine
      education programs have had limited success in training hospital based healthcare providers
      to acquire, retain, and transfer knowledge and skills to impact patient outcomes in both
      developed and developing countries. There is a gap between the cognitive knowledge and
      critical thinking skills attained during courses and the technical and team skills actually
      performed by hospital-based healthcare providers. This gap between existing knowledge and
      performed skills restricts care delivery, underutilizes available resources, and contributes
      to the number of preventable deaths. This gap is further accentuated in resource limited
      settings, where barriers to implementation of successful acute medicine training programs are
      often accentuated.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine selected cognitive knowledge and critical thinking skills which are
      associated with technical and team skills performance assessed immediately following Basic
      Life Support (BLS) for Health Care Providers course training.

      Secondary Objectives:

      1. To identify cultural, healthcare environment and educational barriers that currently
      impede acquisition, retention, and transfer of knowledge and skills in acute medicine
      educational programs in resource limited settings.
