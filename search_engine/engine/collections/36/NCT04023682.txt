      of anesthesia providers' hands just before the start of their first case of the day (n =25).
      The participants will then rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium. The
      investigators will also obtain cultures after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after
      the second case (n = 25). During the intervention period (ProvodineTM; usual hand hygiene
      practice), the investigators obtain hand cultures from the same anesthesia providers at the
      beginning of the day (n =25). The participants will then then do a hand scrub with
      ProvodineTM. The investigators will obtain a second hand culture at this point and
      participants will rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium and then apply a
      small amount of ProvodineTM as a hand rub (n =25). The investigators will obtain cultures
      after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after the second case of the day (n = 25). If
      participants are still providing anesthesia to their second case 6 hours after they applied
      ProvodineTM, the participants will apply a small of ProvodineTM amount as a hand rub at this
      time. For anesthesia providers in the ASC, the investigators will use the same protocol with
      the following exception. Because cases are likely to be shorter, the investigators will
      obtain the final cultures after the last case of the day or after the case that ends closest
      to 6 hours after ProvodineTM was applied in the morning.

      The study procedures will occur on two different work days for the participants: one for the
      control day and one for the intervention day. The study procedures will be done by the end of
      these two working days. There is no long-term followup.
