      studies. Extensive nonclinical data indicates both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity
      via selective SphK2 inhibition which may prove beneficial for treating COVID-19 infection and
      resulting pneumonia. This proof of concept study will take place in the US and other
      countries and will enroll about 40 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection
      who have developed pneumonia and require supplemental oxygen. Half of the patients, i.e. 20
      patients, will receive opaganib in addition to standard of care for 14 days. The other 20
      will receive matching placebo (capsules that do not contain the medication) in addition to
      standard of care. Study drug will be administered every day for 14 days, twice each day,
      unless the patient has been discharged from the hospital without requiring supplemental
      oxygen, in which case study drug will only be administered for 10 days. All participants will
      be followed up for 4 weeks after their last dose of study drug.
