      microbiota. These infections can exacerbate pregnancy complications and increase the risk of
      preeclampsia and preterm birth. The present study aims to evaluate the potential effects of
      perinatal use of probiotics on the number of diagnosed viral, bacterial and fungal infections
      in pregnant women and on the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. Potential infections include
      but are not limited to influenza/colds, bacterial vaginosis, mastitis, candidiasis, urinary
      tract infection and gingivitis. Additionally, the benefits of probiotic intake by the mother
      on the infant during pregnancy and breastfeeding will be evaluated.
