      Application of WiCare Wound Pump to a standard gauze dressing will result in faster time to
      definitive wound closure and rate of healing in acute wounds from trauma, infection, or
      surgery as compared to standard gauze dressing without negative pressure.

      Study Design A. Single center prospective trial to be conducted at Mbingo Baptist Hospital
      (MBH) a multispecialty hospital located in North-West Cameroon that provides complex surgical
      care.

      B. Phase II C. Two arm trial with all patients with eligible wounds offered entrance into
      Phase II trial D. Blinding: Non E. Indication and patient population: Acute wounds secondary
      to trauma, infection, or surgical excision in adult patients (>15 year old) F. Sample size:
      100 total; based on Schoenfeld's Method to compare two-sample Log-Rank Test with Power of
      80%, significance level=5% G. Random Permuted Blocks: Patients will be randomized in blocks
      of 4 using the following schema Treatment A) WiCare, Treatment B) Standard Dressing: AABB,
      ABAB, BAAB, BABA, BBAA, and ABBA.
