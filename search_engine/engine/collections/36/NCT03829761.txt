      intensive outpatient (IOP) treatment programs and randomized to treatment with either
      inhibitory 1Hz rTMS to cerebellar vermis given daily for 2 weeks (total of 10 sessions) or
      sham. Alcohol use outcomes, self-reported negative affect, and craving will be obtained at
      baseline, 1 day, 1 week and 6 weeks following rTMS termination. An fMRI scan during a Stroop
      task will be obtained at baseline and 1 day after the final rTMS session.
