      Cartilage tissue is acquired from the Non-weight-bearing area of patients. chondrocyte are
      isolated and grown in culture for 6-8 weeks. After this time interval, the cells are
      reprocessed and the cell sheet is obtained. Implantation of the chondrocyte sheet into the
      Cartilage defect of the keen.The patients will be assessed clinically with scoring systems
      preoperatively as well as 24 months postoperatively to assess relief of symptoms and joint
      function. Radiological assessment (MRIs)of the affected joints will be performed at the same
      time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed cartilage. Second look
      arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess the repair tissue and
      grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International Cartilage Repair
      Society guidelines.
