    
      A non-interventional, observational program to assess the effects of oral dydrogesterone
      therapy in a post-marketing setting whether the effects are related to the regimen of
      dydrogesterone therapy. In this observational program, assuming that dydrogesterone plays a
      role in the treatment of endometriosis without suppression of ovulation, the goal is to
      observe the possible implications of such treatment in terms of treatment regimen and
      response pattern. In the study will be described effects of DuphastonÂ®
      6-months-administration in patients with confirmed endometriosis by assessing pain relief,
      quality of life, need of self-medication with analgesics, etc.
