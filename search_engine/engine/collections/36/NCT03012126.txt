      intervention (PWMI): 1)a Healthy Weight Clinic based at a federally-qualified health center
      (FQHC), or 2) a modified Healthy Weight and Your Child intervention delivered in YMCAs. A
      comparison sample of children receiving care in eight demographically similar FQHCs serve as
      a comparison group.
