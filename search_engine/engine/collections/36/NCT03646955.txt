      breast conserving surgery for an early breast cancer to lower the risk of local and distant
      failures. However, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the gain from RT in selected
      low risk patients is low. RT may cause acute and late side effects, and some of these may be
      serious to the patient. Therefore, there is a need to tailor RT utilization to the individual
      recurrence risk and try identify patients who are unlikely to gain much risk reduction from
      RT, because those patients can then omit RT and thereby avoid late effects and
      over-treatment. At the present time there is no consensus as to define the selection criteria
      for patients who may omit RT.

      Based on early results from the randomized DBCG RT PBI trial, external beam 40 Gy/15 fr
      partial breast irradiation (PBI) has been standard in Denmark since April 2016 for selected
      low risk breast cancer patients. Based on results from the UK IMPORT LOW trial, the 5 yr
      local recurrence risk using this technique for PBI is 0.5%, whilst 2% for developing a new
      contralateral breast cancer.

      This trial will investigate if PBI can safely be omitted in selected low risk breast cancer
      patients without causing unacceptable high risk of local failure.
