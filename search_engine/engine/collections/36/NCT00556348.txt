      age-related macular degeneration who were treated with at least two (initial and one month
      after) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab and had a follow-up of at least 2
      months. Patients underwent Snellen visual acuity testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      imaging and ophthalmoscopic examination at baseline and follow-up visits.
