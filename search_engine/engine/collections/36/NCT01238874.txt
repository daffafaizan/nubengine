      Therapy (CRT), in both pacing and defibrillation devices across Latin America. The primary
      objective will focus on changes in left ventricular heart size and function measurements in
      subjects receiving CRT therapy. The following additional parameters will also be collected:

        -  Data on referral patterns in Latin America;

        -  Data on device implant (including delivery system, device information, and lead
           information);

        -  Clinical data on subject outcomes and changes (improved, unchanged, or worsened) in
           heart failure status as assessed by heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, New York Heart
           Association (NYHA) class, mortality, and Quality of Life (QOL) measured by the Patient
           Global Assessment;
