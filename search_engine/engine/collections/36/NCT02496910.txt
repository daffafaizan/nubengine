      reference twynsta and Hygroton co-administered in two groups enrolling healthy adult male
      subjects under fasting conditions.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic in the evening before Day 1. All subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of YH22162 FDC or twynsta and Hygroton co-administered in the
      morning on Day 1. All the subjects will remain in the clinical unit until completion of all
      assessments on Day 2 including collection post-dose PK sample. Subjects will return to the
      clinic for pharmacokinetic samples at scheduled time. The two treatment periods will be
      separated by a washout period.
