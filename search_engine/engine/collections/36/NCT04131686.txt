      12 medical institutions in Korea that meet the inclusion criteria are cluster-randomized
      (test sites : control sites =1:1). Information about randomization is disclosed to both
      investigators and subjects. This means both study center investigators and subjects will be
      aware of the purpose of this study as well as the result of randomization (whether the
      subjects will receive NAC inhalation or not) from the beginning of the study.

      Investigators shall obtain voluntary consent for participation in this research from patients
      who visit their medical institutions with symptomatic acute rhinosinusitis within the study
      duration. Patients who provided a written consent for the use of their personal information
      and who satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given a study enrollment number and
      available data on these patients will be collected among the predefined study relevant data
      in the case reports until Day 14 (Â±3 days) from the starting day of treatment.

      Statistical Analysis Methods (Analysis of primary endpoints) :

      Obtain descriptive statistics (average, standard deviation, median, minimum, quartile, and
      maximum) for the change in the total score of the investigator's symptomatic severity
      assessment by treatment group on Day 14 compared with each time point and baseline (Day 0).
      Paired t-test shall be used to check intra-group change difference and Two sample t-test
      shall be used to check inter-group change difference.
