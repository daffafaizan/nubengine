      15minutes by a trained resident in psychiatry as the only interviewer. The interviewer didn't
      participate in patient's medical care nor in the follow-up interventions. The interviewer
      didn't look in patients file before conducted over the phone interviews and had only
      administrative information on the study subjects: first and last name, age, sex, phone
      number. The phone call interview wasn't considered as an intervention. Whenever the
      interviewer judged necessary that a patient needed more intensive treatment, the relevant
      referral to help was done.
