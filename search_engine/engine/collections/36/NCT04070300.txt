      program or serve as control and live as usual. At baseline study visit, study researchers
      will review medical records to collect various information, including the reason for needing
      an ICD, the type and settings of the ICD, medication use and medical history etc. All
      participants will undergo blood collection, complete a questionnaire to assess quality of
      life and undergo examination with echocardiography and ECG. The ICD will be programmed
      accordingly to international guidelines regarding ICD-therapy and optimal monitoring, before
      each participant complete an exercise treadmill test to determine VO2 peak. They will wear a
      Holter monitor to record heart activity 48 hours before the test and 24 hours after the test.
      All participants will then be observed for 2 months before being randomly assigned to either
      intervention or control. During this observation period, they will wear a fitness activity
      tracker wristband to evaluate degree of physical activity and a Holter monitor to register
      number of premature ventricular contractions. Participants taking part in the interval
      training group will perform aerobic interval training 4 x 4 minutes intervals, 3 times a week
      for 12 weeks (week 1-12), whereas participants taking part in the control group will carry on
      with usual daily life with no lifestyle recommendations. All participants will then undergo a
      new period of observation (week 13-20) and repeat the tests and examinations performed at
      baseline and during the observation period prior to intervention/control.
