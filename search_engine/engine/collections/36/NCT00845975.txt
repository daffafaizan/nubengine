      head in the absence of external stimuli. About 40-50 million people in the United States
      report experiencing tinnitus; 10-12 million have sought medical help for their tinnitus, with
      2.5 million reporting their tinnitus as debilitating. As a result of the distressing nature
      of tinnitus, it is often accompanied by anxiety, depression and sleep difficulties.

      Tinnitus is most often caused by sensorineural hearing loss due to presbyacusis (aging) or
      noise damage. It is believed that the tinnitus results when spurious neuro-electrical signals
      are produced by diseased, degenerated or damaged cochlear hair cells and interpreted by the
      brain as tinnitus.

      There is presently no cure for tinnitus. Current management strategies include using other
      external sounds to distract from the tinnitus, teaching relaxation and stress reduction
      techniques, and prescription medications to help ease stress, anxiety, depression and sleep
      difficulties. However, in general, current tinnitus management techniques are only minimally
      effective. It is believed that low level laser light therapy may offer a simple, non-invasive
      means of relieving the symptoms of tinnitus. In theory, low level laser light penetrates
      targeted tissues to stimulate the mitochondria in underlying cells to produce energy through
      the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In turn, the enhanced ATP fuels cellular
      energy and enhances blood flow to the cochlear hair cells (cilia) to assists in regulating
      the electrical signals disrupted by the diseased and/or degenerated cochlear hair cells. With
      the taming of the spurious electrical signals, the brain no longer has a basis to perceive
      the noise known as tinnitus.
