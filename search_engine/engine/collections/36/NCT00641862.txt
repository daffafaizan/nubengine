      high in India, and several lines of evidence suggest that maternal nutritional status may be
      an important factor. We have previously performed extensive evaluations of poor fetal and
      infant outcomes in other settings, and found that maternal micronutrient supplementation (B
      vitamins including vitamin B12, plus vitamins C and E) in HIV positive Tanzanian mothers
      decreased the risk of low birthweight (<2500 g) by 44% (RR (95% CI) 0.56 (0.38-0.82)), severe
      preterm birth (<34 weeks of gestation) by 39% (RR 0.61 (0.38-0.96)), and small size for
      gestational age at birth by 43% (RR 0.57 (0.39-0.82)). In a prospective cohort study of 410
      pregnant Indian women, we recently found a strong relationship between maternal serum vitamin
      B12 concentration and risk of infant intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Compared to
      women in the highest tertile of serum B12 concentration, women in the lowest tertile were
      significantly more likely to have IUGR infants, after controlling for maternal age, weight,
      education, and parity (OR (95% CI) 5.98 (1.72-20.74)). We now propose a randomized,
      double-blind trial among 300 pregnant Indian women in order to determine the effectiveness of
      vitamin B12 supplementation (50 Âµg daily) in improving maternal B12 status. Secondary aims
      for this exploratory trial include maternal hemoglobin, maternal weight gain during pregnancy
      and infant birthweight. All women will receive standard of prenatal obstetric care, including
      routine supplementation with iron and folate. The study will be a collaborative effort
      between the Division of Nutrition, St John's Research Institute, Bangalore, India, and the
      Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, US.
