    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I study of TAS-114 administered
      in combination with S-1, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary antitumor activity of the TAS-114/S-1 regimen in patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the
      MTD; and an Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy
      with the MTD. Patients will receive the study medication according to the proposed treatment
      schedule until disease progression (PD), occurrence of intolerable side effects, removal by
      the Investigator or withdrawal of consent. A patient is considered discontinued from study
      treatment when TAS-114 is discontinued.

      Male or female patients age 18 years or older with confirmed advanced solid tumor(s) for
      which no standard therapy exists.

      TAS-114/S-1 will be administered BID for 14 days followed by a 7-day recovery period, every
      21 days (1 cycle) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
