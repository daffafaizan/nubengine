      Pneumonia (CAP), including antibiotics and supportive care. Correction of hypoxemia will use
      standard low-flow oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive-ventilation or
      invasive ventilation with endotracheal tube, as required. Patients in the treatment group
      will receive intra-venous hydrocortisone. Patients of the control group will receive an
      intravenous placebo by intravenous route at the same frequency.

      Hydrocortisone or placebo will be given in a double-blind fashion for 8 or 14 full days. The
      intravenous route will be used. The treatment course will include 4 or 7 days of full dose
      (200 mg/day by continuous infusion), 2 or 4 days of half dose (100 mg/day by continuous
      infusion), and 2 or 3 days of tapering dose (50 mg/day by continuous infusion). Duration of
      treatment is chosen upon patient initial improvement.

      A substantial amendment to the CAPE COD study has been submitted to the Competent Authorities
      in order to conduct a specific analysis on the sub-group of patients included with COVID19
      (coronavirus disease 2019), in order to get a quick response in this specific population and
      in the context of an epidemic emergency.

      The aim is to answer as quickly as possible a therapeutic question of major importance in the
      treatment of severe respiratory infections with CoV-2 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2). Modifications made to the original study for patients with COVID (coronavirus
      disease) include some inclusion criteria, the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints.
