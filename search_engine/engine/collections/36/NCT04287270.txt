      adulthood, progressive, unexplained. Brain stem degeneration is thought to play a role in
      respiratory symptoms such as stridor, sleep-related respiratory disturbances and respiratory
      failure in MSA patients. Respiratory disorders were emphasized and evaluated in MSA during
      the studies. However, the pattern of pulmonary anomalies or the performance of the
      inspiratory muscles is not well defined in the MSA.

      Inspiratory muscle strength is assessed by voluntary or involuntary tests. The most commonly
      used reference values are the known maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) measurement
      for ease of use. In people with neuromuscular disease, the influence of the orofacial muscles
      can cause air leakage from the mouth. As a result, low values may be due to air escape which
      caused by true respiratory muscle weakness, submaximal effort or weakness of the facial
      muscles.

      The purpose of this study is; compare respiratory function parameters and respiratory muscle
      strength in patients with MSA compare to healthy controls, and to evaluate the results of
      SNIP and MIP in measuring inspiratory muscle strength in MSA patients.

      For this purpose; demographic information (sex, age, occupation, height, body weight ...),
      clinical and medical status, diagnosis date and Mini Mental Status Scale data of all
      participants will be recorded at the visit. Inspiratory muscle strength will be evaluated
      with sniff nasal inspiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory mouth pressure. Expiratory
      muscle strength will be evaluated with maximal expiratory mouth pressure (PEmax).
