      of 2 key steps: dietary restriction and purgative ingestion.Two liters of PEG-ELS are widely
      used in Asian countries, but in a well-designed clinical trialï¼Œadditional reduction of
      PEG-ELS volume seems feasible. Enteral nutrition may simplify the process and avoid
      unexpected intake of fiber-containing food.

      We hypothesized that dietary restriction with enteral nutrition prescribed could prevent
      nonadherence to dietary restrictions, enable additional reduction of the required volume of
      PEG-ELS.
