      (experimental), and routine IV start (control). Prior to knowing their group, all patients
      will answer the "Before Intravenous Catheterization" portion of the form in order to
      eliminate bias. After this portion is complete, their group (experimental vs control) will be
      determined from opening a blinded envelope.

      A tourniquet will be placed, followed by the Buzzy stimulation device (if in the experimental
      group). An alcohol swab will be used and then a 22 gauge IV catheter will be inserted,
      connected to fluids, and secured with tape. The antecubital fossa or the dorsal hand/wrist
      will be the only sites used in the study. All participants will fill out the post-insertion
      questions on the form and those patients that used the Buzzy system will then fill out the
      several specific questions related to the experimental group. This will conclude the
      patient's involvement in the study. The patient will then continue with treatment as planned.
      We will plan to exclude cases where the IV is not obtained on the first attempt, if a smaller
      or larger gauge IV catheter is required, or if an insertion site not listed above is
      required. The case will be excluded if adjunctive steps are taken to obtain IV access (i.e.
      Oral sedation, nitrous oxide, heat packs).
