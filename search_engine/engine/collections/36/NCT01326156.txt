    
      Isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis can be a disabling condition of the knee necessitating
      knee arthroplasty. It is debated whether total knee replacement or isolated patellofemoral
      replacement is the better treatment option. This randomized trial attempts to give a
      qualified answer to the debate by comparing clinical outcome (range of movement, stability,
      effusion, patellofemoral tracking, tenderness, stair climbing), patient self assessment
      scores (EQ-5D, Oxford Knee Score, KOOS, SF-36, AKS), complications (infections, revisions),
      longevity (survival analysis) and cost (direct and indirect) for the two implant types.

      The Avon patellofemoral implant has been chosen, as this is the patellofemoral implant with
      the best documentation. The PFC Sigma CR total knee implant has been chosen as it a current
      standard implant and market leader.
