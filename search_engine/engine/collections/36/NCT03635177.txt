      association with a myocardial infarct but less is known about the potential effects on
      vascular function in patients who have suffered a stroke. RIC is a procedure by which blood
      flow to a limb is repeatedly occluded during a short period by an inflatable cuff. This
      project evaluates the effect of a two week period with RIC on vascular function and cerebral
      blood flow velocity as well as on factors associated with blood clot formation in patients
      who have suffered a stroke. The study also aims to provide mechanistic insight into the
      beneficial effects of the RIC procedure.

      Subjects are patients who within the past five years have suffered from lacunar infarct. The
      study is of a cross-over design with two weeks of homebased RIC treatment and two weeks of
      control period in a randomized order. Before and after the experimental periods the subjects
      undergo a number of tests assessing general health status, vascular function and cerebral
      blood flow velocity. Skeletal muscle samples are obtained for the determination of selected
      proteins related to vascular function and angiogenesis and blood samples are obtained for the
      determination of platelet function.
