    
      This study is designed as a randomized, 2-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 8-hour
      postprandial crossover study, utilizing a multiple sampling paradigm to evaluate
      fermentability and potential health opportunities for glucose control of a dietary fiber
      (FCHO) in healthy non-obese men and women. The study will include 2 - 8 h assessments
      following consumption of the FCHO drink or a placebo drink and will follow with a 7 day
      feeding period to assess tolerability.
