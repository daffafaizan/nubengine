      a study group based on when they join this study. Up to 8 groups of up to 20 participants
      will be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 3 groups of up to 24 participants will be
      enrolled in Phase 2.

      If participant is enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of HA121-28 tablets they receive will depend
      on when they join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose
      level of HA121-28 tablets. Each new group will receive a higher dose of HA121-28 tablets than
      the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the
      highest tolerable dose of HA121-28 tablets is found. If participant is enrolled in Phase 2,
      they will receive HA121-28 tablets at the low, medium and high doses to select the
      recommended dose for phase â…¡ clinical trials.
