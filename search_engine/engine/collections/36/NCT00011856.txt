      which more than one person has had a known cerebral aneurysm will be studied. Family
      histories will be obtained and participants identified who are willing to come to the NIH
      Clinical Center for an MRAngiograph and venipuncture. DNA will be isolated and linkage
      studies undertaken to identify loci involved in the etiology of familial cerebral aneurysms,
      using standard linkage approaches.
