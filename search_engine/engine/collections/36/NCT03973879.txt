    
      The purpose of this phase1b/2 study of atezolizumab in combination with oncolytic
      polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in patients with recurrent World Health Organization
      (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is to assess the safety of the combination of PVSRIPO +
      atezolizumab, as well as describe the survival of patients receiving this novel therapy
      combination. Patients will receive an intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO followed by
      atezolizumab treatment with possible surgical resection after the first atezolizumab
      treatment at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.
