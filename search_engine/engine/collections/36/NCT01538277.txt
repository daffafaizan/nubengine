    
      A randomized controlled study comparing pulmonary vein antrum isolation with and without the
      knowledge of the real-time contact force. In both groups, a catheter, which is able to
      measure contact force (SmartTouch, ThermoCool catheter, Biosense Webster) will be used. In
      the control group, the operator will be blinded to the measured contact-force. In all
      patients, the ablation will be guided by a circumferential mapping catheter (Lasso, Biosense
      Webster), CARTO 3 mapping system and ablation of adenosine-induced reconnection will be
      performed in all patients. Follow-up will be performed by continuous monitoring using an
      implantable loop recorder (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn)
