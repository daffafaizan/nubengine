    
      Objective:

        -  The objective is, in patients with T3 clinically resectable carcinoma of the rectum, to
           demonstrate that the local recurrence rate in patients treated with a long course (LC)
           of pre-operative radiotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU is lower than that in
           patients treated with a short course (SC) of pre-operative radiotherapy with early
           surgery

      Eligibility Criteria:

        -  The main eligibility criteria are that the patient has clinically resectable
           adenocarcinoma of the rectum, a clinical stage T3 tumour whose lower border is within 12
           cm of the anal verge, and no evidence of distant metastases.

      Endpoints:

        -  Primary endpoint is local recurrence.

        -  Secondary endpoints are overall survival, toxicity, abdminoperineal resection rate,
           quality of life.

      Treatment arms:

        -  SC arm: Radiotherapy (RT) 25 Gy in 5 fr in 1 week to be followed by surgery within 1
           week and 6 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy 5FU/Folinic acid.

        -  LC arm: RT 50.4 Gy in 28 fr in 5Â½weeks with 5FU 225 mg/m2/day throughout the course of
           RT, to be followed by surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of RT. 4 cycles of adjuvant
           5FU/Folinic acid will be given.
