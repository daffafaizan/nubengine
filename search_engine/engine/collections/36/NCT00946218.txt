      drawn from subjects in El Salvador to be tested in an effort to improve detection and test
      sensitivity and specificity of a dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, dengue NS1 Ag STRIP, and clinical
      suspicion for the detection of dengue virus infection in children in San Salvador, El
      Salvador compared to the gold standard, PCR. This protocol will also seek to identify and
      compare gene transcription patterns characteristics of each dengue virus disease phenotype in
      children.
