      treatment outcomes. Parents will provide their written agreement to upload their child's data
      in the study electronic CRF.

      Easypod™ is an electromechanical device that delivers growth hormone and also records
      injections' date and time. Adherence data will be primarily derived from injections recorded
      in the Easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome measures (i.e. height &
      weight). This will allow the establishment of adherence profiles and evaluate the link with
      subsequent clinical outcomes.

      Since this is an observational study, there will be no study-specific clinical interventions
      and subjects will be treated according to the clinical and laboratory findings as routinely
      evaluated by the physician. Auxological and laboratory data will be reported prospectively
      throughout the duration of the study. At baseline, available data can be recorded
      retrospectively from the subjects' medical file and Easypod™ device Data will be collected
      retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the establishment of adherence profiles
      and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also analyzed in a multinational
      pooled analysis of comparable national studies.

      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving Saizen® via Easypod™

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving Saizen®
           via Easypod™

        -  To identify adherence subject profiling

        -  To asses the Impact of adherence on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) ranges/levels
