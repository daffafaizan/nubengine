      Primary

        -  Compare cognitive function in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have received
           5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen vs letrozole on protocol IBCSG-1-98.

      Secondary

        -  Compare cognitive function in patients who have received a single hormonal therapy for 5
           years vs those who have received that same hormonal therapy for 3 years, having
           previously received an alternate hormonal therapy for 2 years.

        -  Compare improvement in cognitive function 1 year after cessation of adjuvant hormonal
           therapy.

        -  Compare changes in cognitive function in patients who have received prior adjuvant
           chemotherapy vs those who have not received adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the relationship between objective and subjective measures of cognitive function,
           including specific cognitive domains.

        -  Assess the relationship between cognitive function and psychological distress, fatigue,
           and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cognitive function testing and complete self-reported questionnaires
      regarding cognitive ability, quality of life, fatigue, and psychosocial status during the
      fifth year of adjuvant hormonal therapy on protocol IBCSG-1-98 and then during the sixth
      year* (post randomization on protocol IBCSG-1-98) (i.e., after completion of adjuvant
      hormonal therapy).

      NOTE: *Patients who receive extended letrozole, hormone replacement therapy, or other
      endocrine therapy beyond 5 years do not undergo the 6-year assessment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 148 patients will be accrued for this study.
