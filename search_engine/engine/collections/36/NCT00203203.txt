      mononuclear stem cells in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. The study hypothesis is that
      transendocardial injections of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells in patients with
      end-stage ischemic heart disease is safe, can promote neovascularization, and can improve
      perfusion and myocardial contractility. The primary object of this study will be to evaluate
      the safety of autologous-bone-marrow mononuclear cell injections. The secondary endpoint of
      the study is to assess the efficacy of autologous bone marrow cells in improving cardiac
      contractile function and functional outcome. The efficacy will be assessed on the basis of
      the treadmill Max VO2 (maximum volume oxygen uptake). Secondarily the efficacy will be
      assessed on the basis of clinical status and imaging rests, with follow-up extending to 1
      year after enrollment.A maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled in the study. At the end of
      the 6-month visit. after the required angiogram with mapping and non-invasive testing is
      complete, the patients will be told whether they were in the control or the active group
      (stem cell therapy). Those in the control group will be told before final invasive testing,
      and those who consent may cross over to the active therapy arm and undergo the cell injection
      procedure (control, then stem cell therapy. In these patients, the foll-up angiogram and
      mapping procedure will also serve as the baseline procedure required for cell injection. Bone
      marrow mononuclear cells will be injected in an identical fashion, according to the same
      criteria described for the original treatment group, and these patients will have identical
      follow-up visits starting again at the baseline time-point and extending for up to 1 year.
