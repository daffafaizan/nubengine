      the airways as determined in sputum) after inhalation of CCRE (20,000 EU), shown in previous
      studies of healthy, nonsmoking volunteers as well as in a limited number of otherwise healthy
      smokers to be well tolerated. This dose induces measurable increases in neutrophil content of
      induced sputum that can be employed to screen large populations for susceptibility to the
      inflammatory effect of inhaled endotoxin. Limitations of the understanding of actions of
      inflammatory stimuli on airway function are likely due to the fact that functional
      assessments of dynamic airway response /in vivo/ have generally been limited to those based
      on spirometry and examination of airway samples for assessment of cells and mediator content.
      Slowing of mucociliary clearance (MCC), a key component of airway defense, can be induced by
      inflammation and almost certainly contribute to mucus plugging and decreased clearance of
      inhaled irritants. Measures of mucociliary clearance (MCC), by inhalation of radiolabeled
      particles to label airway surface liquid, suggest that clearance of secretions is impaired to
      a mild degree in smokers and more severely in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations.
