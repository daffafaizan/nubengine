    
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort phase II study, to evaluate the immunological
      effectiveness and safety of adjuvant Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination. The evaluation of
      immunological efficacy will be expressed as the number of patients who show enhancement of
      the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel of associated
      antigens for each disease (HNSCC, NET and STS). To avoid unacceptable toxicity, a formal
      safety analysis will be conducted after six patients have been observed (two for each
      disease) for at least 30 days after the third treatment cycle. If two or more patients have
      experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, enrollment will be definitively stopped;
      differently, other 15 patients for each disease will be enrolled and evaluation of primary
      objectives will be done for each cohort separately (H&N, STS and NET).
