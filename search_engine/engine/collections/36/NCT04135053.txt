      methodology previously used in another UK-based human challenge experiments. The research to
      be conducted in this study will inform the study team whether intranasal inoculation of
      reconstituted lyophilised Nlac (hereafter, lyoNlac), can result in immunising colonisation of
      participants and the optimal dose to achieve this.

      Previous challenges have been conducted using frozen stocks of Nlac but this is relatively
      unsatisfactory because of instability of frozen stocks, and will not be practical in Mali.
      The facility to reconstitute dry powdered lyoNlac into water and inoculate as a nose drop
      will greatly simplify the experimental method. However, it is not known whether lyoNlac can
      be inoculated directly into volunteers and induce successful colonisation.

      In summary this is a pilot study of the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the intranasal
      inoculation of healthy human volunteers with lyoNlac. This study will determine the efficacy
      of lyoNlac as an agent for inducing nasopharyngeal colonisation with this organism, which is
      an important methodological development for ease of administration of Nlac in experimental
      human challenge studies. The study team will aim to determine the dose of inoculum required
      to induce colonisation in 80% of volunteers (the Standard Inoculum or SI). This SI will be
      used in future studies aiming to optimise duration of colonisation and immunogenicity induced
      by lyoNlac.
