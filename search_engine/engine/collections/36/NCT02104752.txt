      a pharmacokinetic profile expected to exert biological effects. Specifically, 36 subjects
      will be enrolled in the double-blind randomized controlled trial. They will be randomized to
      curcumin or placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline, and 4 and 8 weeks, subjects will receive
      assessments of neurocognition (e.g., processing speed, attention and vigilance, working
      memory, learning, reasoning and problem solving), social cognition, EEG biomarkers (e.g.,
      visual cortical plasticity and mismatch negativity), a serum marker of neurogenesis (BDNF
      levels), and clinical symptoms (positive and negative symptoms). At weeks 2 and 6 subjects
      will return for additional safety (e.g., vitals, side effects, akathisia) and medication
      adherence assessments. Improvement on the primary outcome measure (MATRICS Consensus
      Cognitive Battery), as well as secondary outcome measures, will be compared between
      participants randomized to placebo versus curcumin. The results of this study will establish
      whether curcumin is a viable adjunctive agent for future larger clinical trials.
