      recruited in the study was calculated by the ACS NSQIP risk calculator and by POSSUM.

      In order to compare the performance of ACS NSQIP risk calculator with POSSUM, area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for each tool. The statistical
      differences between the two AUC curves were compared using P value. Calibration of the
      agreement between observed and predicted outcomes was tested using the Brier score. The Brier
      score ranges from 0 to 1. The closer the score is to 0, the more accurate is the risk
      prediction model.

      There is a need of validation of the ACS NSQIP risk calculator in Spanish population which
      requires emergency (immediate and urgent) surgery. Besides, it is suggested that ACS NSQIP
      risk calculator performs better than POSSUM. Hence, its prediction performance is compared
      with POSSUM.
