    
      Specific Objectives:

        1. To compare Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements of the illumination area under the RPE
           to expert manual measurements of areas of hypofluorescence typical of geographic atrophy
           in fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images.

        2. To describe the differences and similarities between Cirrus HD-OCT and fundus
           autofluorescence images of subjects with geographic atrophy secondary to dry age-related
           macular degeneration (AMD).

        3. To determine the clinical factors that affect the Cirrus HD-OCT automated measurements
           of the illumination area under the RPE.
