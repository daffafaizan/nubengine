      cohort of subjects undergoing cancer relate surgery at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto
      Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano.

      BEFORE SURGERY Subjects will be stratified before surgery according to the following three
      main clusters: 1) Systemic inflammation: baseline levels of C Reactive Protein; 2) Cancer
      staging: TNM will be taken into account, together with the type of cancer, previous radio or
      chemo therapy, and planned/performed surgical procedure; 3) Frailty: subjects will be
      stratified according to their overall status, taking into account elements of frailty.
      Co-existing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac heart failure, acute myocardial
      infarction, chronic obstructive disease/asthma, kidney or liver disease (past or present)
      will be considered. Functional status will be assessed by means of ASA, ECOG status and
      Possum scores. Frailty will be explored using the mFI and G8 score, the WHO scale, and
      considering age. Absolute BMI and loss of weight will be used to assess malnutrition.

      DURING SURGERY Duration and type of surgery, kind of anesthesia and intra-operative
      complications will be considered.

      AFTER SURGERY Hospital mortality, length of stay, and admission to intensive care will be
      considered as outcome measures. Major complications, such as myocardial infarction,
      arrhythmia, cardio circulatory arrest, shock, stroke, pulmonary embolism, kidney failure,
      delirium, pneumonia or SSI will also be considered.
