    
      Adalimumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in
      adult patients who are candidates for systemic treatment. There are currently several
      biosimilar drugs (Amgevita, Imraldi, Hyrimoz, Idacio, Hulio,â€¦) in addition to the reference
      product (Humira).

      The reduction in the cost of production of biosimilar drugs with respect to reference
      products has led to their replacement by biosimilar drugs in patients initiating biological
      therapy, but some centers are also switching to adalimumab biosimilar in patients who are
      controlled with original adalimumab (Humira).

      There are no actual clinical efficacy / safety data in our setting on the use of adalimumab
      biosimilars.

      There is also no evidence of maintenance response in patients who are switched from
      adalimumab (Humira) to biosimilar adalimumab in clinical practice.

      This retrospective study will collect demographic and disease data of the psoriasis patient
      treated with the different biosimilars of adalimumab, as well as their comorbidities,
      response to treatment, and safety. In this way, data will be available in usual clinical
      practice to improve the management of the patient with psoriasis treated with biosimilar
      drugs.
