      for food choices that improve LDL cholesterol levels. The information will contain
      motivational strategies, e.g. "It's great that you want to improve your blood lipids! What
      are your three main reasons that you want to improve your blood lipids? What food choices
      suit you? How low can you go?" Participants will receive a table of ten suggested healthy
      food choices and be instructed to mark for each day a certain food change has been made.

      The Control Group will receive similar advice and motivational strategies, with the one
      difference being the dietary advice, that will focus on Triglycerides instead of LDL
      cholesterol.
