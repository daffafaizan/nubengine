    
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib is being tested
      to treat people who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The study
      looked at anti-tumor activity in participants who received alisertib.

      The study enrolled 48 patients. Participants were categorized as per disease subtypes into
      five subtypes: Large B-Cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma,
      Burkitts lymphoma and aggressive T-Cell lymphoma (Note: There were no participants enrolled
      with Precursor B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma). Participants received:

      â€¢ Alisertib 50 mg BID on Days 1 to 7

      All participants took alisertib capsules approximately every 12 hours each day for 7 days
      followed by a 14-day rest period in a 21-days cycle. MLN8237 was supplied in capsules of 5 or
      25 mg strength.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study was until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable
      treatment-related toxicity. If the participant would derive benefit from continued alisertib
      treatment beyond 24 months, the Sponsor was consulted for approval of further treatment.
      Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, with imaging assessments every 12 weeks.
      Participants discontinuing treatment prior to disease progression continue with clinic
      visits, chemistry and hematology lab testing, and tumor assessments every 12 weeks up to 12
      months after last dose of study drug for follow-up assessments.
