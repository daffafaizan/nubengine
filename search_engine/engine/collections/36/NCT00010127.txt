        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of autologous dendritic cells transfected with
           autologous total tumor RNA in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the presence, frequency, and activation status of tumor specific and prostate
           specific antigen (PSA) specific cellular immune responses in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to PSA protein and other recall
           antigens in patients before and after being treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine clinical responses based on clinical and biochemical (PSA) response criteria
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine a platform for immunological treatment using dendritic-cell based tumor
           vaccines in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Tumor tissue and peripheral blood stem cells are collected from patients and cultured in
      vitro with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 7 days to produce dendritic cells
      (DC). Patients receive autologous DC transfected with autologous prostate carcinoma RNA
      intradermally once weekly on weeks 0-3 for a total of 4 doses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12; every 3 months for 9 months; and then
      annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
