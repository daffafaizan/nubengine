      will die of cardiovascular disease. Further, the risk for cardiovascular events is 2-3 fold
      higher than in the general population and increases with the severity of renal impairment
      [1]. Reasons for this accelerated atherosclerotic process are unclear. Recent evidence
      suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are critical to maintaining vascular
      integrity [2]. Patient populations with low circulating EPCs, including patients with kidney
      disease, have excess vascular disease burden. The hematopoietic cytokine, erythropoietin, is
      a key regulator of EPCs and is reduced in patients with kidney disease [3]. Therefore, we
      hypothesize that supplementation with the erythropoietin analog, darbepoetin, enhances EPC
      function leading to improvement in vascular repair mechanisms in patients with chronic (CKD).

      To begin to explore this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims.

        1. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on EPC number in patients with anemia related to
           CKD

        2. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on EPC function in patients with anemia related to
           CKD

        3. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on proangiogenic factors in patients with anemia
           related to CKD

      These studies will expand our understanding and potentially guide therapy aimed at reducing
      the excess cardiovascular disease burden in high risk populations.
