    
      This is a two-part, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study, in which adolescent subjects with schizophrenia will be enrolled. Overall, eligible
      subjects will be randomized in a pre-defined 1:1 ratio to NaBen速 or placebo.

      This study will be conducted in two parts:

      In Part 1 (Phase IIb) of the study, 76 subjects (~ 60% of the total planned subjects) will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio (NaBen速 or placebo), of which 38 subjects will be randomized to the
      NaBen速 group and 38 subjects to the placebo group. An interim analysis (IA) will be conducted
      after the randomization of the 76th subject in Part 1 of the study. The data will be analyzed
      after all enrolled subjects in Part 1 of the study complete Visit 5 (week 6) or are withdrawn
      from the study, whichever occurs first. The data from IA will be reviewed by an independent
      Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) that will be responsible for the review of the
      data from the Part 1 (Phase IIb) of the study for both safety and the effectiveness.

      In Part 2 (Phase III) of the study, a total of 50 subjects will be randomized, of which 25
      subjects will be randomized to the NaBen速 group and 25 subjects to the placebo group. The
      final subject numbers in the study will depend on the sample size re-estimation after Part 1
      of the study.
