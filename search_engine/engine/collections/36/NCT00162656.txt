    
      Group B: Randomized trial with factorial design. The 4 treatment arms are standard LMB89
      therapy B, reduction of cyclophosphamide (CPM) in COPADM2, deletion of COPADM3, both
      reduction and deletion. Randomization occurs following COPADM1 and is stratified for national
      group, histology (large cell; small non cleaved cell) and stage (Murphy I orII; Murphy
      III+LDH<2N; Murphy III+LDH>2N or Murphy IV).

      The primary analysis questions are whether reducing CPM dose in COPADM2 results in a smaller
      long-term EFS whether omitting COPADM3 results in a smaller long-term EFS

      Group C: Randomized trial. The 2 treatment arms are standard LMB89 therapy C versus reduction
      of CYVE + deletion of the last 3 maintenance courses. Randomization occurs following COPADM2
      and is stratified for national group, histology (large cell; small non cleaved cell) and CNS
      disease.

      The primary analysis question is whether reducing CYVE and omitting the last 3 maintenance
      courses result in a smaller long-term EFS than standard LMB 89 treatment C
