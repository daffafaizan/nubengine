      activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation
      of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell
      regulatory signaling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of cryoablation combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.
