      risk stratifying patients for cardiac risk prior to major non-cardiac surgery, the current
      clinical practice utilized for assessing patients being evaluated for kidney or pancreas
      transplantation is both a stress echocardiogram and a coronary angiogram. This gap in opinion
      appears to be a concern on the part of both nephrologists, endocrinologists, and surgeons
      that the stress echocardiogram may miss significant angiographic disease that could result in
      major post-operative complications in this high-risk subgroup of patients (unstable angina,
      non-fatal infarction, or death).
