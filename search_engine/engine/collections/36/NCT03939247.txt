      lateral elbow tendinopathy.

      60 patients will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups:

        -  "Conventional physiotherapy treatment (CPT)" (massage, eccentric exercises by means of
           an isokinetic dynamometer, stretching);

        -  "CPT + Tecare" (idem CPT group + Tecaretherapy during the eccentric exercises)

        -  "CPT + Placebo Tecare" (idem "CPT + Tecare" group but with an inactive "Tecare" device)
           The treatment will include 18 30-minute sessions.

      The "Tecaretherapy" consists in using a specific device providing high frequencies (between
      300 kHz and 1 MHz) supposed to accelerate the tissues healing process.

      Outcome sessions will be organized at baseline, after the first 9 sessions, at the end of the
      treatment as well as 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment session.
