      respiratory function, diaphragm bioelectrical activity, cerebral oxygenation and selected
      vital signs in premature neonates with respiratory failure. 23 neonates â‰¤32 weeks gestational
      age (GA) were enrolled in the study. Patients were eligible for inclusion when ventilated due
      to respiratory failure, and in group 1 (n=12) on NIV as primary modality with oxygen
      requirement of 0.25-0.4 in the first 72 hours of life, or in group 2 (n=11) ready to extubate
      according to the given criteria. Newborns were ventilated with NIV NAVA and standard
      breathing gas (air-oxygen) at baseline. Heliox was introduced for 3 hours, followed by 3
      hours of air-oxygen. NAVA level was kept constant and pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2)
      kept in range of 90-95%. Recorded parameters included heart rate (HR), SpO2 and cerebral
      tissue oxygenation (StO2). Selected ventilation parameters: peak inspiratory pressure (PIP),
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), mean airway pressure (MAP), air leakage during NIV,
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) as well as electrical activity of the diaphragm (EaDI
      mean, minimum and maximum) were also acquired. Blood gas analysis was performed in each
      period of the study. Statistical analysis was completed with ANOVA Friedman's test and
      single-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance.
