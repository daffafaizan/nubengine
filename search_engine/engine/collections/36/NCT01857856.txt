      right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) patients carry a single (founder) mutation in the
      gene encoding Phospholamban, PLN R14del. Analogous to other inherited cardiomyopathies, the
      natural course of the disease is age-related ("age-related penetrance"); after a
      presymptomatic phase of variable length many PLN R14del-carriers progress to overt disease,
      and are diagnosed with either DCM or ARVC. PLN is a regulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
      Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) pump in cardiac muscle and thereby important for maintaining Ca2+
      homeostasis. Cardiac fibrosis appears to be an early manifestation of disease. The
      investigators hypothesize that treatment of presymptomatic PLN R14del-carriers with
      eplerenone, which by virtue of its mineralocorticoid(aldosterone)-blocking properties is a
      strong antifibrotic agent, reduces disease progression and postpones onset of overt disease.
