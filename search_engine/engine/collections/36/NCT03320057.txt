      providers. The Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requires that Mifeprex Â® (
      mifepristone) be dispensed only from a doctor's office, clinic or hospital (not from a
      pharmacy by prescription) by a certified health care provider and the health care provider
      must obtained a signed Patient Agreement Form before dispensing mifepristone. Data are needed
      to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of pharmacy dispensing of
      mifepristone. In order to address the study question, a mixed methods study design is
      appropriate. To assess feasibility, the study will collect data on pharmacists' satisfaction
      with dispensing mifepristone. To assess acceptability, qualitative data will be collected
      from pharmacists about their perspectives on dispensing Mifeprex before and after the study,
      as well as measure patient satisfaction through open-ended and close-ended survey questions.
      To assess effectiveness of the pharmacy dispensing model, the study will evaluate clinical
      outcomes from electronic health records. The proposed feasibility study would take place at
      sites in California and Washington states.
