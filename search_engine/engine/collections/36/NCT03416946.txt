    
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to have their knee
      implanted using either the patient-specific custom cutting blocks or the regular
      instrumentation system. Functional and radiographic outcomes will be assessed in a blinded
      fashion. The Smith and Nephew Legion PrimaryÂ® total knee system will be used in both groups;
      this is an implant with a good long term track record based on the Genesis II design. All
      surgeons have used and are familiar with the regular instrumentation. They will be instructed
      in the use of the patient-specific custom cutting blocks prior to study initiation.
