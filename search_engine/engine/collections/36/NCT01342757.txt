      I. To evaluate the strength of the association between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      imaging measurable biomarkers and response to vorinostat plus temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate MRS-detected inositol and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels (at 3 tesla) as
      indicators of mood alterations as measured by a self-report depression survey (IDS-SR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 (course 1 only) and
      days 8-14 and 22-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients previously treated with
      standard radiotherapy and temozolomide receive maintenance temozolomide PO on days 1-5.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicities. Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and at
      approximately 1 and 8 weeks on treatment. Patients also undergo an Inventory of Depression
      Symptomatology Self-Reported (IDS-SR) assessment at baseline and periodically during study.
