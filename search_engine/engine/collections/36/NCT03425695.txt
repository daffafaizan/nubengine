      healing period are important concerns. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of
      low level laser therapy (LLLT) in terms of enhancing wound healing, reducing graft shrinkage
      and postoperative pain.

      Methods: Thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive either FGG+ LLLT (test, n = 15) or
      FGG + placebo LLLT (control, n = 15). In the test group, a diode laser
      (aluminum-gallium-arsenide, 810 nm, 0.1 W, continuous mode, time of irradiation:60 s, energy
      density: 6 J/cm2, spot size:0.5 cm) was applied immediately after the FGG surgery and 1,3,7,
      and 14 days later. The control group received the same sequence of irradiation with the
      laser-off. Comparison of the graft surface areas between groups at 1st, 3rd and 6th months
      were made with an image-analyzing software. Complete wound epithelization, visual analogue
      scale (VAS) pain score of recipient site and the number of analgesic used were evaluated
      after the surgery.
