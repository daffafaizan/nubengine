      ill patients. In recent years studies have raised suspicion that HES is nephrotoxic. So far
      acute kidney injury has been diagnosed based on creatinine measurements, but new technology
      allows for earlier diagnosis using measurements of biomarkers in urine.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate HES's potential toxicity and effects on the
      circulation and kidneys using measurements of biomarkers specific for toxicity and for the
      sodium/water balance in the urine and by measurements of vasoactive hormones in the blood
      after administration of HES 130/0.4
