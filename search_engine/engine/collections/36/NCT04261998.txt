      sensitivity and acquired transversal competences. On the other hand, we aim at evaluating the
      service performed, the skills acquired, the participation, the degree of participatory
      evaluation and the level of satisfaction of the intervention group. All variables will be
      measured with validated scales or questionnaires.

      Both groups will have to describe the specific characteristics of the program, different
      phases of the process, types of exercises recommended, contraindications, safety ranges with
      respect to the intensity of the exercise, ways of calculating the intensity and self-control.
      Likewise, they will have to defend the usefulness and duration of the final product through
      an oral presentation of the program to the patients themselves. Finally, the possible doubts
      that should exist will be solved.
