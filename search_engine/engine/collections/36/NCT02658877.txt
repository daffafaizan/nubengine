      feasibility and proof of concept. Analysis of whole induced sputum is under development for
      endotyping for asthma, allowing sampling of rare cells from conducting airways, repeated
      sampling, and cell-specific detailed genomic evaluation. Investigators have developed a novel
      technique to simultaneously enrich innate immune cells from sputum. This technique allows for
      in situ analyses of sputum-derived human bronchial epithelial cells (sHBEC). The non-invasive
      nature of the technique provides a unique tool for in vivo human studies.
