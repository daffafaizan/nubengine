      debrided (cleansed of any dead tissue or infection). You will then be randomly placed into
      one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will be the control group and a moist wound therapy will
      be applied to the wound. Either you or home nursing will then change the dressing twice a
      week. Group 2 will have a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressing applied. The NPWT
      dressing will be changed twice a week by home nursing. You will return to clinic every 2
      weeks for a total of 12 weeks for observation and assessment of the diabetic foot ulcer. If
      wound healing occurs prior to 12 weeks, a final assessment visit will be done and the status
      of the healed ulcer will be assessed.
