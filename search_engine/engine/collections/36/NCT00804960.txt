    
      Specific Aim:

        1. To determine whether addition of letrozole to gonadotropins would reduce the amount of
           gonadotropins used in an IVF-ET cycle, thereby reducing the cost.

        2. To determine whether letrozole improves IVF-ET success compared to standard ovarian
           stimulation protocols.

      Null Hypothesis: Use of Letrozole for ovulation induction in IVF is not less expensive than
      the standard therapy by a clinically relevant amount.

      Alternative Hypothesis: Use of Letrozole for ovulation induction in IVF is better than the
      standard therapy by a clinically relevant amount.

      Protocol:

      Infertile women <40 years of age with age-appropriate ovarian reserve (as determined by
      day2/3 E2, FSH, and AMH) will be randomized between two protocols: one with letrozole and one
      with standard ovulation induction.

      In both groups, serum FSH will be measured each time a sample is obtained for estradiol. Sera
      will be frozen for further batch assay.

      Number of embryos to be transferred will be decided following the ASRM guidelines. The day of
      embryo transfer (D-3 vs D-5) will be based on the number and quality of embryos as per
      established clinical criteria.

      Power Considerations

      A review of 1473 cycles of patients less than 40 years old over the last 6 years (2002 -
      2008) revealed average cost per cycle to be $3,152 +/- 1685(SD).

      For the purpose of this power analysis we consider a 20% decrease in medication cost to be
      clinically significant. Thus a decrease from $ 3152.83 to $ 2522.26 will be considered
      clinically significant (20% decrease). For an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% for a two
      tailed test 113 patients will need to complete each arm.

      Allowing for 10% drop-out we will attempt to randomize 125 patients to each arm of the study.
