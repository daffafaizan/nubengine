      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban used in
      extended treatment of pulmonary embolism in a real-world.The secondary objective aims to
      analyze the drug usage pattern of rivaroxaban, patient satisfaction and medical resource
      utilization used in extended treatment of pulmonary embolism in a real-world.496 subjects
      will be enrolled in this study. The primary outcome of this study is net clinical benefit.

      All patients with rivaroxaban should be followed up to 12 months, or about 30 days after the
      end of rivaroxaban treatment if discontinued before the completion of 12 months. Follow up
      visits occur at initial visit, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the initial visit, where such data
      have been collected as part of routine clinical practice, by phone and or face to face
      interview.

      During each follow up visit, the date of visit, physical examination, ACTS and, as
      applicable, changes in the concomitant medication, changes in concomitant disease,changes in
      pulmonary embolism and/or treatment regimen, new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, medical
      resources utilization, and adverse events will be obtained and recorded.

      Starting with the first application of rivaroxaban after enrollment into the study or
      follow-up period, all AEs would be documented. For each AE, the investigator must assess and
      document the seriousness, duration, relationship to product, action taken and outcome of the
      event.
