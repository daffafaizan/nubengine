      on:

      i) The early (first 5 breaths) and late or steady state (3-5 minutes) ventilatory response to
      CO2 ii) The immediate (< 1 minute) ventilatory response to hyperoxia iii) The PCO2 apneic
      threshold iv) The breathing pattern during quiet and REM sleep v) The morphology of periodic
      breathing cycles vi) The incidence and morphology of sighs
