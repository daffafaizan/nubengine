      Hospital Dr. Sardjito, Teaching Hospital of Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), and Yogyakarta
      COVID-19 referral hospitals (RSUD Wonosari and Sleman). The COVID-19 patients are recruited
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, then divided randomly into two groups.
      Group I, the intervention group, consists of COVID-19 patients receiving standard therapy and
      15 mL of VCO twice a day for 14 days. Group II, the control group, consists of COVID-19
      patients receiving standard therapy and 15 mL of placebo twice a day for 14 days. Both groups
      are monitored for four weeks with a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR) swab test.
