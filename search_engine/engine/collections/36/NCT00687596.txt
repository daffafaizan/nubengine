      locoregional therapies such as hepatic artery hemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA) which are effective in controlling localized tumors. Currently marketed systemic
      chemotherapy agents, with the exception of sorafenib, provide marginal benefit. Despite the
      demonstrated survival benefit from sorafenib, it is still imperative to improve to the
      effectiveness of systemic therapy in this patient population. Studies of TAC-101, a synthetic
      retinoid, indicate that although TAC-101 may not induce tumor regression, it appears to have
      a stabilizing effect, prolonging survival over what was expected historically. This Phase 2,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international, multicenter study is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAC 101 as second line treatment in patients with
      advanced HCC following treatment with sorafenib as first-line therapy. Sorafenib has recently
      been approved as first line treatment for HCC in the EU and the US and is expected to become
      the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC. Aside from best supportive
      care, there is no second line therapy available for HCC. It is hypothesized that TAC 101
      treatment can extend Overall Survival (OS) after discontinuation of sorafenib.
