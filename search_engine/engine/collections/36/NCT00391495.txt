      disorder, characterized by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention,
      hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Approximately 5-10% of school-age children are affected by
      ADHD, and in many cases, symptoms persist into adolescence and adulthood.

      Cytokines are key mediators of immune function and can be either pro-inflammatory or
      anti-inflammatory. Recently few studies have suggested involvement of cytokine pathways in
      subjects with ADHD.

      Polymorphism of IL-1 receptors antagonists' alleles have been suggested in families and
      subjects suffering from ADHD. Moreover, a new variant of inflammatory bowel disease, another
      immunological based disease, was recently suggested in children with ADHD and other
      developmental disorders. There are no other published reports on cytokine production in
      children who suffer from ADHD.
