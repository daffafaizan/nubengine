      therapeutic lifestyle plans in conjunction with molecular analysis lead to informative
      assessments of disease risk that can reduce risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease.

      Our main objectives were:

      A. To investigate the effect of lifestyle modification on: (1) physiological measurements of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) including carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), exercise
      stress tests, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and weight; (2) plasma markers
      associated with development of CAD such as lipids and triglycerides; and (3) molecular
      characteristics such as gene expression signatures and protein profiles.

      B. To determine if patients with heart disease or risk factors that would promote heart
      disease can achieve and adhere to the goals of a lifestyle change program in a
      non-residential, out-patient setting.
