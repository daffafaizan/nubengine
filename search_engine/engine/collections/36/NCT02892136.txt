    
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow development and testing of new MRI techniques
      suitable for evaluating patients with cardiovascular disease, congenital heart disease, fetal
      cardiac structure, function, and physiology, and other fetal organ analysis. Individuals
      referred to Children's National Medical Center for a clinically indicated cardiac MRI or
      cardiac catheterization by their primary referring cardiologist or obstetrician, and who are
      enrolled in this study may also undergo additional research imaging.

      Since such technical development work often depends on preliminary studies in healthy
      volunteers, the protocol also recruits healthy subjects.
