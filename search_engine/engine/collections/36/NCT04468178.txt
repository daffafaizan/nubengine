      from DePuy does not exhibit worse shoulder function after 2 years than the SIMPLICITY from
      Wright Medical. The primary endpoint is the Constant-Murley Shoulder Score (CMSS) of the
      implant after 2 years, the non-inferiority of which is to be demonstrated in comparison with
      an already established prosthetic system (SIMPLICITY, Wright Medical).

      As secondary endpoints, the migration behavior of the humeral components over time will be
      determined by radiostereometric analysis (RSA), the further clinical-functional results and
      the satisfaction of the patients treated will be investigated. Clinical outcomes are measured
      using standardized and reproducible clinical scores (Oxford Shoulder Score -OSS and Short
      Form Health 36-SF-36 v1.0 ) at each time of examination.

      Other endpoints include revision rate within the follow-up period, surgical time (incision to
      suture), and delays in surgical procedures due to instrumentation.

      The times of data acquisition are the admission day before the operation to determine the
      preoperative status, the discharge day and the follow-up appointments after 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months and 24 months to determine the postoperative status and course.
