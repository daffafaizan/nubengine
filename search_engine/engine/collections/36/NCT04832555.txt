      standard for elderly patients, except in carefully selected cases. Given the relevance of
      this population, scientific societies also suggest to propose prospective studies for this
      subset of frail patients (European Organization for Research and treatment of cancer (EORTC),
      European Society for Medical oncology (ESMO)). In addition, it is necessary to collect data
      on specific categories, which are as homogeneous as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a tailored RT approach administered with a
      curative intent in a subset of frails elderly patients not candidates neither to standard
      concurrent RT-CT / RT-cetuximab nor to palliative treatment/best supportive care.
