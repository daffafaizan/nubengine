      severe ARDS. The estimation of pleural pressure (Ppl) has been validated in the upright
      position in humans with few studies commenting on the changes in supine positioning and
      almost none on prone positioning aside from radiographic analysis. An abstract presented at
      the annual American Thoracic Society meeting recently reported a series of 18 patients
      undergoing spinal surgery. In this population of patients without ARDS, esophageal pressure
      (Pes) decreased when shifting from supine to prone positioning. This suggests that
      transpleural pressure (PtmL) would be increased at a given airway pressure.

      The investigators hope to measure changes in PtmL in patients undergoing treatment with
      mechanical ventilation while switching from the supine, upright (head of bed >30 degrees),
      and prone positions. The esophageal balloon catheter will be placed using standard techniques
      and secured with tape to the patients' nares during changes in positioning. The goal will be
      to measure the changes in chest wall and lung compliance in mechanically ventilated patients
      with changes in position.
