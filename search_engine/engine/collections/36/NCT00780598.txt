      with AML, particularly those with refractory or relapsed disease for whom there are few
      effective treatment options. Treatment options for elderly patients are further limited by
      co-morbidity and tolerability constraints.

      Tosedostat is a new aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in preclinical experiments has shown
      potent activity in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models as a single agent. In early
      clinical studies particularly good results have been observed in refractory and relapsed AML
      in older patients and these observations form the basis for the current study.

      This multi-center, open label phase II study will enrol approximately 70 subjects in Part A
      and 130 subjects in Part B.
