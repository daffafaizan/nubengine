      football players, concentration, reflexes, balance, coordination, anticipation time,
      proprioception and pass quality can be improved. Within the scope of the investigators'
      study,the investigators think that the positive effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular
      exercises on executive functions can positively affect athlete performance by contributing to
      rapid thinking, planning and implementation. In this way, footballers will be able to reach
      high performances on the field and will become more qualified athletes. In addition, it is
      predicted that the incidence of injuries in athletes will be minimized by improving the
      parameters such as anticipation time, balance, coordination, reaction time, and
      proprioception. If the effectiveness of the exercises is proven, it is aimed to contribute to
      the literature with objective and evidence-based results in order to include cognitive-based
      exercises in training programs, which are often overlooked in football training programs.
