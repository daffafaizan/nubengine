      essential tremor in order to deliver deep brain stimulation only when the patient is showing
      symptoms. By delivering stimulation only when needed, the investigators hypothesize that the
      treatment will be more effective, will cause fewer adverse side effects and will increase
      battery time of the device (reducing the number of battery replacement surgeries).

      Participation in this study will require extensive pre-surgical screening to determine
      eligibility for deep brain stimulation surgery, a deep brain stimulation surgical procedure,
      and regular follow-ups. Subjects will be seen monthly post surgery for 6 months. After 6
      months, data will be assessed and closed-loop deep brain stimulation may be offered as a
      stimulation setting. If so, the stimulator settings will be changed from chronic to
      responsive. If not, the subject will continue to receive chronic deep brain stimulation
      stimulation. Subsequent visits will be scheduled every 6 months until a total of 24 months of
      study participation (also at month 9).

      At the end of the initial 24-month study period, subjects will have the choice of 1)
      continuing active stimulation at the current setting, 2) continuing stimulation but searching
      for a new setting, 3) discontinuing stimulation (turning the device off), 4) having the
      device removed. If the subject continues to receive active stimulation, they will be followed
      by the investigators and seen at yearly intervals.
