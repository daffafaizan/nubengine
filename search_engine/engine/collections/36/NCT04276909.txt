      surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the
      LUM imaging device.

      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be administered with LUM015
      at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Due to the expected duration of these surgeries (up to 14 hours), all
      subjects will require LUM015 administration intraoperatively.

      The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care
      used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will
      continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will
      continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is
      required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM
      Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
