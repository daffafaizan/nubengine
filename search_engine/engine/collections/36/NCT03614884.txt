      individuals will receive the integrated treatment, where both gambling and smoking behaviours
      will be addressed. Those in the integrated group will be encouraged to use nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of nicotine patches. These patches will be provided to
      participants at the beginning of the intervention and will be encouraged to use for the
      duration of the 8-weeks. The the other half of the participants (150) will receive the
      problem gambling treatment only.

      Once participants provided informed consent and are registered on the treatment website, they
      will be asked to complete a baseline assessment in order to determine eligibility. Eligible
      participants will be those that: are aged 19 years old+, have at least moderate levels of
      gambling, report current daily smoking, are fluent in English, have weekly internet access,
      and report at least moderate motivation to change gambling and/or smoking behaviours.

      Once the link is available, participants will complete the online, self-help 8-week
      treatment. At the end of the program, they will complete the same brief questionnaires. Six
      months following the completion of the online program, they will complete the same series of
      brief questionnaires.
