      exposure (CCE), each separated by a 24 hr. period and both conducted while the participants
      remain in hospital. One group (PBO) will receive placebo following each CCE session while the
      second (40PP) and third (80PP) group will receive 40 mg and 80 mg propranolol, respectively.
      Participants will return two days, and 1, 3, and 6 weeks after discharge and will be
      administered a CCE session to assess for maintenance/generalization of disruption of
      reconsolidation (DoR) effects on craving and cue reactivity to familiar and novel cocaine
      cues. Participants will also be assessed 3 times weekly for cocaine use (self-report & urine
      drug screen) during follow-up.
