      single-center study. No sooner had patients gone through Pillcam colon capsule (PCC)
      endoscopy solution than they got conventional colonoscopy which is recognized as the "gold
      standard" examination technique. The extent of mucosal damage and inflammatory lesions during
      both modalities were recorded for comparison. In addition, the regimen of bowel preparation,
      completion rate, colonic cleanliness, compliance or adverse events were analyzed.
