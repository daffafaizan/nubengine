    
      Eighteen healthy subjects wil be recruited for a quasi-experimental study. Participants will
      be from 18 to 40 years old, not obese. Participants will be measured before and after
      bilateral dry neddling in Flexor digitorum Brevis. The investigators will measure
      stabilometry variables with eyes open and closed.

      Measures. Stabilometry will be measured by displacement of the center of pressures in X and Y
      with eyes open and closed , center of pressure (COP) with eyes open and closed, COP area with
      eyes open and closed, COP antero-posterior (a-p) and medio-lateral (m-lat) directions with
      eyes open and closed, and COP speed. Two trials will be recorded for each condition and the
      order of the conditions will be randomized across subjects, eyes open and eyes closed.
