      sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Patients will be treated in groups of
      three with full dose sorafenib and OSI-906. If we do not observe any significant side
      effects, then three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. After
      confirming the safety of the combination (possibly after first six patients) the study will
      proceed with regular accrual. The patients will receive the treatments orally and will be
      evaluated by physical exam, blood work and imaging. If the cancer is well controlled and the
      therapy is well tolerated then patients will continue on the trial. If the side effects are
      significant or the tumor starts to grow or the patients wishes to stop therapy the patient at
      that time will be taken off trial.

      The trial will collect blood samples to evaluate the level of the investigational agent in
      the blood. Also samples of the patients tumor will be analyzed to evaluate for markers that
      may predict who benefits from treatment.
