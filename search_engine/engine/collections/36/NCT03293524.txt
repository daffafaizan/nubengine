    
      GS-LHON-CLIN-05 is a Phase III, global, multi-center randomized, double-masked for the
      primary analysis, placebo-controlled, clinical study. As LHON is a neurodegenerative disease,
      the goal is to administer GS010 as soon as possible upon confirmation of the LHON diagnosis
      and the causative mutation.
