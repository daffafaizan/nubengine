      outcomes including daily function, objective physical function, falls, quality of life (QOL),
      and early treatment discontinuation; (b) to determine whether the Hurria/Cancer and Aging
      Research Group (CARG) tool is able to predict severe (grade 3+) chemotherapy toxicity in men
      starting chemotherapy. Our secondary aim is to understand the impact of abiraterone and
      enzalutamide on 'elder-relevant' outcomes.

      This is a prospective multicentre observational study. The investigators will enroll men age
      65 or older with mCRPC who are starting (a) first-line chemotherapy; (b) abiraterone; or (c)
      enzalutamide. Assessments will occur prior to starting treatment and every 2 months
      thereafter until the end of treatment.

      As treatment options become more complex in older men with mCRPC, understanding and
      predicting a wide range of treatment toxicities is important and will aid decision-making and
      management.
