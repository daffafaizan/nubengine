      Ozurdex every 3 months and monthly Eylea (aflibercept) to monthly intravitreal injections of
      aflibercept alone as measured by improvement in central subfield thickness from baseline at
      Week 48 in eyes with center-involving DME and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or
      worse
