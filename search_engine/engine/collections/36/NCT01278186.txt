      there is no suitable technique or strategy to manage such lesions.

      This multicenter randomized prospective trial in bifurcated coronary lesions will compare the
      new technology of the paclitaxel-eluting balloon with the until now "gold standard" technique
      of the "provisional stenting" with the paclitaxel DES in the main branch.
