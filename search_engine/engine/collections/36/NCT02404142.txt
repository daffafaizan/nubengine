      during videolaryngoscopy with Glidescope Titanium whether patients receive (curare
      (Atracurium)group) or no (control group) within elective surgery patients with no difficult
      intubation prediction. The IDS score assessed by an anesthesiologist from the video-recording
      is the primary outcome. All general anesthesias are standardized using Target Control
      Infusion of propofol and sufentanil. The investigators also compare IDS scores as assessed by
      intubators, time for tracheal intubation, and laryngeal morbidity in both groups.
