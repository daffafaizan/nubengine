      worldwide. Decision-making regarding treatment for patients is limited by the lack of
      clinically actionable biomarkers. This is pronounced in the case for determining and
      monitoring liver transplant recipients. In an effort to improve diagnosis, the use of
      circulating serum-based microRNA isoforms (isomiRs) can serve as non-invasive, screening
      biomarkers in HCC patients pre- and post-transplantation of the liver.
