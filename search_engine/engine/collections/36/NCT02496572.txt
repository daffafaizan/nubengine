      intensive phase of at least 4 months duration of Pyrazinamide (Z) + Ethambutol (E) +
      Isoniazid (H) + Moxifloxacin (Mfx) + Capreomycin (or Kanamycin/Amikacin) (Cm/Km/Am) +
      Prothionamide (Pto) + Clofazimine (Cfz) and a continuation phase of oral drugs
      Z-E-Mfx-Pto-Cfz. Patients will be followed up until the end of treatment and during 12 months
      after treatment completion in order to evaluate the rate of relapse.

      Data will be recorded in patient's clinical files and electronic databases and analyzed with
      Stata 11.0.

      This study is a result of ongoing collaboration of MSF with the Ministry of Health in
      Uzbekistan; results will be shared with the national health authorities, World Health
      Organization and the rest of the scientific community and aim to influence and improve
      treatment and care of patients with MDR TB.
