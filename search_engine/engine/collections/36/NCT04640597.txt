      presentation of data from use of the BioMimics 3D Vascular Stent System purchased by the
      hospital / institution or office interventional suite and used in accordance with the IFU
      associated with the product's FDA approval. The intent of this post-market observational
      study is to increase the understanding of the performance of the BioMimics 3D Vascular Stent
      System in a larger population of patients representative of a real-world situation within US
      hospitals, institutions and office-based interventional suites or labs.
