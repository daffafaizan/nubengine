      treatment in combination with active breathing exercises on respiratory power (Peak
      Expiratory Flow, PEF) in people with MS?".

      In a single-center randomized clinical trial, 96 people with MS-related respiratory problems
      will be allocated to either the intervention group (IPV + active breathing training) or the
      control group (active breathing training only). Interventions will be provided by trained
      speech- and language therapists, in combination with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation
      programme of 3 weeks. Pre- en posttraining assessment includes measures of respiration,
      speech and fatigue.
