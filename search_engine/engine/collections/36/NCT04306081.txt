    
      This is a double-blinded, prospective, randomized, study in eighty-six subjects with clinical
      ASCVD with PAD on background treatment with maximal tolerated dose of a statin. Subjects will
      be assessed based on their medical history and physical examination. Eligible subjects must
      meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (listed below). There will be
      a treatment group and a placebo group, each with equal number of participants (n=43 patients
      in each group). After consent and enrollment, subjects will have a venous blood sample drawn
      to perform serum circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress as oxidized low density
      lipoprotein (oxLDL), oxidized glutathione : reduced glutathione (GSH:GSSG) and soluble CD36
      (sCD36). We will then perform: functional walking measurements, pain free walking time
      (PFWT), and (maximal walking time (MWT), lower extremity arterial perfusion assessment (rest
      ABI/TBI, post-exercise ABI and bilateral TcPO2), and brachial endothelial function testing
      (after hyperemia). Subjects will receive monthly subcutaneous injections of Evolocumab 420 mg
      or placebo injection. The study participants will be seen at three months and six months for
      follow up and a final assessment at 26 +/-2 weeks, all tests will be repeated for comparison
      from baseline and/or placebo.
