      data and an android software application that serves as the Hemodynamic calculator. The
      application performs POST-PROCESSING of the PhotoPlethismoGraphic (PPG) signal (Normally the
      PPG signal in Pulse Oximeters is used only to compute heart rate and SpO2). The raw data is
      transferred from the watch oximeter to the smartphone using a standard Bluetooth protocol.

      The Post-processing uses wavelet signal processing to estimate and display certain
      Hemodynamic parameters like Blood Pressure (BP) and Cardiac Output (CO) in a continuous and
      graphical way on a standard Android device. In addition to the standard heart rate and SpO2,
      the application displays the measured PPG signal and estimated continues BP and CO.

      HeartBeat is the only device that can non-invasively estimate Continuous BP and its Cardiac
      Output component and the resistance component in a mobile wearable device. Differentiating
      between these 2 components can play a major role in helping the doctor to understand the
      effect of cardiovascular medications and Lifestyle interventions.

      The trial will compare blood pressure and cardiac output parameters measured during Stress
      Echocardiography using an echo cardiograph and standard sphygmomanometer to the parameters
      generated by the application.

      Trial goals

        -  Feasibility tests for the HeartBeat application as a tool for monitoring BP and CO
           changes over time

        -  Compare BP and CO parameters generated by the applications to the ones measured by
           standard non-invasive equipment during a Stress Echocardiography

        -  Calculate additional parameters such as stroke volume, systematic vascular resistance
           and cardiac index
