      an independent risk factor and predicts future coronary events or clinically manifest disease
      up to 10 years later.

      Index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) is a validated method to Assessment of the
      Coronary Microcirculation but this is an invasive technique.

      In this study, we use a new mathematic technique from homogeneity analysis to provide
      precise, objective, automated quantification of perfusion heterogeneity at stress with new
      camera CZT SPECT. We compare the results with those of the measurement of IMR.
