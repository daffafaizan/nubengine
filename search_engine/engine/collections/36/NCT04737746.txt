      selection, the satisfaction for the patient is often considerable. The investigators want to
      investigate the caregiver burden for relatives of patients who are treated with spinal cord
      stimulation. This will be evaluated by appropriate scores at baseline, during neurostimulator
      trial and 3,6 and 12 months after implantation. At the same time the patient satisfaction and
      pain reduction will also be evaluated independently.

      In this prospective cohort different parameters will be assessed at baseline, trial, 3, 6 and
      12 months follow-up for the patient and their caregiver.

      For the patient this will include Numeric Rating scale (NRS) for leg and back pain, Oswestry
      Disability Index (ODI), EuroQuality of Life-5 Dimensions score (EQ5D), opiate use and
      Relation Quality Index (RQI).

      For the caregiver the Zarit Burden Index (ZBI), Relation Quality Index (RQI) and Modified
      Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI).

      With regard to the research questions, subgroup analysis will be performed regarding to age,
      sex, education, neurostimulation pattern, surgical vs percutaneous lead placement, working
      status of both patient and caregiver and caregiver relation characteristics.
