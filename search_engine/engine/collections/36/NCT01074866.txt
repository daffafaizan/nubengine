      during standard pressure support (PS) and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory assist (NAVA) in a
      group of patients receiving non invasive ventilation (NIV)for an episode of acute respiratory
      failure of various origin. The subgroup of COPD patients will be analyzed separately. The
      effects of various setting of Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist on patient-ventilator
      interaction will also be explored.
