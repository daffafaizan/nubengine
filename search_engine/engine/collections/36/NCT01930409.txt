      larger scale study to test effectiveness of a clinician supported telephonic self management
      intervention for older adults after hip fracture. The primary aim is to determine feasibility
      and acceptability of the intervention, and the secondary aim is to measure statistical trends
      on quality of life at 4 months after fracture in community dwelling older adults. In
      parallel, we will conduct a process evaluation to ascertain key features of the intervention
      via qualitative interviews of participants and health care professionals involved in delivery
      of the intervention.
