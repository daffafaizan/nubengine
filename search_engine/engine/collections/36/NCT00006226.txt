      I. To determine whether thalidomide can induce objective responses in relapsed B-CLL
      patients.

      II. To determine the toxicity of thalidomide in this patient population. III. To document if
      alterations in vascular growth factors and/or bone marrow angiogenesis patterns correlate
      with thalidomide related clinical responses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral thalidomide daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.
