           assessments of serum creatinine, an insensitive measure of renal injury and the
           diagnosis relies on renal transplant needle biopsy which is an invasive procedure
           associated with a significant risk of bleeding and graft loss and is limited by sampling
           error and/or interobserver variability. Moreover, repeated biopsies to evaluate a renal
           graft's status pose challenges, including practicability and cost. Consequently, other
           sensitive and less invasive modalities, including gene expression profiling and omic
           analyses of blood and urine samples as well as in vivo imaging, are currently under
           investigation to reinforce our clinical armamentarium for acute rejection diagnosis.
           Likewise, it would be useful to non-invasively predict rejection in kidney transplant
           recipients with acute renal dysfunction and suspected acute rejection, thereby avoiding
           unnecessary transplant biopsy.

        2. This study aims to generate a scoring system that predicts individual patients' risk of
           long-term kidney allograft failure.

        3. Since 2007, the protocol in our institution is to withdraw the corticoids after 3 months
           after the protocol biopsy if no sign of rejection is demonstrated. We would like to
           evaluate the impact of such decision in the risk of rejection and the long-term
           allograft outcome in our patients. We are looking also to the impact on bone mineral
           density after corticoids withdrawal in those patients.

        4. Evaluate the type and the frequencies of complications in our kidney transplant
           population to adapt our daily basis clinical practice.
