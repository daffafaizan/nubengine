      diplegia. The treatment includes soft tissue and bony correction. Especially the bony
      procedures e.g. femoral derotation osteotomies have proven to be effective both in short term
      and long term evaluation. Nonetheless there is still a relevant number of patients that
      suffer from over- or under-correction and recurrence over time. The reasons are diverse and
      include false measurement of the derotation in OR.

      The study now evaluates electromagnetic tracking for femoral derotation to improve these
      results.

      The patients are recruited from the outpatients department and included if they meet the
      criteria.

      A baseline rotational CT or MRI scan and a 3D gait analysis are performed preoperatively. The
      patients are randomized into a electromagnetic tracking group or a classical goniometer
      group. The derotation is measured with the EMT system or with a classic Moeltgen goniometer
      in the OR. Goal is to achieve the planned amount of derotation more accurately.

      The surgical procedure follows standard rules and does not need alterations because of the
      study.

      After the operation a second rotational CT or MRI scan is performed and the derotation
      precisely evaluated by two raters and later compared to the results of the intraoperative
      electromagnetic tracking system. One year postoperative a second 3D gait analysis is
      performed to measure and compare the functional and dynamic outcome.
