      Hospital , and who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the COPACNE cohort.
      Inclusion will take place at the first consultation, after information and agreement of the
      patient and, if applicable, his or her legal representatives. The frequency of each patient's
      follow-up visits will be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the patient's
      medical needs (generally, the interval between 2 visits is between 1 and 4 months).
