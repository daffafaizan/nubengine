      I. To examine if letrozole monotherapy/maintenance (L/L) is non-inferior to intravenous (IV)
      paclitaxel/carboplatin and maintenance letrozole (CT/L) with respect to progression-free
      survival (PFS) in women with stage II-IV primary low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or
      peritoneum after primary surgical cytoreduction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the nature, frequency and maximum degree of toxicity as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0 for each treatment arm.

      II. To compare the relative frequency of objective tumor response in those with measurable
      disease after cytoreductive surgery for each treatment arm.

      III. To compare overall survival for each treatment arm. IV. To compare the CT/L and L/L arms
      with respect to patients' adherence to letrozole therapy as measured by pill counts.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. Patients then receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD)
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive letrozole PO QD in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.
