      and failures continue to occur. The incidence and reasons for failure are not well
      understood. The Tsui test is not routinely performed with each epidural catheter insertion,
      but rather it is used when there is suspicion about the catheter location.

      In this study, the Tsui test will be performed twice during the epidural procedure, and
      bupivacaine consumption will be recorded for the first 2 hours.

      Information gained from this study could have great impact in clinical practice, since the
      incidence of inadequate labor analgesia is still relatively high (10-20%), leading to
      maternal distress and disappointing labor experience.
