      incidence , The clinical manifestation is multifaceted and targets the musculoskeletal
      system, the skin and different organs like lung and kidney From 30-80% of SLE patients
      develop lupus nephritis (LN) which often leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an overall poor prognosis and high mortality
      Diagnosis of LN is made by kidney biopsy, which still remains the gold standard Histological
      evaluation distinguish between different stages of LN upon morphological changes within the
      kidney . However, noninvasive methods to diagnose and guide LN therapy are currently not
      established in the clinic. On the other hand, an early diagnosis is important for the
      therapeutic success and thereby lowers the risk of ESRD In this context, classical clinical
      markers for renal dysfunction are insufficient for an early assessment of the need for renal
      biopsies and subsequently to decide about the optimal therapy. Even though traditional
      biomarkers like antids DNA antibodies and complement deficiency are widely accepted as
      diagnostic instruments to assess disease activity, their specificity is rather low, and they
      appear to be more suitable to confirm diagnosis of SLE and LN in an already likely clinical
      setting Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules ,composed of sphingosine and fatty
      acide ,found in high concentration with in the cell membrane of eukaryocyte cells, since they
      are component lipids that make up sphingomyelin, one of the major lipids in the lipid bilayer
      Ceramides and other sphingolipids found in cell membrane were purely supporting structural
      elements,also participate in variety of cellular signaling, regulating differentiation,
      proliferation, Programmed cell death(PCD) Sphingolipids are a heterogenous group of lipids
      with more than 400 single compounds formed by structural and chemical modifications of a
      sphingosine backbone Recent studies reveal that blood sphingolipids not only have important
      signaling properties but also serve as biomarkers in various renal disease Patyna etal in
      2019 concluded that ceramides in blood could act as potent biomarker for renal impairment in
      patient
