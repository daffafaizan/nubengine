    
      This will be a randomised clinical trial comparing MOCA to CAE. Patients will be randomised
      into group A (MOCA) or group B (CAE). Only the endovenous ablation part of the procedure will
      be randomised while the decision as to whether patients should receive treatment of their
      varicose tributaries will be at the discretion of the clinical team.

      The device used for MOCA (group A) will be the ClariVeinÂ® mechanochemical ablation (MOCA)
      device (Vascular Insights, Madison, CT, USA).

      The device used for CAE (group B) will be the VenaSealTM Closure System (Medtronic,
      Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).

      Re-intervention of the treated saphenous veins will not be decided until at least 3 months
      after their initial procedure.
