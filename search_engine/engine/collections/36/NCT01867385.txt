      quality of life. Thus far, there is scant knowledge about the causes of fatigue in this
      population, and almost no specific treatments for fatigue have been found effective in
      clinical trials. Sleep disturbance and alterations in plasma melatonin profiles have been
      documented in patients with cirrhosis, but remain largely unstudied in patients with earlier
      stages of liver disease. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled in a case-control study on the
      physiology of fatigue in patients with chronic liver disease. This is a descriptive study,
      exploring the concept that fatigue may be the result of circadian rhythms in the central
      nervous system being out of sync with circadian rhythms in peripheral organs, i.e.
      unsynchronized central and peripheral clocks.
