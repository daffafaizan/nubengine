      limited to case series of limited size and significant heterogeneity. These tumors comprise
      11% of all Primary Musculoskeletal Tumors and 4.2% of all spine tumors. Of all primary spine
      tumors only 6% are malignant, but it is the malignant tumors that present the greatest
      therapeutic challenges. Through this multi-center retrospective cohort study performed at 13
      spine oncology referral, data on at least 2.000 patients with specific primary benign and
      malignant spine tumors will be collected. This will provide power to determine the influence
      of many previously hypothesized variables on outcome.

      The purpose of this study is to determine clinical, imaging and treatment factors that
      influence patient survival, local recurrence rate, and peri-operative/post-operative
      morbidity. Most surgical options carry significant morbidity and consume vast resources. In
      contrast, there is emerging evidence that incomplete or oncologically inappropriate resection
      increases local recurrence rate and decreases overall survival. These data will be used to
      refine existing study questions regarding patient outcomes and to develop new study questions
      that will be assessed in the future using prospectively collected data.
