      induction with highly effective, but also relatively toxic, drugs and, secondly, after
      remission is achieved, maintenance therapy with less toxic drugs. Currently,
      remission-maintenance therapy with azathioprine is stopped after approximately 18 months.
      However, the optimal duration of azathioprine maintenance therapy is unknown.

      The investigators have found that patients with PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis who remain
      C-ANCA positive after induction of remission have an increased risk to experience relapse of
      disease (MC Slot et al. Arthritis Rheum. 2004 15;51(2):269-73). Therefore they will test
      whether relapse risk in these patients can be reduced by extending maintenance therapy at the
      cost of acceptable therapy related toxicity. After induction of stable remission, ANCA will
      be measured by IIF. C-ANCA positive patients will be randomized for either standard therapy
      with azathioprine (until 18 months after diagnosis), or longterm azathioprine maintenance
      therapy (until 48 months after diagnosis).
