      electrical stimulation in chronic lung disease patients. It was used as a pulmonary
      rehabilitation component especially in patients with decreased exercise capacity and
      peripheral muscle strength, intensely increased dyspnea inhibits exercise. It was
      demonstrated that neuromuscular electrical stimulation improved functional exercise capacity,
      peripheral muscle strength and quality of life.
