    
      The primary objective of this prospective, post-market study is to collect data to assess the
      long term outcome of a broad contact modular interbody device in the form of the InterFuse S™
      or InterFuse T™ device in patients undergoing long construct fusion for degenerative disc
      disease and/or scoliosis. While there is no concurrent control population, there is ample
      historical control data to be used for comparison.

      The study will include up to two hundred (200) patients, up to 10 centers, and provide a
      prospective evaluation of the InterFuse "T" and/or InterFuse "S" Interbody Fusion System.
      Primary endpoints will be assessed at twelve months post-surgery. All patients enrolled in
      the study will be followed for at least 24 months.
