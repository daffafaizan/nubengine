      evaluate the effects of adding a Chinese formulation (TCM-700C) on the standard combination
      treatment for patients with Genotype 1 hepatitis C infection. Patients were screened within 4
      weeks before receive the first study drug dose. Eligible patients at baseline were stratified
      according to baseline HCV RNA (≤800,000 IU/ml vs >800,000 IU/ml) and randomized with an equal
      chance to receive either TCM-700C or placebo as an add-on to the combination drug therapy.
      The combination drug therapy was peginterferon α-2b (PEG-INTRON®, Schering-Plough) 1.5
      micrograms/kg once weekly injection for 48 weeks plus oral ribavirin (REBETOL®,
      Shering-Plough) 1000mg-1200mg daily for 48 weeks. The add-on treatment of TCM-700C or placebo
      was given 2 tablets thrice daily for 48 weeks.

      During the 48 week treatment period and 24 week untreated follow-up, patients were assessed
      at regular intervals for safety and efficacy at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter until study completion. Patients who prematurely discontinued test drug therapy
      had laboratory examination re-taken on the week patient was discontinued from study.
