      with grade III-IV IVH develop severe neurodevelopmental outcomes. There are currently no
      effective treatments to prevent preterm infants with IVH from developing ventricular dilation
      or serious neurological disabilities. Recent studies have shown that EPO could improve
      neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants with grade III-IV IVH. However, the dose and
      course of EPO in preterm infants is still uncertain. The purpose of the study was whether
      repeated low-dose EPO (500 U/kg, every other day, for 2 weeks) given to very preterm right
      after the diagnosis of IVH could improve long-term neurological outcomes. Very preterm
      infants with gestational age of â‰¤ 32 weeks who are diagnosed with IVH within 72 hours after
      birth in NICU are eligible for enrolment. After informed consent is obtained, infants will be
      randomly assigned to EPO group or vehicle group. The primary outcome is whether EPO improves
      mortality and neurological disabilities in very preterm infants with IVH at 18 months of
      corrected age, and the secondary outcome was whether EPO decrease the incidence of cerebral
      palsy, MDI<70, blindness, and deafness.
