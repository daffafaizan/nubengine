      narcotics (administered as an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection). However, IV
      or IM narcotics provide incomplete pain relief and have maternal and fetal/neonatal side
      effects, e.g., maternal drowsiness, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and neonatal
      respiratory depression. Other obstetricians allow their patients to request early neuraxial
      (spinal or epidural) analgesia. The results of several studies comparing patients who
      received epidural versus IV/IM narcotic labor analgesia (not specifically in early
      labor)suggest that initiation of early neuraxial analgesia may be associated with higher
      Cesarean delivery rates. It has been hypothesized that epidural/spinal local anesthetics may
      induce pelvic musculature relaxation leading to failure of fetal descent and rotation.
      However, early pain may be a marker for other factors that increase the risk of Cesarean
      delivery, e.g., large or malpositioned baby, or dysfunctional labor. Whether or not early
      neuraxial analgesia (particularly if narcotic based, which would not cause pelvic muscle
      paralysis) compared to IV/IM narcotics, adversely affects the outcome of labor has not been
      studied in a randomized, prospective fashion. The purpose of this study is to compare
      Cesarean and forcep delivery rates, and quality of pain relief, in first-time mothers
      undergoing induction of labor who receive neuraxial versus IV/IM analgesia for early labor
      (cervical dilation < 4 cm).
