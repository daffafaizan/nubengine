    
      This is a multi-center (5 sites) open-label, single-arm, efficacy study of Lysteda in the
      treatment of adolescent females (10-19 years of age) with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).
      Each subject will receive oral Lysteda 1.3 grams three times daily during the first five days
      of menses. Subjects will be monitored over the course of four menstrual cycles (1
      pre-treatment cycle and 3 treatment cycles). During all cycles, assessments of menstrual
      bleeding will be performed using the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) and Pictorial
      Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC).

      The study will begin as a currently funded pilot study to assess the efficacy of Lysteda in
      32 patients followed to study completion.
