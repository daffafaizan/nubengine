      fatigue will be randomly assigned to either the usual care for an HIV patient, which is an
      educational program about the medications, or an intervention program, which includes both
      the educational program and three sessions with a psychologist. The sessions will help
      participants understand their concerns about the medications and will teach relaxation
      techniques and guided imagery to help participants reduce discomforts associated with the
      medications. All patients will continue to receive the usual care from their medical
      providers. The main measures are the measured frequency and intensity of the symptoms under
      study; secondary measures examine medication adherence, CD4 counts, and virus levels. Control
      measures include the number of doses of side effect medications taken in each group, and the
      number of relaxation/imagery sessions practiced privately by participants in the intervention
      group.
