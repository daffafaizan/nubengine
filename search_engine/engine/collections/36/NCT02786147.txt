    
      The three aims for this study are: 1. To develop an electronic version of the revised B-RST
      (Breast Cancer Genetics Referral Screening Tool) with a HIPAA compliant database for
      integration within the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory website. 2. To identify the most
      effective means of follow-up to maximize the number of screen positive individuals who are
      referred to and complete cancer genetics counseling. 3. Evaluate the clinical utility of
      B-RST 3.0 by analyzing the number of individuals who were referred to and received genetic
      counseling and were considered appropriate for genetic testing and underwent genetic testing,
      and were identified with a BRCA1/2 mutation, and/or were identified with a mutation in a
      different hereditary cancer gene, or were not appropriate for genetic testing, but were
      appropriate for referral to high-risk follow-up services.

      The B-RST is a simple yet effective screening tool to identify individuals who may be at risk
      for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. This study will seek to determine the most
      effective method of follow-up to maximize referral to and completion of cancer genetic
      counseling services following a screen positive result on the B-RST tool, and to understand
      clinical outcomes following participation in genetic counseling (i.e., whether patients who
      receive counseling undergo genetic testing, genetic testing results, and recommendations for
      enhanced screening and preventions).
