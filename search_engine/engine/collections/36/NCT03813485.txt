      tissue and in the vicinity of myofascial trigger points, however studies about the effect of
      dry needling in this fibers type on these disturbances in EMG activity are scarce.

      The surface electromyography of upper trapezius is related with a tonic muscle dysfunction,
      for example muscle contracture; and the lower fiber of trapezius is related with atrophy
      muscle.

      Dry needling is an effective method for the treatment of myofascial trigger points for
      immediate reduction of pain. There are some studies about latent myofascial trigger point and
      motor activity, but we don't know any research about the effect of dry needling in the
      differences fibers.
