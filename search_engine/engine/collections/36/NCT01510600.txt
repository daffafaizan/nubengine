        -  To establish telomere length measurement by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
           (qPCR) as an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) detection method in
           neuroblastoma (NB).

        -  To determine the frequency of ALT in high-risk NB and the characteristics of ALT+ NB.

        -  To establish C-circle (extra-chromosomal telomeric DNA circles) level as a marker of ALT
           activity in NB.

        -  To evaluate the prognostic significance of ALT in NB.

        -  To evaluate the utility of the C-circle assay for the detection of circulating tumor DNA
           in NB patients with an ALT+ tumor.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and serum samples are analyzed for telomere length
      measurement, frequency, and C-circle levels by PCR. Results are then compared with patients'
      age at diagnosis and outcomes including survival data (event-free and overall survival).
