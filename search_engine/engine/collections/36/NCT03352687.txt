      approaches) have been described in the literature. From an anatomical point of view, the
      anterior approach could expose patients to the risk of ipsilateral PhD by phrenic nerve block
      secondary to diffusion of the local anesthetic into the supraclavicular region.

      By measuring the diaphragm excursion during a sniff test, ultrasound allows reliable and
      reproducible analysis of the diaphragm function.

      No study has evaluated the incidence of PhD after ultrasound block of the suprascapular
      nerve. Knowing the influence of the approach on this complication could be of major interest
      in this context.
