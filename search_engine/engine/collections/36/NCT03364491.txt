      frequency and severity of hemorrhage is significantly higher after cesarean delivery than
      vaginal delivery. Recent evidence has emerged about the importance of the fibrinolytic
      pathway in the pathophysiology of hemorrhage in different clinical scenarios including
      trauma-associated bleeding, cardiovascular surgery, and obstetrical hemorrhage. Tranexamic
      acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis and is used routinely to prevent hemorrhage in trauma cases
      and high risk surgeries. Randomized trials of TXA as a prophylaxis to prevent hemorrhage in
      cesarean delivery have been small and of mixed quality; however meta-analysis suggests that
      it is effective.

      This study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 11,000 women to assess whether
      tranexamic acid as prophylaxis lowers the risk of postpartum hemorrhage in women undergoing a
      cesarean delivery.
