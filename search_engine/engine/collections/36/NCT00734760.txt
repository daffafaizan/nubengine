      cause of morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to evaluate a tailored education
      and counseling program designed for individuals at high risk for a future event. Study
      Hypothesis: The central hypothesis of this study was that a focused education and counseling
      intervention delivered by a nurse will decrease time of delay in seeking treatment for the
      signs and symptoms of AMI in patients already identified as having ischemic heart disease.
      Patients were randomized to receive a nurse-administered education and counseling
      intervention designed to promote early presentation for medical treatment in the face of
      cardiac symptoms or to usual instructions by their healthcare provider. Primary & Secondary
      Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this trial was prehospital delay time, i.e., time from
      onset of symptoms to arrival at the hospital. The secondary endpoints were: use of the
      emergency medical system; use of aspirin; healthcare resource utilization; and knowledge,
      attitudes and beliefs about heart disease.
