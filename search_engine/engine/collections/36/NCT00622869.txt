      post-transplantation) followed by a run-in period that ended on the day of randomization at
      30 days (± 5 days) post-transplantation. Patients were screened for eligibility prior to
      liver transplantation. Patients who had undergone successful liver transplantation were
      initiated on a tacrolimus-based regimen that included corticosteroids and entered the
      baseline period (between 3 and 7 days post-transplantation). At 30 (± 5) days
      post-transplantation, patients who met additional randomization inclusion/exclusion criteria
      were randomized into the study.
