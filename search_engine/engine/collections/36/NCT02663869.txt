    
      This study is a case-control study, including antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced
      patients, coming from the two following cohorts:

        -  Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic (MHMC) cohort and

        -  Romanian HIV cohort (RHC). For this study only patients living with HIV â‰¥ 20 years will
           belong to these two cohort. The Aging-Young patients acquired HIV infection in
           childhood, and Aging-old patients acquired HIV infection above the age of 30.

      Aging-Young patients will be matched to Aging-Old patients considering gender and HIV
      duration (within 1 year interval) (This is the most important matching criteria. The exact
      number of year of HIV duration since HIV test is the major criteria). An HIV negative test
      within 5 years prior HIV diagnosis is required in the selection of patients from MHMC to
      avoid an unpredicted HIV time exposure in these patients.

      Then, Aging-young and Aging-old patients will be age, gender matched with a 1: 3 ratio with
      CINECA (Consorzio Interuniversitario di Calcolo) "ARNO" records (control group, called
      "HIV-negative group"). The study will analyse 200 HIV Aging-Young and 200 HIV Aging-Old
      patients in comparison to 1200 controls.

      In the first set of analyses, the prevalence of non-infectious comorbidities (NICM) and
      multimorbidities (MM) in HIV Aging-Young and in HIV Aging-Old groups will be compared to
      those of HIV-negative group using multivariable logistic regression models. In the second set
      of analyses, the probability of MM in the HIV Aging-Young cohort will be compared to the HIV
      Aging-Old one, using multivariable logistic regression models.
