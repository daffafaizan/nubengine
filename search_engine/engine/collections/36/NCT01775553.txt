    
      This is an open label, single center, phase II study of high dose carfilzomib. Patients with
      relapsed or relapsed/refractory myeloma and with progression of disease on standard dosing
      (20/27 mg/m2) and schedule of carfilzomib will be initially treated at dose level 1,
      carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2. During Cycle 1, patients will receive either 20 mg/m2 on days 1,2
      (if the subject has not received carfilzomib as part another clinical trial within the last 4
      weeks) or 56 mg/m2 (if the subject is enrolling in the present study after progression of
      disease on carfilzomib within the last month - for example subjects enrolled in CMAP
      compassionate use carfilzomib). Thereafter, all subjects will receive 56 mg/m2 for the
      remaining doses given Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards. If a minimal response or better is achieved (and
      therefore disease response is recaptured) a bone marrow biopsy will be repeated.

      If 56 mg/m2 is not tolerated, the dose of carfilzomib will be reduced to dose level -1 i.e.
      45 mg/m2. If a subject does not tolerate 45 mg/m2 then the dose would be further reduced to
      dose level -2 i.e. 36 mg/m2. If the subject does not tolerate 36 mg/m2, then this subject
      would have to come off study.

      Dexamethasone 8 mg po/IV will be administered prior to all carfilzomib doses.

      Once a patient develops disease progression on this study, the patient may return to
      receiving the maximum tolerated dose of carfilzomib by that patient with the addition of a
      therapeutic dosing of dexamethasone (a total of 20-40 mg weekly). An IMId (e.g. thalidomide
      or lenalidomide) and/or an alkylator can also be added to carfilzomib 27 or 36 mg/m2 per
      investigator discretion either concurrent with the addition of dexamethasone or subsequent to
      disease progression on carfilzomib with concurrent therapeutic dexamethasone.
