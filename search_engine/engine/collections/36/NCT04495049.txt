      uncorrected vision (distance and intermediate or intermediate and near) but have a track
      record of frequent patient dissatisfaction because of unwanted visual side effects, "spider
      webs" or haloes. The Vivity non-diffractive EDOF lens offers this same range ofvision with
      contrast sensitivity similar to a monofocal lens, which suggests fewer side effects will be
      encountered in clinical practice.

      This study is designed to measure postoperative patient-reported outcomes with this new lens
      implant. Previous studies we have conducted on the bilateral ReSTOR 3.0, ReSTOR with
      ActiveFocus 2.5 (mixed with 3.0 and alone with mini-monovision) have shown high satisfaction,
      spectacle independence, and acceptable glare and halo profiles using a validated
      questionnaire instrument developed by MDbackline, Inc. The postoperative portions of this
      study will be designed to mirror those previous studies using the same instrument.

      All subjects will receive the Vivity or Vivity Toric implant binocularly with a target of
      plano sphere.
