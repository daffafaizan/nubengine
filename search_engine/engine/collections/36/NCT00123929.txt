      drug doxorubicin versus docetaxel. 250 patients will be included. cDNA microarrays will be
      produced and the genetic pattern will be correlated with the response to doxorubicin and
      docetaxel. Secondary aim is the prediction of response by means of IHC determinations (her2,
      ER, PgR, Ki67, protein TAU), FISH (topoisomerase II alpha, her2) and PCR (topoisomerase II
      alpha).
