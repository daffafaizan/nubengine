      Stimulator and Proximity Leadâ„¢, which comprises an external electrical signal generator
      coupled to temporary electrode that is percutaneously inserted in the neck.

      Sponsor believes, based on animal testing data provided as well as consultations with
      physicians who regularly treat patients suffering from attacks of acute bronchoconstriction
      in ER and inpatient hospital settings, that this device could be used in the skilled care
      hospital setting to help rapidly relax the smooth muscle in the airway, relieving a
      clinically significant portion of the bronchoconstriction suffered by patients experiencing
      moderate to severe asthma attacks, allowing more effective delivery of inhaled medications to
      restore the patient to his or her baseline respiration status.
