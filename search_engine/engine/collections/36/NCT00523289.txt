      local anesthetic in substitution to bupivacaine is ropivacaine, however in Brasil there is a
      bupivacaine mixture of 75% levobupivacaine plus 25% racemic bupivacaine. The research design
      is:

      Patients involved: 48; age: 18 to 40 years old; both sex; ASA I and II. Surgery: elective
      upper extremity orthopedic surgery. Anesthesia technique: brachial plexus block. Primary
      endpoint: cardiovascular safety; analysis by continuous Holter. Secondary endpoint:
      anesthetic and analgesic efficacy.
