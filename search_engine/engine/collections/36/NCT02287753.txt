      muscle and non-invasive blood pressure cuff is applied to ipsilateral thigh. VOT is performed
      as: after baseline oxygen saturation value is recorded, cuff pressure is rapidly increased to
      30 mmHg over than systolic blood pressure. After 3 minutes of ischemic time, cuff pressure is
      rapidly decreased. It is performed at 3 time periods : before start of operation, during
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative outcome
      variables are recorded after surgery : major adverse event, use of inotropic and vasoactive
      drugs, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The relationship between the results
      of VOT and postoperative outcome will be investigated.
