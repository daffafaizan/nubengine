    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To determine whether fatigue improves as patients are treated for
      febrile neutropenia (Day #1, Day #2 and Day #6).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To identify clinical factors associated in cancer patients with low
      risk for outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia on either outpatient febrile neutropenia
      treatment pathway presenting with moderate to severe fatigue.

      II. To describe demographic information in cancer patients with low risk for outpatient
      treatment of febrile neutropenia and fatigue while enrolled in either of two outpatient
      febrile neutropenia treatment pathways.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a questionnaire on days 1, 2, and 6 regarding fatigue, sleep disturbance,
      depression, and other symptoms.
