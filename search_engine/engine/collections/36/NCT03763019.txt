      other muscles of the affected side.

      Ultrasonography is a non-invasive, practical, low cost utility that may measure the thickness
      of diaphragm in maximum expiration and inspiration thus examining the functionality of the
      muscle. Correlation between respiratory functional tests and diaphragm ultrasonography has
      been proven in recent literature. In this manner, the aim of this study is twofold. First is
      to determine whether ultrasonography can be used practically to evaluate the respiratory
      functions of the patients after stroke. Respiratory function tests will be used for the
      correlation analysis. Second is to evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory exercises via
      diaphragm ultrasonography and respiratory function tests.
