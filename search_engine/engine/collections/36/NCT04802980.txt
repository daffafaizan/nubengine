      selected solid tumor indications. There are two parts to this study: a dose-escalation part
      and a dose-expansion part. About 63-72 subjects is planned to recruit, 27~36 subjects (9~12
      subjects each arm) will be recruited during dose-escalation period The sample size may vary
      depending on the DLT observed at each dose level. The conventional 3+3 design will be applied
      for dose escalation. This trial will evaluate two adaptive dose levels, 3 to 6 subjects will
      be enrolled at each dose level depending on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs). Cohorts of 3 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors will receive
      HB002.1T at escalating dose levels in combination with different chemotherapy regimens. After
      determination of the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), another 12 patients in each of 3 cohorts
      will be added to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and clinical
      activity of HB002.1T.
