      A total of 20 participants with Parkinson's disease and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy
      controls will be included in this study. The participants with Parkinson's disease should
      have symptoms only on one side of the body, and they should not be taking any dopamine
      replacement medication such as levodopa or dopamine agonists. The study will take place at
      the Motion Analysis Laboratory of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown,
      Massachusetts. It will consist of two assessment sessions; one where muscle activity of the
      arms as well as movement characteristics will be assessed during a reaching task; and another
      where muscle activity of the legs and movement characteristics will be assessed while walking
      on a treadmill. Clinical evaluations will also be performed. In addition, individuals with
      Parkinson's disease will undergo brain scans at Massachusetts General Hospital to examine
      whether there are any relationships between muscle activity and brain function.
