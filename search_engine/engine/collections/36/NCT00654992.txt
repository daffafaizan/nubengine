      depending on the definition of AKI used. Even small increments in serum creatinine have been
      shown to be associated with increased mortality after cardiac surgery. However, there are no
      proven interventions to prevent AKI after cardiac surgery. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been
      shown to have tissue-protective effects in various experimental models. In this prospective
      placebo-controlled randomized trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of EPO in the prevention
      of AKI after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
