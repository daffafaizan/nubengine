        -  Evaluate the change in the proportion of young adult cancer survivors who are frail from
           baseline to a point five years later.

        -  Evaluate the association between frailty and worsening of chronic health conditions.

        -  Describe the association between demographic and treatment factors and risk for
           prevalent frailty.

        -  Estimate the effects of physical activity, diet and smoking on risk for prevalent
           frailty.

      Participants will complete a study questionnaire to assess social support, complete body
      composition studies, walking speed test, physical activity monitoring, and difficulties in
      daily activities due to health condition. In addition, any data collected as part of the
      SJLIFE protocol, including questionnaires, medical history and physical, height and weight
      measurements, physical functioning assessment results (i.e. hand grip strength), and
      neuropsychological evaluation results, may also be used as part of the evaluation for this
      study. The information collected for this study will be compared to information collected at
      a previous SJLIFE clinic visit within the previous 6 years.
