      disease and stroke. However, making and sustaining lifestyle changes is difficult. More
      information is needed about effective ways to help people begin to change their lifestyle
      behaviours. The investigators propose to test the feasibility of using a 'tool' in guiding
      discussions between people and health professionals about physical activity and diet, and
      support people in making decisions about why and how they might begin to fit more exercise
      and healthy food into their daily routines. The 'tool' consists of questions to help people
      think about their personal circumstances and their motivation, opportunities, capabilities
      and priorities, and includes information about heart disease and stroke.

      The investigators will explore the use of this tool in general practice, assessing patients'
      physical activity and diet behaviour after 1 and 3 months. Patients' and healthcare
      professionals' views of its use and how it influenced decisions will help to improve the
      tool's design. Participants' opinions regarding its format and method of delivery will inform
      future plans for its use and the design of a study of its effectiveness in helping people to
      begin to change their behaviour and achieve healthy lifestyles, hoping to lead to improved
      quality of life for people with heart disease and stroke.
