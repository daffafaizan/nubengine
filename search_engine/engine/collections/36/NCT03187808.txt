      the patients who meet the criteria of mechanical neck pain that is the pain provoked by
      sustained prolonged neck posture, neck movement or palpation of cervical musculature. The
      subjects will be screened by screening questionnaire, and then will be examined by a
      physiotherapist. All subjects will be required to sign an inform consent before participating
      to the study

      - The sample size was calculated by using the averaged of pain level at rest after treatment
      from the single thoracic manipulation combined with special massage group and single thoracic
      manipulation group, after the preliminary procedure that will be conducted with ten subjects
      per each group. After that, the variance was calculated by using the equation σ2 = (n1-1)s12
      + (n2-1)s22/(n1+n2)-2 and the result will be used for calculate the sample size. A drop out
      rate will be set as 20%. The effect size (∆), the significant level of lower than 0.05
      (Zα(0.05) = 1.96) and a power of test at 90 percent (Zβ(0.2)=1.28) was used to calculate in
      the equation as follow: n/group = "2(Zα + Zβ)2σ2" /"∆2"
