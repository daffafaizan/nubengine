      implantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the putamen of patients with advanced
      Parkinson's disease (PD), with half the patients receiving the implant (n = 20) and half
      receiving sham surgery (n = 20). The goals were to determine whether the cells survived and
      led to improvement of symptoms, and to examine the effect of age on results of the
      implantation. Quality of life of participants and care partners was also examined at each of
      the assessment periods (baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months). The blind was maintained for 12
      months.
