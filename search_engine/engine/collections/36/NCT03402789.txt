      There are well established therapies for this condition, which typically involve eye patching
      or atropine eye drops. Despite these therapies, a substantial proportion of treated patients
      have some degree of residual amblyopia, even when treatment takes place early during the
      critical period visual development.

      Investigators have tried to augment standard amblyopia treatment with medications that appear
      to promote visual cortex plasticity, thus addressing the neuronal pathogenesis of amblyopia.
      For example, levodopa, was described as a possible drug to treat amblyopia due to its ability
      to enhance cortical plasticity. While the rationale behind such treatments is promising,
      results from well-powered clinical trials have not shown a statistically significant effect
      of these treatments.

      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) that is
      considered essential for the maturation of the developing brain and retina. DHA, which is
      commercially available a nutritional supplement, has been added to infant formula, with
      studies showing that it improves visual development in premature infants. Randomized studies
      have shown that DHA supplementation of infant formula results in higher visual acuity in
      infants. Our proposal is aimed at conducting a prospective randomized pilot study to provide
      a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of DHA combined with daily ocular
      occlusion therapy in children and teenagers with residual amblyopia. To our knowledge, this
      would be the first study aiming to treat amblyopia with DHA. If found to be effective, DHA
      may be considered a safe and inexpensive adjunct to our conventional means of treating
      amblyopia.
