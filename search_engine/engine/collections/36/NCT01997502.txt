      Rainbow SpHb technology during surgeries. The purpose is to compare Masimo Rainbow technology
      to arterial blood samples taken during surgery. Hemoglobin concentrations in the arterial
      blood samples will be measured using standard blood analyzers on site and/or the sponsor's
      laboratory.
