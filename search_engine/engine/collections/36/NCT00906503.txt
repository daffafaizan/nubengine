        -  To determine whether ultra short-term steroid therapy (24-48 hours) can be used to
           increase the accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed
           tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging in categorizing nodules in patients with pulmonary
           nodules.

        -  To calculate the overall sensitivity and specificity of the nodules group, based on FDG
           uptake, for predicting malignancy.

        -  To gather effect-size estimates that will be used to improve the quality of a larger
           follow-up study.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dexamethasone at 40, 28, 16, and 4 hours before imaging.
      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      (PET/CT) imaging at baseline and upon completion of steroid therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 6 months.
