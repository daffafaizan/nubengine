      buprenorphine is a relatively new strategy to prevent overdose. While the literature is
      beginning to amass showing the effectiveness of this strategy for initiating people into
      treatment, a dearth of data to describe how well people are maintained in treatment remains.
      The current research project aims to 1) develop an intervention to enhance engagement and
      retention in treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder who initiate buprenorphine at
      Denver Health and 2) assess acceptability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of an
      intervention to enhance engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with opioid
      disorder compared to usual care.
