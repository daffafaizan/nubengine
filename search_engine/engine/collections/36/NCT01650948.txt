      evaluate correlations between genetic markers and particular features of AMD including
      geographic atrophy and pigment epithelial detachments. We hypothesize that patients with more
      aggressive forms of AMD will have a higher genetic burden contributed by markers in ARMS 2,
      Complement Factor H (CFH), Complement component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor
      B (FB), or other genetic polymorphisms associated with CNV.
