      United States. As evidenced by its increasing prevalence and high mortality rates, sepsis is
      a complex and difficult syndrome to treat. Current therapeutic management of sepsis includes
      fluid resuscitation, vasopressor and inotropic support, maintenance of oxygen delivery,
      drotrecogin alpha, and steroid replacement therapy in patients who are found to have adrenal
      insufficiency. Studies in septic patients suggest that the administration of stress doses of
      hydrocortisone alone, or the combination of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone promotes an
      improvement in cardiovascular performance and a quicker resolution of shock symptoms. Current
      therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of severe sepsis recommend either hydrocortisone
      alone or combination therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as therapeutic options
      for the treatment of adrenal dysfunction in severe sepsis. This study will help determine
      which regimen is more efficacious in this patient population.
