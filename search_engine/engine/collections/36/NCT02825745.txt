      epilepsy who are consuming their normal diets, but limiting intakes of foods high in
      carbohydrate and sugars.

      The participants will be required to drink Betashot to enable the following assessment:

        1. Tolerance (side effects such as bloating or cramps)

        2. Acceptability (flavour, texture, taste)

        3. Compliance (how easy it is to use Betashot at the advised quantity, as part of their
           daily diet)
