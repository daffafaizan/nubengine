        -  To identify aspects of survivorship experience that differ by clinical risk (low risk vs
           high risk) in patients with non-invasive bladder cancer.

        -  To collect and examine data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom
           management.

        -  To analyze differences in outcomes between genders, stage and grade of disease, and
           recency of diagnosis (new diagnosis vs â‰¥ 6 month diagnosis).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 45-minute telephone interview to assess their current medical
      condition and psychological functioning (i.e., bladder cancer treatment history, levels of
      depression and anxiety, quality of life, self-efficacy, and perceived social support).
      Patients complete a series of questionnaires including the Lepore social constraint measure;
      REACH social support measure; self-report inventories assessing patient communication,
      relationship style, illness intrusiveness, fear of recurrence, and social constraint; Impact
      of Events scale; Brief Symptom Index-18 and Global Severity Index; EORTC QLQ-C30 (general
      health-related quality of life); and EORTC QLC-BLS24 (disease-specific health-related quality
      of life).
