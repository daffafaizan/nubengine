      vitamin D status and muscle strength, twenty-nine swimmers, 12 female and 17 male (16-24
      years) residing at latitude 55-56°N were included to the trial conducted in March-April.
      Blood samples were analysed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH)D) and hand-grip strength
      was measured as marker of muscle strength. Subjects´ vitamin D and calcium intake were
      assessed by food frequency questionnaire and sun exposure and training status by
      questionnaires.
