    
      Design: This study will use questionnaires to assess participants cannabis habits (frequency
      and amount of use) and then employ planning strategies to help them quit. Follow up
      questionnaires will be used to ascertain the success of planning on reduction in cannabis
      use.

      Sample Size: We plan to recruit a minimum of 60 participants in each condition (120 total)
      but aim to collect data from as many participants as possible.

      Recruitment: To participate in this study a person must be over the age of 18 and a frequent
      user of cannabis. The study will be advertised online on social media platforms.

      Procedure: Potential participants will follow an online link to a briefing sheet that
      provides information about the study. The sheet will also inform participants that they do
      not have to complete the questionnaire and that they can withdraw from the study at any time
      without giving a reason. Once they have read the briefing sheet and generated their personal
      identity code, as instructed, they will complete the questionnaire online. A month after the
      participants have completed the initial questionnaire they will receive a link to a follow-up
      questionnaire via email. Email addresses will be stored separately to study data and will be
      destroyed once the follow up phase has completed and their involvement in the study ends.

      Outcomes and Analysis: The main purpose of this study is to explore the role of planning in
      encouraging people to reduce cannabis use. Quantitative analysis will be conducted to assess
      the effects of planning on cannabis use reduction. The investigators expect to find that
      planning is effective in helping people reduce their use.
