      surgical resection during the early stage has improved treatment outcomes.However, many
      patients are diagnosed with unresectable advanced or metastatic stage disease losing the
      radical surgery opportunity. Systemic chemotherapy is the leading treatment that prolongs
      survival times for such patients.

      Approximate 20 patients with unresectable gastric cancer will be enrolled in this study,the
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy and security of Apatinib + SOX(oxaliplatin+S-1) for
      unresectable gastric cancer.
