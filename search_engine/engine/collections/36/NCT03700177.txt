      relatively minor interventions can be associated with significant postoperative pain. The
      most common surgical procedure for breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy, which means
      removing a generous amount of skin and the entire breast with axillary evacuation. According
      to the literature, up to 50% of breast surgery patients experience severe acute postoperative
      pain, with 10-40% breast cancer patients experiencing pain a year or more after surgery.

      Poorly controlled postoperative pain has negative physiological and psychological
      consequences. Furthermore, effective acute pain control preserves immune function both by
      suppressing surgical stress response and decreasing the need for general anesthetics and
      opioids in the perioperative period.

      The ultrasound-guided modified, pectoral nerve block is a frequently used, easy, and reliable
      technique to provide complete analgesia during and after breast surgery. A major limitation
      to its use for postoperative analgesia is that the analgesic effect lasts only a few hours,
      after which moderate to severe pain at the surgical site may result in the need for
      alternative analgesic therapy. Several adjuvants have been used to prolong the analgesic
      duration of peripheral nerve block, including perineural/interfascial or intravenous
      dexamethasone.

      Our aim is to explore the efficacy of 8 mg dexamethasone added to US-guided modified pectoral
      nerve block on postoperative pain in patients undergoing major breast surgery.
