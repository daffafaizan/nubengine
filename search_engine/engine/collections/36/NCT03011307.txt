      investigators anticipate that intrathecal oxytocin will speed recovery from pain after major
      surgery (hip arthroplasty). For this study, the investigators will use a randomized,
      controlled and blinded study of intrathecal oxytocin in patients scheduled for hip
      arthroplasty, with primary outcome being the slope of change in pain over the first 60 days
      following surgery, using growth curve modeling and a ln(time) function.
