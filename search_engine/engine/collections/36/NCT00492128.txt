      who are uncontrolled with monotherapy. Diuretics increase the activities of
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) depress
      blood pressure potently in the state of increased RAS activities. Thus, the combination
      therapy with ARB and diuretics is expected to lower the blood pressure synergistically. This
      combination therapy is also expected to reduce the side effects of each drug. In this study,
      we will compare the effect and safety of the combination therapies between
      losartan/amlodipine and fixed dose drug of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide.
