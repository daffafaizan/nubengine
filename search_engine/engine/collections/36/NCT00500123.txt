      testing indications. All genetic tests have risks and possible benefits. The ACT study
      evaluates the population demographics, reasons for testing, and outcomes through a
      confidential testing program. Co-morbidities of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency other than
      lung and liver disease are being investigated. Concerns about genetic confidentiality are
      lessened in this study by a coded testing procedure that returns results through the mail to
      study participants.
