      I. Evaluate the response of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) per Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with recurrent/metastatic iodine refractory well
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate early positron emission tomography (PET) changes in patients with WDTC and MTC
      treated with sunitinib.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of sunitinib given as a continuous treatment in
      patients with WDTC and MTC.

      III. Evaluate the effect of sunitinib therapy on overall survival, duration of response and
      time-to-progression.

      IV. Evaluate serial tumor markers, thyroglobulin (WDTC) or calcitonin (MTC), during therapy.
      These measurements will not be used to define disease progression or response.

      V. Correlate changes in serial tumor markers with radiologic response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then for 2
      years.
