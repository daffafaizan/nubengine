      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma. II. Determine the qualitative
      and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of these drugs in this patient population. IV. Determine the antitumor
      activity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over
      60 minutes followed by ZD0473 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) may continue treatment until
      disease progression or until 2 courses after maximum response. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome and ZD0473 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and 3 months. Patients
      with PR or CR ongoing continue follow-up every 3 months until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
