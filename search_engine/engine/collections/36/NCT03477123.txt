      who have suffered anincomplete spinal cord injury. Robotic therapy arises from the new
      concepts of neuroplasticity. One of the most novel contributions in this field is robotic
      exoskeletons. However, there is still not enough scientific evidence to support the clinical
      use of this technology.

      The aim of this proposal is to assess the efficacy of a new model of robotic exoskeleton (Exo
      H2) developed by the CSIC with HNP involvement in the context of HYPER project (Consolider
      2009 call) in gait rehabilitation for people with incomplete spinal cord injury. A
      multicenter study is proposed here, involving the National Hospital of Paraplegics and the
      Institut Guttmann. Two randomized groups of patients with subacute incomplete spinal cord
      injury will be defined. In one group, protocol gait rehabilitation based on the Exo H2 will
      be established and traditional gait therapy will be adapted for control group. Both groups of
      patients were assessed performing a physical exam including functional gait scales (10 MWT,
      6MWT, WISCI II score, SCIM) and a biomechanical gait analysis with kinetic and kinematic
      techniques. Functional assessment will be carried out before intervention, at the end of the
      intervention and a follow up six weeks later.
