      deemed suitable for the study if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. 210 patients
      will be recruited to the study and each patient will be randomised into either of the groups
      allowing 105 patients into each group. Patients will be followed up at 6 months, 1 year and 2
      years after the surgery. All patients will have radiographic assessments at these follow-up
      intervals, as well as Harris Hip, Oxford Hip and Womac scores. This will allow comparison of
      the two groups.

      The BoneMaster coating has been extensively tested in cell and animal studies and has been
      evaluated in one previous clinical study and showed favorable results. Further investigation
      is required to ensure the new coating may enhance bony growth allowing better fixation of the
      hips in the early period after the operation and also over a longer period of time. The
      growth needs to be measured using a more sensitive scan than radiographic assessment alone,
      called DEXA which was also used in the previous study.
