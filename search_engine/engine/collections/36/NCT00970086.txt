      surgical interventions in the groin.

      Although the efficacy and the safety of this technique is high, nonetheless, there are
      several caveats such as unwarranted motor blockade of the lower limbs and disturbances of the
      bladder function, potentially resulting in delayed demission in the ambulatory setting. The
      effect of the blockade wears off within 4-5h post-block, making the administration of
      additional pain medication necessary.

      Peripheral nerve blockades (PNB) are an alternative to CB and have a prolonged duration of
      the analgesic effect. More recently, an alternative method to block neural structures which
      innervate lower abdominal wall has been described; the transverse abdominal plane block. The
      ultrasound guided technique improves the safety of margin. However, although this new
      technique seems to offer substantial advantages so far only experience from small case series
      are available. In particular, the TAP block has not been compared in a systematic trial with
      the "gold standard", the caudal block.
