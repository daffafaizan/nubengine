      characteristic changes of the RAS peptide profiles. In a first step this finding needs to be
      verified in a larger number of healthy subjects. Since it is unknown, whether the changes
      that were observed within hours after a single inhibitor dose are stable over time, the
      profiles also need to be investigated under steady-state conditions of the different
      inhibitors. Comparison of RAS peptide profiles after single dose and under steady-state
      conditions will also allow to detect whether the peptide profiles are altered by compensatory
      mechanisms.
