    
      Objective:

      To compare the expression levels of cardiovascular risk markers in young people between 5 and
      12 years of Toluca, Mexico and Bogota, Colombia.

      Material and methods:

      Type of study: prospective, descriptive, comparative, and longitudinal.

      Sample Calculation:

      For a cohort study and taking into account that in the investigators' previous publication in
      the Colombian population only 13% (sick rate in unexposed group) had an altered metabolic
      parameter; accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2 on a risk bilateral contrast, 57
      subjects were required in the exposed group (Mexican population) and 57 in unexposed to
      detect a minimum relative risk of 3 to find other alteration to metabolic syndrome after six
      months follow-up.

      Measurements:

      The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be applied to all children.
      Dietary history of three days and physical examination (height in cm , weight in kg and waist
      circumference in centimeters) and blood pressure (mmHg) data will be recorded. Blood samples
      will be taken to analyze glucose, cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, homocysteine and leptin.

      Statistics:

      Variables will be tested for normality through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk
      formulas. Variables related to the physiological and metabolic functions and anthropometric
      measurements will be reported in mean and standard deviation. The differences in the
      laboratorial and anthropometrical variables will be analyzed with the Student t test. A
      difference will be considered significant with a p value â‰¤ 0.05. The statistical program used
      is the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.
