      and starvation more or less prolonged of the patient dependent of surgeon's view. Decision to
      feed the patient is based on gas and feces reappearance after surgery. However, prolonged
      starvation might be uncomfortable for the patient as well as increasing his hospitalization
      stay. Moreover, delayed feeding effect on anastomosis and wound healing is controversial and
      naso-gastric tube use is known to be uncomfortable and may generate secondary adverse events.

      Some studies in opened surgery observed that early alimentation was beneficial against
      post-surgery mortality, infection risk and anastomosis dehiscence. In addition, early feeding
      seemed to decrease patient hospitalisation stay.

      In order to conduct this study, patients having a colorectal surgery will be randomly
      attributed to the nil per os group, which is based on the reappearance of a functional
      intestinal transit, or to the experimental group, which will begin alimentation 12 hours
      after colorectal surgery.
