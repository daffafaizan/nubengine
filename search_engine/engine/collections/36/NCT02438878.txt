      infant-feeding practices of a low-cost series of video trainings and tools targeted to
      medical staff and designed to support ongoing Baby Behavior education of WIC participants.
      The intervention, currently used in all California WIC agencies, teaches caregivers to
      recognize and understand healthy infant behaviors such as the range of infant cues and common
      patterns for sleep and crying. This project will also evaluate the acceptance, knowledge
      transfer, and use of the tools by health care providers and medical staff. It is expected
      that trained staff will be prepared to share Baby Behavior messages with their patients and
      that the information will be delivered quickly and easily during well-baby visits.
