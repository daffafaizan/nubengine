      inclusion criteria and gave written informed consent to participate will be randomized into
      an intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. Next, subjects of both groups will undergo
      baseline testing (online survey). The subjects of the intervention group receive a single
      educational video (online) and are motivated to follow 2 training sessions of 60 minutes
      each, during 12 consecutive weeks. Instructions for the specific exercises are provided via
      an online platform. The subjects of the control group are instructed to maintain their normal
      working activities and activities of daily life and receive no further intervention. Subjects
      of both groups are prompted to fill out a weekly online logbook to gather information on
      their physical activity and neck and/or back complaints. All subjects undergo
      post-intervention testing at 12 weeks (short term effects), 6 months, and 12 months (long
      term effects).
