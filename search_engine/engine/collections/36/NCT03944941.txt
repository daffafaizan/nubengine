      I. To evaluate whether treatment with avelumab plus cetuximab prolongs progression free
      survival (PFS) compared to avelumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the confirmed objective response rate of each treatment arm. II. To evaluate
      the clinical benefit rate of each treatment arm. III. To evaluate the PFS of cetuximab plus
      avelumab in patients that have progressed on single agent avelumab.

      IV. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) for each treatment arm. V. To evaluate toxicity
      across treatment arms of avelumab plus cetuximab and avelumab alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with avelumab failure will crossover to arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8,15, and 22 and avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles for
      cetuximab and 24 cycles for avelumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression, then every 6 months for up to 2 years.
