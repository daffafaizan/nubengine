      study. Patients will be prescribed non-hormonal pharmacotherapy tailored to the timing of
      their predominant symptoms. They will be given access to an evidence based platform for
      digital CBT for insomnia and asked to identify a partner or other companion who will commit
      to providing psychosocial support to the research participant throughout the study period.
