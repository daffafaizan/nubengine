    
      Parkinson's disease (PD), while defined by its motor abnormalities and associated
      dopaminergic loss, is invariably accompanied by cognitive impairment. Early in the disease
      course, the deficits are characterized by executive dysfunction with difficulties on tasks
      that involve information processing, attention, sorting, planning, set-shifting, and working
      memory and are subserved by neural connections with prefrontal brain regions. There has been
      little effort to identify treatments for these PD-related cognitive impairments, despite
      their disabling and distressing effects. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to conduct
      a small pilot study to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of atomoxetine, a
      selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of executive dysfunction in
      patients with PD.

      Atomoxetine (Strattera) is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. Atomoxetine enhances dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic transmission in frontal regions that are also implicated in executive
      dysfunction and thus has the potential to improve executive dysfunction in PD as well as
      other neurological conditions. Results of the study will be used to develop a larger
      placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine, if appropriate, as well as inform the design of
      other clinical trials on potential treatments for cognitive dysfunction in PD.

      The overall hypothesis is that atomoxetine will be an effective and safe treatment for
      executive dysfunction in PD.
