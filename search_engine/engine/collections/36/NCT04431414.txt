    
      This is a prospective study of acute immune responses to SARSCoV-2 infection.

      The study will include 3 groups, as described in the table below. Groups are defined based on
      clinical status at enrollment, but for the purposes of data analysis, participants who
      experience disease progression can contribute data to other cohorts.

      Participants will complete six visits over 28 days followed by a health contact at Month 2
      (one month after the last scheduled visit). Additional follow up visit(s) may be added over
      time in response to evolving information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

      Study visits may include review of medical history; interviews/questionnaires; pregnancy
      tests (for participants assigned female sex at birth); blood draws; nasal swab, nasal wash,
      and saliva sample collection; and optional stool sample collection.
