      tolerate 30% of goal-dose EN, then she/he will be randomized to Gradual or immediate
      Goal-dose EN group at day 3. Patients in Gradual Goal-dose EN group will receive increased
      calories gradually by EN and will reach the 80% of target energy by EN at day 8 while
      patients in immediate Goal-dose EN group will receive 100% of target energy by EN at day 3
      after abdominal surgery. Both groups will receive EN for 5 days except 80% of target energy
      delivered by oral feeding or patients are discharged from hospital, whichever arrives first.
      The primary and secondary outcomes will be collected.
