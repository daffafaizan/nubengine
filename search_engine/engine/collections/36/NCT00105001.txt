      I. To determine which of 3 GVHD prophylaxis regimens results in reduction of acute grades
      II-IV GVHD to =< 40%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Reduce the incidence of non-relapse mortality from infections and GVHD before day 200 to
      =< 15%.

      II. Reduce the utilization of high-dose corticosteroids compared to protocols 1463, 1641, and
      1668.

      III. Compare survival and progression-free survival to that achieved under protocols 1463,
      1641, and 1668.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: All patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes
      on days -4 to -2 and undergo total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: All patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 180 with
      taper beginning on day 100 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive MMF PO every 8 hours
      on days 0-29 and then every 12 hours on days 30-96 with taper beginning on day 40 in the
      absence of GVHD.

      ARM II: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or PO every 12 hours on days -3 to 150 with taper
      beginning on day 100 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive MMF PO every 8 hours on
      days 0-29 and then every 12 hours on days 30-180 with taper beginning on day 150 in the
      absence of GVHD.

      ARM III: Patients receive tacrolimus and MMF as in arm II. Patients also receive sirolimus PO
      once daily on days -3 to 80.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then every year
      thereafter.
