      participants with high-risk HPV, in cohorts of 3 in 3 dose ascending groups, will be
      vaccinated after SMC safety data reviews.

      This is followed by a blinded, randomised Main phase with 96 participants with high-risk HPV,
      in parallel running dose cohorts (three different doses of ChAdOx1-HPV plus two different
      doses of MVA-HPV versus placebo plus placebo boost). At least 60 of these participants will
      take part in the immunogenicity sub-study.

      A blinded, randomised expansion phase investigating the effects of up to two different main
      phase doses against placebo will be further defined prior to commencing this phase of the
      study.
