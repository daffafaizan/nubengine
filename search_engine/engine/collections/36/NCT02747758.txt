      social impairment representing approximately 7% of the population. Chronic pain conditions
      include patients with neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia, post-zoster pain or pain
      after amputations. There is a significant number of patients with pain without response to
      optimised drug therapy. Especially in these chronic pain patients there is data demonstrating
      maladaptive plasticity as pathophysiological evidence of structural changes in brain
      connectivity. Patients are treated with multimodal pain therapy concepts including
      interventional procedures with nerve infiltration techniques.

      One innovative therapeutic option for pain patients is transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS): In recent clinical trials, patients reported on reduced overall pain
      intensity following tDCS stimulation series shown e.g. from Bolognini et al., Antal et al.
      and most recently from Volz and colleagues. However, there is no current data available
      evaluating a role of tDCS for patients with chronic neuropathic pain treated with regional
      anaesthesiological techniques.

      Objective: To evaluate effect of additional tDCS series on pain in patients with chronic
      neuropathic pain

      Primary study endpoint: relative reduction in pain (initial VAS measured versus VAS after
      completion of the therapy series) as a numeric value between 0 and 10.
