      obesity and, along with it, of chronic noncommunicable diseases. There have been addressed
      various management strategies, including sugar replacement for Non-caloric Artificial
      Sweeteners (NAS). Nevertheless, in several cohort studies it has found the opposite effect,
      it has observed associations between the consumption of NAS with greater weight gain and
      increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In clinical trials, in both humans
      and mice, there has been greater association with glucose intolerance, being 3 possible
      mechanisms: 1) dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota; 2) altered regulation of appetite
      cephalic phase and secretion of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1); and 3) increased intestinal
      glucose absorption via increased Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter-1 (SGLT-1) and Glucose
      transporter 2 (GLUT2), transporters to glucose absorption.

      In the following review the major findings in the literature regarding the consumption of NAS
      and its deleterious effects on human health will be studied.
