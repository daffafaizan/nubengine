      streptococci in children who are acutely infected from those who are carriers. The hypothesis
      is that when in the carrier state, GAS exhibits unique transcriptional profiles that differ
      from those of the acute infection state. The investigators expect transcriptional profiles of
      GAS to provide important information regarding the changes the organism undergoes when
      transitioning between acute infection and carriage.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To collect longitudinal participant-samples from acute and carriage phases of GAS
           infection and compare transcriptomic profiles and whole genome sequences of GAS
           recovered from acute and carrier pharyngeal swabs obtained from the same participants.

        2. To evaluate how identified differentially expressed genes, or observed genetic
           polymorphisms, influence GAS models of bacterial colonization and pathogenesis.

      To do this, the investigators will to identify 12 children with acute pharyngitis due to
      Group A streptococcus (GAS) who are pharyngeal carriers of GAS. Thirty percent of children 4
      to 16 years of age with acute pharyngitis occurring between October and May will have a
      positive culture or rapid antigen detection test for GAS. Approximately 8-10% of these
      children with pharyngitis and a positive culture or rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for
      GAS will be carriers. Therefore,180 participants will need to be enrolled.
