      pathogens are non-susceptible to available antibiotics, causing of high clinical mortality
      (clinical impact) and high budget (economic impact), whereas new antibiotics in drug
      development are fewer. Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are categorized into one
      of the critical groups in World Health Organization's lists. In Thailand, the spread of CRE
      have been risen continuously since 2011.

      Diverse actions are designed to address antibiotic resistance with limited resources, known
      as antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). Dose-optimization by using PK/PD
      (Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics) application is recommendation of supplemental strategies
      in clinical routine practice. The benefit of the strategy is to reduce inappropriate
      antibiotic use and provide minimum resistance as well as maximum the success of clinical
      treatment.

      Antibiotic combination regimens have a role for the CRE treatment. However, current evidence
      in clinical study is not concluded which the best or optimal combined antibiotics are. The
      reasons may be that combined antibiotics often vary among different sites of infection,
      causative pathogens, the patterns of local antimicrobial susceptibility and patient
      comorbidity. As the results, the antibiotic combination regimens for the treatment any
      infections caused by CRE is needed for further investigation. The anticipated result is to
      fill the limited data of the appropriate antibiotic regimens for individual Thai patients.
