      Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, it is still widespread and deadly. As an ongoing
      pandemic, it has led to a panic and then a controlled fear in societies. In many studies,
      neuropsychological deficits were observed in Covid-19 patients both during the illness and
      after recovery. A recent study found that impairment in cognitive functions continued after
      recovery of Covid-19, and it was associated with peripherical inflammatory markers, such as
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP). CRP, as a peripherical inflammatory marker, has been proven to be
      inversely related to serum levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an
      important neurotrophin in the growth and differentiation of neurons. In this study,
      attention, working memory and executive functions of Covid-19 patients at post-covid period
      and its relation with the severity of the disease will be investigated.
