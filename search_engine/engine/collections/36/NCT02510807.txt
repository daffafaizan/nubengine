      peripheral arterial disease. Such treatment should be comprised of intermittent walking of
      sufficient distance to induce significant discomfort, and be carried out over a period of at
      least several months. Supervised exercise training utilizing intermittent treadmill walking
      is a well-validated treatment for claudication. Most prospective randomized single site
      studies have reported significant improvement in walking distance following supervised
      exercise training but not with non-supervised regimens.

      Furthermore, this has been acknowledged in both the current AHA/ACC 'Guidelines for the
      management of patients with peripheral arterial disease', which recommends supervised
      exercise training as an initial treatment modality with a Class 1A level of evidence
      (highest), as well as in the TransAtlantic Intersocietal Consensus, which provides an 'A'
      categorical recommendation. In spite of these peer-reviewed, published recommendations,
      supervised exercise training remains little used, expensive, not reimbursed by Ontario Health
      Insurance Plan, and therefore is rarely available to patients with claudication in Ontario.

      The purpose of this multicentre study is to examine whether the use of a pedometer enhances
      patient compliance with walking as compared to usual care.
