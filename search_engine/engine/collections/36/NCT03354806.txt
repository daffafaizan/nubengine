    
      Patients are allocated in two groups regarding :

        -  their eligibility to analgesic treatment using continuous peripheral nerve blocks

        -  the unability of usual pain management to reduce their pain (pain visual analogic scale
           equal to or more than 4).

      When patient 's response to pharmacological analgesic treatment is sufficient (pain visual
      analogic scale equal to or less than 3), patient is allocated to the control group.

      Patients of experimental group received a continous analgesic treatment for 6 weeks using
      ropivacaine (2mg/ml, flow rate 7 ml/h).

      Patients of control group received an analgesic treatment according the recommended pain
      ladder of World Health Organization (WHO). Opioids for mild-to-moderate pain are used in
      combination with a non-opioid analgesic, such as paracetamol, at the second step of the
      ladder. If regular maximum doses of opioids for mild-to-moderate pain do not achieve adequate
      analgesia, then they should be replaced with an opioid for moderate-to-severe pain, such as
      morphine.

      Efficiency of both treatment is assessed the improvement of oxygen level in the tissue below
      the skin of the injured forefoot through the study.
