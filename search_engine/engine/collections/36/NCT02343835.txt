      (â‰¤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and
      ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples
      will be used.

      After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered.
      Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker
      and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).

      The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation
      without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.
