      pharmacokinetic Phase I study of CBP501 and cisplatin administered as consecutive IV
      infusions according to a once-every-3-weeks schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors
      refractory to standard therapy. The study was conducted in three US centers. During the
      course of the study, an amendment was introduced (#3, October 17th, 2007; see section X9.8X)
      to allow administration of a unique dosing of single agent CBP501 prior to the initiation of
      combination therapy to enable completion of the pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of
      single agent CBP501. Pharmacodynamic analysis involving phosphoserine 216 evaluations was
      also removed. See section X16.1.1X for copies of the protocol and all protocol amendments.
      With 8 additional patients included at the recommended dose (at DL6), it was decided to stop
      all PK and CTC sampling (and therefore the day-7 CBP501 alone infusion), as sufficient
      information had been retrieved. In addition, based on evidence of efficacy observed in
      ovarian cancer patients, a further 10 ovarian and 4 endometrial cancer patients were to be
      included at the recommended dose; these patients were to be assessed for DLT to confirm the
      identification of the MTD.

      Case Report Forms were used to collect the data, and data management was carried out by
      AAIOncology. All laboratory data and Investigator observations were be transcribed into the
      CRF. ECG, U/S, MRI and CT scans were to be reported in summary in the CRF. The original
      reports, traces and films were to be retained by the Investigators for future reference. See
      section X16.1.2X for a sample CRF.
