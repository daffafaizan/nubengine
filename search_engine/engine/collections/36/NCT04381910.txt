      small cell lung cancer that progressed after first-line antitumor therapy.

      Patients were enrolled in one to three cohorts to receive LY01610 every 2 weeks, initial 30
      subjects will be included in each cohort and the number of the cases could be adjusted.
      Subjects will receive LY01610 start with 60 mg/m2 every 2 weeksï¼Œwhen the sixth subjects of
      the current cohort completed 14 days safety observation of the first LY01610 administration,
      the investigators will evaluate the ongoing dose tolerance. If the investigator and the
      sponsor jointly believe that other doses can provide greater potential benefits for patients
      while ensuring safety and benefit, other appropriate cohorts could be explored (such as 80,
      90 and 100 mg/m2, etc.) Subjects will receive the LY01610 monotherapy until occurrence of
      progressive disease (PD), death, intolerable toxicity reaction, withdrawal of informed
      consent, conduct of other antitumor therapy or completion of the whole study.
