      but also decreases plasma androgen concentrations (DHEAS and androstenedione) in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) . However the reduction in the androgen levels in PCOS is
      whether secondary to increase in the insulin sensitivity or due to direct effect of
      thiazolidinediones on steroidogenesis is not known.So far, two human studies have been
      conducted regarding the effects of rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione group of drug) on
      testosterone level, one in healthy individuals and another was in patients of type 2 diabetes
      with hypogonadism . But these studies gave equivocal results as the study population were
      different. Hence we plan to study the effects of pioglitazone on the steroidogenic enzyme
      axis in eugonadal men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
