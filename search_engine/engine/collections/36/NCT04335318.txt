      techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in assisting clinical diagnosis
      in different medical fields. One of these artificial intelligence (AI) devices to diagnose
      colon polyps during colonoscopy was launched in October 2019. Its intended use is to work as
      an adjunct to the endoscopist during a colonoscopy with the purpose of highlighting regions
      with visual characteristics consistent with different types of mucosal abnormalities.

      It is essential to know whether deep learning algorithms can really help endoscopists during
      colonoscopies. Several studies have already addressed this issue with different approaches
      and results. However, one common drawback of these type of Machine vs Human retrospective
      studies is endoscopist bias. It is usually generated because of human natural competitive
      spirit against machine or human relaxation because of AI-reliance. This can have an effect in
      the overall results.

      The investigators perfomed colonoscopies with the use of a commercially available AI system
      to detect colonic polyps and recorded them during clinical routine. Additionally from March
      2019 - May 2019, 120 colonoscopy videos were performed and captured prospectively without the
      use of AI.

      In this study, the investigators plan to retrospectively compare those two video sets
      regarding the polyp detection rate, withdrawal time and polyp identification characteristics
      of the AI system.
