      Leukopheresis is performed monocyte-derived DC are generated ex-vivo by standard culture
      techniques, utilizing GM-CSF and Il-4. PEG fusions are generated, and following irradiation,
      the vaccine is frozen. The thawed vaccine is administered SC into a single site every three
      weeks. Each study is examining a dose-escalating strategy based apon the number PEG-fused
      generated from the PEG process that expressed both tumor cell and DC markers as determined by
      immune staining.
