      Havening Techniques (treatment) versus waiting list (no treatment). Participants will be
      assessed using resilience testing (CD-RISC), and Type D measure of personality (DS14). A
      subgroup of the treatment arm will be assessed for the biomarkers of blood pressure, heart
      rate and cortisol. This parallel-group controlled trial will examine the efficacy of Havening
      Techniques at 3 timepoints; baseline (Time point 1), twenty-four hours post (Time point 2)
      and one month later (Time point 3).
