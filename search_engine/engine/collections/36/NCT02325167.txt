      psychotherapy, called Existential Behavioural Therapy (EBT), to reduce psychological distress
      in informal caregivers of palliative patients. The investigators propose to conduct a two-arm
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of EBT against usual care for the
      reduction of distress and the promotion of quality of life.

      Two one-to-one manualised psychotherapeutic sessions will be compared to a treatment-as-usual
      control group.Treatment-as-usual includes two supportive sessions.

      The design will be an unblinded RCT consisting of two conditions (EBT and
      Treatment-as-usual), with assessment at pre- and post-treatment and follow-ups at four weeks
      and six months. The trial will take place in the Clinic of Palliative Care, University of
      Munich (Klinik und Poliklinik für Palliativmedizin der LMU München).
