      everyday activity shoes (Nike, New Balance, etc.) make a shoe better or worse. There have
      been several peer-reviewed studies aimed to answer this by calculating forces and torques at
      the ankles, knees, and hips while subjects wore shoes with different properties. Such
      characteristics include heel size, cushioning and side-to-side cradling of the foot.
      Interestingly, most studies have shown that the lack of a heel, less cushioning, and less
      cradling of the foot actually improve the biomechanics related to forces and torques, thus
      decreasing wear and tear on the cartilage and bones of the leg. Wear and tear on cartilage
      and bone may predispose patients to a bone condition called "osteoarthritis", which is a
      disease where bones become damaged from rubbing on each other with breakdown of a cartilage
      "cushion". This study thus aims to directly compare traditional everyday activity shoes
      (ASICS, Nike) with a shoe created to be flatter, less cushioned, and with less cradling of
      the foot (OESH shoe).
