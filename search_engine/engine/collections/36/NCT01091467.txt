    
      -  Time 0: Patients will be screened at the time of presentation to the hospital at
           participating centres

        -  Usually patients will be hospitalised for an acute dyspnea in relation with a pulmonary
           congestion. This congestion does not necessarily justify a hospitalization and for part
           of the patients a consultation and a dedicated treatment would be good enough to cure
           the symptoms.

        -  Thus, patients seen in emergency for a congestion and diagnosed or known to have a
           preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF > 45%) will be proposed to
           participate to the study.

        -  Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be invited back to the clinic in stable
           condition, approximately 4-8 weeks after the initial hospitalization.

        -  Time 4-8 weeks after initial hospitalisation (NOT after discharge): Comprehensive
           history-taking and examinations.

        -  Any information necessary for the study will be collected by the principal investigator
           in each participating center in a dedicated, secure, e-CRF. The access to the e-CRF will
           be restrictive to the only principal investigator of each center. The lonely other
           persons able to take look to the e-CRF are the study monitors.

        -  Time 6, 12, and 18 months: Follow up by phone call or review of charts or other records
           such as death registries. This part of the study will be performed by the CRAs in the
           French Society of Cardiology
