           the drugs and therefore are planning on treating 3-6 patients with a given dose before
           increasing to higher dose levels.

        -  Each patient will receive approximately two cycles of therapy. On day one and day eight,
           they will receive taxotere, cisplatin and CPT-11 intravenously. The cycle will begin
           again on day 22.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed: CAT scan prior to beginning
           therapy, after every 2 cycles of therapy, and at the end of the study; physical exam
           before each course of therapy; vital signs before and with each dose of therapy; routine
           blood tests before starting therapy and weekly during treatment; chest x-ray and
           echocardiogram before starting therapy and; toxicity assessment each week of therapy.

        -  Patients will remain on the study as long as their cancer responds to treatment and they
           do not have unacceptable side effects.
