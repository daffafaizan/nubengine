      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effects of signaling on airway fibrosis and lung function in
      obese asthma and non-asthma patients. We will:

      •Perform assessments to determine if obese, early-onset asthma patients are more susceptible
      to airway fibrosis and remodeling than lean, early-onset asthma patients and obese and lean,
      non-asthma patients.◦

      Specific Aim 2: Investigate the mechanism by which bariatric surgery slows the progression of
      airway fibrosis in obese human asthma. We will:

      •Perform assessments to determine if airway fibrosis in obese, early-onset asthma and obese
      non-asthma patients improves following bariatric surgery and weight loss◦
