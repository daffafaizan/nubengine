    
      Study Design: A single-center, single-arm, one-stage phase II clinical trial for patients
      with recurrent grade IV glioma (glioblastoma), with two additional exploratory arms for
      patients with recurrent grade II and grade III gliomas.

      Patient Numbers: A total of 40 patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be enrolled. In
      addition, a minimum of 10 patients with recurrent grade III (anaplastic) glioma and a minimum
      of 10 patients with recurrent grade II (low-grade) glioma will be enrolled independently into
      separate exploratory arms.

      Summary of Patient Eligibility Criteria Histological confirmation of glioma, grades II - IV;
      prior first-line treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for malignant (grades
      III and IV) gliomas; age > 18 years; life expectancy >8 weeks; Karnofsky Performance Status â‰¥
      60; adequate organ function; signed patient informed consent; willingness to forego
      additional therapy until evidence of disease progression.

      End Points

      Primary: Six-month progression-free survival (PFS-6)

      Secondary: Median overall survival (mOS), median progression-free survival (mPFS), location
      of recurrence, symptomatic necrosis rate, reoperation rate, reoperation findings (estimated
      percentage of viable tumor vs. radiation effect and necrosis), and safety
