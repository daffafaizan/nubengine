      genders with all four endurance tests of the core.

      Since strength and endurance are key to keeping healthy as we age and National Institute for
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European guidelines advocate them, this study aims to
      look at the 3 main measurements of core endurance namely flexor, extensor and lateral
      muscles, and the possible correlations with age, PAL, existence of LBP, BMI and gender. Each
      participant performed 4 isometric core endurance tests in the same order- 1.
      Biering-Sorensen, 2.-3. side plank on both sides, and 4. McGill V-sit. All participants were
      tested by the same tester to reduce potential differences in procedure and testing error. The
      four tests were each measured using a stopwatch and documented in seconds. Each participant
      was told the time they had reached during testing to improve their motivation. Pain during
      testing was documented.

      Based on the normative data of abdominal muscle endurance for young adults Null hypothesis
      (H0)- There is no significant difference in endurance tests for age, presence of LBP or PAL.
      Hypothesis (H1)- Any significant difference in endurance tests for age, presence of LBP or
      PAL are due to chance factors. This is a two-tailed hypothesis, as previous evidence shows
      conflicting results. Pearson's correlation and Independent T-test in SPSS (The Statistical
      Package for the Social Sciences) were used to confirm or reject the possible correlations
      between the core muscle endurance and age, LBP, PAL, gender, BMI, and participants' job.
