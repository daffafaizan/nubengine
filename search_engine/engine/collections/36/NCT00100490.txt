      evaluation to determine eligibility after signed informed consent is obtained. If eligible,
      the subject will complete questionnaires and undergo structured clinical interviews with a
      study psychiatrist. The subject will then undergo a 2-day testing period during which time,
      blood is drawn each morning at 8 am, with the subject taking 0.5 mg of dexamethasone (a
      synthetic steroid) at 11 pm prior to the second day of blood testing. About 80 ml of blood
      will be drawn on each morning. The blood collected will then be assayed for cortisol
      dexamethasone, lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor levels; cytokine levels in plasma and
      lipopolysaccharide stimulated and unstimulated whole blood (IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-6, sIL-6R, and
      IL-10); lymphocyte subsets (T helper and suppressor, B, and Natural Killer cell numbers), and
      antigen stimulation responses to tetanus and candida. In addition, blood from the first day
      of testing will undergo ex vivo challenge with dexamethasone at varying concentrations to
      determine differential cytokine sensitivities to steroid exposure in subjects.
