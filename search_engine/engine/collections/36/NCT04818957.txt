    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy of oral thin film (OTF) cholecalciferol
      (vitamin D3) replacement in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients who
      failed to achieve or sustain adequate vitamin D levels after vitamin D supplementation using
      current standard of care, or those unable to take/tolerate currently available enteral
      vitamin D formulations. With oral thin film (OTF) cholecalciferol, investigators hope to
      significantly improve the ease of administration, restoring compliance and facilitating
      therapeutic vitamin D levels without relying on the gut for absorption.
