      Elevated apoB levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.
      Hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBLP) is characterized by apoB levels less than the 5 percentile.
      Dr. Welty, the principal investigator, sequenced mutations for truncated forms of apoB-67,
      apoB-55 and apoB-44.4 which causes HBLP, described a kindred from the Framingham Heart Study
      with HBLP due to an unidentified apoB gene mutation and purified apoB-67 containing
      lipoprotein particles. Heterozygous apoB-67 subjects have one normal allele making apoB-100;
      therefore, apoB levels would be predicted to be at least 50 percent of normal; however, they
      are 24 percent of normal. Dr. Welty has shown that these lower than expected levels result
      from decreased production of VLDL apoB-100, LDL apoB-100 and apoB-67, increased catabolism of
      VLDL apoB-100, and increased direct removal of apoB-67 from VLDL.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The first aim is to locate the apoB gene mutation in the Framingham kindred. The second aim
      is to perform stable isotope studies in the apoB-55 and apoB-44.4 kindreds to determine if
      apoB metabolism for these shorter truncations is similar to that for apoB-67. In aim three,
      apoB-100 synthesis is studied in heterozygous apoB-70 transgenic mice. If it is 25-25 percent
      of normal litter mates, the mechanism for this reduction in apoB-100 levels will be studied
      in hepatocytes isolated from the transgenic mice. In specific aim 4, size and composition of
      VLDL are compared in apoB-67 subjects and controls to determine if larger size or
      compositional changes account for the faster catabolism of VLDL apoB-100. The study has been
      extended through June 2007.
