      given the fact that 10% of the procedures may fail. It has been suggested that using variable
      stiffness colonoscope (a colonoscope with a shaft that the stiffness can be altered), or even
      more sophisticated magnetic imaging colonoscopy (colonoscopy performed under a magnetic
      position detection sensor), could improve the success rate. However, these kinds of equipment
      are either expensive or not always available in the daily clinical practice. From some recent
      studies it was shown that adding a transparent cap to the tip of the colonoscope may improve
      the procedure success rate without increasing the complication rate of the procedure. The
      cost of the cap is cheap and it is available in almost every endoscopy center. Therefore the
      cap-assisted colonoscopy method may be an alternative which may improve the success rate of
      colonoscopy procedure, and reduce the pain and discomfort related to the procedure.
