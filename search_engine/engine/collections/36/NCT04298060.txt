      doses, placebo-controlled study that will investigate the efficacy of DAS181 for the
      treatment of serious IFV in hospitalized patients who suffered from acute hypoxemia requiring
      supplemental oxygen therapy.

      Cohort 2: It is designed as an open-label study that will investigate the efficacy of DAS181
      for the treatment of patients with sever IFV but not eligible for Cohort 1 and non-IFV SAD
      viral infection, e.g. parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus and all strains
      of Î²-coronaviruses (including but not limited to SARS-CoV-2), with hypoxemia requiring
      supplemental oxygen therapy.
