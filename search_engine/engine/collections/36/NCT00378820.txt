      intervention studies suggest that milk has special growth stimulating properties especially
      regarding body size, bone mass and gut. We have previously shown that a one week high-dose
      intervention with milk, but not meat, increased fasting IGF-I and insulin levels in
      prepubertal boys. It is not clear which milk compounds are responsible for the growth
      stimulation. Through short term intervention studies in prepubertal children, we will test
      the effects of whey, casein, and milk minerals (especially Ca/P). Outcomes will be IGF-I,
      IGFBP-3, p-amino acids, oral glucose tolerance test (insulin, glucose, GLP-1 and 2,
      C-peptide, proinsulin) and markers for bone turn-over in blood and urine (s-osteocalcin,
      s-bone alkaline phosphatase, urine Dpyr, Ntx) as well as blood pressure. Exploring the growth
      stimulating effects of these milk components will improve the understanding of dietary
      effects on growth and bone metabolism, and will be valuable for the diary industry developing
      dietary products supporting growth e.g. infant formula, products for clinical nutrition and
      milk based products for nutritional rehabilitation of malnourished children in developing
      countries.
