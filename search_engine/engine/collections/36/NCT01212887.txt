      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T
           lymphocytes in combination with preconditioning chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide
           and fludarabine phosphate plus aldesleukin in patients with CEA-positive tumors.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the dose of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes
           required to give optimal survival of these cells in the circulation (recommended phase
           II dose).

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes isolated
           from the circulation are functional.

        -  To determine the preliminary tumor response to MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA
           MFEz T lymphocytes.

        -  To evaluate the safety of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis 7-14 days before study therapy begins. Cells are then
      transduced with a retrovirus vector and expanded to produce MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      Patients receive preconditioning chemotherapy comprising fludarabine phosphate IV over 15
      minutes on days -5 to -1 or cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -6 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 15 minutes on days -5 to -1. They receive MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive high-dose
      aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 12 doses beginning on day 0, in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If there is evidence of MFE23
      scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes survival, patients may receive
      additional high-dose aldesleukin.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      studies. Some patients may undergo a tumor biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 6 weeks,
      every 4 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
