      control. Accurate CO measurements can serve as a guide for resuscitation therapy,
      catecholamine use, differential diagnosis, and intervention during a circulatory failure.
      Although the thermodilution technique via a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has an invasive
      and intermittent, it remains the gold standard for CO measurements.

      Previously monitoring of CO required invasive and costly devices limiting their use to
      intensive care setting. More recently ultrasound is increasingly being used and offers a
      range of non-invasive tools to estimate CO.

      Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has been used as a reference technique for CO
      measurement and its accuracy has been adequate for many clinical uses. TTE is painless, safe
      and non-invasive. Some drawbacks of TTE are being expensive, bulky and needs advanced
      training.

      Currently, due to increased interest in minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring, multiple
      new methods have become commercially available to assess CO: the arterial pulse aortic flow,
      bioreactance, and bioimpedance.

      One of these new devices is LiDCOrapid (LiDCO Ltd, Cambridge, UK). It is a new, minimally
      invasive monitor which estimates beat-by-beat CO and fluid responsiveness from the arterial
      waveform.

      It has been validated after vascular, urological and thoracic surgery and shows good
      agreement with the PA catheter in swine, in patients with normal left ventricular systolic
      function and in patients with vasodilatation. However, LiDCO has not yet been validated in
      patients with septic shock. Therefore, the aim of this study is to validate LiDCOrapid
      parameters in septic shock patients using TTE derived parameters as the non-invasive
      reference.
