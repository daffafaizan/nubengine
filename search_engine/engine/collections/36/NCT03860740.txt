      Exercise is a safe and effective treatment for women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), that
      has an integral benefit during and after treatments, however, the effect at the tumour
      microenvironment it is unknown; previous studies have evaluated the association between
      exercise and BC, finding a positive influence on it, which suggest that exercise could reduce
      the aggressiveness of the tumour. This study will explore the exercise impact in tumor
      microenvironment, as part of the therapy given to the patients prior to surgery and
      treatment. In addition, different serum biomarkers involved and the tailoring of exercise for
      these women will be evaluated. The effect of exercise on treatments secondary effects,
      biomarkers and quality of life will be evaluated after 6 months of BC surgery. This project
      will open a window of opportunity to explore new translational research as well as new
      treatment vias to the patients of this breast cancer subgroup.
