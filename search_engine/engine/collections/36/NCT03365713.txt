    
      The investigators will determine whether case-finding for COPD can be facilitated using
      5-item questionnaires with and without a measurement of Peak-Flow. The investigators
      hypothesise that 5-item questionnaires will be a valid case-finding tool for COPD in LMIC and
      will be acceptable and feasible for use in these settings.

        1. Clinical Aim: Determine the diagnostic accuracy of the case-finding questionnaires with
           and without PEF.

        2. Implementation Aim: Assess the appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility of using
           questionnaires and PEF to identify COPD cases from the perspective of local community
           members, community health workers, local health centre physicians and ministries of
           health.

      The design of the intervention will be informed by formative work prior to commencement of
      the main study.

      Study fieldworkers will enroll and screen a randomly-selected age- and sex-stratified
      population sample of adults aged â‰¥40 years; a total of 10,500 between the following three
      countries in the catchment areas of existing community census areas in Bhaktapur (Nepal),
      Lima (Peru), and Nakaseke (Uganda).

      The investigators will report the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of
      the case-finding questionnaire, with and without PEF, in relation to a gold standard COPD
      diagnosis made at spirometry (post-bronchodilator FEV1/VC ratio <LLN, with a history of
      significant respiratory exposure to tobacco smoke or biomass). The investigators will
      construct ROC curves to visualise trade-offs in sensitivity and specificity across a range of
      questionnaire cut off values.

      The investigators will also examine the feasibility of implementing a 5 item questionnaire
      +/- PEF intervention at scale.
