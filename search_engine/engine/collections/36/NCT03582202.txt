      IT, tables in C). The IT was in addition assessed for adapted weight-loss, counseled with a
      plan for nutrition and followed-up daily by the dietician if at nutritional risk. All
      patients were re-screened weekly and had their intake registered. Hand-grib-strength (HGS)
      was measured in both groups at admittance and discharge, and weight three times weekly.

      The primary endpoint was re-admission rate to hospital within 2 months.
