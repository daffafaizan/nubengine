      risks will be calculated based on the values of the risk factors using cardiovascular risk
      models. The estimates of different risk models will be compared, and the levels of
      traditional risk factors will be adjusted in order to evaluate the impacts of uncommon risk
      factors such as social and genetic risk factors.
