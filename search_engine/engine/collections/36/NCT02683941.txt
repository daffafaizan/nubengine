    
      As planned initially, a total of 216 eligible patients with well-differentiated typical or
      atypical, metastatic and/or unresectable lung NETs, and a positive somatostatin receptor
      imaging (SRI) (Octreoscan® ≥ grade 2 Krenning scale; Ga-PET scan: uptake greater than liver
      background), had to be randomized 2:1 to either LAN plus BSC (120mg/28 days) or placebo plus
      BSC following the stratification of 1) typical versus atypical and 2) prior chemotherapy
      versus no prior chemotherapy*. At the time of the premature stop of the recruitment (as per
      Protocol Amendment #5), 77 patients have been enrolled. All patients still treated in the DB
      Phase have been entered into the OL Extension Phase (either for Follow up or for OL treatment
      periods). The transition to the OL Extension periods was done on a country-basis and per
      patient, at the following planned scheduled visit (i.e. approximately 28 days from the last
      injection). Patients enrolled into the study not progressing at the time of transition, and
      who agree to stay on LAN therapy (i.e. OL Treatment Period) not progressing at the time of
      transition, and who agree to stay on LAN therapy (i.e. OL Treatment Period) will receive the
      study active treatment until evidence of disease progression (based on local radiological
      assessment then confirmed centrally), development of unacceptable toxicity, or premature
      withdrawal for any reason or up a maximum of 18 months after the last patient randomized.
      After disease progression patients are followed for survival, QoL and all subsequent
      anticancer treatments in the OL Follow-up period up to the end of the study (i.e up to 18
      months after the last patient randomized).

      * cytotoxic chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy or interferon.
