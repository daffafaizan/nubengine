    
      BT062 is an antibody-drug conjugate designed to bind and destroy Myeloma cells. The study
      drug is being given in multiple doses with standard Multiple Myeloma treatments, lenalidomide
      and dexamethasone, to test how well the treatments are tolerated and work together. This
      study is a dose escalation study with the purpose to find out the highest dose of BT062 that
      a subject can tolerate in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
