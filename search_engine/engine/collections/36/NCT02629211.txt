      before the age of 18. IBD primary includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Studies have shown that the current incidence of pediatric IBD ranges from 4-7 cases per
      100,000, worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of IBD is important for correct prognosis,
      course of disease, therapeutic decisions and follow-up. Complete diagnostic work-up is key to
      proper diagnosis in patients.Early diagnosis of IBD and differentiation between UC and CD can
      be difficult in children. The major issues that face pediatric IBD today include accurate
      disease classification, unknown extent of disease, complete bowel visualization, inability to
      reach depth of findings, and biopsy retrieval for diagnostic work-up.

      The NaviAid™ AB device presents a new and unique concept that helps overcome these short
      comings of IBD diagnosis and treatment. Through repetitive inflation and deflation of the
      NaviAid™ AB, the endoscope can be swiftly advanced deep into the small bowel via the proximal
      or distal route, allowing for complete visualization of the small bowel and easy biopsy
      sampling for histopathology. As a result, subsequent diagnoses can influence proper action
      for further treatment and therapy for the patient. Although many studies have reported on the
      safety and efficacy of balloon enteroscopy in adults with IBD, further investigation of the
      value of balloon enteroscopy in pediatric patients with known or suspected IBD is still
      required.

      This is a single-center, non-randomized open-label study intended to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the NaviAid™ AB device during small bowel enteroscopy in children with known or
      suspected IBD.
