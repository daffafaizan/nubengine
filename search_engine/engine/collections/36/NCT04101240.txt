      prognosis. Up to 40% of surgical oncologic patients receive red blood cells (RBC). However,
      transfusion is associated with adverse events, and equipoise remains on the optimal
      transfusion strategy in oncologic patients in surgical setting. The primary objective of this
      study is to determine the impact of anemia and red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on
      post-operative complications and mortality. This is a retrospective, single center study. All
      adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after oncologic surgery within the study
      period are eligible.
