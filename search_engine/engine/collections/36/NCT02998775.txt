    
      E7080-A001-010 is a multicenter, parallel-group study in participants with mild, moderate, or
      severe hepatic or renal impairment and age-, gender-, and smoking status-matched healthy
      participants. Approximately 6 participants with each degree (mild, moderate, or severe) of
      hepatic or renal impairment will be enrolled. Two cohorts of 8 healthy participants will be
      enrolled. One cohort of healthy participants will be matched to the hepatic-impaired
      participants, whereas the other will be matched to the renal-impaired participants.

      The study has 2 phases. The Pre-study Phase consists of a Screening Period and a Baseline
      Period. The Study Phase consists of a 2-day Study Period. No lenvatinib will be administered
      in this study.

      The end of the study will be the date of the last study visit for the last participant in the
      study.

      The following estimates are provided:

        -  From first participant in to last participant out, the study is expected to take
           approximately one year to complete.

        -  The maximum estimated duration of the study for each participant is anticipated to be
           approximately 5 weeks.
