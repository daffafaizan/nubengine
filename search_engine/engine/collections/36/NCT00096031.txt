        -  Determine the 6-month overall survival of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
           esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with cetuximab as second-line therapy.

        -  Determine the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial), time to
           progression, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, gene expression and germline polymorphism of enzymes and genes
           involved in the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, DNA repair, and angiogenesis
           with time to progression, response, overall survival, toxic effects, and time to
           treatment failure in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats once weekly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until 3 years from
      the date of study registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-14
      months.
