      study to identify whether EA is a beneficial anesthesia adjunct in children undergoing
      procedures on their congenital heart defects.

      Study subjects age's birth to eighteen years, undergoing cardiac surgery for their congenital
      heart lesions will be considered for entrance into the study. The randomized subjects will
      receive either EA or sham during their surgery for CHD. Subjects are expected to remain in
      the hospital 48 hours post procedure. Standard of care blood samples will be obtained
      pre-operative and post-operative. The only study specific blood sample will be Troponin I
      levels which will be obtained before surgery begins after the IV lines have been placed, and
      6 hours after bypass. Urine samples will be obtained before surgery after placement of the
      foley catheter and every 6 hours post bypass aortic cross clamp removal for 48 hours while
      the foley catheter is still in place.
