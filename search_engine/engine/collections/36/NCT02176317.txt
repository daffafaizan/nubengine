      Currently, available treatments for patients with ASD are supportive, but not curative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been shown to lessen the clinical and radiographic impact of
      hypoxic brain injury and stroke in animal models and in infants with hypoxic ischemic
      encephalopathy. UCB also engrafts and differentiates in the brain, facilitating neural cell
      repair in animal models and human patients with inborn errors of metabolism undergoing
      allogeneic, unrelated donor UCB transplantation. Infusion of autologous UCB does not require
      immunosuppression and has been shown to be safe in young children with brain injuries such as
      cerebral palsy and stroke. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that infusion of a
      patient's own umbilical cord blood cells (UCB) can offer neural protection/repair in the
      brain and reduction of inflammation associated with this disorder.
