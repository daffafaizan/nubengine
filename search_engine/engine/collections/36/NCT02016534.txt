    
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, single arm, 2 cohort study to assess the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in MET amplified Gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma or other solid
      tumors. Approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with MET
      amplified G/E adenocarcinoma with measurable tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified
      solid tumors with measurable tumor/up to 10 subjects with MET amplified G/E adenocarcinoma
      with non-measurable tumor/up to 10 subjects who have received prior MET antibody therapy).
      All subjects will self-administer AMG 337 300 mg daily until disease progression or other
      protocol specified end of treatment criteria is met.

      Tumor tissue, biomarkers, Pharmacokinetics and Patient reported Outcomes will all be
      assessed.

      Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study treatment.
