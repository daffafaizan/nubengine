      population at risk of reduced oxygen levels during sleep, poor sleep and increased breathing
      effort . All of the above put stress on the body and are proven to increase the risk of high
      blood pressure, heart failure and vascular problems. This can lead to strokes, heart disease
      and death.

      Sleep apnoea patients are at much higher risk of abnormal heart rhythms. Even with continuous
      positive airways pressure (CPAP) treatment (which is the mainstay in sleep apnoea and does
      help to reduce arrhythmias) patients are still at higher risk of heart disease and stroke.

      An implantable loop recorder (Reveal-LINQ) inserted into sleep apnoea patients will be able
      to continuously monitor a patient's heart rhythm. This will determine the incidence of
      arrhythmia in sleep apnoea patients. Any significant abnormalities in either arm of the study
      will be treated as per National Health Service guidelines and best care. The cost associated
      with this method of intervention will also be considered.

      If there is a high prevalence of arrhythmia a future larger trial, involving much larger
      numbers and multiple centres, could be conducted to demonstrate reduced risk of stroke or
      heart attack using this method of arrhythmia detection and management.

      Cardiovascular biomarkers, cardiac function, autonomic function and magnetocardiography in
      these patients could shed light on the mechanisms which cause increased cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality.
