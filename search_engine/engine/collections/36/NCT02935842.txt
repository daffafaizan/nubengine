      In addition, severe verbal fluency (VF) decline has been repeatedly observed in the context
      of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. Interestingly, while PD non-DBS patients have deficits
      with respect to loudness and intelligibility of their voice, PD patients who have undergone
      DBS (PD-DBS) suffer rather from difficulties in semantic and phonemic word retrieval, and
      from speech apraxia symptoms.

      However, to-date and to the best of our knowledge, therapeutic approaches focusing
      specifically on SL deficits observed in PD-DBS patients are yet to be developed and evaluated
      regarding their effectiveness. Thus, this study investigates the short-and longterm
      effectiveness of specific and intensive, high-frequency speech-language therapy in terms of
      reducing SL-deficits compared to a nonspecific and non-verbal sham treatment (i.e. a rhythmic
      balance-movement training (rBMT)) as well as to a 'no-therapy' condition.
