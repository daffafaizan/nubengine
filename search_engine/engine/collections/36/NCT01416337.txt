    
      This Phase I, open-label, non-randomized study is designed to determine the absolute
      bioavailability of the standard 2 mg tablet formulation of GSK1120212 co-administered with an
      intravenous microdose (5 Î¼g) dose of [14C]-labelled GSK1120212 (7.4 kBq) in subjects with
      solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic sampleswill be obtained up to 10 days post-dose. Safety
      assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory values (hematology
      and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed throughout the study. After
      completing all assessments, eligible subjects may transition to MEK114375, an open-label,
      rollover study to continue treatment with GSK1120212.
