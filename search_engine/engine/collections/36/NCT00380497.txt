      that children do not tolerate well. Many pediatric centers in North America use Poly-Ethylene
      Glycol and electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS, GolytelyÂ®) for bowel lavage administered in a large
      volume, often causing nausea, vomiting and bloating. This is often poorly tolerated by
      children who usually require the insertion of a nasogastric tube and a day admission.
      Recently, Pico-Salax was approved in Canada for bowel cleanout in children. It is
      administered in two divided doses, each in one cup of water; it is palatable and does not
      have to be given in hospital. However, no controlled study in children compared it with the
      current standard of care. Our preliminary experience and previous literature suggest that it
      is effective and well tolerated. We propose to study whether colon cleanout for colonoscopy
      with Pico-Salax is better tolerated than Golytely in children, by a single blinded randomized
      controlled trial. Positive results of this study will facilitate a better tolerated regimen
      for bowel clean out in children.
