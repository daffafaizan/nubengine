      contending with illness, trauma or loss, the support services provided at even top-tier
      medical facilities are overwhelmingly focused on the individual patient. In most cases,
      combined treatment with spouses and family members is the exception rather than the rule.

      FOCUS is one of the very few programs that has a strong evidence base and has been used in
      medical settings. It is a preventive, skill-based training program that is customized for
      each couple or family and is designed to build upon existing strengths in order to enhance
      family and individual resilience.

      A cancer diagnosis is a family affair. Research has shown that the family or spousal
      relationship can be instrumental in lessening patient distress and supporting treatment
      compliance and positive adjustment across the various stages of treatment, survivorship,
      recurrence / relapse, and end-of-life. Reductions in patient depression and anxiety through
      couple or family interventions may reduce overall healthcare utilization and cost while
      improving care quality.
