      aortic stent graft via the femoral route. This technique is commonly used in high surgical
      risk patients but can also be suitable under certain conditions for normal risk patients.

      Abdominal aortic stent grafts, inserted via the femoral artery, are used to treat infrarenal
      abdominal aortic aneurysms, removing the need for an invasive surgical procedure.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the long-term (5 year) benefits of the
      technique by documenting the overall mortality, complications (endoleak, migration), rate of
      surgical conversion, progression and rupture of the aneurysm in a cohort of patients who are
      representative of the treated population under real conditions of use.
