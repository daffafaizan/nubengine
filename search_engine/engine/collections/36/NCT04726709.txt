      participate in a real-time online course called "Poised for Parkinson's." The course will
      meet twice per week via Zoom for eighteen 105-minute sessions. Outcome measures, including
      surveys, interviews, balance, and motor performance, will be assessed the week before classes
      begin and the week after classes end.
