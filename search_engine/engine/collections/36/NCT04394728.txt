      not responsive to the first-line treatment based on anthracycline/ifosfamide. Patients
      underwent trabectedin monotherapy that was administered intravenously at the dose of 1.3
      mg/m2 every 21 days.

      Single overnight fasting urine and blood samples were collected on day-1 of the first
      trabectedin administration.

      Plasma pharmacokinetics was performed during cycle 1. Blood samples, drawn from a site
      separate from the drug infusion site, were obtained prior to the infusion (basal) at 2, 8, 24
      (end of infusion) and 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24.0 after the end of the infusion. Plasma
      concentrations of trabectedin were measured by liquid chromatography, tandem mass
      spectrometry assay (LC-MS/MS) and the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Clearance, AUC and
      T1/2) were calculated from the concentration-time curve using a non-compartmental model.

      Metabolomics profiles were explored by LC-MS/MS in predose urine and serum and encompassed a
      total of 192: a) 45 amino acid derivatives, virtually involved in a wide set of biochemical
      pathways; b) 40 different acylcarnitines, principally involved in the cellular energy
      metabolism; c) 15 lysophosphatidylcholine metabolites, 77 phosphatidylcholine derivatives,
      and 15 sphingomyelins, involved in fatty acid metabolism and cellular signaling. The
      identification of predictive metabolomics biomarkers is performed using univariate and
      multivariate statistical analyses.
