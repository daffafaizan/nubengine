    
      In this study, the same patients who were enrolled in a previous study of PTC124 (protocol
      number PTC124-GD-005-CF) will be treated with the investigational drug PTC124 for a period of
      84 days. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination, blood and urine tests to
      assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and CF-specific tests) to
      determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within 21 days prior to the
      start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will be assigned to
      receive PTC124 treatment (based upon TEPD results from the previous study) at 1 of the 2
      following dose levels:

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 4 mg/kg at breakfast, 4 mg/kg at
           lunch, and 8 mg/kg at dinner, or

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 10 mg/kg at breakfast, 10 mg/kg at
           lunch and 20 mg/kg at dinner.

      During the study, PTC124 efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated
      periodically with measurement of transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), medical
      history, physical examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, sputum tests, ECGs, chest x-ray, and
      pulmonary function tests.
