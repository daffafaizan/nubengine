      diseases and metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is associated with systemic inflammation and
      proinflammatory cytokines.Clinical observations and experimental results argue for an
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant property of MET.

      A randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      metformin as add-on therapy to MTX compared to MTX after 24 weeks in patients with PsA.

      The study randomized 56 patients with a diagnosis of PsA . Patients with a history of a
      cardiovascular event and diabetics were excluded. Body mass index (BMI) and classic
      cardiovascular risk factors were recorded. Blood samples were analysed for glucose, lipid
      profile, ESR, hsCRP, proinflammatory cytokines; tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-17. The homeostasis model assessment model for insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR) was used. The patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 500mg/day retarded
      formulation of metformin (n=29) or placebo (n=29). Continuation of stable doses of MTX
      (25mg/week), NSAIDs, and/or corticosteroids (prednisone <10 mg/day) was permitted. Metformin
      drug pause on the day of MTX was given. Folic acid supplementation was given to both groups.
      The primary clinical endpoint was the ACR 20% (ACR20) response at 24 weeks. Secondary
      endpoints included reduction in PASI score, Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index
      (HAQ-DI) and Psoriatic arthritis response criteria (PsARC) score.
