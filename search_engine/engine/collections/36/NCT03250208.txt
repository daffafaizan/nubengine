      within the lower urinary tract, the vagina, and the peri-rectal area in response to an oral
      probiotic as well as to evaluate the stability of these changes following cessation of an
      oral probiotic. Voided urine and peri-urethral, vaginal, and peri-rectal swab samples will be
      analyzed for their Lactobacillus E. coli ratio using bacterial culture as well as 16S
      ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The study will compare the ratios present before, during, and
      after oral probiotic usage. The study will also compare the change in ratios between subjects
      taking the oral probiotic and those taking an oral placebo.

      A secondary aim is to identify the normal daily changes (i.e. stability) in the bacterial
      populations within the voided urine, including whether host intrinsic (e.g. diet, hygiene,
      and sexual activity) and extrinsic (e.g. menstruation) factors affect the stability of
      bacterial populations. The bacterial populations defining the voided urine samples will be
      correlated to various daily subject-reported lifestyle variables. These include diet,
      hygiene, sexual activity, medication usage, alcohol usage, menstruation, and urinary-related
      symptoms. These lifestyle variables will be recorded each day for the entire duration of the
      study.
