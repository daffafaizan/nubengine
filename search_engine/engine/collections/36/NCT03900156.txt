      modifiable. There is a need for robust evidence about the potential for prevention of
      cognitive decline through behavior change interventions.

      This study involves the development, implementation and initial testing of a behavior change
      intervention. At the 1st year, a small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) will
      investigate the implementation of a goal-setting intervention aim at promoting behavior
      change of personal modifiable risks for cognitive decline in the community for >55 years with
      at least one of the 7 modifiable risk factors for dementia. These older participants in the
      community (n = 100) will be randomized to either control (had a discussion regarding health
      and daily activity) or goal-setting with mentoring (the goal-setting interview involving
      identification of up to five personal goals of personal modifiable risks). All participants
      will be reassessed after 12 months. The 2nd to the 5th year, is a multisite, prospective, RCT
      with 36 months intervention. Recruitment of 300 older people (â‰¥55 years) with at least one of
      the 7 modifiable risk factors for dementia will take place in Northern Taiwan. Participants
      randomised to the intervention condition will have access to an interactive internet
      platform, stimulating self-management of dementia risk factors, with remote mentoring by a
      mentor.
