      there are a few studies on the effects of foam-rolling massage and they have conflicting
      results regarding the improvements in ROM and muscular performance. In contrast, neurodynamic
      mobilization (NM) is a manual therapy method used to assess and treat neuromuscular
      disorders. It includes gliding techniques and tensile techniques. Gliding techniques or
      "sliders" are intended to produce a sliding movement between neural structures and adjacent
      nonneural tissues. NM has been shown to reduce pain and soreness and improve ROM. However, no
      studies have investigated its effects after exercise-induced muscle soreness or DOMS.
