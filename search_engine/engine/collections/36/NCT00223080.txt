      to control the HIV pandemic. In this phase III efficacy trial, a 'prime-boost' vaccine
      strategy is evaluated for prevention of infection and amelioration of disease course.
      ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) from sanofi pasteur is given as the 'prime' vaccine at months 0, 1, 3 and
      6; AIDSVAX gp120 B/E from VaxGen is given as the 'boost' at months 3 and 6. This regimen will
      be given to 8,000 adult Thai subjects, while another 8,000 will be given placebos in a
      double-blinded, randomized manner. Following the completion of each subjects immunization
      phase, he/she will be followed for 3 years with clinic visits every 6 months with HIV
      testing, pre- and post-test counseling. Subjects who become HIV infected will be counseled,
      referred to HIV treatment facilities for management according to national guidelines, and
      offered enrollment in a protocol for extended follow-up.
