      non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies in patients deemed to be 'high risk'
      according to current scientific guidelines. In the real world, however, statin treatment is
      often discontinued due to side effects.

      In addition, statins are not indicated in those subjects deemed to be 'low risk', in whom
      only non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies are currently prescribed.

      Along with non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies, newer approaches to
      reduce cholesterol blood levels currently include nutraceuticals, which are compounds derived
      from foods with cholesterol lowering actions.

      In the real world clinical practice, however, it remains unclear if nutraceuticals yield
      additive therapeutic effects to non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies in
      patients in whom statin treatment is not tolerated or is not indicated.

      The primary objective of this study is twofold:

      First, to prospectively compare in the real world clinical practice the efficacy and
      tolerability of non-pharmacologic intervention vs. the combination of non-pharmacologic
      intervention with a nutraceutical-based protocol in patients in whom statin treatment is not
      tolerated or is not indicated.

      Second, to evaluate gender and race/ethnic differences in the hypolipidemic effects of a
      nutraceutical-based protocol among European countries.

      Patients will be assigned at the discretion of their own general practitioner to receive for
      1 year either non-pharmacologic intervention and prevention strategies or non-pharmacologic
      intervention and prevention strategies associated with a commercially available nutraceutical
      combined pill (1 capsule/day containing red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, and
      berberine 500 mg).
