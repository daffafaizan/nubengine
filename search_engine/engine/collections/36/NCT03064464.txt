    
      Eligibility criteria:

        1. Inclusion criteria: Patients (Child, Adult) with infections caused by S. aureus from the
           sites as follows: blood stream, skin or soft tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bone and
           joint, genitourinary tract, infection of indwelling intravascular device, surgical
           wound, respiratory tract (organism grown from sputum and infiltrate on chest X-ray),
           peritoneal fluid or other otherwise sterile body fluids.

        2. Exclusion criteria: Patients with S. aureus from anterior nares or throat swabs cultures
           (colonization).

      Outcome measures:

        1. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection
           rates in patients with S. aureus infections in Chinese hospitals.

        2. Risk factors and clinical outcomes of CA-MRSA infection

        3. Molecular characteristics of CA-MRSA isolates recovered in Chinese hospitals.

      Definition:

      A MRSA infection was considered to be HA-MRSA by the CDC epidemiologic definitions if, in the
      year prior to culture, the subject had surgery, hospitalization, hemodialysis or a stay in a
      long-term care facility, if an indwelling vascular catheter was in place at the time of
      culture, or if the subject was an inpatient hospitalized for 2 days at the time of culture.
      Otherwise, the subject was considered to have a CA-MRSA infection.
