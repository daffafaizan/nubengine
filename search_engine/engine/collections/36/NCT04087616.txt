    
      To evaluate the effect and acceptability of an Internet-based comprehensive behavioral
      intervention for tics (ICBIT) in a sample of children and adolescents with Tic disorders,
      children and adolescents (aged 8-17 years) with Tourette Syndrome (TS) or Chronic Tic
      Disorder (CTD) and their parents will be randomly assigned to receive either an
      Internet-based ICBIT or wait-list (WL) condition in a cross over design.

      Participants will be randomized to ICBIT, or to wait list, and half will cross over from wait
      list to ICBT. Two blind independent clinical evaluators will rate tic severity and
      comorbidity. The primary outcome measure is the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).
      Assessments will be performed at baseline, post-ICBT or post wait list, 3-months and 6-months
      (post-treatment for those originally assigned to ICBT) and post-ICBT, 3-months and 6-months
      (post-treatment for those originally assigned to wait list condition). All assessments were
      conducted by 2 PhD level independent child psychologists.
