      pathways is a highly plausible way to induce active emergence from general anesthesia. The
      investigators have compelling experimental data demonstrating that methylphenidate is highly
      effective in actively inducing emergence from isoflurane and propofol general anesthesia in
      rodents. The available literature suggests that IV methylphenidate would be safe to
      administer to patients recovering from general anesthesia, and that in addition to promoting
      arousal, it would enhance breathing. Both of these effects would be highly desirable in
      patients recovering from general anesthesia.
