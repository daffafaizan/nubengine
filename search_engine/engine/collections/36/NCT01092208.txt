      autism, and second to characterize a potential cellular phenotype through the re-programming
      of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). The scope of autistic
      spectrum disorders (ASD) is defined by its behavioral symptoms, encompassing a group of
      conditions that includes Asperger disorder, autism and pervasive developmental disorder-not
      otherwise specified (PDD). The clinical presentation of each of these diagnostic groups
      differs slightly, but all share three common features: deficits in social reciprocity, delays
      or deficits in communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and presence of repetitive
      behaviors and fixated interests. These symptoms are most pronounced in the autism group, so
      they will serve as the subjects for this pilot investigation. Individual differences in
      behavioral symptoms, genetic abnormalities, medical comorbidities and other risk factors will
      be assessed. These approaches will be coupled with computational approaches to identify
      neural networks by analysis of gene association study data, and analysis of gene databases to
      relate the diagnostic criteria of autism by unbiased analysis of the ontology of genes
      relevant to CNS function.
