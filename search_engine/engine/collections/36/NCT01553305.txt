      such as cardiovascular events compared with healthy age-matched controls. Studies indicates
      that patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis have a lower level of physical activity than the
      general population and a low proportion of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis exercises.
      Regular exercise with moderate to high intensity level of intensity has proven to be
      effective in reducing the cardiovascular risk by improving cardiovascular fitness and to
      increase muscle strength. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate if supervised exercise
      programme makes a difference making patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis participate in
      exercise.
