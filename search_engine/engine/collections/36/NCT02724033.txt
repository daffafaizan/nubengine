      auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the ear canal (commonly described as nerve of Arnold)
      in conjunction with a block of the greater auricular nerve and lesser occipital nerve at the
      superficial cervical plexus level. The block would cover both the sensory innervation and of
      the ear canal and the inner ear. A regional anesthetic block prior to the surgical
      intervention on the inner ear at the superficial cervical plexus block is performed. This
      latter is a branch of the vagus nerve at the superficial cervical plexus (erb's point). The
      block would inhibit the vagal afferent to area postrema through inhibition of afferent vagal
      input to the medullary center.

      The emetic act (vomiting) is a highly integrated physiologic reflex involving both the
      somatic and autonomic nervous system. Researchers do not know how much of a relation there is
      between the vagal nerve branches involvement and incidence of nausea and vomiting effects are
      from the inner ear injury and or the inflammatory response type of response triggering the
      area postrema. The usual prophylactic treatment of PONV (post operative nausea and vomiting)
      has been limited to anti-emetics such as dexamethasone along with aggressive fluid therapy
      and adequate analgesia.

      Investigators are proposing to conduct a comparative study of the therapeutic and cost
      effectiveness of regional anesthesia and antiemetic therapy in the prevention and treatment
      of PONV in children undergoing inner ear surgical procedures.
