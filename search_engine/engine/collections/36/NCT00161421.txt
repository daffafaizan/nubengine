      weeks. At that point, we will administer testosterone by mouth on six days in the next two
      weeks to see how much is absorbed and present in the bloodstream after administration. The
      day Lupron is given, and for 24 days after that, subjects will take the second medication,
      Dutasteride, which alters testosterone breakdown in the body. Fifteen days after the Lupron
      shot, subjects will take the first formulation of testosterone by mouth and undergo blood
      draws to see how much of this testosterone makes it into the blood stream and how long it
      lasts. The next day(Day 2) subjects will take a larger dose of testosterone and undergo blood
      draws. On study day 3, subjects will again take the larger dose of testosterone, this time
      with a meal and undergo blood draws. During the 2nd week of the study, subjects will repeat
      the testosterone doses, with a 2nd formulation of testosterone. The first two doses of
      testosterone each week will be taken on an empty stomach, while the third will be taken with
      breakfast. Please note that six study days: 1,2,3,8,9 and 10 will require repeated blood
      draws over a 12 hour period.
