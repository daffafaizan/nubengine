      Subjects will be screened up to 30 days before the study begins and admitted to the clinic on
      Day -1 of Period 1 for baseline assessments. Before dosing on Day 1 of Period 1, subjects
      will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence. Subjects will receive a single dose of
      study drug on Day 1 of each treatment period.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose by subcutaneous route of the
      assigned study drug: enoxaparin (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC injection manufactured by Rovi Spain,
      or Clexane (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC injection manufactured by Sanofi EU; after an overnight
      fasting period of at least 10 hours. Subjects will continue fasting for at least 4 hours
      after study drug administration.

      The washout period between administrations of study drug in each period will be at least 7
      days.

      On Day 1 of Period 2, subjects will cross over to receive the dose of the other drug, after
      an overnight fasting period of at least 10 hours. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 6 weeks.
