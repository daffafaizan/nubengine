      on sevoflurane and opioids and will be randomised in two groups, using computer generated
      randomisation system. Allocation concealment is established on opaque envelopes that contain
      random allocation.

      Anesthesia depth will be measured by Bispectral index (BIS), titration of sevoflurane to a
      BIS of 45-60. In case of neuromuscular block reversal at the end of surgery, sugammadex will
      be administered.

      At induction, 1 mg IV atropine 0.1% OR 10ml saline will be administered, depending on group
      allocation, on a syringe prepared by an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study.

      Patients will receive ketorolac 30 mg/8h, acetaminophen 1g/8h and a morphine IV patient
      controlled anaesthesia pump (PCA) 0-1-8 Outcomes will be evaluated at the postoperative care
      unit (PACU) and 24 postoperative hours by an investigator blinded to study group
