           dosing with AZD5718 (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1 until at least 48 hours after last
           dosing with AZD5718 in Treatment Period 3 for collection of PK and safety samples.
           Subjects will be discharged on Day 3 of Treatment Period 3.

        -  A Follow up Visit, 5 to 7 days after the last dose of investigational medicinal product
           (IMP).

      There will be a minimum washout period of 4 days between each dose administration.
