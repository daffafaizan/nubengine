    
      Aim 1. To examine the efficacy of the Men Moving Forward guided intervention, as compared to
      a self-guided control intervention, in producing significant post-intervention changes in
      body composition in 200 AA PC survivors.

      Hypothesis: Men randomized to the guided arm will exhibit significant post-intervention
      decreases in adiposity and increases in lean body mass compared to men randomized to the
      control arm.

      Aim 2. To investigate the effects of participation in the Men Moving Forward guided
      intervention on health behaviors and quality of life outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Men in the guided program will exhibit increased intake of fruits and vegetables
      and decreased intake of red meat/processed meat, greater levels of physical activity (minutes
      per week and #times/wk resistance training) and improved quality of life (targeting physical
      function, social isolation, sexual functioning) compared to men in the control arm.

      Aim 3. To explore the effects of the intervention program on blood pressure, blood lipids,
      fasting glucose, and biomarkers associated with comorbidities and carcinogenesis (i.e
      adiponectin, leptin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, C-Reactive Protein, estradiol, testosterone
      and sex hormone binding globulin)

      Hypothesis: Men in the guided arm will exhibit greater improvements in biomarkers associated
      with chronic disease and carcionogenesis compared to men in the self-guided control arm.

      Men Moving Forward supports PC survivors in adopting physical activity and eating patterns
      that will improve their body composition, bolster QOL and reduce risk for comorbidities and,
      potentially, PC recurrence.
