    
      This is an open-label, randomised controlled study to assess the impact of FCM in correcting
      iron deficiency anaemia compared with Venoferâ„¢ (IS).

      All subjects, after providing written informed consent and meeting the eligibility
      assessments, will receive a first dose of IV iron as either FCM or IS. A total of
      approximately 368 subjects (184 per group) will be enrolled. All subjects will have iron
      deficiency anaemia as measured by haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin and transferrin saturation
      (TSAT) at screening.

      Ferric carboxymaltose will be administered as either a diluted infusion or undiluted
      injection (at Investigator discretion) and IS will be administered as a slow intravenous
      injection at a rate of 1 ml undiluted solution per minute (with each single injection of 200
      mg iron) or by drip infusion. Note, for subjects randomised to receive IS dosing visits are
      required three times a week to achieve total iron repletion dosing as calculated using the
      Ganzoni formula.

      For subjects randomised to FCM, the total iron requirements will be calculated at screening
      based on the screening Hb and subject weight. Dosing will be at baseline and, if required, at
      day 8 and day 15. All subjects will attend study visits at screening, baseline and thereafter
      at Weeks 2, 4 and 6. All subjects will attend an end of study visit (at Week 8 - or earlier
      if discontinued prematurely).
