      sensitivity. In comparison With the inlay-retained bridge, there is less amount of tooth
      substance loss. this clinical study will provide benefits for practitioners and clinicians by
      guiding them to choose a more conservative treatment plan with the better marginal fit,
      clinical performance and satisfaction for the patients on the long term. rather than other
      benefits like less chair time, less risk for pulp injury, less time and cost
