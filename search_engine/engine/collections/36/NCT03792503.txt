      pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy after 4 cycles of non-progressive evaluation were
      treated with pemetrexed plus apatinib. Until the disease progresses, there are intolerable
      side effects or the patient requests to withdraw from the study. It is planned to include 20
      subjects.

      Dosing regimen： Apatinib 500mg po qd (If there is a 3-4 degree toxic side reaction after 14
      days of administration, the dose can be lowered to 250mg qd); Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 d1×q3w;
      Until the patient progresses, the toxicity is intolerable, the patient withdraws his
      knowledge, or the investigator judges that the medication must be discontinued.
