      the third stage of labor, as part of standard of care in the United States. This medication
      helps to reduce overall blood loss, by functioning as a uterotonic. Currently evidence is
      lacking to direct timing of oxytocin administration in cesarean deliveries.

      This study will evaluate both estimated and quantitative blood loss for both groups of
      patients. It will also compare the change from pre-operative to post-operative hemoglobin
      levels.
