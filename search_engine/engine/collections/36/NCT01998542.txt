      refractory metastatic disease with <90 day survival expectancy. In the Phase I/II study all
      patients progressed using RECIST criteria. However, 11/42 (26%) were alive at 1yr and 9/42
      (21%) alive at 2 yr. Therefore, CT scans did not correlate with clinical presentation and
      "pseudo-progression" was suspected. This study was designed to select subjects with visible
      tumor burden on the head, neck or tongue that could be measured and photographed so as not to
      rely solely on CT scans to determine anti-tumor debulking efficacy. Subjects are initially
      primed with intradermal AlloStim(TM) injections creating systemic anti-allo-specific cellular
      immunity. Tumor biopsy samples taken prior to dosing were processed into personalized
      Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) vaccine containing enriched heat shock proteins which are
      believed to chaperone tumor-specific neoantigens . AlloStim(TM) was then injected with CRCL
      into primed subjects to create tumor-specific cellular immunity. Subsequently, subjects are
      infused with intravenous AlloStim(TM) to cause extravasation of memory cells to the tumor
      lesions. The protocol including intradermal AlloStim(TM) day 0, 3, 7, 10. Intradermal
      AlloStim(TM)+CRCL on days 14, 17, 21, 24. Intravenous AlloStim(TM) day 28. This experimental
      treatment schedule will continue for 3 cycles.
