      cardiovascular disease (CVD) refer to cardioprotective dietary fatty acid proportions.
      Several studies demonstrate the hypocholesteremic effects of walnuts in energy restricted
      diets. To our knowledge, the health benefits accrued as a result of addition of walnuts to an
      ad libitum diet in type 2 diabetic subjects have not been studied. Addition of walnuts to an
      ad libitum diet represents a practical way to achieve the recommended fatty acid proportions.
      The proposed study will examine whether a total dietary pattern inclusive of walnuts, will
      result in amelioration of cardiac risk as measured by improvement in endothelial function and
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetics. Results of the study will have important implications
      for clinicians and dietitians in dietary management of type 2 diabetes. Demonstrating that
      walnuts can be regarded as beneficial components of dietary management of type 2 diabetes is
      of relevance to the walnut industry as well. The study employs a pragmatic approach to
      approximate dietary practices in a real world setting thus enhancing the external validity of
      the study. If positive, the study results can inform future marketing efforts of the
      California Walnut Commission. Demonstrating that addition of walnuts to an ad libitum diet
      can potentially lead to improvement in endothelial function, improve lipid profiles, glycemic
      control and reduce the risk of CVD complications in diabetic patients has important
      applications for dietary management of diabetes.
