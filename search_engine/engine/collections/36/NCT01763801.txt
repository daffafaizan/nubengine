      catheters obtained with the IVECG method. Patients were randomised into 2 groups: in group A
      the catheter tip was placed in correspondence to the P-max, in group B in correspondence to
      the P-submax. We followed up the tip position by measuring the variation of its distances
      from the tracheal carina on multiplanar reconstructions of volumetric CT scans taken within a
      month (T0) and a year (T1) from the port implant.
