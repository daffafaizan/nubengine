    
      This is the dose ranging study to evaluate efficacy and safety of MK-0859 in Japanese
      patients.

      Eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 10 treatment groups (including treatment groups with
      or without administrative atorvastatin) for an 8-week treatment period which was followed by
      a 8-week reversibility period.

      As an additional follow-up, the pregnancy information from women of childbearing potential
      who were treated with MK-0859 in this study will be collected retrospectively for a period of
      4 years after the last dose of MK-0859.
