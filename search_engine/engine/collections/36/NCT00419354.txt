      physical interference of the valve closure by the electrode.

      "2" Right ventricular pacing may be associated with dyssynchrony in contraction of the right
      ventricular wall (i.e. septum and free wall.

      "3" The tricuspid sub-valvar apparatus is anchored to the septum and free wall, thus may be
      sensitive to dyssynchrony in those wals contraction.

      "4" The study hypothesis is that the dyssynchrony in right ventricular contraction, induced
      by pacing, may increase tricuspid regurgitation grade and that this is a mechanism is
      independent of the mechanical effect of the electrode on the valve closure.
