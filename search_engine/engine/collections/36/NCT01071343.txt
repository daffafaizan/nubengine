      factors often present in ICU patients and enhances statistical strength we designed a study
      where we included a well-defined group of patients with septic shock in a single-legged
      exercise design, using the contralateral leg as the (paired) control and used a two-channel
      stimulation approach with 3-D evaluation of muscle volume changes based on CT scans.

      After randomization of the quadriceps muscles TEMS is applied on the intervention side for 7
      consecutive days, 60 minutes per day. All patients undergoes CT scans of both thighs before
      and immediately after the 7-day treatment period. The quadriceps muscle is then manually
      delineated on the transverse CT slices, and muscle volumes are calculated after 3-D
      reconstruction.
