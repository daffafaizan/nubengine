      response rate of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-equivocal breast
      cancer. Patients will receive trastuzumab emtansine at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg via intravenous
      infusion every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks (2 21-day cycles). Patients who achieve partial
      or complete response (responders) after the 6-week treatment will continue on trastuzumab
      emtansine for an additional 12 weeks (4 cycles). The primary objective will be objective
      response rate after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine. Secondary objectives will
      include imaging response (ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) after six weeks of
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine and toxicity and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine. After
      completion of continued trastuzumab emtansine treatment, pathological complete response rate
      of responders as a whole and according to estrogen receptor status will be explored. Markers
      related to the mechanism of action of trastuzumab emtansine (HER2 copy number in circulating
      tumor cells; tissue expression of PTEN, PI3K, and other potential candidate markers) will
      also be explored.
