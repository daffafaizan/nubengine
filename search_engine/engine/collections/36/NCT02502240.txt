      isolated in some Latin American countries like Brazil report a frequency of 3.2%, Argentina
      of 4.2% and Mexico of 9.0% of ALK fusion in a small number with lung cancer. Reliable
      information about ALK frequencies and disparities among ethnic groups is critical. Our study
      pretends to know the frequency and clinical characteristics of ALK rearrangement of Latin
      American patients with NSCLC. Discusses the difficulty of having a single diagnostic test for
      this chromosome abnormality.

      The development of efficient and reliable laboratory test is critical in the selection of
      patients likely to respond to these targeted agents. Currently, the current gold standard for
      testing for EML4-ALK translocation is fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for selecting
      patients for ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy according to the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA). But, an important aspect is the amount of available tumor
      present in a determined sample, given the labor-intensive nature and cost of the test, there
      has been interest in validating other screening and diagnostic tools. Recent evidence
      suggests that ALK Immunohistochemistry (IHC) instruments globally protocols, can be very
      effective in the detection of ALK rearrangement in NSCLC (ALK+) tumors expressing the fusion
      ALK protein.
