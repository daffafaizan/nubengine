      OCT images of AMD patients. OCT images from the central 10 degrees of the macula in AMD
      patients will be obtained using the NOTAL OCT v.2.5 and a commercial OCT device (Zeiss Cirrus
      / Heidlberg SPECTRALIS). These images will be evaluated for the presence/absence of fluid in
      the images by a human grader. The sensitivity and specificity will be determined by
      comparison of the presence/absence of fluid in the NOTAL OCT v2.5 images with the
      presence/absence of fluid in the commercial OCT images.

      To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity regarding the presence and absence of fluid on
      OCT images of DME patients. OCT images from the central 10 degrees of the macula in DME
      patients will be obtained using the NOTAL OCT v.2.5 and a commercial OCT device (Zeiss Cirrus
      / Heidlberg SPECTRALIS). These images will be evaluated for the presence/absence of fluid in
      the images by a human grader. The sensitivity and specificity will be determined by
      comparison of the presence/absence of fluid in the NOTAL OCT v2.5 images with the
      presence/absence of fluid in the commercial OCT images.

      Patients will complete a questionnaire regarding the usability of the NOTAL-OCT v.2.5 device
