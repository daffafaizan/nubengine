    
      1. To investigate, by using protein fortified foods and beverages, whether mucoadhesion to
           the oral cavity is greater for older adults compared to younger adults and determine
           whether it is related to salivary flow rate.

        2. To determine whether protein fortification of foods and beverages causes mouthdrying and
           whether perception and acceptance are influenced by age and individual differences in
           saliva flow.

      These aims will be investigated using two different models: a liquid model using whey protein
      and a solid model using protein fortified biscuits and cakes.
