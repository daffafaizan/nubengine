      provide a 16% or greater improvement in nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. This is
      a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-center outpatient study in adult
      men or women who have seasonal allergic rhinitis and have 2 year history (or longer) of mild
      to moderate allergic reaction to mountain cedar pollen. The study will be conducted in
      mountain cedar pollen season. 72 qualified patients will be admitted to the single-blind
      7-day Run-in Period (placebo twice daily) to establish the Baseline allergic rhinitis symptom
      scores. Patient eligibility to enter the double-blind treatment phase will be based on
      patients' baseline nasal symptom scores. At least 66 eligible patients whose daytime average
      nasal symptom scores (of nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and sneezing) is 2 or
      greater, with the daytime nasal congestion symptom score 2 or greater, on at least 4 of the 7
      Run-in days will be admitted to the double-blind treatment phase, and randomized to either
      the JNJ-17166864 or placebo treatment group. During the Treatment Phase, patients will
      self-administer study medication (0.5 mg JNJ-17166864 or placebo per nostril) twice daily for
      2 weeks, record allergic rhinitis nasal and ocular symptom scores, and complete the
      Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), to establish the In-Treatment
      scores. Pharmacokinetic and biomarker samples will be collected during treatment phase.
      Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assessed.
