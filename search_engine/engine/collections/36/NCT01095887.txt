      disease. In some instances, the only suitable living kidney donor is ABO blood group
      incompatible. This usually presents a barrier to successful transplantation because most
      recipients have circulating serum antibodies that bind to incompatible blood groups that will
      bind and damage the kidney allograft early after transplantation. Fortunately, over the past
      decade, we and others have developed protocols involving the pretransplant removal of
      anti-blood group antibodies using multiple plasmapheresis treatments that allow for the
      successful transplantation of ABOi LDKTx. Thus, this therapy enables patients to receive a
      living donor with its advantages rather than having to wait >5 years for a deceased donor
      kidney.
