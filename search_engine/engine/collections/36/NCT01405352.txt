      important health concern because of its well known relationships with metabolic and endocrine
      disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and immune
      dysfunction. Low-grade systemic inflammation, confirmed by the increase of inflammatory
      markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 has been observed in obesity. CD4+
      T-helpers are the most important regulators of immune system. Epidemiological evidence has
      linked obesity to several (but not all) autoimmune disorders, including inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and psoriasis .Some sublineages of T- helpers plays core roles in immune
      dysfunction, and recent evidence demonstrates that an imbalance of T-cell subgroups including
      Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg has occurred in obesity. This imbalance is the redirection of the
      immune response from most often Th2 and Treg like responses to Th1 and Th17 like responses
      respectively, however the opposite is desired. Vitamin A (VA) or VA-like analogs known as
      retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers of type 1 or type 2 responses but a definitive
      description of their mechanism(s) of action is lacking. High level dietary vitamin A enhances
      Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and is likely to decrease Th1 cytokine production.
      Retinoic acid inhibits IL-12 production in activated macrophages, and RA pretreatment of
      macrophages reduces IFNγ and TNF α production and increases IL4 production in antigen primed
      CD4 T cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A or retinoic acid (RA) decreases IFNγ and
      increases IL5, IL10, and IL4 production.
