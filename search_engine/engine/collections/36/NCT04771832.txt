      Memorial Hospital in Skawina between 2011 and 2020. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was in
      charge of the program and performed annual audits. A consecutive series of 100 ECF patients
      (44 F, 56 M, mean age 54.1) was evaluated. Postoperative complications rate, readmission
      rate, length of hospital stay, prevalence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were assessed.
