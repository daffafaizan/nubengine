      investigational products for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The
      platform trial design will allow for products to be incorporated into the protocol as
      additional arms, as products are identified and become available. Initially all eligible
      subjects will be enrolled in a "non-interventional" arm, described here. This master protocol
      describes the core study elements that will be maintained across all study arms.
      Interventional design elements will be added in a subsequent amendment to the master
      protocol, and interventional arms will be added in amendments as product specific appendices.
      PROTECT-APT will be conducted as a multi-site study coordinated centrally by the Henry
      Jackson Foundation.
