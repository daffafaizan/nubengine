    
      Redwood Pharma is developing the novel ophthalmic product RP101 containing the known active
      substance 17β-oestradiol-3-phosphate and based upon the drug delivery platform IntelliGel
      which controls the active substance release. The novel formulation is planned to meet the
      still unmet medical need of an efficacious treatment against chronic dry eye in
      postmenopausal women.

      The efficacy of the novel formulation RP101 will be investigated for the first time in the
      present multicentre, randomised, double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase II
      study in women post-menopausal for at least 3 years presenting with symptoms specific for dry
      eye syndrome of moderate to severe intensity.

      The planned study will be conducted in Austria, Germany and Hungary. The primary objective of
      the study is to establish the effective dose/dose regimen of RP101 in these patients applying
      RP101 ophthalmic sterile solution or matching placebo (vehicle) once (q.d.) or twice a day
      (b.i.d.) for 3 months. One hundred (100) patients will be enrolled in this study. The
      subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a treatment group and will receive one of the
      treatments for 90 consecutive days.

      Evaluation of the clinical efficacy during and at the end of the treatment will be done on
      the basis of the Schirmer's test type II (with anaesthesia).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment

        -  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of serum 17β-oestradiol after the 1st and the last
           dose (only PK substudy).
