      a new and effective screening method to improve the detection rate. LCI (linked-color
      imaging)is a new model of laser endoscopy which can provide brighter image. LCI can provide
      clear image which can make red part redder and white part whiter, so suspicious lesion could
      be found easier. The study of this randomized controlled trial is to discuss effectiveness of
      LCI in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and to find a new method to improve the
      detection rate of early gastric cancer in China.
