           As a quality-assuring basic register, the CPU II register checks the extent to which
           certified Chest Pain Units fulfill the criteria published by the DGK. In particular, the
           following quality dimensions are evaluated:

             -  Indication quality

             -  Diagnostic quality

             -  Therapeutic quality

             -  Structural quality / networking

        2. Platform for projects with a scientific focus

      The CPU II register and the infrastructure provided are a platform for further projects with
      scientific questions (scientific protocol = WP):
