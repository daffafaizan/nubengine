      insertion site. This study will be the first study to quantitatively measure sensation at the
      epidural insertion site. The investigator will assess localized pressure sensitivity with an
      algometer. An algometer is a hand-held device commonly used by neurologist to detect sensory
      deficits and measures the pressure sensitivity threshold in a 1-cm diameter circular area.
      Ultrasound (US) pre-procedural examination provides more accurate landmarks for the placement
      of epidural catheters. The investigator will determine if an US examination prior to epidural
      placement reduces localized pressure sensitivity. The investigator will also determine if
      there are correlations between the participants characteristics and/or comorbidities and
      increased pressure sensitivity at the insertion site.
