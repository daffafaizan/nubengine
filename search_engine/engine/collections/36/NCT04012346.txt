    
      Intensified intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol will be applied in the MCI
      study group. A two-parallel-group, randomized, placebo controlled design will be used. Ten
      MCI subjects will be stimulated in a week-long therapeutical sessions. Other ten MCI subjects
      will be stimulated with the same protocol using sham stimulation. The investigators will
      study the change in subjects immediately after and again at a two-weeks follow-up visit after
      the end of the last stimulation session.
