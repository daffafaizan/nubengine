      anti-retroviraltreatment (cART) era has been associated with poor compliance with cART,
      reduced quality-of-life and increased mortality. Reported factors associated with the
      development of NC function impairment in HIV disease and risks associated with progression of
      such impairment include degree of immune suppression related to HIV infection, other chronic
      viral infections (such as chronic hepatitis C co-infection), age and central nervous system
      (CNS) antiretroviral drug exposure.

      One modifiable factor which may be associated with the evolution of NC function impairment is
      the direct effect of cART on the central-nervous-system (CNS). Certain antiretroviral drugs
      such as zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, nevirapine, efavirenz and indinavir are known to
      achieve optimal exposure in the cerebro-spinal-fluid (CSF) whereas other drugs, such as the
      majority of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors penetrate less effectively. Studies to date suggest
      different cART regimens may have differing effects on NC performance. In the EuroSIDA study,
      the use of nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase inhibitors was found to specifically protect
      against the development of HIV related brain disease. More recently, in a small prospective
      study, ALTAIR, different effect on cerebral function was reported in subjects randomised to
      commence three different cART regimens.

      The investigators propose, in a prospective, randomised study to assess the effects of two
      different antiretroviral regimens on NC function in HIV infected subjects commencing
      antiretroviral therapy for the first time.
