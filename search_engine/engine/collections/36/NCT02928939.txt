      conflicts or dilemma situations, respectively. The first concerns patients with diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal bleeding and prescription of anticoagulants or/and antiplatelet drugs (e.g.,
      warfarin, clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid) as a risk factor for bleeding events. The
      second concerns patients with diagnosis of exacerbated diabetes mellitus and prescription of
      corticosteroids as a risk factor for worsening of blood glucose.
