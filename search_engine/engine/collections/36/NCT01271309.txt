    
      MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:

      Characterization of circulating CD133+ stem cells in a group of 170 patients with MI (mean
      post-MI follow up, 6 months):

        -  Counting total mononuclear cells and FACS analysis of CD133 stem cells.

        -  Characterization of CD133+ stem cell biology: Migratory assay, imaging of cytoskeleton,
           angiogenesis tests in vitro.

        -  Evaluation of migratory signalling, with specific focus on the PI3K/Akt/eNOS system.

      Assessment of the prognostic value of the stem cell migration assay.

        -  Relationship between cell biology tests on CD133+ cells and changes in circulating
           cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors after MI.

        -  Assessment of area at risk by ECG-synchronized Single Photon Emission Computed
           Tomography (gated-SPECT) in subgroups with different patterns of stem cell migratory
           tests.

        -  Assessment of ventricular remodelling (echocardiography, NMR) in relation with patterns
           of stem cell migratory test.

      EXPECTED RESULTS:

      Clarification of the implication of stem cell migratory deficit in post-ischemic HF.

        -  Identification of underlying mechanisms

        -  Identification of a cellular marker for prediction of patients at risk of HF.

      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH:

        -  Introduction of a biological test for the early diagnosis of post-MI HF

        -  Recognition of therapeutic targets for the rescue of stem cell migratory liabilities
