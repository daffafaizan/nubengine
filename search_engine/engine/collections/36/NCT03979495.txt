      follow-up in these three participating primary care networks and their affiliated integrated
      delivery systems (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dartmouth
      Hitchcock Health, the largest health care provider in New Hampshire). The primary outcome
      will be whether an individual receives follow-up, defined based on the type of screening
      abnormality and organ type (breast, cervical, lung or colorectal cancer), within 120 days of
      becoming eligible for mFOCUS. Secondary comparisons will assess multi- and cross-level
      (individual, team, system) outcomes. The study design will allow us to examine the marginal
      effectiveness of system, team and individual-level enhancements, and exploratory analyses
      will address subgroups defined by race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status and cancer type.
