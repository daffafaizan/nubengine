      locoregionally advanced NPC,especially for the high risk NPC (EB virus DNA â‰¥ 4000 copies/ml)
      ,the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (CCRT) can improve the treatment outcomes of these patients, approximately 25% of
      locoregionally advanced NPCs relapse. Adjuvant chemotherapy or inducing chemotherapy addition
      to CCRT did not significantly improve patient survival compared to CCRT alone. Hence, there
      is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve disease-free survival and reduce
      treatment-related toxicity in patients.

      Accumulating evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) selected for tumor
      recognition and greatly expanded in vitro are especially effective for treating cancer
      patients.The investigations phase I results showed that TILs following CCRT as a novel
      treatment strategy in locoregionally advanced NPC patients resulted in sustained anti-tumor
      activity and anti-EBV immune responses, associated with a good tolerance.

      This is a Phase II trial to study the effectiveness and security of cisplatin CCRT plus TIL
      versus cisplatin CCRT only with IMRT in treating patients with locoregionally advanced high
      risk NPC.
