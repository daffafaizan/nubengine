      exploration of potential new diagnostic markers for spasticity that can assist in diagnosis
      and referral. This will be done by assessing the relatedness of comorbid conditions in
      patients with spasticity. Emphasis will be placed on urinary incontinence, as previous work
      has suggested a link between the two conditions. An additional aim of this study is to assess
      health-related quality of life measures in this population. A medical record review will be
      performed for all consenting participants residing in Tennessee State Veterans' Homes, which
      is a long-term care facility in Murfreesboro, TN. Participants will also be asked to complete
      a brief questionnaire assessing their perceived health-related quality of life, physical
      wellbeing, and mental wellbeing.
