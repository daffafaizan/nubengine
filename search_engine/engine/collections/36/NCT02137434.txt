      disease, but supplementary calcium appears to be associated with raised risk of
      cardiovascular events. Fatty meals lead to oxidative and inflammation which seems to
      interfere in postprandial dismetabolism, a predictor of cardiovascular events. To investigate
      calcium acute influence over the postprandial effects of a fatty meal a crossover,
      controlled, and randomized clinical trial will be conducted with obese adult women who will
      be randomized into one of the three interventions, characterized by a fatty meal with
      different contents of calcium: low calcium (40 mg), high dietary calcium (540 mg from non-fat
      milk), and high supplementary calcium (540 mg from calcium carbonate). Each participant will
      receive all three meals and one of them every week. Before meals' intake blood sample will be
      collected and endothelial function assess will be performed. Participants will eat the
      specific meal and endothelial function will be assessed again after 120 minutes. Blood sample
      collections will be repeated every 60 minutes after meal's intake to perform latter
      biochemical analyzes to determine: 8-isoprostane levels, to assess oxidative stress status;
      triglycerides; glucose; insulin; and serum calcium. Blood pressure will be continuously
      assessed during 25 minutes before meals' intake and during 2 hours after it.
