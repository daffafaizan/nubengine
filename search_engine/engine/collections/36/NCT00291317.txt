      physiologically and psychologically. Complications associated with walking upright include
      loss of muscle mass from atrophy, reduction in bone mineral density (osteoporosis),
      compromised cardiovascular endurance, loss of sense of well-being, etc. Functional Electrical
      Stimulation (FES) of the lower extremities has been found to reverse many of these
      complications. We propose to examine the use of FES in children who have suffered from spinal
      cord injury (SCI). We plan to examine the effect of FES bike therapy on bone mineral density
      and psychological well-being.
