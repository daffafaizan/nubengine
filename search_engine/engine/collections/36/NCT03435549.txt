      be discharged to home safely after lower extremity joint replacement surgery (LEJR). The
      investigators will target those patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery at a
      large urban hospital system at two different sites. The investigators aim is to increase the
      number of patients that are discharged to home, by providing patients with a physical
      activity pedometer, daily pain score tracking through bi-directional text messaging,
      milestone and nudge messaging for recovery, social influence, and connection to clinicians as
      needed for 6 weeks after surgery. Eligible participants are age 18-85, with a Risk Assessment
      and Prediction Tool (RAPT) score of 6-8 and are scheduled to undergo lower-extremity joint
      replacement surgery. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to usual care (Arm 1) and
      intervention (Arms 2a and 2b). After enrollment with the monitoring device, participants in
      the intervention group will be randomized 1:1 to Arm 2a (remote monitoring) or Arm 2b (remote
      monitoring + goal-setting and social support). Both intervention arms will receive the
      intervention for 6 weeks post-surgery.
