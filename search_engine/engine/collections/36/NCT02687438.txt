      FDA-approved device for reducing the need for post-operative interventions by maintaining
      patency and delivering steroid medication directly into the ethmoid cavity following surgery.
      Five recently published clinical trials have demonstrated that the mometasone
      furoate-releasing implant placed in the hospital operating room or in the office setting
      produces statistically significant reductions in inflammation, polyp formation, and
      postoperative adhesions. In addition, the implant has been found to significantly reduce the
      need for postoperative prescription of oral steroids and to decrease the frequency of
      postoperative lysis of adhesions. Minimal adverse effects were reported in these trials.
