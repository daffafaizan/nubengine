      head-and neck cancer (HNC) patients and necessitates treatment intensification. However,
      despite increased spatial resolution of current imaging techniques, around 20% of patients
      with a pre-operative clinically negative neck will have occult metastases in the neck
      dissection specimen. It is therefore that, when patients are treated with radiotherapy, the
      neck is almost always included in the target volume, also when the tumor is clinically staged
      N0 (elective neck treatment). As a consequence, large tissue volumes must be treated
      resulting in significant morbidity such as mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia and on the long
      term also hypothyroidism and vascular damage.

      If the detection of small lymph node metastases can be improved elective neck treatment may
      be avoided in at least part of the patients resulting in less toxicity and improved quality
      of life. One promising approach is the sentinel node procedure. Thus far, the sentinel node
      procedure is not employed in patients with larynx and pharynx cancers that are treated with
      primary radiotherapy. One reason is that these tumors are not easily accessible for tracer
      injection and this needs to be done under general anesthesia. However, in the past few years
      there has been progress with instrumentation via flexible endoscopy. The ENT-department of
      Radboudumc has developed expertise with endoscopic biopsy taking and even laser surgery of
      pharynx and larynx cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph node identification
      in pharynx and larynx cancers using flexible endoscopy-guided tracer injection.
