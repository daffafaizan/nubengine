    
      Child secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant public health problem that has been
      linked to asthma, acute respiratory illnesses, otitis, and SIDS, and is associated with
      increased risk of cancers, cardiovascular disease, and behavior problems. This project will
      test the effectiveness of a comprehensive multilevel intervention to reduce young children's
      SHSe in minority and medically underserved communities known to have the highest SHSe-related
      morbidity and mortality risk. First, we will provide a clinic-level quality improvement (CQI)
      intervention to improve the care of pediatric patients with SHSe in four pediatric clinics in
      North and West Philadelphia. We will then randomize eligible parents visiting the CQI clinics
      into either a home-level behavioral counseling intervention (CQI+BC) or a home-level
      attention control intervention (CQI+A). In addition to clinic-level intervention, CQI+BC
      provides personalized, behavioral counseling with intensive skills training and support where
      SHSe occurs (in the home), as well as systems navigation to facilitate access to and
      effective use of reimbursable nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medication.
      Participants will complete assessments at pre-treatment, 3-month end of treatment, and
      12-month follow-up.
