      remains as the major cause of maternal and neonatal mortality, especially in developing
      countries. Cost-effective interventions aimed to prevent the development of preeclampsia are
      urgently needed. Ethiopathogenesis of preeclampsia involves multiple mechanisms as oxidative
      stress, endothelial dysfunction, infections, maternal constitutional factors, and others.
      Regular aerobic exercise recovers endothelial function, decreases oxidative stress and
      improves maternal constitutional factors.

      The purpose of this Controlled Clinical Trial is to determine the effect of regular aerobic
      exercise on endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Furthermore, the
      effect of exercise on biomarkers on vascular function and perinatal outcomes will be
      evaluated.
