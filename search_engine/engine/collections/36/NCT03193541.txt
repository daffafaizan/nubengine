      hematuria harboring BCa. VUC is the most widely used urine-based assay for detecting BCa;
      however, it fails to detect approximately 50% of low-grade or early stage BCa when it is most
      curable. Because of this severe limitation, patients with hematuria will undergo an invasive
      examination of the urinary bladder, where a miniature camera is inserted into the bladder.

      We propose to improve the non-invasive detection of BCa by further validating a multiplex
      ELISA assay directed at a BCa-associated diagnostic signature in voided urine samples of
      patients with microscopic hematuria.
