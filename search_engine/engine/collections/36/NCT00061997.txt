        -  Determine the safety of inositol for the prevention of lung cancer in patients with
           bronchial epithelial dysplasia who are current or former smokers.

        -  Determine the potential efficacy of this drug in regression of existing dysplastic
           lesions or prevention of appearance of new dysplastic lesions in these patients.

        -  Determine whether intake of this drug can facilitate smoking cessation in patients who
           are current smokers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral inositol twice daily. Treatment continues for 1 or 3 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of inositol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 12
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Once the MTD is determined, 10 patients are treated with inositol twice daily at the MTD for
      3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
