    
      This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential
      multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of supratherapeutic
      doses of eslicarbazepine acetate in 32 healthy adult male and female subjects, with 8
      subjects per treatment group. In each study group, subjects were to receive single doses of
      eslicarbazepine acetate or placebo once daily for 5 days.

      A series of screening evaluations was performed within a 21-day period prior to the first
      dose of study medication in order to determine the eligibility of prospective study
      participants for the trial. Eligible subjects reported to the clinic on Day -1 prior to study
      medication administration and remained in the clinic until clinic discharge on Day 7. Plasma
      and urine samples were collected throughout the study to determine the pharmacokinetics of
      eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites.
