    
      The study proposed herein is a randomized, double blind study to evaluate the therapeutic
      effectiveness of HBO in children (ages 3-8 years) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. Ninety-four
      children will be randomly assigned to either a hyperbaric oxygen treatment group or
      hyperbaric air treatment (HBA) group. Each group will receive 40 dives of 60 minutes duration
      each at 1.5 atmospheres of pressure (ATA) (the HBO group receiving 100% oxygen, and the HBA
      group receiving an air mixture containing 14% oxygen, which simulates 21% oxygen at 1.5 ATA).

      Neurological testing (Gross Motor Function Measure, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability
      Inventory, and the Test of Variables of Attention) will be performed at baseline, immediately
      after experimental treatment #40, and at 3 and 6 months after experimental treatment #40.
      Statistical analysis will be performed on these test data to determine any changes from
      baseline, or between group differences, in the functional capabilities of the study subjects.
