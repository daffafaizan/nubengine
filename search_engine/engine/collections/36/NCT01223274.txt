      beneficial in reducing ventilator dependence and subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
      in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. These studies did not test for the optimal
      timing of CPAP initiation or compare CPAP/PEEP initiation in the delivery room against
      standard resuscitation methods. Current practice at the time was for the ELBW infant to be
      intubated early and administered prophylactic surfactant. The feasibility of initiating CPAP
      in the DR and continuing this therapy without intubation for surfactant had not been
      determined prospectively in a population of ELBW infants.

      This pilot study was designed to determine the feasibility of randomizing extremely low birth
      weight (ELBW) infants <28 weeks' gestation who required resuscitation to one of two
      resuscitation methods, either: (a) 100% oxygen by facemask and continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) or positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with positive end-expiratory pressure
      (PEEP), if the infant required PPV (the intervention group); or (b) 100% oxygen and no CPAP
      and no PEEP if the infant required PPV (the control group).
