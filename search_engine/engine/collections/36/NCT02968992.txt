      the efficacy of Recombinant Human lactoferrin (rhLF) in reducing chronic inflammation as
      measured by IL-6 and sTNFR1 in the bloodstream. The primary end point is to gather
      information about the tolerability of and adherence to oral rhlactoferrin (rhLF) among older
      adults with CI over a six-month period. The exploratory objective is to assess the efficacy
      of rhlactoferrin (rhLF) in attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the Digit Symbol
      Substitution Test and Trail Making Test, as well as improving physical mobility as measured
      by performance on 4 meter and six-minute walk tests. Further physical and functional
      measurement data will be gather using an Acti-graph link Activity monitor, the raw data
      collected will be used to : (i) characterize cumulative daily activity, (ii) assess daily
      circadian patterns of activity, (iii) assess physical activity variability, (iv) model
      patterns of daily activity, and (iv) estimate walking speed. This additional data will
      complement mobility measures by describing function enacted in daily life
