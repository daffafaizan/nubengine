      and ribavirin (1600 mg/day) for the first four weeks achieves the plasma concentrations of
      the product in the blood needed to reduce the half-life of the virions and accelerate the
      elimination thereof. This would bring the viral kinetic curves in coinfected patients closer
      to the model described for mono-infected HCV patients, probably achieving improved rates of
      response in week 12 (early virological response) and posterior in week 72 (sustained
      virological response).

      Therefore, the patients were randomised to treatment with two different doses, 270 µg and 180
      µg of PEGASYS, and 1600 mg and 1000-1200 mg of ribavirin.
