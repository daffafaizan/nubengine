      part, thereafter, during the double-blind part of study, participants will be randomized
      1:1:1 to receive the low, medium or high dose of the vaccine (VLA2001). All participants will
      received a total of two vaccinations intramuscularly, on day 1 and day 22.

      The first 5 participants in each dose group will receive VLA2001 open label, starting with
      the low dose of VLA2001. If no safety concerns are identified, the next 5 subjects will
      receive the medium dose of the vaccine. Again, if no safety issues are identified, 5
      participants will be vaccinated with the high dose vaccine. A Data Safety and Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) will review accrued safety data before randomization of the remaining 135
      subjects across all sites will be initiated.

      All study participants will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity up to approximately
      6 months after receiving their second vaccination.
