      phone numbers for persons who had roux-en-y bariatric surgery at the SVBCE five or more years
      ago at the St. Vincent Bariatric Center of Excellence (SVBCE. The interview includes scripts
      that the caller will use to recruit subjects in either direct conversation, in voice mail or
      by leaving a message. Recruitment will cease after 400 complete post pilot interviews are
      obtained.

      The interview covers topics related to physical and psychological health and quality of life.
      The number of questions asked will vary from subject to subject since some questions are
      asked only if a prior question is answered affirmatively. For example, if a subject responds
      "yes" when asked "have you had plastic surgery?" the subject is then asked what type of
      procedure they had. The topics covered are as follows: weight, current health, post surgery
      complications, relationships, work, cross addiction, mental health, diet, television viewing,
      exercise, and life satisfaction.
