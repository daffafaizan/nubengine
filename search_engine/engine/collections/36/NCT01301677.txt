    
      Subjects that signed the informed consent and are eligible to the study will be irradiated on
      the back to evaluate their individual minimal erythema dose (MED).

      A training session (without study medication) will be performed in order to introduce
      subjects to the testing and rating procedures.

      Subjects will come in within 28 days of screening to start the treatment period of the study.

      For eligible subjects, three test areas oriented along the long axis of the back and
      different from the areas of MED determination will be defined for the evaluation of effects
      on pain and inflammation induced by UVR. The three areas will be irradiated with 2 MED. In
      addition, non-irradiated, not treated areas will serve as reference and training areas for
      the individual visits.

      Topical treatments will be randomly assigned to the three test areas.
