    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus TG4010 (modified vaccinia virus Ankara [MVA]-human
      mucin 1 [MUC1]-interleukin-2 [IL2] vaccine) in previously treated patients with stage IV non
      squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with respect to objective response rate (ORR) by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Define the safety and toxicity profile of nivolumab plus TG4010 by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.

      Determine progression-free survival by RECIST 1.1.

      Determine overall survival.

      Determine the duration of response and the occurrence of responses over time.

      Determine the rate and duration of stable disease.

      Determine the disease control rate.
