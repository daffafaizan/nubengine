      the adjacent non-tumour tissues, for comparison in each individual. The tissues have been
      collected as part of routine clinical work/other studies, by liver biopsies or at liver
      resection/liver transplantation. Data regarding the patient characteristic will be collected.
      Whole genome sequencing analyses are planned to be performed.
