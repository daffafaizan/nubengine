    
      Study Design: Phase I, 2-stage Simon design (Simon et al., 1997), single-centre,
      un-controlled, open label, non randomized study.

      The therapeutic program will include radical surgical resection of the tumor, followed by
      immunotherapy. Immunotherapy will comprise 4 biweekly vaccinations first (injections I, II,
      III, IV), 2 further monthly vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination
      (injection VII) 2 months after the sixth one.

      Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while the others
      will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection (week 7), 6
      cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status,
      further vaccine boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination
      cycle.

      Study Population: The first stage of the study will include 22 patients with recurrent GBM.
      The overall population at the end of the study will consist of 72 patients.
