      The surgical procedure and the use of a heart-lung machine may disturb the function of
      platelets, why measures to protect the existing function of platelets are of prime concern.

      The present study aims to compare how two types of heart-lung machine methods influence
      platelet function in two groups of patients.

      The platelet function will be tested before, during and after surgery by the use of two
      independent methods.
