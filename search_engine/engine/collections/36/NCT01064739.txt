      they contain high levels of the dopamine precursor, dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa).In addition
      to the central nervous system functions of dopamine that are compromised in Parkinson's
      disease, renal dopamine has vasodilatory and natriuretic activity. Elevated urinary dopamine,
      however, does not consistently correlate with increased urinary sodium excretion, and there
      are conflicting opinions over the conditions under which renal dopamine might regulate sodium
      balance.The goal of our study was to clarify the natriuretic effect of fava beans, obtained
      from a source that serves patients with Parkinson's disease. Catechol and sodium data were
      compared in healthy volunteers using a longitudinal design in which all participants consumed
      a fixed sodium study diet on day 1 and the fixed sodium diet plus fava beans on day 2. Blood
      was sampled at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after breakfast, and three consecutive 4-hr urine samples
      were collected.

      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the most common form of orthostatic intolerance,
      affecting an estimated 500,000 Americans, principally young women. POTS refers to an
      excessive increase in heart rate (>30 beats per minute) on standing in the absence of
      orthostatic hypotension. Previous findings by the Robertson/Garland research group suggest
      that mechanisms involved in orthostatic and absolute volume regulation contribute to POTS
      pathophysiology. A follow-up study might compare the influences of diet in patients with POTS
      and healthy volunteers.
