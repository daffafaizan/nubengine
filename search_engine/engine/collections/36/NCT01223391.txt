      continuous BP monitoring and symptoms, ease-of-use and compliance scoring. In protocol 1,
      patients will exert abdominal compression to maximal tolerable and comfortable levels and
      values will be recorded. In protocol 2, patients will perform 3 standing maneuvers following
      a preceding rest period with and without abdominal compression at 20 mmHg (binders used in
      random order). In protocol 3, the standing maneuvers will be extended and the investigator
      will adjust binders to levels of abdominal compression corresponding to what patient gauged
      as maximal tolerable and comfortable levels. Comparison of outcome measures will establish
      which binder achieves higher abdominal compression, is easier to adjust, likely will be used
      in the future, if elastic and adjustable binders are equally effective in attenuating
      Orthostatic Hypotension and its associated symptoms at comparable pressures and which binder
      is more effective in recovering standing BP and improving orthostatic symptoms.
