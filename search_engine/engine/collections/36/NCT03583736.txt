      in uterine cancer. When controlled for stage, patients with longer time to treatment tend to
      have less favorable outcomes. Similarly, longer time to treatment has a negative impact on
      patients' quality of life and markers for anxiety. Our experience at this institution
      suggests that the time to referral (time from uterine cancer diagnosis and the patients'
      first encounter with the oncologist) is variable and presents the greatest opportunity for
      decreasing time to treatment. Among the factors that contribute to the time to referral are
      the time taken by the referring provider to relay the diagnosis to the patient, time taken to
      schedule an appointment with the specialist, and the patient's availability to keep an
      appointment.

      Virtual visits provide an opportunity to expedite consultation with the treating oncologist
      by removing some of the barriers that delay face-to-face visits. Among these barriers are
      patients' availability for a short notice face-to-face visit based on their work or family
      obligations, access to transportation, and mental preparedness.
