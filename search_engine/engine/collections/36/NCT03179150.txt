      interpretation with that of unassisted reading in the detection of lung metastases in
      consecutive patients staged for extrathoracic malignancies. This study also aims at
      validating a new Web/Cloud based workflow for the use of CAD systems in clinical practice,
      not requiring installation of additional software or hardware and potentially representing a
      cost-effective CAD solution for clinical facilities.
