      causes head, neck or jaw movement, and provide information regarding the optimum location and
      variable vibration parameters of vibratory stimulus on a subject's neck to cause head, neck,
      or jaw movement. The study will also provide information whether the subject experienced or
      did not experience a change in sleep stage or arousal by vibratory stimulus on a subject's
      neck. The data gathered from this study will be used for future studies in analyzing whether
      such vibratory stimulus can serve as a potential treatment for sleep disorders, such as
      snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.
