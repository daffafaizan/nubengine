      twelve without) will be enrolled at the San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Modafinil
      has been shown to increase alertness in individuals who are pathologically sleepy (Study
      C1538a/301/NAIUS).

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by excessive daytime sleepiness (value
      of >=9 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale). Subjects will receive either modafinil or placebo,
      supplied by the sponsor. The study drug will be taken by mouth once daily in the morning. The
      titration schedule will be as follows:

        1. The beginning does will be 50mg for 2 weeks

        2. The study medication will be increased to 100mg at the week 2 study visit

        3. The study medication will be increased to 200mg at the week 4 study visit and will
           continue for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. If subjects are unable to tolerate
           dosage increases, the dose will be decreased to the previous level.
