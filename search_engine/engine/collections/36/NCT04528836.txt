      non-randomized, Phase 1/1B study utilizing BOIN dose escalation followed by an expansion
      phase in patients with MAPK pathway- or RTK-driven advanced solid tumors. The primary
      objective is to determine safety and tolerability of BBP-398, the MTD and RP2D. The secondary
      objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile,
      preliminary anti-tumor activity, objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial
      response rate) and the duration of response (DoR) of BBP-398. The exploratory objective is to
      assess predictive biomarkers of response.
