    
      Study duration per participant will be approximately: 7 months for Stage 1 participants, 12
      to 18.5 months for Stage 2 participants, 12 months for Stage 3 participants and 18 months for
      Stage 4 participants

      In each vaccine group at each age group (Stage 1, 3 and 4 only), the first 5 participants
      enrolled (sentinels) will be assessed via early safety data review (ESDR) as a cohort for the
      evaluation of biological safety and overall safety profile for D01-D08 post dose 1. The
      safety data collected will be reviewed before proceeding with recruitment of remaining
      participants in each study group. Enrollment of remaining participants randomized to each
      group will be based on the outcome of the safety assessments of the sentinels: only a
      positive review outcome will allow the enrollment of the sentinel cohort of the respective
      lower age group.
