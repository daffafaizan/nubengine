      I. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on objective
      response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator per immune related Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) whose
      tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on
      progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator per irRECIST in patients with
      ROC whose tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.

      II. To evaluate clinical anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy based on PFS rate
      at 6, 12 and 18 months as assessed by the investigator per irRECIST in patients with ROC
      whose tumors show an immunoreactive gene expression signature.

      III. To evaluate and characterize the tolerability and safety profile of the study population
      after being treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess correlations of the immunoreactive gene signature with the validated a PD-L1
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using Merck's proprietary 22C3 antibody and the clinical
      activity observed in the study population.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
      for up to 35 courses (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and then every 9 and
      12 weeks thereafter.
