      IIIC/IV (AJCC 2010) carrying the BRAF V600 mutation, in order to achieve operability are
      enrolled in the NEO-VC-study. The main aim of this study is to achieve operability in a
      higher percentage of patients by neoadjuvant treatment through shrinkage of the tumors.
      Patients with operable stage IV disease show an impressive survival benefit with long term (5
      y.) survival rates around 30 %. Only a percentage of up to 20 % can presently be treated by
      complete metastasectomy. This percentage may be enlarged by pre-treatment with an efficacious
      antitumor drug.
