      ≤50nmol/L at randomization. One group will receive 100 000 UI cholecalciferol once a month
      during 6 months, the other group will receive no treatment during 6 months.

      In order to randomize patients with 25OHD ≤50nmol/L, supplemented patients will undergo a 3
      months wash-out period renewable 3 times (maximum of 12 months wash-out) until 25OHD reaches
      a level≤50nmol/L.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze if a 6 months period of oral cholecalciferol
      (i.e. native vitamin D) supplementation improves muscle strength of hemodialysis patients
      with low 25OHD vitamin D levels. Muscle strength will be assessed at 0, 3 and 6 months, by
      handgrip strength measured with a quantitative dynamometer.

      Secondary objectives are 1) to analyze 25OHD plasma levels after vitamin D wash-out and/or
      supplementation, as well as factors associated with 25OHD lowering speed during wash-out and
      2) to analyze if this supplementation improves patient's autonomy, reduces frailty risk and
      improves quality of life.
