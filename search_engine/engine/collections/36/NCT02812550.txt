      death in West countries. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for prevention of colorectal cancer
      disease. Screening for colorectal cancer with biennial faecal occult blood testing is a
      widely used strategy followed by colonoscopy for those with a positive test. Colonoscopy
      identifies polyps during the procedure as well as polyp removal in order to prevent
      progression to cancer. Although, interval cancer appears after a colonoscopy because of
      22-28% of polyp missed rates. Advanced Technology may improve adenoma detection rates so
      decrease interval cancer and reduce mortally. Full-spectrum endoscopy with 330ยบ angle vision
      decrease adenoma miss rate in general population.

      The investigators conducted a randomized trial in patients from colorectal cancer screening
      programme (aged 50-69 years) after faecal immunological test positive. One arm the
      colonoscopy is performed with standard forward view colonoscopy (170ยบ angle view) and the
      other arm is performed with full-spectrum endoscopy (EndoChoice) (330ยบ angle view)
