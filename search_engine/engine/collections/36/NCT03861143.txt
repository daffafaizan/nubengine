    
      Following a 28-day screening period, a total of 195 subjects with mild to moderate UC (total
      Mayo Score 4-10; Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] â‰¥ 2) are planned to be enrolled into this
      study from approximately 46 sites in Europe and the United States. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 low-dose (500 mg), BT-11 high-dose (1,000 mg) or
      placebo. Each of the treatment arms will comprise 65 subjects. The randomization will be
      stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy for UC (yes/no; exposed population limited
      to 30% of total sample) and corticosteroid use at baseline (yes/no).
