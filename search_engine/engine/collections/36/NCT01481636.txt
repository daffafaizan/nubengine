      pharyngeal airways during sleep causing hypoxic and hypercapnic episodes with the cessation
      of ventilation. Considering the high number of overweight and obese individuals in Western
      society the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind OSA are important. This observational
      study aims to investigate the correlations between the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      assessed by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and different health outcomes associated with the
      OSA.
