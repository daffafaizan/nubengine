    
      Carraguardâ„¢ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial fielded in one site in Chiang Rai,
      northern Thailand. The primary aims of the study were to assess Carraguard's safety
      (toxicity) in both men and women - including signs of local irritation, such as itching or
      burning; changes in vaginal flora (women); and incidence of abnormal external genital,
      vaginal (women), and cervical findings (women) - when applied vaginally prior to intercourse
      for 6 months; to evaluate acceptability; to gauge men's and women's reactions to a
      non-contraceptive microbicide; and to explore microbicide use dynamics in a Thai population.

      Secondary aims were to investigate sexually transmitted infections averted - including HIV,
      C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, and T. pallidum (preliminary indications) in
      men and women; bacterial vaginosis and candidaisis in women; and balanitis in men; and effect
      on cervical cytology.
