    
      This is a two year randomized clinical trial examining the feasibility, tolerability,
      acceptability (including adherence) and efficacy of an intervention designed to improve
      sexual functioning of survivors of rectal cancer.

      We have completed enrollment of female patients and are currently collecting follow up data.
      Recruitment for male patients is ongoing. Male participants will now be randomized in a 3:1
      ratio to either the intervention condition (n = 40) or the control condition (n = 40).
