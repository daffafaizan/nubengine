    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of enasidenib mesylate (AG221, IDHIFA) in combination
      with azacitidine (AZA) for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia is
      measured by overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine duration of response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the safety of enasidenib in combination with azacitidine in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate occurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status by IDH2 mutation
      analysis and flow cytometry.

      II. To investigate possible relationships between baseline protein and gene expression
      signatures and mutation profile and clinical response to the combination.

      III. To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of IDH-inhibitor related differentiation
      syndrome (IDH-DS) with combination therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days 1-7 and enasidenib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 5 years.
