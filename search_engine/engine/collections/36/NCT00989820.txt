      treated with radiotherapy for a tumor in the head and neck region. Part of the lower jaw
      becomes non-vital and has to be treated. ORN proofs to be a condition difficult to treat and
      the treatment for this condition varies.

      In many countries hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is added to the surgical treatment of ORN.
      Unfortunately there is no consensus whether the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to the
      treatment of ORN is beneficial or not. This study has the aim to investigate the efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness of HBOT in the treatment of ORN
