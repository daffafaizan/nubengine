      nonalcoholic individuals. Alcoholics have shown impairments in cognitive processing of
      emotional signals. Some alcoholics are impaired in social skills, and many are unable to
      implement the strategies for interpersonal interactions that they recommend for themselves.
      For example, alcoholics have difficulty interpreting non-verbal emotional cues and
      recognizing facial expressions of emotion. When listening to sentences, alcoholics also have
      some difficulty judging emotional intonations and emotional content. In our research, we are
      trying to understand where in the brain these emotional behaviors take place, and whether or
      not the brain functions differently for alcoholic and nonalcoholic individuals. We present
      emotional words and pictures on a computer screen, and using MRI scans, we observe how the
      brain works when people purposefully respond to the words and pictures. Additionally, we are
      comparing brain structure and activation patterns in men and women, because there may be
      gender differences in responses to emotional stimuli.
