      Then, the drug test article, clonidine HCl, 0.1 mg tabs, will be administered once daily by
      mouth at bedtime for one week. Steady-state PK will be measured on Day 8 post-drug with a
      single blood draw of 10 mL. This will be followed by a one week wash out period. During each
      of these three different one-week periods, sleep quality will be monitored nightly with a
      blue tooth and wireless enabled, wearable sleep tracker. Vital signs (VSs) will be monitored
      daily at home with a blue tooth and wireless enabled blood pressure machine. VSs and
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be measured before drug on Day (-7) and Day 1. Repeat
      measurements will be made during clinic visits on Day 2, Day 8, and Day 16.

      The findings should show that there is, or is not, a PD effect produced by this rather low
      dose of drug administered for a relatively short period of time. Showing a PD effect at a
      safe and reasonably well tolerated dose would qualify this drug dosing regimen as a
      pharmacological challenge in future studies.
