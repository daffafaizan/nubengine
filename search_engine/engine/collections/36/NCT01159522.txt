    
      This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation, safety and tolerability study. Eligible
      subjects will be assigned to a SCB01A dose level at the time of study entry and scheduled to
      receive two treatment cycles with SCB01A for the observation of DLT. A treatment cycle is
      defined as a three-hour infusion of SCB01A given every 21 days. Unless any off-study criteria
      are met, the study period of each subject can be up to two cycles.
