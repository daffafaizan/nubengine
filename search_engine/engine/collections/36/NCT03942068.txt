      recurrent ovarian cancer treated with apatinib with albumin-bound paclitaxel from 2019 to
      2020 in Henan Cancer Hospital.Antiangiogenic treatments have been implicated to play a major
      role in ovarian cancer (OC). Apatinib, a novel oral antiangiogenic agent targeting vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2), in combination with weekly paclitaxel, may
      improve clinical outcomes compared with apatinib or paclitaxel alone in patients with
      refractory or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
