      syndrome. More than 2 billion people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world
      are at risk of dengue virus infection, which is the leading cause of hospitalization and
      death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine called rDEN2/4delta30(ME), which
      is derived from the DEN2 and DEN4 serotypes.

      This study will last 180 days. Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to receive
      rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo at study entry. Cohort 2 will begin only after safety review of
      all participants in Cohort 1. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive a higher dose of
      rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo.

      After vaccination, participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes for immediate
      adverse reactions. Participants will also be asked to monitor their temperature every day for
      16 days. Study visits will occur every other day after vaccination until Day 16, followed by
      4 additional visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection and a targeted
      physical exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants will be asked to undergo a
      skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
