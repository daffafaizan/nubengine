      latest 24 hours preceding the infiltration and the mean leg pain preceding the visit S4
      (visit 4 weeks after the infiltration). If difference is of 50% patient will be considered
      "improved". This study will be organized under three steps:Step 1 : when 124 patients will be
      randomized: first intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1+ 2+ 3 versus 4. If
      significant difference is not demonstrated, study will be stopped at this stage since having
      demonstrating that infiltration or simulation is inefficient. On the other case, step 2 will
      be performed.Step 2 : Recruitment is continued only in arms 1 to 3 until reaching a total of
      142 randomized patients. Second intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1+ 2
      versus 3. If significant difference is not demonstrated, study will be stopped at this stage
      since having demonstrating that infiltration is inefficient. On the other case, step 3 will
      be performed.Step 3 : Recruitment is continued only in arms 1 and 2 until reaching a total of
      274 randomized patients. Third intermediate analysis to compare efficacy of groups 1 versus
      2.
