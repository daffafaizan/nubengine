      because the food needs to be cooked first and it will take time to prepare. Besides, the
      egg-white sandwich is not suitable for those with allergies to egg and bread and also to
      vegetarian patients. This gold-standard meal is also not a common meal for Asian people so
      some of the people may not tolerate with the meal. The aim of this study is to determine
      whether Abbott VitalÂ® is as reliable as the gold-standard egg-white sandwich by comparing the
      gastric meal retention of both meals.
