      atherosclerotic disease involving the lower limb because it is associated with a high degree
      of mortality and morbidity. Below the knee arterial disease is the basis of critical limb
      ischemia (CLI). It is generally characterized by the involvement of multiple tibial arteries,
      long lesions and high rate of hronic total occlusions. Percutaneous treatment of tibial
      arteriopathy is characterized by high restenosis (70%). The advent of the drug-eluting
      strategy has led to a reduction in the restenosis of the femoral and tibial district with
      paclitaxel eluting devices. Data are not yet available on sirolimus eluting devices, both for
      the femoropopliteal and tibial districts. The objective of this study is to compare the
      remote patency of paclitaxel (Lithos) vs. the sirolimus (magic touch) eluting balloons in
      patients with CLI undergoing tibial artery revascularization.

      The study will enroll only patients with optimal balloon angioplasty defined by angiographic
      and ultrasound criteria in order to avoid biases related to potentially unbalanced suboptimal
      angioplasty results in both groups. The patients will be followed by either
      interventionalists as well as diabetic foot specialists in order to optimize their
      surveillance for lesion healings and vessel patency and reduced dropout.
