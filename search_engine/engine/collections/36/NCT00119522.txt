      primarily male (96%) population was 55 + 13 years old, and had their SCI for an average of 21
      + 13 years. 47% of the injury levels were cervical and 46% thoracic. The majority of subjects
      used manual wheelchairs (62%) an average of 10.9 + 4.3 hours a day. 553 fall events were
      reported by 204 individuals. 95 (14%) subjects were injured as a result of the fall.
      Regression models showed that fall occurrence was predicted by increased pain in past two
      months, increased alcohol use, higher FIM sub-motor scores, having a previous fall, shorter
      wheelchair length, fewer years of SCI, and not having one's first wheelchair. Injurious falls
      were predicted by increased pain in past two months, higher FIM sub-motor scores, having a
      previous fall, non-flat home entrance and a diagnosis of arthritis. In both models, 83% of
      the variance was explained by the predictors. Additional analysis is planned for completion
      of manuscripts. In addition, funding was received to develop a risk assessment tool for falls
      from wheelchairs in SCI.

      Final analyses are being conducted and 17 manuscripts are currently in development.
