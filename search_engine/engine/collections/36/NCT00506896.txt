    
      A randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted including 60 patients with RA.
      Patients were randomized to receive either a single intra-articular knee injection with
      triamcinolone hexacetonide 60 mg and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 mL) associated to a single
      intramuscular injection of 1 mL of xylocaine chloride 2% (IAI group) or 1 mL of xylocaine
      chloride 2% by intra-articular injection and a intramuscular injection of triamcinolone
      acetonide 60 mg and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 mL) (IM group). Evaluations were performed at
      baseline and 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-intervention. The following instruments were used: the
      ACR 20%, 50 and 70% improvement criteria; VAS for knee morning stiffness, pain and edema;
      knee circumference and goniometry; Likert's scale of improvement (IVAS); daily use of oral
      glucocorticoid and NSAIDs, blood pressure and adverse effects.
