    
      Background: The devastating COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a high prothrombotic state.
      It is unclear if the coagulation abnormalities occur because of the direct effect of SARS-CoV
      2 or indirectly by the cytokine storm and endothelial damage, or by a combination of
      mechanisms. There is a clear indication of in-hospital pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for
      every patient with COVID-19 after bleed risk assessment. However, there is much debate
      regarding the best dosage regimen, and there is no consensus on the role of extended VTE
      prophylaxis.

      Design: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for
      35+/-4 days versus no intervention after hospital discharge in COVID-19 patients who were at
      increased risk for VTE and have received standard parenteral VTE prophylaxis during
      hospitalization, with a composite efficacy endpoint of symptomatic VTE, VTE-related death,
      and/or VTE detected by mandatory bilateral lower limbs venous duplex scan and computed
      tomography pulmonary angiogram on day 35+/-4 post-hospital discharge.

      Summary: The Michelle trial is expected to provide high-quality evidence around the role of
      extended thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 and will help guide medical decisions in clinical
      practice.
