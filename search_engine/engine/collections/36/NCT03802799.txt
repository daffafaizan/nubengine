    
      This is an open-label extension, multiple-center study, to assess the long-term safety and
      tolerability of CBD administered as ZYN002, a transdermal gel, for the treatment of child and
      adolescent patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Male and female patients with FXS will be
      treated for up to 12 months. Up to 300 male and female patients, ages 3 to 18 years will be
      enrolled.

      Parents/caregivers will apply the study gel twice daily for the 52-week treatment period.

      Participants who weigh less than or equal to 35 kg, will receive 1 sachet of ZYN002, applied
      every 12 hours (± 2 hours).

      Participants who weigh more than 35 kg will receive 2 sachets of ZYN002, applied every 12
      hours (± 2 hours).

      At the Investigator's discretion, the dose may be increased to a total of 4 sachets a day or
      decreased to a total of 2 sachets a day any time after the first month of treatment.

      Participants whose weight changes during the course of the study may have their doses changed
      at the investigator's discretion on or after the Month 1 visit, or reduced due to
      tolerability issues at investigator's discretion.

      Participants who are taking anti-epileptic drugs may have an additional one or two weeks of
      treatment after the 52 week treatment period to taper off study treatment.

      Blood samples will be collected for safety analysis of ZYN002. Additionally, the
      parents/caregivers will be asked to complete some questionnaires. There will be other
      questionnaires and scales that will be completed at the site by the study doctor and/or with
      the participant and their parents/caregivers.
