      and Rehabilitation Department in Ankara, Turkey. The demographic and clinical characteristics
      of the patients were recorded. Voluntary patients with SIS were regarded as eligible for the
      study if they met the inclusion criteria. Pain, posture and functionality were assessed
      before and after intervention. Patients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to
      participate were randomly allocated to Group 1 [Conventional therapy (CT)], Group 2 [CT+ PNF
      in extremity pattern] and Group 3 [CT+ PNF in extremity pattern+PNF in scapula and upper
      trunk patterns]. A simple randomization method was used with opaque sealed envelopes
      containing "A", "B" or "C". Group allocation was performed by an independent therapist, not
      involved in the study. All patients received physiotherapy for approximately 60 mins each
      session, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks. Conventional therapy consisted of cold pack (15
      minutes); pulsed ultrasound therapy (1 watt/cmÂ², 3 MHz, 1:2 pulsed mode; 3 minutes);
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (60-120 Hz; 20 minutes) and exercises (20
      minutes). The exercises included stretching, strengthening and posture exercises. The
      exercises, and the duration and intensity of conventional physiotherapy were selected
      according to previous studies which showed that a physiotherapy program 3 times a week for 6
      weeks was effective in improving function and relieving pain in SIS. The physiotherapy
      program was applied to all patients at the same intensity by the same physiotherapist and
      patients did the exercises every day throughout the 6-week period. The patients were also
      advised to avoid overhead activities.
