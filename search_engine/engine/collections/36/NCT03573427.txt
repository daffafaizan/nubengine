      CRT implants.This trial will assess feasibility of a larger scale randomized controlled
      study.

      Patients consented to the study will receive a CRT device with or without ICD, placed in the
      same time frame, and will have RA and RV leads implanted as the standard of care. The device
      will be implanted in a facility that has the capacity to perform trans-atrial septal puncture
      with ultrasound guidance (TEE or ICE) at the time of implantation. The LV lead will be placed
      using a trans-atrial septal approach, using specially designed puncture tools and LVendo
      delivery tool kits specifically designed for this study. Special care will be taken to avoid
      the LV apex and transmural scar identified by pre-implant imaging. Electrical testing, and
      programming of the device will be standardized.
