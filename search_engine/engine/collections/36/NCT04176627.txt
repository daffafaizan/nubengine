        -  Cross-sectional study, inviting PD patients at 10 Northern CA home dialysis units to
           participate. One-time ultrasound done during monthly nurse visit between December 2019
           and March 2020. All patients present for their monthly visit at participating home
           dialysis units on days in which ultrasound available will be eligible, unless they had
           already completed an ultrasound for the study.

        -  Eligible patients approached for informed consent

        -  Ultrasound method: 28 areas of the anterior and lateral thorax examined for B lines,
           need at least 3 B lines in each field to be counted- recorded for future validation

        -  Training: lung ultrasound training modules accredited by American College of Emergency
           Physicians, in addition to dedicated rotation of ultrasound training during internal
           medicine residency.

        -  Separate nurse clinical evaluation- yes or no, nurse blinded from ultrasound results

        -  Patient characteristics obtained from dialysis EHR and form 2728: Age, gender (male sex
           %), race, ethnicity, case of ESRD, dialysis vintage (mo), PD modality, BMI, DM (%), SBP,
           DBP, albumin , # of antihypertensives, use of diuretic, use of icodextrin, PD Rx, 24
           hour urine volume, lung disease (%), heart failure (%)

        -  Lung ultrasound info documented in EHR along with nurse evaluation. If moderate-severe
           lung congestion on ultrasound, nephrologist notified in person, by phone or fax.

        -  Prescription changes from nephrologist (diuretic adjustment, dextrose concentration
           change, addition of icodextrin, or none) within 2 weeks tracked in EHR and/or in person
           with dialysis nurse

        -  Sample size calculation- assuming 30% subclinical fluid overload prevalence, 95%
           confidence interval of prevalence of subclinical fluid overload with 10% margin of
           error-> 81 patients
