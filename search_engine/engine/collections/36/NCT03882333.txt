      on pain intensity and movement control. It also aims to investigate potential differences in
      movement control between patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain compared to healthy
      controls. All tests will be conducted at Dalarna University.

      After the initial baseline tests, participants will be randomised to either acute exercise
      intervention group or to a control group not performing any intervention groups (both
      patients and controls will be randomised to intervention or control). If randomised to the
      control group, participants rests corresponding to the time it takes to perform the
      intervention (30 min), and then preform the post-intervention tests similar as the
      intervention group.
