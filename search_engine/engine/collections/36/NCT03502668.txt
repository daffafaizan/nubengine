    
      A Phase 1-2, multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to
      assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and hematologic response in
      subjects with IPSS risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS. The study will be
      conducted in 2 phases.

      Phase 1: In Stage A, subjects will be randomized into 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each testing
      different doses of oral decitabine with cedazuridine in 28-day cycles. When safety has been
      established in Phase 1 Stage A, Phase 1 Stage B will open, wherein additional 30 subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 cohorts of 10 subjects.

      Phase 2: Using 2 doses/schedules one of which will be selected from Phase 1, 40 additional
      subjects per dose/schedule will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The selected doses/schedules
      will be evaluated for safety (drug-related AEs), efficacy (including hematologic response),
      PD (LINE-1 methylation, and fetal hemoglobin as fraction of total hemoglobin), and PK.
