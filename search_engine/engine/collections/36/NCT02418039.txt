      factors involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. However ; it is also known
      than the restriction on the consumption of protein predisposes to depletion of muscle mass,
      and increase the risk to develop overt hepatic encephalopathy, due to the muscle role in the
      detoxification of ammonia in presence of liver failure. Currently, the type and amount of
      protein in the diet to treat minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is unknown. In this study,
      the investigators will administrated two types of protein content in patients with MHE: a
      high protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day) vs a normal protein diet (0.8 g/kg/day) during 1 month.
