      menstrual cycle.

      Randomization will take place on day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle, according to a list of
      random allocation of treatments and egg-donors will be assigned to random start ovarian
      stimulation: During follicular phase starting at day 5,7,9,11 or 13 of the menstrual cycle
      and during luteal phase starting at luteinizing hormone (LH) peak +3,+5,+7,+9 or +11.

      Egg-donors will receive urinary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 150-225 IU/d in
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol with cetrorelix acetate 0,25 mg/d
      starting five days after ovarian stimulation and a GnRH agonist trigger with triptorelin 0,2
      mg to induce the final follicular maturation. Transvaginal ultrasound and serum analysis
      (estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH) will be included for cycle monitoring.
