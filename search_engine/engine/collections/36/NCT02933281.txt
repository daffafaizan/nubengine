      immunogenicity study in 144 healthy adults with and without LTBI. All participants will have
      received previous BCG vaccination in infancy. The investigational product is MTBVAC at four
      dose levels: 5 x 10^3 CFU, 5 x 10^4 CFU, 5 x 10^5 CFU, and 5 x 10^6 CFU. The active control
      is BCG (5 x 10^5 CFU).

      Participants meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized within a study
      cohort to receive a single dose of MTBVAC or BCG revaccination administered intradermally on
      Study Day 0. The study will be conducted at one site in South Africa. Participants will be
      enrolled into one of eight cohorts and followed for safety and immunogenicity endpoints
      through Study Day 182. The estimated time to complete enrolment is approximately 9 months.

      Cohorts 1-8 will include 72 QFT-negative (Cohorts 1-4) and 72 QFT-positive (Cohorts 5-8)
      participants. Participants will be randomized within each cohort, to receive either MTBVAC
      (N=96) or BCG (N=48). The cohorts will be enrolled as described in the protocol, as long as
      no pausing/stopping rules are triggered
