      University of Minnesota. Researchers will interview the patient and describe procedures and
      risks. An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in an upper extremity for infusing magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) contrast dye. Baseline MRI scans will be done. These MRI measurements
      will be compared with clinical, radiological and pathological findings (the gold standard).

      Follow-up contact will occur within one year after the MRI to determine whether a pathology
      report is available.
