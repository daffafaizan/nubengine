      methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring compound that may have antidepressant effects.
      SAMe may also enhance the effectiveness of other antidepressants, such as selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study will determine the effectiveness of oral SAMe in
      enhancing the effects of SSRIs in patients currently not responding to SSRI treatment.

      This study will last 6 weeks. No follow-up visits will occur. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to add either oral SAMe or placebo to their existing SSRI regimen for 6 weeks.
      Depression scales and self-report questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms will be used
      to assess participants at the end of the study.
