    
      51 patientes with dizziness and glucose intolerance diagnosed by the glucose tolerance test
      were selected.

      The subjects were submited to CDP SOT conditions and a visual analogue scale to measure his
      self perception about dizziness.

      Then, they were randomized in two groups: with and without fractioned diet without glucose
      during 30 days.

      The CDP was repeated in order to verify a statistical difference of SOT condition 5 that
      reflects the individual hability to maintain the own posture with the vestibule solely and CS
      - that represents the final balance situation.

      The VAS was repeated too in order to verify the self perception of the dizziness after diet.
