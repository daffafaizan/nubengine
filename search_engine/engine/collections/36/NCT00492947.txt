      body does not know that the cancer cells are making you sick. We hope to teach your white
      blood cells to find and destroy your cancer cells with a vaccine. The vaccine will be made
      from a special kind of blood cell called a dendritic cell. This is the cell that will carry
      the information about your cancer to your white blood cells in your body.
