      I. To determine the efficacy of letrozole plus imatinib mesylate in patients with estrogen
      receptor (ER) and or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of letrozole plus imatinib mesylate in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer.

      III. To determine the time to disease progression and overall survival in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer who are treated with letrozole plus imatinib mesylate.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and letrozole PO once
      daily (QD) for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 and 4 weeks and at 2,
      4, 6, 9, and 12 months.
