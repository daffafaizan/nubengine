      setting of chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Patients with CLTI usually present with
      infra-popliteal arterial occlusions and endovascular therapies to restore blood flow are
      often preferred considering their inherently less invasive nature and because of multiple
      patient background comorbidities or absence of a suitable vein conduit in these patients.
      Below The Knee (BTK) plain balloon angioplasty (POBA) remains the only viable "standard of
      care" in the management of long "Real World" BTK Lesions. However tibial angioplasty is
      plagued by high rate of re-occlusion/stenosis because of barotrauma caused by the
      intra-arterial ballooning and subsequent development of neointimal hyperplasia. Devices
      coated with paclitaxel have been used successfully to limit restenosis by inhibiting the
      biologic pathway that leads to intimal hyperplasia. However, a recent formal systematic
      review and study-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating treatment
      of the infra-popliteal arteries with paclitaxel-coated balloons compared with conventional
      balloon angioplasty for critical limb ischemia (CLI) was recently published showing
      amputation-free survival was significantly worse in use of paclitaxel coated balloons
      compared to plain angioplasty. Furthermore current poor patency seen in BTK angioplasty is
      likely contributed in part by small vessel size and poor luminal gain after standard
      semi-compliant POBA. Vessel Preparation and Optimising POBA with High Pressure, Non-Compliant
      balloons may help achieve Luminal Gain for rapid and sustained flow for wound healing. The
      objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the 6-month safety and performance outcome of
      the non-compliant high pressure JADE balloon for the treatment of infrainguinal stenotic
      occlusive or stenotic TASC C & D lesions in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia.
