      ventilation receive next to midazolam either remifentanyl or fentanyl for analgesia and
      sedation. The study medication will be started not later than 12 hours after intubation and
      the maximum application time is 96 hours. The opioid infusion rate is started with either
      9µg/kg/h remifentanyl or 3µg/kg/h fentanyl and will be adapted according to a clinical
      sedation score (Hartwig- and Comfort score). The maximum infusion rate is 30µg/kg/h
      remifentanyl or 10µg/kg/h fentanyl.

      To judge the efficacy of both opioids, we will evaluate the sedation scores every 6 hours and
      measure the skin conductance during a painful procedure (tracheal suctioning). Next to the
      adverse events we document different vital parameters like heart rate, blood pressure or
      oxygen saturation every 6 hours to estimate the safety of both opioids.

      The midazolam plasma level will be determined immediately before termination of the opioid
      and midazolam infusion when the child is clinically judged to be ready for extubation. The
      child will be extubated as soon as it reaches a certain level in the sedation score and
      exhibits stable spontaneous breathing.

      After extubation we will look in both treatment groups for the possible development of
      hyperalgesia by investigating the cutaneous flexor reflex with von Frey hairs. The trial ends
      for each patient 48 hours after extubation.
