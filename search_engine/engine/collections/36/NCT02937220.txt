      prognosis of implants and crestal bone resorption. Accordingly this study will investigate
      the influence of metal ceramic crowns and monolithic zirconia crowns on crestal bone
      resorption under loading. Also these crown materials greatly influence the final aesthetic
      outcome of the definitive restoration, which will be evaluated using the pink and white
      aesthetic scoring systems.
