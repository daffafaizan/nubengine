      repair is therefore warranted when the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of complications
      following surgery. Aneurysm rupture occurs when the forces (stress) acting on the aneurysm
      wall surpass aneurysm wall strength. Information on both wall stress and strength might
      therefore improve rupture risk assessment and patient selection for prophylactic repair.
      Although aneurysm wall stress calculations are possible, no in vivo method exists to
      determine aneurysm wall strength. This study was designed to identify possible biomarkers of
      aneurysm wall strength
