      I. To compare the change in gastric mucosal interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) cytokine level,
      quantified by Luminex assay technology, after a 6-month intervention in participants randomly
      assigned to the curcumin (Meriva [curcuminoids]) versus placebo arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of Meriva versus placebo. II. To compare changes
      in Histology Gastric Score (HGS) from baseline to 6 months for Meriva versus placebo.

      III. To compare changes in additional gastric mucosal cytokine/chemokine levels (interleukin
      8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFalpha], and inducible protein 10 [IP-10];
      quantified by Luminex assay).

      IV. To compare changes in gastric mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage as assessed by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), of the biomarkers 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and
      phosphorylated subtype of histone H2A (H2AX).

      V. To explore associations between proinflammatory cytokine genotype status (IL-1beta, IL-8,
      and TNFalpha single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; characterized at baseline) and the above
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 180 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 180 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 7 months.
