      (i.e infants at high-risk for CP) will be evaluated by the Neonatology team and the
      recruitment will be done after discharge from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) during the
      follow up performed by infants previously enrolled in the first observational phase (aimed to
      identify infants at high risk for CP) and will begin with the signing of the participation
      agreement by the parents. The study is designed as randomized clinical trial. Recruited
      infants will be randomized in two groups: CareToy intervention vs Infant Massage. All infants
      will perform the home based and family centered early intervention according to their
      allocation group for 8 weeks. Before (T0), after the intervention period (T1) and in follow
      up (at T2, 8 wks after T1 and at 18 mths of post term age) all infants will be evaluated with
      standardized scales and questionnaires in order to evaluate the effects of EI on motor,
      cognitive and visual development and parent-infant interaction. Moreover the sleep
      organization, before and after the intervention, will be studied using actigraphs. The sample
      size has been calculated on the basis of the primary outcome measure (Infant Motor Profile).
