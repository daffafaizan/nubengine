      microspheres that digest into the ileum, were previously shown to reduce food intake in a
      diet-induced obese rat model by activating the gut-brain axis. These results suggested that
      SDCs trigger the ileal brake, which is a feedback mechanism controlling stomach-mediated
      transit of a meal. The ileal brake is characterized by delayed gastric emptying rate and
      increased satiety. The goal of this work was to determine if common SDCs trigger the ileal
      brake in humans, using gastric emptying rate as a proxy indicator. In a human study, SDCs
      were delivered through a semi-solid yogurt matrix, and gastric half-emptying time and
      postprandial glycemic response were assessed. The study was a five-arm, double-blind,
      crossover design with a one-week washout period between treatments (n=20, 9 females, 11
      males). Four different carbohydrate ingredients (SDCs: isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO),
      XtendÂ® sucromalt, and raw corn starch; and non-SDC: maltodextrin) were incorporated
      individually, or in combination, into yogurt products matched in energy density and
      viscosity. Participants consumed 300 g test meals of yogurt formulated with one or a
      combination of the carbohydrate ingredients after an overnight fast. Gastric emptying rates
      and glycemic response were measured using a 13C-labeled octanoic acid breath test and
      continuous glucose monitors, respectively. Glucose readings were continuously monitored 24 h
      prior to and 48 h after test meal consumption, and breath samples were collected for a 4 h
      period following test meal consumption.
