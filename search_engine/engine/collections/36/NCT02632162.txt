        -  Evaluate the prevalence of sleep apnea after cardiac surgery

        -  Compare results interindividually (group A vs. group B) and intraindividually
           (longitudinal assessment after 3 months)

      Outcome(s)

        -  Prevalence of sleep apnoe at day 1 and 20 of rehabilitation and 3 months after cardiac
           surgery

        -  composite endpoint of events at 3 months (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial
           infarction, non-fatal cardiac arrest, revascularisation procedure, new atrial
           fibrillation and stroke)

        -  change in 6-minute walking test (6-MWT)

        -  impact of heart surgery on sleep apnoe
