      based pain management guidelines. Barriers to pain management in nursing homes occur on
      several levels including lack of knowledge and negative beliefs towards pain of care workers.

      For this embedded mixed-methods pilot study a convenience sample of maximum six nursing homes
      will be recruited. The planned intervention comprises the implementation of pain management
      policies, training of all care workers in pain assessment and management as well as training
      and introduction of a facility pain champion. Quantitative outcomes assessed at baseline,
      after three and six months include self-efficacy and attitudes to pain of care workers,
      functional interference from pain and pain intensity in residents. Feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention and potential barriers to its implementation will be
      explored in focus groups and interviews.
