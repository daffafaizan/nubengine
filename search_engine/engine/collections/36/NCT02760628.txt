      volunteer firefighters comprise the majority of firefighters, often with negative
      consequences for the health of personnel. While rates of overweight and obesity remain high
      among firefighters and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of line of duty
      deaths, few resources tailored to the unique culture and needs of firefighters are available
      to help occupational medicine physicians who provide their fitness for duty examinations. By
      engaging firefighters and occupational medicine clinicians in tailoring an internet/mobile
      intervention and pilot testing the program with a sample of volunteer firefighters, the
      investigators will be poised to implement a full-scale clinical trial with the developed
      program.
