      treatment, two-sequence, bioequivalence study to investigate the bioequivalence of generic
      tacrolimus and its reference listed drug (RLD).

      Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), has been widely used in solid organ and bone
      marrow transplants for more than two decades. Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase,
      is instrumental for signal transduction for activation of T cell and B cell, which in turn
      cause production of autoinflammatory cytokines such as such as interleukin 2 (IL- 2), tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). CNIs prevents the
      dephosphorylation and translocation of various factors such as the nuclear factor of
      activated T-cells (NF-AT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells
      (NF-κB), thereby inhibiting the signal transduction responsible for growth and proliferation
      of activated T cells and expression of autoinflammatory cytokines. This mechanism of action
      results in immunosuppression and prevents organ rejection.

      However, therapeutic drug monitoring is required for tacrolimus since the range between
      tacrolimus therapeutic and toxic tacrolimus whole blood concentrations is narrow and some
      toxicities are serious and/or irreversible. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      bioequivalence of generic Tacrolimus and RLD in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-lactating
      female volunteers under fasting conditions.

      The outcome of this study will help further understanding about pharmacokinetic (PK)
      performance of tacrolimus in a healthy volunteer population and improve review standards for
      bioequivalence of narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs.
