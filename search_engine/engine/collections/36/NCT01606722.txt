      virologic failure while on a PI-containing regimen was allowed if the genotypic resistance
      tests showed no major resistance mutation associated to reduced susceptibility to DRV/rtv
      according to the International AIDS Society. Patients with transitory episodes of detectable
      plasma HIV-RNA viral load ("blip") preceded and followed by a plasma viral load <50 copies/mL
      without changes in antiretroviral treatment could also been included. The only exclusion
      criteria were pregnancy, hepatitis B coinfection and the concomitant use of drugs with
      potential major interactions with DRV/rtv pharmacokinetics.
