      III rectal cancer. Compared to postoperative chemoradiotherapy, the advantage of preoperative
      application of chemotherapeutics and irradiation includes improved compliance, reduced
      toxicity and downstaging of the tumour in a substantial number of patients. The latter may
      enhance the rate of curative surgery, permit sphincter preservation in patients with
      low-sited tumours and have a positive impact on the quality of life of these patients. Orally
      administered capecitabine (XelodaÂ®, Hoffmann - La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) mimics the
      pharmacokinetics of continuous 5-FU infusion and makes chemoradiotherapy more
      patient-friendly. The mechanism of capecitabine activation, preferably in tumour cells, may
      further enhance its efficacy and tolerability, offering the potential for an enhanced
      therapeutic ratio.The aim of the present phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      toxicity of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine in patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is a pathologically determined
      complete remission rate (pCR) of the disease locally and regionally. Secondly, the rate of
      sphincter preservation in low-sited tumours, overall downstaging rate,toxicity and survival
      parameters will be analysed.
