      cavitational effects. The non-thermal energy up-regulates cell activity and promotes growth
      factor and protein synthesis, fibrinolysis, and is anti-bacterial. The technology selectively
      emulsifies dead and dying tissues with micro-sized gas bubbles, stimulates membranes of
      surrounding healthy cells, and render bacteria more susceptible to antibiotic treatment.
      Thus, in addition to creating an optimal environment, the modality also serves to promote the
      process of healing. At St. Michael's Hospital, ultrasound debridement is already being used
      in the wound clinic with promising results. However, objective comparisons need to be made to
      quantify and qualify our clinical observations. The goal of the proposed pilot study is to
      assess feasibility of our current study design and allow us to refine the research
      methodology for the development of a larger-scale study.
