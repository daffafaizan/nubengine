    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine if cytogenetic abnormalities can predict clinical outcome, in terms of
           response to treatment and survival, in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
           registered to the nephrectomy arm (arm I) of SWOG-8949.

        -  Correlate cytogenetic abnormalities and DNA content analysis (DNA index and S-phase
           fraction) with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a partially prospective, partially retrospective, multicenter, companion
      study.

      Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens from patients enrolled in SWOG-8949 are evaluated by
      cytogenetic analysis (e.g., presence of trisomy and loss of Y chromosome) and flow cytometric
      analysis (e.g., presence of nondiploid cells and presence of abnormal proliferation index).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
