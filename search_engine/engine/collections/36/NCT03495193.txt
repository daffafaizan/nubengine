      dysfunction and sleep problems. These symptoms can be more disabling than the motor symptoms
      of PD. Medications are often not effective for treating these non-motor symptoms or can have
      unwanted side effects. Non- medication treatments such as exercise are known to improve the
      motor symptoms of PD, but the effect of exercise on cognition and sleep has not been fully
      explored. This study investigates the impact of 16 weeks of supervised exercise, 3 times per
      week, compared to no-exercise over the same duration, on cognition and sleep dysfunction.
      Participants will be evaluated with cognitive tests and sleep studies before and after
      16-weeks to determine the impact of this exercise intervention. The goal of this research is
      to identify an intervention that will improve cognition and sleep in persons with PD.
