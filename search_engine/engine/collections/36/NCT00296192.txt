    
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of rotigotine nasal spray (SPM
      952)in a single dose application scheme. Subjects will undergo a 2-28 days screening period
      in which eligibility criteria will be checked. Subjects will then be hospitalized for one
      night. In the morning of the next day, subjects will be randomly assigned either to
      rotigotine or placebo nasal spray and will then receive a single dose of trial medication.
      Safety assessments after application include adverse events, 12-lead electrocardiograms,
      blood pressure and heart rate assessments, and laboratory checks. Efficacy will be assessed
      by application of motor examination scores.
