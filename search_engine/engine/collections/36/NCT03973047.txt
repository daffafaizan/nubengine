    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized study to evaluate the rate of nausea in healthy premenopausal
      study participants following a single dose of BMT with or without a single 8 mg po dose of
      Zofran given 30 minutes before BMT dosing. The study consists of a 21-day screening period
      for subject eligibility followed by a 1-day double-blind period in which all subjects receive
      a single open-label dose of 1.75 mg SC BMT after receiving a single blinded dose of Zofran
      (ondansetron) 8 mg or placebo. Approximately 228 subjects will be enrolled at up to two study
      sites in the United States. Safety and tolerability of BMT administration will be summarized
      and assessed.
