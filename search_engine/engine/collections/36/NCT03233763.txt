      with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML. Samples will be sent from district general
      hospitals and teaching hospitals.

      Results will be returned to referring clinicians in the same way investigators currently
      return results for samples sent for standard tests. The service will be advertised through
      the Royal Marsden Website with visibility to both participants and HCPs). The investigators
      will also inform all the clinicians involved in the AML working party (Dr Taussig is a member
      of the AML working group).

      In addition we are looking at diagnostic approaches to IDH 1 and 2 mutation identification.

      An initial comparison of 50 samples by three analysis methods will be conducted.

      IDH1 and IDH2 variant discovery will first be performed using an established standard in
      house SOP (SOP: SMD103) for CE-SSCA
