      throughout the study. Another purpose is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK - the study of
      the way the drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of trodusquemine
      (MSI-1436). Finally, this study will also determine whether trodusquemine (MSI-1436) has any
      effect on appetite, mood or behavior, and selective biomarkers (substances in your blood that
      may change in response to the study drug).
