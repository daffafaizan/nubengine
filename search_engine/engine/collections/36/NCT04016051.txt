      respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or acute
      bacterial bronchitis) and who needed antibiotic treatment. The study compared treatment
      satisfaction and treatment adherence of oral clarithromycin DST (125 mg, 187.5 mg, or 250 mg
      twice daily) with the established oral clarithromycin syrup administered via a graduated
      syringe (Klacid Syrup ForteÂ®, 250 mg/5mL) at the same fixed daily doses.

      Fixed doses of 125 mg, 187.5 mg and 250 mg of clarithromycin DST offer the pediatrician the
      flexibility to treat children of different body weight and age adequately at the recommended
      daily dose of 15 (12.5-20) mg/kg. All children were treated for 7 to 10 day (14 to 20 doses).
      Treatment satisfaction by the guardian/caregiver in terms of handling and administration of
      the clarithromycin DST straw and the comparator clarithromycin syrup, convenience of the
      administration, acceptance of taste and aftertaste, and treatment satisfaction with respect
      to future use was evaluated by means of a Parents' Questionnaire once on either Day 3, 4, or
      5 and once on either Day 11, 12, 13, or 14. In addition, treatment adherence/willingness of
      medication intake and the child's health status were assessed. The safety program comprised
      recording and evaluation of adverse events and countermeasures.
