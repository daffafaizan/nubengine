    
      Background: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is common and can lead to infertility, ectopic
      pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain.

      Objectives: To see if screening and treatment of chlamydial infection reduces the incidence
      of PID over 12 months, and to investigate the natural history of chlamydial infection and the
      role of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in the development of chlamydia associated PID.

      Design: Randomised trial over one year

      Setting: Common rooms, bars and lecture theatres at universities and colleges in London, UK.

      Participants: 2500 sexually active female students aged <28 years will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire on sexual health and to provide a self-administered vaginal swab and smear with
      follow up after a year.

      Intervention: Following randomisation, vaginal swabs from intervention women will be tested
      for chlamydia by PCR and those infected referred for treatment. Vaginal swabs from control
      women will be stored and analysed after a year. Vaginal smears will be Gram stained and
      analysed for BV.

      Main outcome measure: Incidence of clinical PID over 12 months in intervention and control
      groups.

      Possible cases of PID will be identified from questionnaires and record searches.
      Confirmation of the diagnosis will be done by detailed review of medical records by two
      independent researchers blind to whether the woman is in the intervention or control group.
