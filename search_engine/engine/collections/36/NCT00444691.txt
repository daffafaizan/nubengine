      patients' follow-up) interventional study in 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      justifying anti-TNF treatment.

      The overall duration of the study will be 8 months composed of a 4-month inclusion period and
      a 4-month follow-up period for each patient. Moreover, X-ray evaluations of hands and feet
      will be performed 2 years from the beginning of the study in order to assess the changes in
      structural damage.

      During the patients' participation, 6 visits are planned: an inclusion visit then, a
      follow-up visit at 1, 2 and 3 months from the inclusion visit, and a final evaluation visit
      at 4 months from the inclusion visit. At each visit, synovitis will be evaluated using both
      methods: clinical examination and ultrasonography. For a same patient, clinical evaluation of
      synovitis will have to be performed - during the entire study - by the same rheumatologist
      and the ultrasonographic evaluation will have to be performed by the same ultrasonographist
      (different from the rheumatologist) and always using the same ultrasonograph.

      Finally, patients will be performed anterior X-rays of hands and feet two years from the
      beginning of the study whatever the ongoing RA treatment.
