      approximately 44% to 65% of pain complaints related to the shoulder. Methods such as
      immobilization, drug therapy, injection techniques, physical therapy modalities and
      therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, acupuncture and surgery can be used in the treatment
      of the disease. Due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan
      province of China in December 2019, the problems in patients' access to hospitals and
      rehabilitation services caused telerehabilitation to be on the agenda. Telerehabilitation can
      be summarized as the delivery of rehabilitation services to those in need by using
      communication technologies. This method covers the steps of evaluation, monitoring,
      prevention, intervention, control, training, and consultation. Although there are many
      studies on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in the literature, there is no study on
      the superiority of telerehabilitation, physical therapy under supervision and home exercise
      program over each other.
