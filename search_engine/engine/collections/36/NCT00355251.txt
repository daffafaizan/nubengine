      immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) through two independent mechanisms of action has been
      described: the blockade of Rho guanosine triphosphatase that intervenes in the entry and exit
      of the virus and the blockade of the interaction between LFA-1 (leukocyte function antigen 1)
      and its ICAM 1 ligand (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) that intervenes in the process
      through which the virus binds to the target cell.

      These initial data have led to the study of the effect of atorvastatin on the plasma
      replication of HIV in HIV+ patients that interrupt antiretroviral therapy (Ator Study 3)
      developed in our unit. The data of this study indicate that baseline plasma cholesterol
      determines viral load rebound on interrupting antiretroviral treatment. However, the
      introduction of atorvastatin on the day of interruption provided no virological or
      immunological benefit in comparison with an interruption of antiretrovirals without statins.
      This may be due to the fact that the potent inhibitory effect of atorvastatin is unable to
      compensate their activating effect on the production of HIV also described in our study.

      Overall, our results pose a possible usefulness of atorvastatin in the control of viral
      replication if given before the interruption of antiretroviral therapy due to:

        -  Their capacity to reduce serum cholesterol at the time of interruption and consequently
           the cholesterol of the cell membrane.

        -  Their potent capacity to purge the HIV reservoir

      Therefore, in this study we aim to investigate the impact of atorvastatin on viral
      replication when it is given 8 weeks before the interruption of the antiretroviral treatment
      and determine whether this impact is due to the reduction in serum and/or membrane
      cholesterol, or whether, on the other hand, there is a contribution by atorvastatin's
      capacity to induce the expression of viral products.
