        -  Determine the response rate of patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with
           thalidomide and irinotecan after radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive irinotecan IV
      over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 week after the first course, prior to all
      subsequent courses, and then after course 6.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
