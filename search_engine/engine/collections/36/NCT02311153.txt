      and accepted by both anesthesia providers and surgeons alike, as a safe mode of airway
      management when delivering general anesthesia. In sinonasal surgery, however, there are more
      concerns regarding the use of LMA's for airway management. Due to the nature of sinonasal
      procedures, the patient is exposed to blood and secretions that may drip/flow from the nasal
      cavity into the oropharynx and potentially into the upper and lower airways if not protected
      adequately. Additionally, often times, manipulation of the patient's head throughout the
      procedure is encountered to improve operative positioning. As a result, both surgeons and
      anesthesiologists have been hesitant to utilize LMA's in these types of surgeries despite
      documented benefits of increased patient comfort, fewer hemodynamic fluctuations during
      induction of anesthesia, and better controlled emergence when using LMA's.

      Specific Aims The overall purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability to provide safe
      and effective ventilation and airway protection with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during
      sinonasal surgery, by directly comparing them to endotracheal intubation in a prospective
      randomized single-blind study.

      Aim 1: Analyze and compare the incidence and severity of airway contamination/aspiration of
      blood and secretions during sinonasal surgery and reveal any statistically significant
      difference between LMA and endotracheal intubation.

      Aim 2: Analyze and compare the incidence of various outcome measures including laryngospasm,
      bronchospasm, anesthesia time, recovery time, post-op pain medication requirements, and
      airway complications between LMA and endotracheal intubation.

      Aim 3: Analyze and compare both patient comfort and surgeon satisfaction after procedure
      between LMA and endotracheal intubation groups.
