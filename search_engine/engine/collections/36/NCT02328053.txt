      medical therapy for a period of two weeks were randomized to receive or not receive adjuvant
      CXL. The medical therapy was continued in both the groups and were followed up for 6 weeks
      after randomization. Healing of the ulcer was taken as successful outcome, while perforation
      and increase in ulcer size of more than 2 sq.mm from the baseline was considered as treatment
      failure.
