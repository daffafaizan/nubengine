      understanding of the effects of critical illness on peripheral muscle strength.

      To begin to develop this hypothesis, a better understanding of the determinants of handgrip
      strength needs to be developed. As a result we propose to perform a prospective observational
      study examining the clinical factors that are associated with handgrip strength. Several
      clinical factors are known to be associated with increased risk of developing ICUAP while
      hospitalized: multiple organ failure, severe sepsis, female gender and treatments like
      steroids. As many of these risk factors are not modifiable, the opportunity to intervene is
      unclear. However, by attempting to better describe the spectrum of strength deficits
      experienced by critically ill patients we may better be able to dissect and prevent ICUAP.
