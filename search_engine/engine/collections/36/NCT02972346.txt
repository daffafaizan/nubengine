      syndrome are steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant.Low serum cortisol is one of the main
      relapse reasons.Adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) can stimulates the adrenal cortex and its
      production of corticosteroids.ACTH also direct melanocortin receptors(MCRs) mediated
      protective effect on kidney cells. To investigate the efficacy and safety of ACTH to treat
      NS, total 42 children steroid resistant or steroid dependent NS is enrolling in this
      multicenter, prospective case series of prescription based treatment with ACTH for NS.
