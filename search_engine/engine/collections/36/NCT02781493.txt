      cleansing is critical for adequate visualization of colonic mucosa during colonoscopy.
      Inadequate bowel cleansing results in adverse consequences for the examination, including
      lower adenoma detection rates, longer procedural time, lower cecal intubation rates, shorter
      intervals between examinations and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy
      cost.Unfortunately, despite advances in bowel preparation methods, up to one-third of all
      colonoscopies are reported to have an inadequate bowel preparation.

      Prucalopride can accelerate colonic transit and has been demonstrated to be efficient in
      constipation.
