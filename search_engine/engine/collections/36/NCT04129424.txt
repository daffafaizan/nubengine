      including type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus,
      perioperative diabetes mellitus, pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (after total
      pancreatectomy) and diabetes patients in perioperative periodï¼Œeach type of diabetes patients
      were divided into three groups according to the time (7days, 14days and 28days) reaching the
      target blood glucose. Those patients are educated to record blood glucose and frequency of
      hypoglycemia during the study period. After achieving goal blood glucose, follow-up will
      continue one week to evaluate whether the blood glucose reached our goal and adjust the
      insulin pump parameter if necessary. The investigators plan to apply continuous glucose
      monitoring(CGM) for each patient during follow up. The investigators aim to explore the best
      time to reach goal blood glucose considering frequency of hypoglycemia, economic factors,
      insulin pump parameters at the end of study and the final insulin pump parameters at the end
      of follow up. The investigators aim to enroll patients with six different types diabetes
      because those patients have different insulin secretion pattern, which induced to different
      mode of CSII. The investigators set the goal fasting blood glucose at 4-6mmol/L and the goal
      postprandial blood glucose at 6-8mmol/L. The blood glucose of hypoglycemia was lower than
      3.9mmol/L.
