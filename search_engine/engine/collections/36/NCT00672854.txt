      emulsion in healthy volunteers and in critically ill patients. In healthy volunteers, your
      blood sugar levels, blood vessel function, and your ability to fight infections will be
      examined. In ICU patients, we examines whether use of the olive oil-based lipid emulsion may
      decrease the risk of infection and hospital complications.
