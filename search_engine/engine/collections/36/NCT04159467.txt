      20%, with the highest prevalence among women. In addition to metabolic diseases, obesity can
      cause musculoskeletal disorders, including pelvic floor muscle (PFM) disorders and urinary
      incontinence (UI) is the most prevalent one. Conservative intervention can be medication,
      lifestyle changes, but pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is considered the first-line
      conservative therapy for urinary incontinence in women and it is effective when delivered
      both individually or in group.
