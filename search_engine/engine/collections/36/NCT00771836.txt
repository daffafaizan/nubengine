      hyper-reactivity (AHR) by spirometric evidence of reversible airway obstruction that was not
      reported pre transplantation. Our question was if AHR is present but undiagnosed pre BMT or
      AHR is developed post transplantation.

      Our aim was to determine if BMT induces AHR as assessed by methacholine challenge test (MCT)
      and to determine a possible correlation between AHR and pulmonary complications. The study
      was Prospective. Subjects: consecutive patients were referred for pulmonary function tests
      (PFT's); MCT and clincical evaluation before SCT and were followed after transplantation for
      at least a year. The study was approved by the ethics committee and parental consent was
      obtained. Clnical evaluation included medical history: type of disease, previous
      chemo/radiotherapy. Type of SCT was recorded (allogeneic/ autologous). respiratory evaluation
      included: Respiratory history; previous asthma medications; allergy/ parental smoking;
      Physical exam; CXR O2-Sat. on rest and exercise. PFT's included: Spirometry, lung volumes,
      diffusion capacity; MCT prior and 2-6 months post SCT; Follow-up: 6-12 months post SCT.
      Pulmonary complication: Any respiratory symptoms or signs: cough, SOB, hemoptysis, hypoxemia;
      New chest radiological finding; Number of hospitalizations due to pulmonary complications.

      Statistics: Sample size-26 patients to detect an increase of 0.5SD in AHR with a power of
      80%. No. of children with AHR before and after SCT.; Pulmonary complications and AHR:
      hospitalizations for pulmonary complications and AHR.
