    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 3 types of sensory-targeted
      rehabilitation interventions on subjective and objective measures of function for those with
      chronic ankle instability. If a potential participant is deemed eligible for participation
      and consents to participate, he/she undergo a pretest session in which balance, gait, and
      range of motion will be assessed. The participant will then be randomized into one of the 4
      treatment groups and undergo the first treatment which takes approximately 5 minutes. After
      completion of the first treatment, the participant will be immediately retested on the
      balance, gait, and range of motion measures. Upon completion of testing on the first day,
      participants in the treatment groups will be asked to return for 5 more treatments over the
      course of 2 weeks. Upon completion of the treatments, each participant will be tested on
      their balance, gait, and range of motion again. Then, after 1 month, each participant will be
      contacted to do a self-reported function follow-up visit in which he/she will be asked to
      report how stable and functional his/her ankle has been over the past month.
