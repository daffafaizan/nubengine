      in the US as a dietary supplement, and was used in Europe in the 1990s to treat mild to
      moderate anxiety. Some clinical trials suggested kava's efficacy in treating generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD), although a recent meta-analysis was inconclusive. While the
      mechanisms behind kava's anxiolytic activity are not well-established, its clinical use shows
      no signs of addiction or withdrawal. Kava thus is a promising and potentially novel
      anxiolytic with a unique mechanism of action. Although kava has been extensively consumed by
      humans for centuries, its pharmacokinetics have never been characterized in humans. Such
      knowledge is essential for its future studies of its anxiolytic potential and dose
      optimization. This study will characterize kava pharmacokinetics, which will set a solid
      foundation for its future clinical development. To establish kava pharmacokinetics, each
      participant will take three 75 mg kava capsules in a single dose and the absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of kava will be assessed, corresponding to the
      pharmacokinetic curve. Serum liver biochemistries will then be monitored for up to three
      months to test liver function response to kava.
