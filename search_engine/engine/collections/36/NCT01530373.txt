      flashes among women with breast cancer, in view of the limitations associated with currently
      available treatments. This randomized study evaluates the safety and efficacy of 3 weeks of
      solifenacin compared to 3 weeks of clonidine, for women receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy
      (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) for breast cancer.
