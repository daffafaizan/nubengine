      of or resistance towards the main topical antibiotics. Accordingly, the infections are either
      not effectively treated or harsher systemic antibiotics with side effects are needed.

      Infections in atopic dermatitis are predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and various
      species of Streptococcus. ATx201 is a potent antibiotic against these and other organisms.
      ATx201 overcomes current resistance problems such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) as well as resistance towards all
      topical antibiotics. ATx201 also exhibits an extraordinarily strong ability to delay the
      onset of de novo resistance compared to currently marketed antibiotics.

      The study is a combined Phase I/II study with 36 healthy volunteers and 40 patients.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of new topical
      formulations of ATx201 in healthy volunteers, and in a population of patients with infected
      atopic dermatitis. Efficacy of ATx201 in eradicating S. aureus compared to vehicle after 4
      and 7 days of treatment will be evaluated. In Phase I of the study, three formulations of
      ATx201 including the respective Placebos will be applied to healthy volunteers. One
      formulation will advance into Phase II, where patients will be treated with the respective
      formulation or Placebo.
