    
      Our study is a nationwide population-based prospective cohort on 4 years thanks to the French
      Health Reimbursement Agency database (Système National d'Information Inter-Régimes de
      l'Assurance Maladie, SNIIRAM) and French hospital discharge database (Programme de
      Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information; PMSI). A unique civil registration number has been
      assigned to all French residents and this number unambiguously links those two databases.
