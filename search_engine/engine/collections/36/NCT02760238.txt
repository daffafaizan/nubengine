      which the bone marrow cells that produce the body's blood cells develop and function
      abnormally.

      Despite the gains that have already been made in understanding and treatment of MPNs there is
      much that can still be learned. This registry will establish a clinical annotation database
      would help to better understand this group of diseases and to more effectively assign
      individual patients to the optimal therapy and so, improve their outcomes. This project will
      provide new insights on the molecular profiling of patients with MPN. It will be used as
      future resource for observational studies related to MPN.

      The registry involves the collection of clinical information from patients with diagnosis of
      MPN at different time points during the course of their disease. The clinical data is
      collected following written informed consent from the Hematologic Malignancy tissue bank (UHN
      REB 01-0573C).

      Data collected includes: a range of clinical measures, disease-associated factors, details of
      treatment and its results, complications during treatment, molecular and cytogenetic data,
      symptom assessment and survival outcome (up to 10 years).

      Data will be collected prospectively and retrospectively, in both cases after obtaining
      written informed consent as per the study standard operating procedure (SOP).
