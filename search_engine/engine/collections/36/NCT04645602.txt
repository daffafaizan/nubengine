    
      This is a non-randomized phase II trial in adult male and female subjects diagnosed with
      human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Recurrent Respiratory Papilloma to test the safety and
      efficacy of the drug combination Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Pembrolizumab or Lenvatinib for
      HPV-associated Recurrent Respiratory Papilloma but they have been approved for other uses.
      Lenvatinib works by blocking certain proteins that are associated with tumor growth.
      Lenvatinib also blocks the growth of blood vessels feeding tumors to cause tumor cell death.
      Pembrolizumab helps the body's immune system destroy cancer cells. This study is
      investigating whether the combination of Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab may eliminate
      HPV-associated RRPs.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment and
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years and will be followed for 1 year.

      It is expected that about 21 people will take part in this research study.

      Merck is supporting this research study by providing Pembrolizumab and supporting the
      research study procedures.

      Eisai is supporting this research study by providing Lenvatinib.
