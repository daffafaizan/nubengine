      within three days after inclusion in the study (immediately prior to tablet-based aphasia
      therapy). Based on the results of diagnostic testing (standard of care in the acute phase),
      therapy will be tailored for each individual. After two short training sessions, patients
      will independently practice with the app during hospitalisation, guided by a user-friendly
      instruction sheet. Patients will be encouraged to practice as much as possible, with a
      minimum of 30 minutes per day. Exercises will be selected by the speech-language therapist
      based on diagnostic results and will be adjusted for difficulty and type of exercise during
      treatment based on performance rates. the aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility,
      usability and acceptability of a tablet-based aphasia therapy in patients with aphasia in the
      acute phase following stroke.
