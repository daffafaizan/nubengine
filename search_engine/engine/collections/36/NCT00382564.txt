    
      Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a developing technique that permits the non-invasive
      evaluation of arterial and venous structures without the need for x-ray based catheter
      angiography. While dramatic progress has been made in the last few years, there are still
      substantial limitations in the accuracy of MRA in the evaluation of coronary artery. The
      primary aim of this study is to evaluate state-of-the-art techniques for coronary MRA in
      subjects with known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis. The secondary aim of this protocol
      is to generate natural history data for future hypothesis-driven clinical trials using MRA
      techniques developed in this current protocol. The long-term objective of this pilot study
      and research initiative is to improve coronary MRA to the point that it can reliably replace
      diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography in the evaluation of subjects with atherosclerotic
      disease.
