      A crossover design (two 12-weeks intervention periods) will be used to measure treatment
      effects. The subjects will be randomized into two groups (intervention to control [I/C] and
      control to intervention [C/I] groups). Each study group will have 15 subjects. The subjects
      in the I/C group will consume 2 ml honey/kg/dose (maximum 50 ml/dose), twice weekly in the
      first 12-week period (period 1) while the subjects in the C/I group will not receive honey as
      a Control in period 1. After period 1 the subjects of each group will exchange their protocol
      for the following 12-week period (period 2). This design will allow the treatment effects to
      be measured between the study groups (namely between the different subjects) in the same
      study period, or period 1, as well as in the same subjects in a crossover comparison of
      periods 1 and 2.
