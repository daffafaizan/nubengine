      (designated JC virus) infection, has not been determined, although the most encouraging
      results have occurred with intrathecal administration of the drug.

      Patients are randomized to receive antiretroviral therapy alone (AZT plus ddI or ddC),
      antiretroviral therapy plus intravenous Ara-C, or antiretroviral therapy plus intrathecal
      Ara-C. All patients receive 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. Beginning at week 2, patients
      on the intravenous Ara-C arm receive daily infusions of Ara-C over 5 days, with cycles
      repeating every 21 days. Patients on the intrathecal Ara-C arm receive single administrations
      of Ara-C at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24. A brain biopsy confirmation or in
      situ hybridization will be required within 7 days after study entry. Patients are followed
      every 4 weeks.
