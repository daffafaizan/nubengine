      epigenetic mechanisms by changing methylation levels of BDNF gene. It also aims to test
      whether BDNF valine-66-methionine (Val66Met) polymorphism influences CRT treatment outcome
      among people with schizophrenia.

      SAMPLE AND METHODS: A randomized and controlled study will be carried out with two groups:
      patients receiving CRT and patients in control condition without any cognitive intervention
      and receiving Treatment as Usual (TAU). Methylation levels of BDNF gene at different sites
      will be contrasted before and after treatment. Additionally, neurocognition profile, level of
      symptoms and psychosocial functioning will also be tested. CRT outcomes will be investigated
      in a mixed model for repeated measures.
