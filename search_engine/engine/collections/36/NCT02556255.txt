    
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, international, open-label, non-randomized
      clinical study.

      All enrolled subjects will undergo atherectomy procedure, during which the B-Laser™ catheter
      will be used to perform atherectomy in target lesion, followed by any other adjunctive
      therapy (balloon and/or stent etc.). The procedure will be done according to standard
      hospital procedure for atherectomy. The steps of the operation before and after the operating
      of the B-Laser™ device are routinely used practice and will be done according to local
      practice at each hospital. For the post-atherectomy stage, as an adjunctive therapy in the
      procedure, any approved device may be used (balloon and/or stent etc.).

      Subjects will then be followed for 12 months after the procedure.
