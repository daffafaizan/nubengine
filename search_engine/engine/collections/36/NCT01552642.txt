    
      Study procedures and interventions:

      Pre-intervention: a full-day training will occur with a physician and nurse from each clinic
      site to be trained as "champions" in counseling.

      Intervention:

      A letter of introduction will be mailed to potential subjects whose child was seen in the
      last 6 months for a well-child exam whose BMI is greater than or equal to the 85th
      percentile. After informed consent is obtained, the subjects will be randomized to the
      intervention or control group. One parent may join the study.

      Groups of 10 to 12 parents of overweight and obese 3 to 6 year olds will meet once weekly for
      6 weeks at 5:30 to 6:30 pm with the "nurse champion" in the primary care office. Topics to be
      presented and discussed include authoritative parenting, using the food plan "Go, Slow, and
      Whoa", increasing physical activity, and behavior change strategies. Sessions will be
      audiotaped and independently audited to confirm program fidelity. Parenting skills will be
      discussed at every session.

      The intervention group will have access to a website. This site will include information
      services (instant library with health topics related to nutrition and physical activity and
      answers to frequently asked questions), web links to other pre-screened sources of
      information on nutrition and physical activity, local resources for current activities for
      children and families, personal stories (emphasizing authoritative parenting), interactive
      discussion group and Ask the Expert (questions will be answered within 48 hours and usually
      sooner).
