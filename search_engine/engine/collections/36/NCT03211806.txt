      randomized to either the sedentary behavior intervention or monitoring only. The intervention
      will use a Bluetooth-enabled activity monitor to detect prolonged sedentary bouts, which will
      prompt a message delivered via smartphone suggesting that patients walk. The intervention
      will begin at least two weeks prior to scheduled surgery and will continue through the first
      30 days at home following hospital discharge. Outcomes will include objective activity and
      sedentary behavior, patient-reported symptoms and quality of life using standardized
      instruments, inflammatory biomarkers, and morbidity and hospital readmission 30-days after
      index discharge.
