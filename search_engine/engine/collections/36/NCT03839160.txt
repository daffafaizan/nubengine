      analgesia (TEA) as a golden standard for acute post-thoracotomy pain. Ultrasound-guided
      serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is a relatively new truncal block method treating
      thoracotomy pain, yet more evidence is needed to ascertain its efficacy.

      This is a prospective study carried out in a tertiary hospital. Patients scheduled for
      thoracotomy are randomized into two groups: Group M (intravenous patient-controlled-analgesia
      morphine) and Group S (intravenous patient-controlled analgesia morphine and SAPB). Morphine
      consumption, VAS pain score and Prince-Henry pain score are recorded for 72 hours
      respectively at PACU, 2hr, 6hr, 12hr, 24hr, 48hr and 72hr, with heart rate, systolic
      pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure and SpO2. Moreover, the profile of
      opioids-related side effects and length of hospital stay are documented. The primary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of SAPB. The secondary objective is to
      compare the opioids-related side effects (including nausea, vomiting and pruritus),
      hemodynamic parameters and the length of hospital stay.
