      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of intravenous doxorubicin
           hydrochloride and intraperitoneal carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive
           recurrent ovarian cancer.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the response rate and progression-free survival of patients with recurrent
           ovarian cancer who have had no more than two prior salvage regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of carboplatin followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour followed by
           carboplatin intraperitoneally on day 1 until the maximum tolerated dose is achieved.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride as in phase I and carboplatin at
           the maximum tolerated dose as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients (18 patients in phase I and 43 patients in phase
      II) will be accrued for this study.
