        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate in
           patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lung treated with aerosolized
           sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this regimen in terms of natural killer cells
           cytotoxicity, and T-cell, B-cell, and dendritic cell activation markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive aerosolized sargramostim (GM-CSF) by nebulizer over 10-15 minutes twice
      daily on days 1-7 and 14-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unaceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for disease progression and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-20
      months.
