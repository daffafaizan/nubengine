      been prospectively studied in such patients. Preliminary retrospective studies have shown
      that total lymphopenia was independently associated with an increased risk of infections. A
      previous retrospective study from our group have also shown that total lymphopenia and CD3-
      lymphopenia three months after the beginning of rituximab was associated with infections.

      The determinants of infections occurring during the course of immune and inflammatory
      diseases treated with corticoids and immunosuppressive drugs or biotherapy are probably
      multiples. We hypothesized that the following variables may have an impact on the risk of
      infections in those patients: Epidemiological: gender, social situation, Clinical: causal
      disease, comorbidities, vaccination status, Therapeutic: type and doses of corticosteroids
      and immunosuppressive drugs/biotherapy, prevention treatment Biological : neutrophils, total
      lymphocytes, CD4-T lymphocytes, CD8-T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, immune activation (HLA-DR+
      lymphocytes), CD5 and CD19 lymphocytes, CD27/IgD lymphocytes, immunoglobulins IgA, IgM, IgG.

      On the other side, the impact of infection on the clinical course of immunologic or
      inflammatory disease have been poorly described and will be documented by this longitudinal
      study.

      After inclusion in the present study, patients will be followed on a 30 months period and
      monitored at M3, M6, M12, M24 to describe the impact of treatment on clinical and biological
      variables. Every clinical event will be prospectively reported and validated by a specific
      committee.
