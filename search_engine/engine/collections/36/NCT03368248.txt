    
      This is a survey carried out among all neonatal resuscitation services in the Ile-de-France
      region, from January 1 to 31, 2016. All professionals in contact with children were
      interviewed: doctors (senior and intern), paramedics (managers, pediatric nurses, auxiliaries
      and nurses, psychomotor therapists) and psychologists. The survey was based on a
      questionnaire, which was offered to all professionals, both medical and non-medical. All
      questions were closed, and a free comment area was proposed at the end. The questionnaire was
      preceded by a comment recalling the objectives of the study, the voluntary and individual
      nature of participation, and insisted on respect for anonymity. It consisted of 49 questions,
      allowing 197 possible answers. For most questions, several answers could be chosen. An
      additional questionnaire was sent to the heads of the services, medical and care settings.
      The questions sought to describe the 2014 activity (number of admissions and number of
      deaths, number of collegiate meetings and number of deaths resulting from an LAT), medical
      and paramedical staff to calculate the response rate, the existence of reflection and / or
      training on palliative and end-of-life care in the service, as well as the existence of a
      mobile team or palliative care unit in the facility.
