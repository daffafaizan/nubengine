      Individuals with anemia have unusually low numbers of RBCs. They also often have difficulty
      concentrating and remembering information, which is likely caused by a reduced oxygen supply
      to the brain. Previous research has shown that correcting anemia in patients without sickle
      cell disease improved their memory and attention. The purpose of this study is to examine any
      abnormal changes in the brains of individuals with sickle cell disease and to determine
      whether these changes are related to reduced memory and attention capabilities.

      Participants will attend one study visit. During this visit, a brain magnetic resonance image
      (MRI) will be performed while participants complete neuropsychological tests that measure
      memory, attention, and organizational ability. There will be no follow-up visits.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
