    
      Dysphagia is common in patients with acute stroke and deteriorates the overall outcome (1).
      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a routine examination in the diagnostic workup of
      stroke etiology. In cardiac surgery it is known as cause of postoperative dysphagia (2).

      Using flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) T.E.D.R.A.S., as a prospective,
      blinded, randomized and controlled study, includes patients in two groups in order to test
      the influence of TEE on swallowing in acute stroke: an intervention group and a control
      group. FEES is performed for analysis of swallowing in the intervention group (1) one day
      before TEE, (2) 2-4 hours after TEE, (3) 24 hours after TEE. In the control group FEES is
      performed on three consecutive days with TEE taking place any time after the last FEES.
      Validated scores assess dysphagia severity in both groups.
