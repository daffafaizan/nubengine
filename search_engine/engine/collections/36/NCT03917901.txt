      computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention that addresses anxiety sensitivity to reduce
      emotional eating, eating expectancies, food cravings, binge eating, perceived barriers to
      engage in physical activity, anxiety/depressive symptoms, severity of daily fatigue and
      increase perceived benefits to engage in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy,
      willingness to use adaptive coping strategies, and perceived physical health functioning. To
      address this aim, the investigator's will implement a randomized controlled trial that will
      employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve five stages: (a) online pre-screener;
      (b) baseline survey consisting of a pre-intervention assessment (eligibility) and random
      assignment to a one-session computer-delivered intervention (Active versus Control); (c)
      1-week follow-up survey; (d) 2-week follow-up survey; (e) 1-month follow-up survey.
