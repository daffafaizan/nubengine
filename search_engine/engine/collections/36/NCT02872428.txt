    
      THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF A 2-PART STUDY. Part 1 of the study will be a single center study
      intended to assess the safety and tolerability of valproic acid dosages at 15 mg/kg, 30
      mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg 180 mg/kg, 210 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg. Up to 72
      healthy subjects (9 dose groups of 8 subjects) will receive single doses of valproic acid or
      placebo via a 60-min IV infusion in a ratio of 3:1 active drug: placebo. ID: VPA-C-002

      Part 2 of the study will be a multi-center, double blind, placebo-controlled study in trauma
      patients with hemorrhagic shock. The patients will be able to consent themselves, or if
      unable due to injuries, a Legally Authorized Representative will consent for them. Up to 12
      patients (2 dose groups of 6 patients) will receive single doses of valproic acid or placebo
      via a 60-min IV infusion in a ratio of 2:1 active drug : placebo. The dose levels in Part 2
      will be the two highest doses that are demonstrated to have acceptable safety profile based
      on the review of safety data from Part 1 (130mg/kg and 140mg/kg).
