      randomly assigned to the ketorolac or gabapentin group. The gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer,
      Mexico) group was instructed to take one 300-mg capsule the night before surgery and 1
      capsule every 8 hours on the day of surgery and for the first 3 postoperative days. The
      ketorolac group (Dolac, Siegfried Rhein, Mexico) was instructed to take their 10-mg tablets
      every 8 hours on the day of surgery and for the first 3 postoperative days. Different pain
      scores and variables will be evaluated, along with others side effects variables.
