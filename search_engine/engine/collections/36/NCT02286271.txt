      the unique algorithm will be evaluated in clinical trials at two hospitals over a 14 month
      period. Each device is time synchronised with an Electroencephalographic (EEG) videotelemetry
      system which is the gold standard in identifying different seizure types recording from scalp
      electrodes. The devices will be monitoring participants from 3 months and older (children and
      adults). The algorithm was created from results from a PhD where 527 seizures were
      categorised into different seizure types. Sensitivity of identifying seizures was 91% and
      specificity was 75% using an optimal trigger level and algorithm. This trial will investigate
      how reliable the algorithm is in practice and determine an optimal trigger level..
