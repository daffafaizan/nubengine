      burden upon social and economic aspects of life. Medical and or surgical interventions have
      been used to resolve this problem, but one of the newly introduced is the minimally invasive
      low cost Intradiscal injection of ozone-oxygen mixture (O3-O2) which offers a rapid onset
      amelioration of symptoms, with a sustained duration pain relief.

      A lot of injection approaches are available, but which offers the best results, is the
      question.
