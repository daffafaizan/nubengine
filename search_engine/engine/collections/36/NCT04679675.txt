      HPV screening outreach strategy improves cervical cancer screening initiation and uptake.
      Identifying new, patient-centered options that motivate continued screening initiation and
      uptake is essential now and in the future.

      In August 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force released updated cervical cancer
      screening guidelines that include human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (ie, primary HPV
      screening) as a newly recommended strategy for women aged 30-65 years. With primary HPV
      screening, home-based screening is an emerging option, because HPV tests (unlike Pap tests)
      can be performed on clinician- or self-collected samples. Self-collected samples are as
      sensitive as clinician-collected samples in detecting HPV and mailing HPV self-sampling kits
      increases screening participation. As US healthcare systems prepare to implement primary HPV
      screening, they will need to consider a variety of strategies. To date, HPV self-sampling
      randomized clinical trials have included only overdue women; no study has evaluated uptake
      and acceptance of HPV self-sampling kits as an alternative to in-clinic screening in a
      screening-adherent population.

      Based on our Home-based Options to Make cervical cancer screening Easy (HOME) trial
      (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02005510), most women will test negative (88%) and can continue
      routine screening; 11% will require in-clinic follow-up: 3% directly to colposcopy
      (HPV-16/18+ results) and 8% to Pap because of "HPV+ other" results or an unsatisfactory
      result (<1%). For home-based HPV screening strategies to be successful, ensuring high
      follow-up compliance in the minority of women who test positive is critical.
