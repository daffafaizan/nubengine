        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of paclitaxel, estramustine, carboplatin, and
           androgen ablation followed by radiotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis locally
           advanced prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and time to prostate specific antigen failure in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly; oral estramustine three times a day,
      five days a week; and carboplatin IV over 1 hour once monthly. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients also receive gonadotropin-releasing hormonal therapy comprising either goserelin
      subcutaneously or leuprolide intramuscularly once monthly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for 6 courses.

      After the completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on weeks
      17-24.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
