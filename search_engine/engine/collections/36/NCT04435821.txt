      pain. As a result of chronic pain, children may miss school, withdraw from social activities,
      and develop internalizing behaviors. Therefore, accurately identifying the cause of a child's
      pain is important for both proper treatment of the pain and to prevent problems secondary to
      the chronic pain. Evidence in the literature points strongly toward an involvement of the
      sigma-1 receptor in neurogenic inflammation, which is known to be an important
      pathophysiological mechanism for maintenance and perpetuation of chronic neuropathic pain.
      The investigators hope to image and identify activated pain pathways in pediatric pain
      paitents using a radiolabeled biomarker for increased S1R expression. By localizing and
      quantifying areas of increased S1R expression to sites of augmented nociceptive activity
      using hybrid molecular/anatomic imaging techniques, we will objectively identify sites of
      neurogenic inflammatory activity and pain generation. The ability to image the changes
      associated with chronic pain generating pathologies provides us with a tool to identify and
      measure the intensity of the pathology. Imaging S1R expression in chronic pain states in
      pediatric patients would be both novel in its application and extremely powerful in better
      characterizing pediatric pain.
