      28 h and did not eat or drink for at least 3 h prior to each appointment. Dental biofilm pH
      was measured in the cervical and proximal regions of anterior teeth with beetrode-type
      microelectrode coupled to a potentiometer. The biofilm was submitted nine paediatric
      medicines a long term and sucrose (negative control). pH measurements were taken at baseline
      to determine resting plaque pH and at time interval 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes.
