      provides an increase in alfa-defensin release from neutrophils, can affect HIV viral load in
      HIV-1 infected individuals. The safety, tolerability and effect will be assessed of 28 days
      of daily intravenous dosing of LTB4 on HIV viral load. Safety and tolerability will also be
      assessed.

      The study is randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled. All subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of three treamtent groups, LTB4 at two different dose levels or corresponding
      placebo. Treatment duration is 4 weeks and follow-up period is 2 weeks. Subjects will visit
      the clinic on a daily basis during the treatment period to receive a daily intravenous
      injection of the study drug. 40 subjects will be enrolled, seven clinics in Canada will
      participate in the study.

      Primary endpoint: Change in viral load over the treatment period of 28 days. Secondary
      endpoint: CD4, CD8 and neutrophil counts, alfa-defensins and CC-che, mokine release in blood.
