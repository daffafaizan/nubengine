      significant health consequences for mothers and children. Counseling for prevention of
      postpartum depression is currently recommended in women at high risk of postpartum
      depression; however, there is a shortage of mental health care providers. There is a need for
      effective interventions to prevent postpartum depression that can be easily integrated into
      health care systems, yet do not involve intense health care system resources. eHealth
      interventions are promising in this regard.

      Strong evidence suggests physical activity can reduce depression risk. This study will assess
      the effectiveness of an eHealth exercise intervention tailored to postpartum mothers for
      increasing physical activity levels and improving depressive symptoms in women at increased
      risk of postpartum depression. This intervention addresses several identified barriers to
      physical activity in postpartum women. The study will randomize 200 women to receive an
      eHealth exercise intervention for postpartum women or usual postpartum care. Device-based
      physical activity and depressive symptoms will be measured at 3 and 6 months after
      randomization.
