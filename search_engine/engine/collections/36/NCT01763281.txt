    
      A single centre, randomized cross over study consisting a screening visit and 2 test days
      which will be approximately 7 days apart. The participants will receive 1g unlabelled lactose
      ureide in a glass of water 3 times a day on the day before the study day to induce the enzyme
      activity in the colonic bacteria. The participants (20 healthy volunteers) will have a
      baseline scan in a 1.5T MRI scanner before having a small intravenous needle inserted into
      their forearm. Following this procedure, the participant will have another scan before being
      given either a saline (0.9% NaCl) or 100microgram of CRH intravenous injection. 40g of
      fructose and 500mg of labeled C-13 lactose ureide dissolved in water with pure lime juice as
      flavorant made up to 500mL will be given to the participants. They will then have a serial
      scanning of the abdomen at 30-60 minutes interval for 5 hours post prandially. Salivary
      cortisol will be collected after every MRI scans. Participants will also be asked to blow
      into the hydrogen breath machine and to fill in symptom questionnaire following each MRI
      scans. Further breath collections for orocaecal transit time will be collected initially
      every 10 minutes for the first hour and 15 mins until the end of the study day. Mouthwash
      will be used before initial breath test collection. This procedure will be repeated again on
      the 2nd test day with either a saline or 100microgram of CRH.
