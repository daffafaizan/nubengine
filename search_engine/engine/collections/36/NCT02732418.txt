    
      This is a randomized, partially-blinded, multi-center, parallel-group study to evaluate and
      compare the PD and PK of MPA after a single SC injection of either 45 mg/0.3 mL, 75 mg/0.5 mL
      or 105 mg/0.7 mL of Depo-Provera CI, and one cycle of Depo-subQ 104 use when injected in the
      abdomen, in women of reproductive age with confirmed ovulatory baseline cycle. Baseline
      ovulation will be confirmed in all women by measuring serum progesterone (P) approximately
      twice a week during the 2-3 weeks preceding expected menses. Between 48 and 60 participants
      (12-15 per group) with confirmed ovulation who meet other eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled and randomized to receive a single SC injection in the abdomen of 1 of 3 doses of
      Depo-Provera CI: 45 mg/0.3 mL, 75 mg/0.5 mL or 105 mg/0.7 mL or a single dose of Depo-subQ
      Provera (104 mg/0.65mL). Participants will be followed for 32 weeks (7.5 months) after the
      injection During the study participants will provide blood samples for MPA, P and estradiol
      (E2) prior to injection and then frequently at predefined time points through 7.5 months. In
      addition, for more accurate ascertainment of the PD response we will perform transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVS) and assess cervical mucus at predefined time points through 7.5 months.
      Information on adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected throughout the
      study. Information on acceptability will be collected at predefined time points through 7.5
      months.
