    
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators are
      examining this study intervention.The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved Demeclocycline for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators would like to determine the lowest dose of
      Demeclocycline that will allow surgeons to detect tumor cells during surgery. These cells
      will be marked through a process called fluorescence, which will cause tumor cells to glow
      brightly on an image in comparison to its surroundings.
