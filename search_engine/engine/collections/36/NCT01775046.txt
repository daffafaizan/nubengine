      expected by the French National Authority for Health (HAS). Therefore, in its opinion report
      from December 22, 2009, HAS makes the maintenance of reimbursement approval of each stent
      graft dependent on the presentation of results of a specific follow-up study carried out in a
      cohort of patients representative of the French population treated under real-life conditions
      of use. This prospective cohort study must involve patients implanted after registration on
      the LPPR (List of Products and Services qualifying for Reimbursement). The results of the
      follow-up study must be forwarded to the National Committee for Evaluation of Medical Devices
      and Health Technologies (CNEDiMTS) for examination once a year. The assessment of this
      follow-up could lead to the recommendation by CNEDiMTS to continue or stop the reimbursement
      of the concerned stent graft.

      In France, The Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft with the Captivia Delivery System is registered
      on the LPPR for a period of 3 years since January 12, 2011. In order to comply with HAS
      expectations, Medtronic Bakken Research Center is setting up this long term
      non-interventional study on the Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft with the Captivia Delivery
      System.
