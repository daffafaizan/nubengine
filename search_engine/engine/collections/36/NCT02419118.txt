      vivo correlates and key determinants of success or failure when daratumumab is used alone or
      in combination with lenalidomide for treatment of patients with myeloma have not been
      clarified.

      There is potentially a wide spectrum of factors that may influence the quality and duration
      of response following treatment with daratumumab. The integrity of the patient's immune
      system may be important. Prior lines of chemotherapy or the myeloma disease itself may impair
      humural (i.e. complement) or cellular (i.e. ADCC) effector mechanisms that are of importance
      for the response to daratumumab. Also intrinsic properties of the tumor cells or interactions
      between myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment could make the myeloma cells
      refractory to daratumumab.

      A better understanding of these variables may enable us to improve the quality and duration
      of daratumumab-induced responses and make daratumumab-based therapies more effective in the
      near future.
