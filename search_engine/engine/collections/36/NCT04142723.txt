      study of the disease hepatic Alcohol" (ALEH-GLEHA), belonging to the Latin American
      Association for the study of the hepatic illnesses (ALEH), which is an association non-profit
      that has nearly 1,000 members from most of the countries of Latin America.

      All patients admitted to the hospital with suspected alcoholic hepatitis will be evaluated to
      see if they can be included in the study. Patients will be enrolled according with the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The investigators will take a blood sample to be analyzed as part of the necessary data
      record, for the study of genes and identification of proteins involved in the development,
      evolution and prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis.

      If the medical doctor had instructed to perform a liver biopsy, voluntarily the investigators
      will ask to participants donate a small share of the surplus of histological sample To
      achieve this, it is necessary to generate a data bank of clinical information and biological
      samples (blood, urine, bile, stools, salivary sample or tissue samples) that allows studying
      the various factors involved in the development and prognosis of this disease in the
      countries of the Americas.

      The investigators will make a clinical follow-up for a year, consisting of phone calls to
      complete a questionnaire about participant's health. These calls will be made in month 1, 3,
      6 and 12 subsequent to participant's hospital discharge.

      The data collected are identified by a code and only the study physicians can correlate the
      data with the participants and medical history, so the participant's identity will not be
      shared.

      There is no financial compensation associated with the study
