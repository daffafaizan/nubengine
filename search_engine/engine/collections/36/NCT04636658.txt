      Digital spirometer training for improving pulmonary functions in chronic stroke patients.
      Diaphragmatic Resistance training is based on the same principal as for the any other
      Skeletal Muscle training. The selection of 20 subjects divided equally and placed into an
      experimental group and a control group and the interventions would applied three times per
      week for 4 weeks. In each session, both groups receive Digital spirometer training for 15
      minutes. In addition, experimental group receive diaphragm breathing exercises with
      resistance for 30 minutes. Resistance is Applied through Different thera bands and then
      performing the Breathing Exercises. First of all resistance applied through yellow band(1-6
      pounds of resistance) and then red, Green and black which give (4-18 Pounds of resistance)
      The patient is asked to breath in deeply and slowly while not to move upper chest .Weight
      increased weekly as per patient's tolerance. Further Digital spirometer training Perform to
      determine the Pulmonary Functions FVC,FEV1,FVC/FEV1,PEF,VC. in both Control and Experimental
      Groups
