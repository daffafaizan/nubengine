      the ability of CTC to predict the patients' prognosis. A separate population of healthy and
      benign disease subjects will serve as controls to compare the CTC incidence in this control
      group versus the MBC group at baseline. Correlation between CTC and radiographic response to
      the systemic therapies in the MBC study group will also be assessed.

      300 MBC patients, each of whom will provide a series of at least 3 blood draws (baseline, 3-4
      weeks and 6-8 weeks after the initiation of the systemic therapy) for CTC analysis, will be
      enrolled. All MBC patients will be followed for a maximum of 36 months for disease
      progression and survival.

      200 healthy and benign disease volunteers, each of whom will donate blood 1 time for CTC
      analysis, will be enrolled as controls.
