      economically developed countries stroke takes 2 or 3 place in the structure of morbidity and
      mortality. In animal models, it was shown that autological stem cells transplantation
      significantly increased perfusion of ischemic area and improved lost motor and sensor
      functions. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used in some clinical trials
      without following autological transplantation. However, there are no enough evidence-based
      proved results of G-GSF safety and effectiveness in acute ischemic stroke. In order to
      determine safety and efficiency of G-CSF administration together with conventional treatment
      and conventional intensive care protocol during acute ischemic stroke we organized this
      clinical trial.
