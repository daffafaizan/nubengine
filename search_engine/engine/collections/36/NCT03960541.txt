      the effect of CD24Fc on reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) among patients with HIV.
      The effect of CD24Fc on total cholesterol and triglycerides, markers of immune activation (T
      cell activation, sCD14, and inflammatory cytokines), size of HIV reservoirs, hemoglobin
      (HbA1c) and leptin, and hepatic steatosis will be evaluated.

      It is hypothesized that therapy with CD24Fc will result in significant decreases in LDL in
      HIV patients. In addition, CD24Fc may reduce leptin and cholesterol, HbA1c, hepatic steatosis
      and fibrosis, and markers of inflammation in patients with chronic HIV who are virally
      suppressed on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      In this phase 2 study, a cohort of 64 HIV patients virally suppressed on antiretroviral
      therapy will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive an intravenous infusion of 240 mg of
      CD24Fc vs. placebo administered every 2 weeks during a 4-week treatment window, followed by a
      24- week follow-up period. Patients will be followed for safety and adverse events as well as
      changes in lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers during a 24-week follow-up period. This
      investigation will take place at the University of Maryland.
