      use of a health assessment questionnaire. This questionnaire is derived from a standardized
      questionnaire to assess the quality of life in patients, the SF-36. Participation will
      require a single visit to the outpatient clinic of Public Health Service. During this visit a
      short history and physical examination related to chronic liver disease will be performed.
      During the same visit a single venapunction and a single hepatic elastography (fibroscan)
      will be performed.
