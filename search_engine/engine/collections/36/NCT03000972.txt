      the risk of implant cut-out of the femoral head. The cement used in previous studies has
      produced heat and thermal necrosis on bone cells. The cement used in this study (TraumaCemV+)
      is manufactured specially for this implant and for the augmentation of this implant.
      TraumaCemV sets under low temperature (40 degrees Celsius) and we do not anticipate any heat
      necrosis. The volume effect of the cement could theoretically also damage the blood flow in
      the femoral head. There have been no negative effects in big series of patients operated with
      this technique.

      The aim of this study is to quantify the viability of the femoral head with the use PET-CT
      (Positron Emission Tomography with simultaneous Computed Tomography) including a radioactive
      isotope (Fluorine-18) and the use of threedimensional computed tomography.
