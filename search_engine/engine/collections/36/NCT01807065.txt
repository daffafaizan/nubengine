    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility, based on percent able or willing to receive all three infusions
      of sipuleucel-T immunotherapy, when combining sipuleucel-T with radiation therapy to a single
      site of metastasis delivered one week prior to beginning of sipuleucel-T therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of radiation therapy to single metastasis on immune response
      (antibody and T-cell proliferation to prostate acid phosphate [PAP] and fusion protein
      PA2024) generated by sipuleucel-T immunotherapy.

      II. To assess the effect of external beam radiotherapy to single metastasis on prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) response to therapy with sipuleucel-T.

      III. To assess the effect of external beam radiotherapy to single metastasis on radiographic
      response rate to therapy with sipuleucel-T.

      IV. To assess the time from the onset of therapy with sipuleucel-T +/- radiation to the need
      for subsequent therapy for prostate cancer.

      V. To assess the toxicity associated with sipuleucel-T +/- radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive sipuleucel-T intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes days 22, 36, and 50.

      ARM B: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy in weeks 1-2. Patients also receive
      sipuleucel-T as in Arm A.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until week 60.
