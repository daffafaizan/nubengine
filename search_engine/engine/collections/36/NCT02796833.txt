    
      A prospective double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial of 13 months duration per
      participant to compare between 2 commercially available lipid emulsion, Intralipid vs SMOF,
      in patient receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). All subjects are stable HPN patients
      who receive Intralipid as lipid emulsion in their solutions. The subjects will be randomized
      to two groups. One group will receive Intralipid for 6 months, followed by 28 days of
      wash-out period, and then will receive SMOF for 6 months. Another groups will receive SMOF in
      first 6 months, followed by 28 days of wash-out period, then will receive Intralipid for 6
      months. During wash-out period for both groups, the patients will receive Intralipid as
      standard lipid emulsion. Each patient will have 4 clinic visits at Toronto General Hospital
      for clinical interview, nutritional measurements, routine blood tests, and special blood
      tests at baseline then at 6, 7, 13 months. Also, the patients will be asked to have routine
      blood tests after month 3 and month 9. The patients will fill the food record which will be
      collected later after completion of each period, month 6 and 13 of the study. The
      investigators will be calling patients during both periods to check compliance and update on
      their condition including the adverse events.
