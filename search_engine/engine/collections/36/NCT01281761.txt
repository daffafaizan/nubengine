      to inhibition of post-translational modification of small G proteins. Mevalonate-derived
      prenyl groups, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP),
      facilitate essential intracellular functions of various proteins such as Ras and Rho. Owing
      to its effect on post-transcriptional modifications of Ras and Rho, the anti-tumor effect of
      statins has been suggested in various cancer cell lines. However, more recent studies
      utilizing cancer gene signatures have systematically screened an array of drugs for potential
      anti-tumor effect and have discovered statins as potential novel targeted agent against
      cancer. Given the cardiovascular therapeutic dose is 1 mg/kg/day which translates into serum
      level of 0.1 uM in patients, the investigators have previously tested and reported that low
      dose lovastatin ranging from nanomolar to 0.3- 1 uM statin induced cell senescence or
      cytostatic effect of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In addition, the investigators
      previously reported on well tolerability and promising anti-tumor effect of combination of
      simvastatin 40 mg daily and standard FOLFIRI (irinotecan, infusional 5-fluorouracil,
      leucovorin) in metastatic colorectal cancer.
