      surgery. During laparoscopy, the investigators routinely inject port sites with a 21-gauge
      needle and inject sites with local anesthetic prior to trocar placement. In the study the
      investigators will insert a 21-gauge 3.5inch spinal needle perpendicular to the abdominal
      wall at each possible trocar site. The seven insertion sites are the umbilicus; 12cm lateral
      to umbilicus on right; 12cm lateral to umbilicus on left; Left lower quadrant lateral to
      inferior epigastric; Right lower quadrant lateral to inferior epigastric, Lower midline of
      abdomen; Left upper quadrant at Palmer's Point. The needle will be placed after the abdomen
      is insufflated under direct visualization with the laparoscopic camera. The needle will be
      inserted to the level of the peritoneum and a hemostat will be place on the needle at the
      level of the epidermis. The abdominal wall thickness will be measured with a ruler and
      recorded to the nearest millimeter. The information will be recorded on the case report form
      attached. The case report form will be kept in a binder in the research coordinators office.
