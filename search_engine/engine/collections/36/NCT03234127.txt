      familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) families by performing a coronary calcium score and then
      to detect protective genetic factors in patients who do not have a significant atheroma
      despite a perturbed biological phenotype.

      The investigators will also conduct biochemical, lipidemic and metabolomic analyzes to
      identify a signature of biomarkers protective of cardiovascular risk in FH patients.

      The investigators will use the French FH register, which already includes 3889 patients, to
      identify these "protected" FH families within the main reference centers for the management
      of FH for inclusion and follow-up of patients.
