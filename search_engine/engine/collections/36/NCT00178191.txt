      estimates ranging widely.1 Most urinary incontinence can be categorized into stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) or UUI with UUI remaining more common and debilitating than SUI.2 A major
      cause of UUI is overactive bladder or detrusor instability (DI), and while DI is very common,
      its etiology remains unknown. DI is often successfully managed with behavioral therapy,
      physical therapy, medications and surgery with the most effective therapy being
      anticholinergic medication.2 However, side effects including dry mouth, and constipation
      often lead to discontinuation of these drugs. In addition, many patients fail anticholinergic
      medication and have persistent urinary leakage. Women who fail these treatments have limited
      options.
