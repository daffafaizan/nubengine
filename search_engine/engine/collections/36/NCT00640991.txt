      or the experimental arm, which will include routine AMI care as well as intensive therapy
      intervention.

      In addition to the capillary blood glucose measurements obtained to titrate insulin doses in
      the experimental arm patients, laboratory plasma glucose will be drawn in all patients at
      randomization, 10, 24, 48, and 72 hours post randomization, 7 days post randomization (or
      hospital discharge if that occurs first), and 30 days post randomization.
