      primary mitochondrial myopathy (PMM) who had completed participation in the SPIMM-201 study
      where they had received 5 days of intravenous (IV) elamipretide (0.01, 0.10, or 0.25
      mg/kg/hour infused for 2 hours) or placebo (randomized 3:1). The primary objective was to
      evaluate the effect of single daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of elamipretide administered for
      4 weeks on the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD).

      Subjects were randomized (1:1) to one of two sequence groups: 4-weeks of treatment with 40 mg
      elamipretide administered once daily SC in Treatment Period 1 followed by 4-weeks of
      treatment with placebo administered once daily SC in Treatment Period 2 (separated by a
      4-week washout period), or vice versa. Each sequence group went through 5 distinct periods:
      Screening, Treatment Period 1, Washout, Treatment Period 2, and Follow-Up. Safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of subcutaneous elamipretide in this
      patient population were analyzed.
