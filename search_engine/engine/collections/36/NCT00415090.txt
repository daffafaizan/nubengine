      combinations. The presence of a smaller or greater degree of cross resistance among all RTNI
      is increasingly better described and acknowledged, whereby the number of salvage regimens
      that may be built following the appearance of this resistance to these drugs is by no means
      unlimited.

      This proactive treatment change in patients on RTNI-based regimens while the viral load is
      still suppressed would avoid the selective replication period under antiviral pressure
      following the failure of the regimen in which resistance-associated mutations accumulate.
      This therapeutic approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in clinical practice, albeit not
      in this scenario.

      If we wait until the viral load is detectable there is sufficient evidence that resistance to
      RTNI will appear and that this resistance will compromise future salvage options.

      To intensify with this proactive approach these combinations based on N/NNRTI (nucleotide
      analog), the NNRTI are an optimal alternative.There is vast experience with NVP in
      simplification/maintenance trials. In direct comparative simplification studies in patients
      with virological response, the response rates with NVP or EFV have shown no differences. With
      a relative risk (RR) of virological failure of 0.54 with regard to the continuation of PI
      (protease inhibitors), NVP is one of the best simplification treatment options in
      HIV-1-infected patients.
