    
      This is a multicenter, open-label (identity of treatment is known to patient's parent/legal
      guardian/caregiver and to all study staff) study to characterize the penetration of doripenem
      in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in pediatric patients <1 year of age who are hospitalized
      but medically stable, and who have a documented or suspected infection and are planning to,
      or undergoing treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously (in a vein, abbreviated
      as "IV"). Doripenem will not replace the patients' prescribed antibiotic(s). The study
      includes 3 phases: a pretreatment phase consisting of an up to 24-hour screening period; a
      2-day open-label treatment period when doripenem will be administered, and CSF and blood
      samples will be collected, and a follow-up visit approximately 1 week after administration of
      the last dose of doripenem. The total duration of the study is approximately 10 days. During
      the study, patients <12 weeks of age will receive a 10 mg/kg doripenem 1-hour IV infusion via
      a central or peripheral venous line (a catheter inserted in a large vein) every 8 hours;
      patients 12 weeks to <1 year of age will receive a 30 mg/kg doripenem 1-hour IV infusion
      every 8 hours. A total of 5 doses of doripenem will be administered over a 2-day period while
      the patient is in the hospital.
