      rate of caesarean section increased steadily over the next 20 years, reaching up to 32.2% in
      2011. The absolute risk of uterine rupture in vaginal birth after Caesarean section is 1 in
      100 deliveries. The risk of perinatal death or the outcome of extremely neurological
      impairment is 1 in 1000 deliveries.

      Statistically more than 300 pregnant women with a prior caesarean delivery visit daily
      ultrasound departments of german hospitals to investigate the C-section scar before delivery.
      They have one important question: Is it possible to predict successful trial of labor after
      cesarean delivery? The information for the risk of uterine rupture remains insufficient based
      only on ultrasonography assessment.

      What are the possibilities of additional parameters to examine the stability of uterine scar
      tissue? Currently, there is no defined cut-off value of scar thickness for the prediction of
      uterine rupture. It remains questionable whether the thickness of the lower uterine segment
      is the determinant factor for the stability of the scar and the probability of rupture.
      However, another important factor is the functional elasticity or the structure of the
      connective tissue. It has not been further investigated until now (both quantitatively and
      qualitatively).

      Objective of this project: Multimodalities of assessments, including ultrasonography and
      elastography, validate the accuracy of uterine scar stability in women with previous history
      of Caesarean section in vitro and in vivo.
