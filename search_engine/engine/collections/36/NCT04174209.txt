      spectacle-corrected visual acuity, various subjective refraction techniques can be used. The
      Jackson Cylinder Cross Method, the Astigmatic Dial Technique and the Stenopeic Slit are three
      validated subjective refraction techniques for measuring astigmatism. The subjective
      refraction techniques of keratoconus-carrying patients have never been studied.

      The main hypothesis is that the most suitable subjective ocular refraction method varies with
      the corneal topography of the keratoconus.

      The investigators collect several characteristics of corneal topography of the keratoconus :
      the average value of the keratometry of the 3 central mm called Km ; the value of the point
      corresponding to the maximum keratometry (called Kmax), the distance between the center and
      the point of Kmax, (called d_Kmax) ; the corneal surface variance index called ISV ; the
      Belin/Ambr√≥sio Enhanced Ectasia Display (called BAD-D).

      The main objective is to define the most appropriate refractive technique(s) based on corneal
      topographies in order to provide keratoconus-affected patients with the best
      spectacle-corrected visual acuity.
