      functional area to which it can lay claim; the plastic surgeon practices methods and
      techniques applicable to all specialties and anatomic areas.

      Reconstructive surgery is the process of restoring the human body to "whole" following tumor
      extirpation, infection, trauma or congenital or acquired deformity - restoring both form and
      function.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the thoracodorsal artery perforator
      flap versus other conventional free flaps for reconstruction of soft tissue defects.
