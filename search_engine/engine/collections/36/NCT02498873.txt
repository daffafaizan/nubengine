      progression intensity (LP) and b) randomized or not intensity linaer (NLP) over five months
      running training, and a crossover design between subjects, on gains in VO2max, peak velocity
      (Vpeak) and critical power (CP). Furthermore, the relationship between the gains obtained
      with the training and the amount of exercise will be established. In our case all dependent
      variables will increase after training, with no significant differences between the two
      strategies on dependent variables.
