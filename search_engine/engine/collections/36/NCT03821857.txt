      of cognitive testing, tests of physical function, questionnaires, and a blood draw. All women
      will also undergo clinical neuroimaging, which includes structural MRI, β-amyloid (Aβ)
      deposition on PET as a biomarker of Aβ pathology, and tau deposition on PET as a marker of
      neurofibrillary tangles using AV-1451.
