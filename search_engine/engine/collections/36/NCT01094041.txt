      comparing the effects of gluten rich versus gluten free diets in diarrhea or diarrhea
      predominant IBS patients. All participants will keep a daily bowel pattern diary throughout
      the study. All participants will have negative serum tissue transglutaminase (TTg) assay, and
      anti-endomysial antibody test, if TTg is positive or equivocal. All participants will have
      the following studies performed both before and after the 4-week dietary intervention:

        1. Stool samples to check markers of inflammation such as fecal calprotectin.

        2. Blood samples to check markers of inflammation and for genetic testing.

        3. After ingestion of the mannitol, lactulose and sucralose sugars, urine samples to
           indirectly measure small intestinal and colonic permeability.

        4. After sedation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain 6
           mucosal biopsies from the small bowel and sigmoid colon for immunohistochemical
           analysis.

        5. Scintigraphy to measure gastrointestinal transit.
