      intensive care is currently considered as a standard procedure. It is associated with a
      reduction of morbidity and positive outcome. In paediatric patients there are available only
      limited information related to the size of the tidal volume and it is recommended to use the
      volume between 5 and 8 mL per kg for the whole spectrum of ages of pediatric patients. The
      aim of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate the tidal volumes used in
      clinical practice in pediatric patients during general anesthesia and compared it to the
      tidal volumes used in paediatric critical care. Data will be harvested from the
      anaesthesiology records and from the paediatric intensive care unit charts. The tidal volume
      will calculated per kg of actual weight.
