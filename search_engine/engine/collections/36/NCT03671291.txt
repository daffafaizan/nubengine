      This prophylaxis strategy is based on taking antiretroviral drugs (ARV) before and after
      exposition to a risk of HIV infection which can reduce drastically the contamination with
      HIV. A certain groups of population based on their sexual orientation, for instance man who
      have sex with man (MSM), is among the groups that are highly exposed to this risk. To reduce
      this risk, French national regulatory authority (ANSM), firstly through temporary usage
      recommendation followed by a marketing authorization extension, allowed the prescription of
      these antiretroviral molecules to persons presenting eligibility criteria as defined by
      regulatory authority. Despite these preventive measures, the incidence of HIV such as the MSM
      group still high. The missed opportunity studies has as objectives to try to disentangle real
      obstacles of PrEP use in France and to optimize PrEP criteria if needed.
