    
      This study is being done to collect information on the natural history of NMOSD in pediatric
      AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. A major restriction in performing drug studies in pediatric
      patients with NMOSD is limited information on the course of the disease in these patients.
      Collecting clinical information over the course of a 1 year observational study would inform
      on the natural history of the disease in these patients. A repository of pediatric patients
      with rare diseases can increase knowledge on the natural history of the specific disease,
      assist in identifying appropriate patients fulfilling specified criteria for drug studies and
      potentially serve as a control group.

      Timepoints: Baseline, 3mo, 6mo, 9mo, 12mo (+/- 1 mo for each time point).

      Baseline data:

        -  Demographics [age/sex/ethnicity],

        -  Clinical presentation information including date of initial diagnosis,

        -  Clinical phenotype

        -  Immunotherapy used current and past,

        -  Family history of autoimmune diseases,

        -  Serological data results

        -  Radiologic data as available

      Self-Report Assessments will be:

        -  Current impairment, as measured by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score
           self-reported using Ratzker (1997) EDSS Self Report form,

        -  Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D and Varni's (1998) PedsQL over the
           phone/mail/email.

      At follow-up visits 3mo, 6mo, 9mo, 12mo (+/- 1 mo for each time point):

        -  Attacks/relapses

        -  Any hospitalizations

        -  Confirm medications and update records if changes

      Self-Report Assessments at follow-up will be:

        -  Current impairment, as measured by the EDSS score self-reported using Ratzker (1997)
           EDSS Self Report form,

        -  Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D and PedsQL over the phone/mail/email.
