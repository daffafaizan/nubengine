      containing large amounts of 'good' bacteria, can influence the make-up of the gut bacterial
      population and what effect it has on weight loss and loss of fat. Before undergoing weight
      loss surgery (sleeve gastrectomy or roux-en-y gastric bypass), study participants will be
      asked to provide a stool sample to assess the make-up of their gut bacterial population. They
      will also undergo a limited CT scan of the abdomen and DEXA (Xray) to help assess the amount
      of fat present inside the body.

      After undergoing weight loss surgery (sleeve gastrectomy or roux-en-y gastric bypass), study
      participants will be given either a probiotic supplement or dummy pill (placebo) for 3
      months, in addition to all usual care that occurs after surgery. The CT scan, DEXA scan and
      stool sample will be repeated at the end of the 3 month period and analyzed for changes.
