      functional respiratory disability, resulting on one hand from impaired diffusion of carbon
      monoxide, and on the other hand from a muscular weakness. Indeed, 67% of patients ventilated
      more than 10 days have a neuromyopathy whose recovery is uncertain.

      Beside this, Long-term quality of life is worse than in general population, due in particular

      prevalence around 22% after one year.

      them or decrease their impact on patient's life to improve quality of life and prevent the
      post-traumatic syndrome disorder PTSD. A review would be sent to the patients' General
      Practitioners at the end of each visit.
