      (MM). Based on studies in other types of cancer in humans where beneficial effects were
      obtained, and based on our pre-clinical data in a mouse model for MM, led to the introduction
      of DC-immunotherapy for human MM in 2005. A beneficial effect of immunotherapy in MM patients
      without major side effects was found, however, research has shown that DC immunotherapy might
      be further improved. The objectives of the here proposed phase study are:

        -  To define the safety and toxicity of low dose CTX in combination with MesoCancerVac in
           patients with MM.

        -  To determine if vaccination with low dose CTX in combination with MesoCancerVac results
           in a detectable immune response by skin DTH reactions on MM crude antigen and KLH and by
           in vitro laboratory analysis.

        -  To observe and document anti-cancer activity by laboratory evaluation (e.g. decrease in
           Tregs, increase in CTLs using 51Cr release and IFN-gamma ELISPOT)

        -  To observe and document anti-cancer activity by clinical evaluation (e.g. CT scan)
