      pain catastrophizing and emotional reactivity, often play a major role in migraine pain and
      disability. These processes may be just as important to target as the sensory aspect given
      their impact on outcomes and disability. Because of this cognitive/affective load that builds
      over time in migraine, we hypothesize A) migraineurs perceive affective pain processing
      differently than non-migraineurs and B) mind/body therapies that target these factors may be
      especially beneficial and may differentially impact the affective component of migraine pain.
      Evidence shows that meditation decreases affective (e.g., pain unpleasantness) over sensory
      (e.g., pain intensity) response to experimental pain and reduces pain by engaging brain
      regions important for cognitive and affective modulation of pain. By measuring both
      experimental and clinical pain, the study team will be able to test these hypotheses.
