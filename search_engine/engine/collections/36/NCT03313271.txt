      Hodgkin's lymphoma(HL) and non Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL). The treatment of lymphoma includes
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapy and surgery etc. With
      the progress of treatment, the survival rate of lymphoma patients has been improved. But the
      5 year survival rate of lymphoma in China is shorter than that in United States. The reason
      is that there is still a gap between China and the United States in disease screening,
      diagnosis and treatment.

      Observational studies, especially cohort studies, are important tools for understanding
      disease progression, treatment, and prognosis in the real world. Observational cohort studies
      which involve over 500 patients are currently launched by South Korea and the United States.
      China, which has more patients, doesn't have a cohort of patients with lymphoma. So the
      primary objective of this study was to establish an observational cohort of patients with
      lymphoma in China and follow up the patients for a long period of time to provide basic
      support for clinical research and drug development, and continuously improve patient outcomes
      and quality of life. The secondary objective is to collect information about diagnosis,
      treatment, follow-up and prognosis of lymphoma.
