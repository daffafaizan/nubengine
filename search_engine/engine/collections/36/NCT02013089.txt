      by informing on treatments targeted to each tumor's unique genetic constitution. This data
      can be critical to making an informed decision for disease management, though this may not be
      the case for all patients. CS identifies variations or differences in the DNA and/or RNA of
      the cells in an individual's tumor by comparison to that of his/her normal cells. These
      somatic variations may, on further interpretation, be identified as key drivers of
      carcinogenesis. Such information may predict a patient's prognosis, response to currently
      available treatments or prompt the development of novel therapeutics. Though CS has the
      potential to personalize and optimize cancer care, it may produce a vast amount of data and
      unique changes in the DNA/RNA that may be difficult to interpret at the present time.

      Using the Integrated genomic network analysis, we could have better understanding of the
      underlying processes and pathways involved in tumor onset and progression. And then we could
      choose a specific treatment regimen and develop personalized cancer therapies
