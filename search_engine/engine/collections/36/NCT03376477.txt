    
      This is a single institution, three- arm, randomized controlled, Phase II study examining the
      clinical efficacy of an allogeneic GM-CSF secreting myeloma vaccine in combination with
      lenalidomide (with or without Prevnar) compared to lenalidomide and placebo (control arm).

      Patients enrolled in the study must have two disease measurements (including the last one)
      consistent with a near complete remission (M-spike negative with persistence of
      immunofixation), or complete remission (M-spike negative, negative immunofixation, and <5%
      clonal plasma cells on bone marrow) per criteria for response in a 3 month period. All
      patients must be minimal residual disease (MRD) positive by NGS sequencing at enrollment.

      Prior to enrollment, patients will have been treated with a lenalidomide containing regimen
      for a minimum of 6 cycles. All patients will continue on a standard dose of lenalidomide as a
      single agent until progression, or treatment limiting toxicity, following enrollment.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either an allogeneic myeloma vaccine and Prevnar
      vaccine in combination with lenalidomide, or allogeneic myeloma vaccine without Prevnar
      vaccine in combination with lenalidomide, or lenalidomide in combination with placebo.
      Patients will receive allogeneic myeloma vaccine or placebo injections on day 14 (+/-3 days)
      of cycles 1, 2, 3 and 6 from enrollment, and then annually thereafter for up to 3 years. If
      assigned to allogeneic myeloma vaccine plus Prevnar vaccine arm, Prevnar-13 will be
      administered with each allogeneic myeloma vaccine. If assigned to either of the two arms that
      do not include Prevnar, then patients will receive a placebo in lieu of Prevnar on the same
      schedule. All patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 years.
