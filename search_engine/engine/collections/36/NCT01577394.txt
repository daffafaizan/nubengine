      dementia. In its early stages, the differential diagnosis of DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      can be challenging. The differential diagnosis is particularly important given that patients
      with DLB respond well to cholinesterase inhibitors but show sensitivity to neuroleptic
      medications which are contraindicated in DLB. DLB tends to progress more quickly than
      Alzheimer's disease. Diagnostic accuracy may be improved. Oculomotor recording, easy to
      perform could be helpful in order to identify and reliably assess fluctuating attention
      performance in DLB patients.

      Main objective:

      - to improve differential diagnosis between DLB and AD in the early stages of the disease
      with oculomotor measurements

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to examine the association between the oculomotor records and neuropsychological
           examination assessing attention abilities and their fluctuations

        -  to evaluate the benefit of complementary neuropsychological tests in the distinction
           between DLB and AD cases

        -  to examine the relationship between hippocampal volume and neuropsychological
           examination in DLB cases

        -  to examine the diagnostic performance of MRI (Support Vector Machine) between DLB and AD

        -  to examine the interest of CSF alpha synuclein concentration to discriminate DLB from AD

        -  to assess at one year variations in oculomotor test scores and neuropsychological test
           scores Method and design Longitudinal multicenter study including 100 patients with a
           DLB or AD diagnosis. Clinical examination at one year.
