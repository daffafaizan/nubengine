      I. Examine temporal associations between dyadic coping and health behaviors such as physical
      activity and diet.

      II. Identify social and physical contexts in which health behaviors occur/co-occur among
      survivors and their partners.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Investigate potential moderators for the associations between stress and dyadic coping.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and partners complete questionnaires over 60 minutes about demographic information,
      stress, coping, and lifestyle behaviors at baseline and end of study. Patients and partners
      also receive an accelerometer and complete Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
      questionnaire on stress, coping, physical activity, and eating behaviors over 5-10 minutes
      four time daily (QID; 7:30 am, 11:30 am, 3:30 pm, and 7:30 pm) via an smartphone application
      (app) for 14 days. Patients and partners also complete a survey on nutrition twice weekly
      (BIW) for a total of 4 surveys.
