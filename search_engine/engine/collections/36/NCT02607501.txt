    
      The objective of this study is to obtain data on the technical feasibility, safety, and
      efficacy of the eCLIPsâ„¢ Products for the treatment of bifurcation aneurysms. Specifically,
      procedural success of the eCLIPs Bifurcation Remodelling System (BRS) will be evaluated to
      determine feasibility of this product and safety will be measured as of a major stroke or
      death within 30 days, or major territorial stroke or neurological death within one year.
      Additional endpoints will be evaluated and data collected to assess the procedural success of
      the other eCLIPs Products Microcatheter, Microintroducer, Detacher) and collect efficacy
      information on the eCLIPs Products. A rate of 69% of aneurysms achieving Raymond Class 1
      occlusion at the 12 month endpoint has been chosen as the criterion for success in subjects
      treated with the eCLIPs Device and coils (primary endpoint).

      An upper 95% confidence interval of 10% rate of major ipsilateral stroke or death at the 1
      month, and 12 month endpoint has been chosen to demonstrate clinically safety (primary
      endpoint).
