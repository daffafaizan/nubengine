    
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-126 in
      approximately 210 adults with schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups (ABT-126 Dose 1, ABT-126 Dose 2 or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ABT-126 compared to placebo can
      improve cognition and what side effects ABT-126 may cause. Cognition is the way a person
      thinks, and it includes abilities like paying attention, focusing, remembering things, and
      solving problems. Acronyms listed in the Outcomes and/or Eligibility sections for this study
