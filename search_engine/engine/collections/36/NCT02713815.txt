      relapse, and proposed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a novel
      interventions. Focused on evaluating Glutamate/GABA functions in prefrontal cortex and
      functional connectivity with deep brain regions, neuropsychological tests, biochemical tests,
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI will be used to investigate the
      neurobiological mechanism of ATS addiction and relapse. These methods will also be used to
      evaluate the efficacy of the novel intervention and investigate the mechanisms. The study
      will be very helpful to develop novel interventions in clinical practice and decrease
      ATS-related harm for both the patients and their families.
