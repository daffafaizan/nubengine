      of this study will provide dosing recommendations for the administration of TMC435 in Chinese
      HCV-infected patients. This is a Phase I, open label (both participant and investigator know
      the name of the medication given at certain moment), randomized (study medication is assigned
      by chance) study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TMC435 after
      single and repeated intakes. Each participant will receive 2 treatments. First, participants
      will receive TMC435 as a single dose of 100 or 200 mg. Thereafter, in the multiple dose part,
      100 or 200 mg TMC435 will be administered during 5 consecutuve days every morning. Both
      treatments will be administered with food. There will be a washout period of at least 72
      hours between the 2 treatments. The main focus of the trial is the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics (level-profile of TMC435 over time in the blood stream). This evaluation
      requires multiple blood samples from Day 1 till Day 3 in the first session and from Day 1
      till Day 11 in the second session. Safety assessments (blood and urine tests, blood pressure,
      pulse, electrocardiogram, and physical examination) will follow a different schedule and will
      be performed during each treatment period, up to 4 weeks after the last. Each volunteer
      participate in 2 treatments, i.e., single dose period and multiple dose period. In the single
      dose part, planned doses will be 100 or 200 mg TMC435. In the multiple dose part, TMC435 will
      be administered during 5 consecutive days every morning.
