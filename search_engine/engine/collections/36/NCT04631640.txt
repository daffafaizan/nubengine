      sustained virological response (SVR) rate is up to 90% after DAAs therapy. However, the
      acquisition of SVR does not mean the cure of HCV-related diseases, some patients still
      developed liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and other diseases after achived SVR by DAAs
      therapy.In this study the investigator would like to bulid a prediction model of HCV-related
      disease after DAAs by conducting an ambispective cohort study. The participants of this study
      would be adult patients (â‰¥18 years old) with chronic HCV infection and have received DAA
      therapy, the investigator would retrospectively collected DAA therapy-related information,
      and follow-up all the enrolled participants every 6 months to observe their liver-related
      disease outcomes (composite liver outcome, including liver-related deaths, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, liver decompensation, and liver transplantation).
