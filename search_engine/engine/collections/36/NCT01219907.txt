    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of expanding HER-2-specific effector T cells (TE) ex vivo from
      CD62L+ TCM and CD62L- TEM from patients immunized with a HER-2 peptide vaccine.

      II. To evaluate the safety of infusing autologous ex vivo expanded HER-2-specific T cells
      into patients with advanced HER-2+ breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the persistence, function, and phenotype of adoptively transferred
      HER-2-specific TE cells derived from TCM or TEM precursors.

      II. To investigate the potential anti-tumor effects of therapy with ex vivo expanded
      HER-2-specific T cells in patients with advanced HER-2+ breast cancer.

      OUTLINE : This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells.

      VACCINE THERAPY: Patients receive HER2 peptide vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3 weeks.

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -1.

      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive ex vivo-expanded HER2 specific T-cell IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 10, and 20.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 28, 35, 49, 63 and then
      monthly thereafter for 1 year.
