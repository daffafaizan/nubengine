      Cell Free DNA (ddcfDNA) assay in the monitoring of three high-risk groups of patients for
      antibody mediated processes.

      The AlloSure assay will be combined with the AlloMAP assay (PAXgene blood sample); which is
      the first in history FDA-cleared genomic solid organ transplantation rejection blood test
      (AlloMap). Immune cell phenotypes and inflammatory cytokines will be examined. The
      combination of the three assays will provide a comprehensive molecular diagnostic and
      prognostic approach to antibody-mediated processes after renal transplantation. Additionally,
      formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from kidney biopsies for subjects in all
      groups will be used to validate the nCounter platform. 3 slides from each biopsy will be sent
      to CareDx to be examined on the nCounter system. Other routine clinical data will be examined
      and assessed for correlation with the nCounter results. This will include AlloSure, Molecular
      Microscope, eGFR, creatinine, DSA as well as other key data fields taken from the Electronic
      Medical Record (EMR).

      AlloMap Kidney is a lab-developed test and will be provided by CareDx, Inc. located at
      Brisbane, CA, and is designed, manufactured and used within a single CareDx laboratory.
      AlloMap Kidney is currently provided as "For Research use only" test and results are not
      intended for clinical diagnosis or patient management for "KidneyCare", which is the
      AlloSure-Kidney and AlloMap-Kidney tests combined.

        -  Group A. Thirty participants with a positive VXM at the time of transplant will be
           monitored for 24 months and undergo protocol biopsies on months 3, 12, and 24 to detect
           subclinical rejection. Participants may also undergo clinically indicated biopsies for
           suspicion of rejection. AlloSure, AlloMap, immune cell phenotypes, and inflammatory
           cytokines will be measured at baseline (within 48 hours of transplant), 3 weeks, 6
           weeks, 3M (SOC biopsy), 6M, 12M (SOC biopsy), 24M (SOC biopsy) and additionally at the
           time of any indication biopsy (5-8 time points/patient). Subjects in this group will be
           monitored for 24 months per SOC.

        -  Group B. Similarly, 35 participants with dnDSA will undergo a SOC biopsy within
           approximately three months to determine the incidence of AMR. Immune cell phenotyping,
           AlloSure and AlloMap will be measured at the time of the SOC biopsy (1
           timepoint/patient). This is a single-time point study, unless participants are diagnosed
           with AMR and require treatment. In this case, they would be enrolled in group C (see
           below).

        -  Group C. Thirty-five additional participants with the diagnosis of cAMR will undergo
           standard of care therapy and be monitored for treatment response with a follow-up biopsy
           at three months. Immune cell phenotyping, AlloSure and AlloMap will be used at baseline
           (prior to index biopsy) and 3M (follow-up surveillance biopsy) (2 timepoints/patient).
           Participants in this group will be monitored per SOC for three months (time between the
           two biopsies).

      For all three groups, history and physical, blood draws and urine sample collections are
      performed per SOC. The only addition is blood sample collection and additional urine
      collection at the indicated SOC timepoints for AlloSure, AlloMap, immune cell flow cytometry,
      RNA-signatures, and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, leftover pathology slides that are
      stored in the pathology department will be sent out to CareDx for the purposes of performing
      the NanoString analysis. The slides will be returned to the pathology department after the
      NanoString analysis is complete.
