      intensive care unit has been subjectively reported by ours and other research groups as a
      significant source of stress for parents. The investigators aim to assess the impact of
      holding on endocrinological markers of stress and bonding. Specifically, the investigators
      plan to collect salivary cortisol and oxytocin levels from infants undergoing therapeutic
      hypothermia and their mothers prior to and immediately after a 30-minute holding period.

      The investigators hypothesize that measurable increases in salivary oxytocin levels,
      coinciding with the reported qualitative increased levels of bonding, will be observed after
      the holding period. The investigators anticipate the reported stress reduction after holding
      to be quantified by measurable decreases in salivary cortisol levels. The investigators
      hypothesize these hormone changes will be present in both the mother and the infant when
      compared to samples taken without the holding intervention.
