        -  To determine the tumor control in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer
           without macroscopic disease treated with dose-intensive salvage radiotherapy.

        -  To determine the toxicity in these patients.

        -  To determine the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≥ 8
      vs 7 vs ≤ 6), pathological tumor classification (pT3b vs others), lymphadenectomy performed
      (yes [pN0] vs no [cN0]), persistent PSA after prostatectomy (detectable [≥ 0.1 ng/mL] vs
      undetectable [< 0.1 ng/mL]), PSA at randomization (> 0.5 ng/mL vs ≤ 0.5 ng/mL), participating
      center, and radiotherapy technique (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3D-CRT] vs
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]/rotational techniques). Patient are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm A: Beginning at least 12 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy* once a
           day, 5 days a week, for 6.4 weeks for a total dose of 64 Gy (in 32 fractions of 2 Gy
           over 6.4 weeks).

        -  Arm B: Patients undergo radiotherapy* once a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks for a total
           dose of 70 Gy (in 35 fractions of 2 Gy over 7 weeks).

      NOTE: *3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, rotational techniques such as Tomotherapy®,
      Rapidarc®, or intensity-modulated arc technique and volumetric-modulated arc therapy are all
      eligible.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60
      months after completing study therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and
      then every 12 months for up to 10 years.
