    
      OBJECTIVE Compare the results of the treatment of gastric varices, coil associated with
      cianoarilato versus cyanoacrylate in patients with systemic shunts in relation to efficacy
      and embolic complications.

      PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS Drawing

      This is a prospective clinical trial, double-blind, comparative, randomized, single center,
      performed on quaternary level hospital involving patients with portal hypertension with
      gastric varices type 2 GOV or IGV 1.

      28 cirrhotic patients will be randomized to the treatment of gastric varices type GOV2 IGV1
      or more cyanoacrylate Cyanoacrylate or only patients with splenorenal shunt or gastrorenal
      spring.

      After signing the consent form, patients will undergo CT angiography to evaluate the presence
      of shunt and classification of the same. Patients without shunt will be excluded from the
      protocol.

      Dopller colored portal system will also be conducted in all patients prior to treatment for
      analysis of portal flow.

      After confirming the presence of shunt patients will be examined by echo-endoscopy for
      completion of treatment The following data will be collected: demographic data (age and
      gender), etiology of cirrhosis, degree of liver function, primary or secondary prophylaxis
      diameter of gastric varix, varices of the esophagus with or without signs of red color, size
      and type of shunt detected by CT, amount of springs inserted, number of ampoules of
      Cyanoacrylate injected complications (bleeding, damage to the endoscope by cyanoacrylate)
