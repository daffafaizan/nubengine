      DSAEK procedures for indication of corneal endothelial cell dysfunction. For the
      retrospective study, all cases of DSAEK procedures performed at UT-Southwestern for corneal
      edema secondary to endothelial cell dysfunction will be considered. The clinical outcomes of
      these surgeries will be analyzed and correlated with the anterior segment imaging from each
      case. Statistical analysis will then be performed on the data collected. For the prospective
      arm of this trial, we propose to recruit up to 200 current patient cases of corneal edema
      second corneal endothelial cell dysfunction. These patients will undergo ocular imaging
      studies in addition to routine ocular exams performed before surgery and at the discretion of
      the investigational physician at 3 to 6-months and 6 to 9-months after surgical treatment.
      Various imaging modalities would include corneal topography, pentacam, anterior segment OCT,
      wavefront measurement and Tandem Scanning Confocal Microscopy (TSCM). The patients who have
      already had the DSAEK procedure done in the past will undergo ocular examination as well as
      various imaging studies at their post op follow up visits. All these modalities are routinely
      used as standard of care practice and are non-invasive. The data from the ocular examination
      and various imaging techniques will be pooled and analyzed at the end of the study in order
      to identify the factors that influence the visual outcome. We believe this will help us learn
      more about this interesting and innovative technique while at the same time help us improve
      the method further in order to obtain better results in future patients.
