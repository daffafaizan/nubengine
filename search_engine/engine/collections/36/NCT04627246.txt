    
      This is a single center, single arm, phase Ib trial to evaluate the feasibility, safety,
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of subcutaneous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine loaded with
      personalized peptides [PEP-DC vaccine] in combination with standard of care adjuvant
      chemotherapy (gemcitabine and capecitabine), followed by the antibody nivolumab in patients
      with non-metastatic surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      All patients will have previously undergone collection of resected advanced pancreatic tumor
      tissue under a different research protocol with a separate informed consent. After
      registration, all patients will receive standard of care chemotherapy consisting of
      intravenous gemcitabine, and oral capecitabine for eight 21-day cycles. Additionally, all
      eligible patients will undergo apheresis during the last week of cycle 3 of standard of care
      chemotherapy to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for dendritic cell vaccine
      production. All patients will receive at least six PEP-DC vaccinations starting concomitant
      with the 5th cycle of chemotherapy. Vaccine will be administered subcutaneously every 3
      weeks, on day 9 (the day after last gemcitabine infusion) of each 21-day cycle, and
      thereafter every four weeks starting from the second nivolumab administration. Nivolumab
      intravenous administration will start three weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy and
      will be given as a flat dose every 2 weeks during the vaccination period until the last
      vaccine dose or at least 8 weeks after the end of the last chemotherapy cycle if vaccination
      stops earlier.

      Regular physical examination, radiological evaluation and blood testing for safety parameters
      will be performed according to the schedule during treatment.
