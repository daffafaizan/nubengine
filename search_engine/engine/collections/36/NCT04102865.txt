      clinical evidence to show that NPWT may reduce oedema, increase healing and reduce chance of
      infection, through maintenance of pressure therapy, in closed incisions. The proposed
      clinical strategy is to conduct a study assessing performance and safety of the new single
      use NPWT system in order to assess whether the same benefits of other NPWT systems on the
      market can be applied to therapy provided with the new system. Subjects with abdominal
      incisions and knee incisions following knee surgery will be recruited to the study and
      receive NPWT for 7 days. The performance of the system will be logged by the device and
      acceptability of the device will be assessed by patient and clinician. Safety will be
      assessed with a 30 day follow up to assess complications and device related events.
