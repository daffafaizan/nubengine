      stenosed aortic valve during peak systole is reconstructed. Using this geometry, the
      projected area of the aortic valve's orifice (AVA) is calculated. Additionally, the left
      ventricular geometry is reconstructed for the complete heart cycle. Using the information of
      the left ventricular volume change, the patient-specific flow profile and peak-systolic flow
      (Q)is calculated. Using this information, the pressure gradient is calculated using a power
      law estimation of the form PG = a * AVA^b * Q^c. The model generation and parameter fit is
      described in [1].

      To validate this model, retrospective data of patients receiving a catheter-based replacement
      of the aortic valve (TAVI) is collected. For those patients, CT images are already acquired
      for treatment planning and the invasive pressure measurements are performed during
      replacement of the aortic valve. Therefore, no additionally steps are required. Using the CT
      images the patient-specific aortic valve area ad flow rate are calculated. This information
      is then used for estimation of the pressure gradient using the power law model. The
      catheter-based pressure gradient is calculated as the difference between the peak-systolic
      pressure in the left ventricle and the ascending aorta before implantation of the prosthesis.
