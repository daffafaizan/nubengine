      institutions (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Vanderbilt Children's Hospital). Over
      1000 studies have been performed between the institutions and the normal studies will be
      selected based on radiology reports and reviewed to confirm they are normal. The fMRU is
      performed with Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs), initially was performed with
      Magnevist, then switched to Gadavist, and most recently converted to Dotarem. The fMRU
      software for analysis of the functional data provides enhancement curves of the aorta and
      kidneys. fMRU enhancement curves are generated by drawing regions of interest in the aorta
      and renal parenchyma and calculating the average signal intensity over time. A comparison of
      the enhancement curves will be performed of the three GBCAs in the normal pediatric
      population. The enhancement curves will provide peak enhancement values within the aorta and
      kidneys (Time to peak = TTP) and allow comparison between the GBCAs. The enhancement
      intensity versus time will be evaluated for each GBCAs, providing an evaluation of how long
      renal parenchymal enhancement is maintained. Additional functional data will be reviewed such
      as calyceal transit time (CTT) and renal transit time (RTT).
