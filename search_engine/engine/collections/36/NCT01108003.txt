    
      Primary Objectives:

      I. To determine the tolerability and toxicity of a broccoli sprout extract (providing 200
      micro mol isothiocyanate/dose/per day) given for 14 days in patients destined to undergo
      definitive bladder resection for bladder cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

      I. Establish the safety of administration of the broccoli extract on the bladder surgery
      specifically.

      II. Determine the levels of isothiocyanates and their metabolites in urine, blood, benign
      urothelium and bladder cancer tissue.

      III. Assess the antitumor effects of broccoli extract on the primary bladder tumor by
      measuring angiogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis.

      IV. Determine the feasibility of treating patients with 200 micro mol isothiocyanate per dose
      per day of broccoli sprout extract in future therapeutic and prevention clinical trials.

      Outline: Patients receive oral broccoli sprout extract once daily on days 1-14 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed at 4 weeks.
