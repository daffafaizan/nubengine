      IL-12 gene therapy with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Nine subjects (3
      cohorts, 3 subjects/cohort) with metastatic pancreatic cancer will receive a single
      intratumoral injection of the oncolytic Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-hIL12 adenovirus at one of three
      dose levels (cohort 1- 1 x 1011 vp, cohort 2- 3 x 1011 vp, cohort 3- 1 x 1012 vp). Depending
      on the location of the target lesion, the adenovirus will be injected either through the
      stomach or duodenal wall using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance. Two days later, subjects
      will be administered (orally) 7 days of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) prodrug therapy. Fourteen
      days after completion of the 5-FC prodrug therapy course, subjects will be administered
      chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician. On an optional basis, subjects will
      be administered [18F]-FHBG, a HSV-1 TK substrate, and will undergo PET imaging to quantify
      the intensity, persistence, and biodistribution of HSV-1 TK gene expression in the pancreas.

      The primary endpoint is toxicity at day 21. A secondary endpoint is rates of â‰¥ grade 3 CTCAE
      adverse events. Exploratory endpoints include 1) intensity, persistence, and biodistribution
      of HSV-1 TK gene expression, and 2) association of immunological measurements (i.e., cytokine
      levels, NK cytolytic activity) with toxicity and clinical outcome.
