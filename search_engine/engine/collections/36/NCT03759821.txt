      interventions that will be delivered by community health workers in the Mara region of
      Tanzania. We will use a 2x2 factorial cluster randomized controlled study design, plus a
      local standard of care control group, to evaluate the effectiveness of EFFECTS on the primary
      outcomes of early child nutrition and development. In total, there will be five study arms:
      nutrition intervention with mothers, nutrition intervention with mothers and fathers, bundled
      nutrition and parenting intervention with mothers, bundled nutrition and parenting
      intervention with mothers and fathers, and a local standard of care control. We hypothesize
      that an intervention approach that engages fathers will benefit the primary outcomes; a
      bundled nutrition and parenting package will benefit the same primary outcomes; and that the
      combined intervention approach - that both engages fathers and bundles nutrition and
      parenting messages - will have additive benefits on the primary outcomes.
