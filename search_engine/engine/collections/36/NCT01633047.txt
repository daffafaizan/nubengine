    
      Participants Twenty-two patients that submitted to ACL surgical reconstruction with flexor
      grafts less than 15 days previously will be included in the study, both genders, between
      18-45 years old. Individuals with previous knee lesions, other ligament injuries,
      osteochondritis or associated menisci repair and complications during surgery will not be
      included in the study. Patients that carried out complimentary therapies to the proposed
      treatment will be excluded.

      The participants will be randomized into two groups: control and electrical stimulation group

      . Intervention All the subjects will be submitted to physiotherapy sessions three times a
      week, following a 12 weeks criterion based reahabilitation, carried out in line with the
      objectives proposed for each rehabilitation phase (immediate post-operative, early
      post-operativeand late post-operative). A group of trained physiotherapists will design the
      exercises and determinate their evolution, including range of motion improvement, muscular
      control and strength, gait training with progression in weight bearing and sensory-motor
      control training, according to the established guidelines.

      The patients from the electrical stimulation group will receive, in addition, NMES
      application in the first six weeks of treatment, using an electrical stimulator with a
      carrier frequency of 47 Hz with symmetrical, biphasic and pyramidal waves, with pulse
      duration of 150 Âµs and duty cycle of 1,5 sec on and 1,8 sec off.

      Evaluation It will be evaluated the pre intervention quadriceps muscle extension force by
      means of a manual dynamometer, and the joint swelling through the perimeter. This procedure
      will be repeated after six weeks of intervention.
