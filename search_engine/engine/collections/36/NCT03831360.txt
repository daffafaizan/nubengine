      12 weeks of hatha yoga vs. 12 weeks of group CBT.

      Participants will be adolescents with depression. Parents will also be invited to participate
      in assessments regarding their child.

      Study B, which will run concurrent to Phase 3, will be for participants who did not meet the
      depression inclusion criteria or had recent changes in therapy or medications that make them
      ineligible for Phase 3.

      Participants will be randomized to Phase 3 groups of 12 weeks of hatha yoga or group CBT.
      Parents will also be invited to participate in assessments regarding their child.
