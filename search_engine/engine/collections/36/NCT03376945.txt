      recovery for surgical patients with biliary tract disease, and to improve laboratory and
      clinical outcomes. The role of it for postoperative patients with jaundice is not clear yet.
      The object of this research was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of n-3 fatty acid-based
      parenteral nutrition (PN) for patients with jaundice following Surgical procedure.

      This cohort study was a pragmatic, retrospective, single center, matched, clinical trial from
      May 2014 to June 2017.
