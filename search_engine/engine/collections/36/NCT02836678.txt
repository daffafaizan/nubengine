      ridge-splitting techniques (RST) or alveolar ridge expansion techniques with simultaneous
      implant insertion. The piezoelectric surgical devices implemented for conducting bone
      osteotomy through the use of micrometric ultrasonic vibrations have been widely used in
      recent years in maxillofacial surgery. Its biggest advantages are that it allows for cutting
      with micrometric sensitivity while cutting hard tissues, it offers a clear vision of the
      surgical site due to its cavitation effect, it does not cause any damage to the soft tissues
      while performing these cuts, and that the bone tissue heals more quickly and seamlessly,
      after the cuts made by piezosurgery device. The fully synthetic bone substitute, NanoBoneÂ®
      (Artoss, Rostock, Germany), which will be applied in this clinical study, is basically a
      nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite embedded in a silica gel matrix, achieved by means of specific
      sol-gel techniques. Features such as interconnecting pores on the nanoscale, the open SiOH or
      SiO groups of polysilicic acid, its large internal surface, and the high porosity of this
      biomaterial are all related to the calcification processes observed within the implantation
      bed. While the HA component is responsible for NanoBone osteoconductive properties, the
      silica component is believed to induce connective tissue formation, osteoblast proliferation,
      bone matrix mineralization, and calcification, thus combining osteoconductive and
      osteoinductive properties. This phenomenon is associated with the rearrangement of the silica
      matrix, which could be observed in vivo.
