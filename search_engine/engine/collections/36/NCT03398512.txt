      therapy of peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer, patients undergo HIPEC with
      Raltitrexed at the time of fist surgery and twice repeat within one week after the surgery,
      following 3 cycles of 3-week Oxaliplatin/Capecitabine chemotherapy. The second surgery,
      exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy, is carried out one week later after the series of
      systemic chemotherapy.
