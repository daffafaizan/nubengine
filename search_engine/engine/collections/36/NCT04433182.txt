    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of Progression Free
      Survival (12m-PFS) at 12 months, of a treatment with copanlisib in combination with a
      standard rituximab-bendamustine regimen in patients with relapsed-refractory DLBCL, who have
      received at least one, but no more than three lines of treatment, including rituximab-based
      immunochemotherapy, not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT or T-cell CAR-T therapy,
      or relapsed after these treatments.
