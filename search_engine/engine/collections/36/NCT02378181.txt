      and provider team into an engaging, narrative graphic novel curriculum useful in group and
      individual counseling. The proven behavioral interventions will be augmented with health
      education material focused on medication assisted treatment (MAT) and HIV risk reduction.
      Together, these materials will comprise the Health Education Toolkit. The Health Education
      Toolkit (TK) will employ a shared decision making model to encourage 1) increased recovery
      engagement by patients, and 2) patient engagement in deciding whether to initiate and adhere
      to MAT. We will conduct a randomized pilot trial of 50 patients with active alcohol substance
      use disorders (SUDs) enrolled in inpatient or outpatient treatment and will follow them over
      3 months. We will test whether patients randomized to receive the TK curriculum will report
      increased shared decision making conversations, report greater satisfaction and acceptability
      of their treatment sessions, demonstrate larger reductions in substance use (drug and
      alcohol) and increases in abstinence, demonstrate improved alcohol severity scores, attend
      more attendance at specialty substance abuse intervention and treatment sessions, and
      demonstrate greater rates of initiating MAT for alcohol dependence over the 3-month follow-up
      period as compared to patients receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU).
