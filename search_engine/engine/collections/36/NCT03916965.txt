      spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) and treated with
      stents are enrolled in the study. We will evaluate the patency of stent, remodeling of the
      dissection and the relief of the symptoms in the next 2 years after patients have received
      stents.
