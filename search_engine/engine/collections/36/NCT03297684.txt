      by defining the factors that participate in the disease process or may be good biomarkers for
      disease progression. Study will investigate the temporal relationship between the course of
      treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and levels of candidate biomarkers previously identified to
      determine which biomarkers are affected by anti-VEGF therapy with aflibercept. Study will
      correlate response to therapy to particular biomarkers and attempt to identify those
      associated with resistance to therapy for DME. Biomarker data will be correlated with serial
      clinical evaluation of disease progression. 40 subjects with clinically significant DME who
      plan to undergo anti-VEGF therapy will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept monthly for 6
      months. At each visit aqueous humor will be collected and stored (6 samples per patient). At
      termination of study all specimens will be analyzed for biomarkers identified from previous
      studies.
