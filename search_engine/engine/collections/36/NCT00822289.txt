    
      Objective To test eradicate H.pylori after administration of radioactive iodine (131I) to
      patients with thyroid diseases and to evaluate their H.pylori CagA status .

      Design Observational study

      Setting

      The Isotopic Institute at the Rabin Medical Center, Campus Beilinson Patients Consecutive
      patients with thyroid diseases referred to the Isotopic Institute at the Rabin Medical
      Center, Campus Beilinson for either radioactive iodine (131I) thyroid scan or radioactive
      iodine (131I)treatment for their disease, will be screened, prior to the radioactive iodine,
      for H. pylori infection and CagA protein by serology. Patient with positive serology for H.
      pylori will be tested for active gastric infection using the H.pylori stool antigen test. The
      study population will include all patients who tested positive for H.pylori both by serology
      and stool antigen tests. Six to eight weeks and 6 month after administration of radioactive
      iodine (131I) treatment , stool antigen or H.pylori will be tested again to confirm
      persistence of H.pylori eradication.

      Main Outcome Measure confirmed H.pylori eradication by the stool antigen test. The rate of
      infection with virulent and caricogenic CagA H.pylori ,will be tested using the immunoblot
      assay.

      Summary

      We will test in this study whether Helicobacter pylori is eradicated, after radioactive
      iodine (131I) administration, from the stomach of patients with thyroid diseases. The rate of
      CagA virulent and carcinogenic H.pylori infection in theses patients will be assessed.
