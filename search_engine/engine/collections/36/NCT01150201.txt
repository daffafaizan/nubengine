      renal deterioration in type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. However, it is not
      known if these therapeutic effects can be extended to nondiabetic chronic renal disease. The
      current study aims to explore this research question by randomly assigning patients with
      various stages of chronic renal disease to receive either aliskiren on top of losartan, or
      continuation of losartan.
