      muscles as a simple mechanical lever system to produce body movement. One of the important
      functions of bones is to exert resistance against gravity in order to carry the body. In
      order to carry out their mechanical functions, bones need to have considerable resistance to
      deformation under load. It is well-known that muscle activity (i.e., exercises) improves the
      resistance of bone to mechanical loading, and that it is also important for treating and
      preventing osteoporosis. Resistance and impact training have been shown to induce bone
      formation and/or prevent bone resorption. Skeletal muscles have positive effects on bone
      structure and function. Can bones have an effect on muscle activity? There is only one study
      about the effect of bones on muscles. In this study, it was shown that bones may affect
      muscle strength gain in healthy young adult males.

      Vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. Vibration-induced bone formation is neuronally
      regulated. Vibration can also effectively enhance muscle strength and power. Previous studies
      have shown that vibration increases muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. But, it has not
      been reported whether bone has an effect on the increase in muscle EMG activity caused by
      vibration or not. The aim of this study was to determine whether radius bone exposed to
      cyclic mechanical loading affects muscle electrical activity of contralateral untrained m.
      flexor carpi radialis in healthy adult volunteers.
