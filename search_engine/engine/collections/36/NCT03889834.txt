    
      Methodology and study design:

      Pr Olivier Hermine, coordinator of the laboratory of Excellence GR-EX regrouping EFS
      (Etablissement Français du Sang) and INTS (Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine)
      partners, and leader of the Centre d'Investigation Clinique (CIC) IMAGINE (Hospital Necker,
      Paris, France) will assure the promotion of the clinical study for Paris Hospital consortium
      AP-HP (assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris).

      To reproduce two potential scenarios of autologous transfusion by an athlete, 1 bag of blood
      packed red blood cells (after leuko deprivation and centrifugation) will be either stored at
      4°C or frozen at -80°C after addition of 40% w/v glycerol. Reinfusion will be performed 31
      days later.

      A clinical randomized double-blinded two-phase study will be conducted. Volunteers will be
      separated in 3 groups:

        -  Group 1: Volunteers with regular sports activities without Autologous Blood Transfusion
           (ABT)T (n=10)

        -  Group 2: Volunteers with regular sports activities receiving a 200ml ABT with
           refrigerated blood (n=10)

        -  Group 3: Volunteers with regular sports activities receiving a 200ml ABT with frozen
           blood (n=10)

      To ensure volunteers safety, collection, preparation and pretransfusion blood testing will be
      performed by EFS at hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière (Paris, France). ABT as well as collection of
      samples will be performed at the IMAGINE Institute (Paris, France). Blood samples will be
      collected before blood removal, the day of the ABT just before reinfusion and after 3 hours,
      8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post-ABT. To perform all the experiments 25ml blood (4x 5 ml
      BD Vacutainer EDTA tubes) will be taken at each time point:

      1 will be dispatched to the French anti-doping laboratory for haematological analysis
      (Châtenay-Malabry, France), 2 to the EFS (Créteil, France) for RBC and MPs morphological
      characterization and quantification (using antigen markers, band 3 on the surface of MPs), 2
      to INTS for MPs isolation, characterization (band 3 on the surface of MPs and RBC) and for
      proteomic analysis and Western-Blot.
