      selected from 3 study sites in China in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      The subjects consent to participate in the trial and sign the informed consent. The subjects
      who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive the intracardiac
      electrophysiological examination, during which the subjects will be subject to diagnostic
      electrical stimulation by the Qubic Stim Cardiac Stimulator. The subjects will also receive
      the clinical follow-up visit after cardiac electrical stimulation until they are discharged
      from the hospital. The clinical effectiveness and safety of Qubic Stim Cardiac Stimulator in
      Chinese population were proved by observing the data collected in this study.
