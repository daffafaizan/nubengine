    
      Objectives:

        1. Collect detailed family cancer histories, personal medical history, prostate cancer
           clinical features, and exposure history from men with prostate cancer and men without
           prostate cancer to support studies focused on identifying hereditary cancer syndromes
           and genetic/epidemiologic factors predisposing to prostate cancer susceptibility.

        2. Collect behavioral measures to support research focused on assessing the needs of men
           undergoing cancer risk evaluation and satisfaction with the process.

        3. Create and maintain a biospecimen bank with specimens from men with prostate cancer and
           without prostate cancer to support studies focused on genetic alterations predisposing
           to prostate cancer risk.

        4. Perform targeted and broad-scale genetic and genomic sequencing to detect genetic
           alterations related to prostate cancer risk.

        5. Develop mechanisms to recontact participants with updates on research genetic results to
           guide genetic testing for inherited prostate cancer risk.
