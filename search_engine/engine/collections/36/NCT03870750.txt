    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare in a randomized phase II study the effectiveness of supportive and palliative
      care, a clinical multi-modal program, or a combined approach versus usual care only (UCO) to
      determine the winning arm in improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (Day-90
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant [FACT-BMT] scores) for
      vulnerable recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (Phase II) II.
      Compare in a randomized phase III study the effectiveness of the winning arm from the
      preceding phase II study versus UCO in improving HRQOL (Day-90 FACT-BMT scores) and/or
      overall survival at 1-year for vulnerable recipients of allogeneic HCT. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rates of overall survival. (Phase II and III) II. Cumulative incidences of non-relapse
      mortality (NRM). (Phase II and III) III. Cumulative incidences of relapse. (Phase II and III)
      IV. Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS). (Phase II and III) V. Cumulative incidence of
      frailty. (Phase II and III) VI. Cumulative incidence of disability. (Phase II and III) VII.
      Cumulative incidence of grades III-IV cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary and renal toxicities
      according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4. (Phase II) VIII. Use of resources
      within first 90 days after HCT: Frequency of hospitalization. (Phase II and III) IX. Use of
      resources within first 90 days after HCT: Duration of each hospitalization. (Phase II and
      III) X. Use of resources within first 90 days after HCT: Number and duration of admissions to
      intensive care unit. (Phase II and III) XI. Use of resources within first 90 days after HCT:
      Days out of hospital alive (DOHA). (Phase II and III)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo SPC on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

      ARM II: Patients undergo a CMC program on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

      ARM III: Patients undergo interventions as outlined in Arm I and Arm II.

      ARM IV: Patients receive standard of care.

      In all arms, patients undergo HCT on day 0 and complete questionnaires and surveys at
      enrollment and 30, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. In all arms patients complete a 4-meter
      walk test, 6-minute walk test, up and go test, measured strength test and cognitive
      assessment at enrollment, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT.
