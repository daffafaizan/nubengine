      the root of this drug resistance is an enhanced survival that relates to intrinsic cell cycle
      dysregulation and aberrations in the overall process of the repair of DNA damage. These
      malignancies represent a continuing therapeutic challenge, since currently no "standard
      treatments" for these diseases exist. Approximately 30% of adults with newly diagnosed AML
      are primary refractory to chemotherapy and at least 50% of those who achieve remission will
      relapse. For patients with relapsed or refractory AML, the expected CR/CRi rates with
      traditional multi-agent chemotherapies range from < 10% for primary refractory AML to 25-30%
      for relapsed AML and cure rates < 20%, even with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Thus,
      novel treatment approaches are needed.
