      I. Determine feasibility of using non-invasive MuscleSound technology to determine glycogen
      stores in cancer patients.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the baseline glycogen storage in two different groups of cancer patients, who
      are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation: (1) those with cachexia; (2) those without cachexia.

      II. Determine the rate of depletion of muscle-glycogen stores by calculating the "Fuel
      Rating" score (FRS) at baseline, after 10-min of exercise and then again after 20-min of
      exercise.

      III. Determine if there is any correlation between muscle-glycogen (at baseline and its
      depletion rate over time) and other factors including cancer type, cancer stage, patient age,
      patient sex, current body mass index (BMI), presence or absence of cachexia, functional
      measures and patient reported outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound via MuscleSound technology over 3 minutes at baseline and
      immediately after each of 2 physical therapy sessions comprising cycling or walking over 10
      minutes.
