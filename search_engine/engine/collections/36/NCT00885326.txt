    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the toxicities and feasibility of bolus and metronomic cyclophosphamide
           when given in combination with zoledronic acid with and without bevacizumab in patients
           with recurrent or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  To preliminarily evaluate the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients
           within the confines of a pilot study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on
      day 0 and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-27 in course 1. In course 2 and all
      subsequent courses, patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 0 and 14,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on day 1, and oral
      cyclophosphamide once daily on days 0 and 2-27. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2
      years* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive up to 13 doses of zoledronic acid.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
