      provided to underserved patients screened by ophthalmologists at the General Eye Clinic at a
      public hospital that does not normally provide the vaccine. A nurse will be at the clinic to
      administer the vaccine. Patients will be contacted by phone 1 month later and seen within 3
      months in the Eye Clinic to determine whether there were any side effects.
