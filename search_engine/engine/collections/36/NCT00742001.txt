      used to test the quality of RBCs in a person. By measuring the level of radioisotope in a
      blood sample, these tests evaluate what percentage of the RBCs remain in the bloodstream
      after 24 hours (recovery) and can predict how long the RBCs will remain in circulation
      (survival). The IMPROVE trial is a feasibility trial to evaluate these parameters in RBCs
      obtained from whole blood units that have been treated with the Mirasol System.
