      done in Biomedical Engineering Center (BMEC) of ITRI.

      Patients A total of 40 cases of HCC patients (20 HBV-related HCC and 20 HCV-related HCC) who
      received surgical resection in National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled from our
      tissue banks. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by pathological examination. The surgical
      specimens were frozen immediately after surgery and stored in -140°C. The clinicopathological
      data will be retrospectively obtained from chart reviews.

      Another total of 40 new HCC patients who receive surgical resection in National Taiwan
      University Hospital will be collected. The healthy subjects and patients chronically infected
      with HBV or HCV without HCC will be used as controls. The whole bloods will be collected
      before, one and six months after operation. The diagnosis of HCC will be confirmed by
      pathology. In addition to the whole bloods, the surgical specimens will be frozen immediately
      after surgery and stored in -140°C.
