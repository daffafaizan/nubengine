      Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and an active comparison therapy called Muscle Relaxation
      Therapy (MRT). Participants that qualify to be in this study will be randomly assigned to
      receive 8 weeks of group therapy in either MBCT or MRT treatments. Prior to receiving therapy
      participants will: complete baseline assessments related to their PTSD; fill out surveys;
      have an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); and provide saliva samples. These
      assessments will be repeated after the therapy is over. Overall study participation should
      last approximately 10-12 weeks.
