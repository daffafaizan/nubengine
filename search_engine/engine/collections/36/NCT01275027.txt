      diabetic dogs and has improved the dogs' longevity and quality of life. Observational
      analysis by trained veterinarians has indicated that the natural fluctuations in blood
      glucose levels do not exist in dogs consuming the product. An initial Phase 1 study tested
      the product in a brownie form. The product has been reformulated to capsule form for the
      Phase 2 study.

      The hypothesis for this study is that diabetic individuals will decrease their
      insulin/diabetic medication usage and have a decrease in glucose levels after consuming the
      product for 16 weeks.
