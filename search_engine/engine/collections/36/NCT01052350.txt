      dementia subtypes in patients with Parkinson's disease. The ultimate goal of this project is
      to be able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing dementia, and to
      distinguish the underlying cause of dementia. We will be including both PD and normal
      subjects in this study. This a long term study and we are considering including a total of
      320 participants in this protocol.
