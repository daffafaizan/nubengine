    
      This study is a comparative effectiveness pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a 12-session community-delivered, family-based type 2 diabetes preventative
      lifestyle intervention, delivered over 6 weeks, that includes mindfulness-based stress
      reduction training - "Salud sin Barreras" (meaning, "Health without Barriers") - in up to 50
      Hispanic/Latino adolescents who are at-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. We also will
      estimate the effectiveness of Salud sin Barreras for lowering perceived stress and improving
      insulin resistance as compared to a time-matched lifestyle-only intervention, the "La Vida
      Saludable" (meaning, the Healthy Living Program; HeLP) in Hispanic/Latino adolescents at-risk
      for type 2 diabetes. In addition, we will estimate the impact of the Salud sin Barreras
      program, relative to HeLP, on the secondary outcomes of mindfulness, depressive symptoms,
      disinhibited eating behavior, sleep quality, physical activity, cortisol, and perceived
      impact of discrimination.
