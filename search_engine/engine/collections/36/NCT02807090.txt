      in women with nonspecific chronic low back pain (DLCI). METHOD: Thirty-eight women, aged
      35-60 years, were randomly assigned to two groups: 1) Circular Dance group (gDC); 2) Lumbar
      Stabilization Exercise group (gESL). The primary clinical outcomes were pain, assessed using
      the Numerical Pain Scale and functional disability by the Roland Morris Disability
      Questionnaire and the secondary outcomes were: Depression assessed by the Beck Depression
      Inventory; Anxiety by the Numerical Anxiety Scale; Global Perception with the Global Effect
      Perception Scale, Signs and Symptoms of Adverse Effects analyzed by the Collective Subject
      Discourse and Quality of Life method using the Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire
      (SF-36). The groups were treated twice a week for 60 minutes for 8 weeks totaling 16
      sessions. Each participant was assessed before and after treatment and at follow-up 12 and 24
      weeks.
