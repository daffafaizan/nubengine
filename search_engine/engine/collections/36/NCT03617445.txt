      importance,especially in individuals with comorbid conditions such as solid organ
      transplantation(SOT). The incidence and adverse outcomes of CDI are greatly amplified in the
      setting of SOT, due to healthcare exposure, antibiotic use and immunosuppression, all of
      which are ubiquitous in SOT recipients. There are currently no effective treatment options to
      achieve a sustained cure of recurrent CDI and prevent further recurrence in SOT recipients. A
      novel approach that has recently gained attention is restoration of the CDI impaired gut
      microbiome by instillation of stool from a healthy donor into the intestine of a CDI patient.
      This treatment, called Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been found in
      non-comparative studies to reduce CDI recurrence dramatically with a reported efficacy of
      over 95%, however its efficacy in SOT recipients has not been studied and cannot be
      extrapolated from results in the non-SOT population because SOT recipients are a unique study
      population due to profound immunosuppression, frequent antibiotic use and frequent
      opportunities for exposure to CDI all of which markedly, repeatedly and persistently disrupt
      the gut microbiome. Thus, this critical gap in the field needs to be addressed by a trial of
      FMT in SOT recipients with CDI.
