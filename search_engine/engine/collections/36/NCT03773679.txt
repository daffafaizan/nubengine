    
      Objective: This randomized controlled double-blinded experimental study was carried out to
      determine the effects of daily exercise program on bone mineral density and cortisol level in
      preterm infants with very low birth weight matched for birth weight, gestation week, and
      gender.

      Study design: The study was performed with preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal
      intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Ethical committee approval, institutional
      permission, parental written consent were obtained. Daily exercise program was implemented in
      preterm infants in the exercise group for 30 days, once a day, and continuing for 7-10
      minutes. Before and after the study the following were evaluated in preterm infants in the
      exercise and control group: anthropometric measurements, tibia speed of sound (SOS) for bone
      mineral density, serum biochemical parameters and cortisol levels.
