      symptoms, quality of life, and anxiety status in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) can potentially reduce anxiety status and improve
      subjective welling in acute patients. It is an ideal rehabilitation intervention for patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. However, no study has investigated the effects of PMR on outcomes
      among patients with chronic schizophrenia.

      Design: This study applied a randomized parallel case-controlled design.

      Methods: Hospital-based randomized control trial in Taiwan. Eighty subjects with chronic
      schizophrenia were recruited from a psychotic ward and randomized into PMR, or control
      groups. Patients in the intervention group participated in progressive muscle relaxation for
      12 weeks; while patients in the control group members received supportive treatment-as-usual
      (TAU). All participants completed anxiety, psychotic syndromes and quality of life measures
      at baseline, 3-month, and 3-month follow-up.
