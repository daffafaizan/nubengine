    
      We will recruit low-income age 65 or older

      -principally African-American, adults from the Baltimore Department of Housing Energy
      Assistance Program.

      -We will interview them at home and randomize participants to either the treatment (CAPABLE
      intervention) or control (attention-control) group. Participants in the treatment group will
      receive up to 10 in-home sessions -- 6 visits with an occupational therapist and 4 visits
      from a nurse - and $1200 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each
      treatment participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will
      systematically tailor content to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols.
