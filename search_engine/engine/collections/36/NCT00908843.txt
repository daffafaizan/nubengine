    
      Objective: To compare the efficacy of oral versus intravenous hydration in the prevention of
      the contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in inpatients with different renal function and equal
      type and volume of contrast.

      Methods: The clinical trial will include 324 patients with GFR higher or equal to 30 ml/min
      who will receive intravenous contrast (Iohexol: 300 mg of l/ml; approximate volume: 120 ml at
      2-5ml/second) in the following 12-24 hours. Patients with inclusion criteria, and having
      previously signed a consent form, will be randomised into 3 groups (intravenous hydration,
      oral and no hydration). Intravenous hydration will be carried out with bicarbonate 1/6M one
      hour before the test (3ml/Kg/h) and oral hydration with Casen solution in will be carried out
      4 hours before (75 ml/10 kg) the intravenous contrast administration. In relation to the
      hydrated, it should be pointed out that, the same procedure would have been carried out
      without the study. The follow-up of renal function will be carried out after measuring
      creatinine and cystatin C in blood and GFR pre- and 24 hour after the test. It will also
      determine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (N-GAL), IL-8 and F2-Isoprostanes levels
      in urine and superoxide dismutase activity in erythrocytes, pre- and in different post- test
      times.

      Also, in vitro, the effect of contrast on NADPH-oxidase activity of PBLs isolated from 30
      control patients will also be studied (10 patients by each group).
