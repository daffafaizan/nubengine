      non-interventional, observational study in which Sevorane is prescribed for adult patients
      undergoing general surgery for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the usual manner in
      accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization. Sevorane is used for
      induction and maintenance anesthesia by the choice of anesthesiologist. No additional
      procedures (other than standard of care) shall be applied to the patients. Each patient will
      be observed from the starting of anesthesia till the anesthesia end. Markers of myocardial
      ischemia will be detected up to the first 24 hours after anesthesia (if available).
      Additionally the correlation between the experience and training background of
      anesthesiologists and patient related outcomes of general anesthesia with sevoflurane as a
      single anesthetic will be assessed.
