      healthy sleep practices for maintaining or even enhancing sleep consolidation and depth in
      subjects aged 75+ who are at risk for decay in sleep quality and daytime well being; to
      determine the associated benefits for health; and to examine the persistence of such effects
      for 12 months beyond the end of the 18-month intervention. This project focuses not on
      pathology but on prevention of sleep decay and preservation of sleep in individuals who have
      already evidenced successful aging.
