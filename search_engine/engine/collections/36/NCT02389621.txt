      treatment period of 7 days (Days 1 to 7 during which study drug is to be administered for 4
      to 7 days), and a posttreatment period (through 28 days posttreatment).

      Once-daily treatment with lusutrombopag 3 mg or placebo is to commence on Day 1 and continue
      for up to 7 days. Platelet count is to be determined on Days 5, 6, and 7 prior to
      administration of study drug; if a participant meets the administration stopping criterion
      (ie, platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L with an increase of ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L from baseline), no
      additional dose of study drug is to be administered. The planned invasive procedure is to be
      performed in the posttreatment period between Days 9 and 14. Platelet count for determination
      of the need for platelet transfusion is to be determined on or after Day 8, but no more than
      2 days prior to the invasive procedure; a platelet transfusion is required if the platelet
      count is < 50 × 10⁹/L.
