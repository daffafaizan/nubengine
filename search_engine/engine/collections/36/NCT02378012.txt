      I. To evaluate the effect access to an iPad has on anxiety as measured by the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine how computers and tablets are used by patients who have access to such devices.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to Group A or randomized to 1 of 2 groups (Groups B or C).

      GROUP A (participants provide their own computer or tablet device): A member of the research
      personnel helps the participants install Netflix, Spotify, and Skype applications on their
      computers if they wish to do so. Participants will be given subscriptions to each application
      and usernames for access on days -5 to 10.

      GROUP B (Apple iPad): Participants receive an iPad for days -5 to 10. Participants also
      receive the BuckiPad manual for instructions on how to use the iPad and Netflix, Skype, and
      Spotify applications. Participants are also directed to the official Apple's iPad user's
      manual on their device and have questions answered by research personnel on day -5.

      GROUP C: Participants do not receive an iPad for days -5 to 10.
