      adults. Progressive cardiac remodeling and deteriorating cardiac output have been implicated
      as key factors underlying HF-related exercise intolerance and quality of life. Even after
      implementing medical and device therapies that moderate remodeling, exercise tolerance
      remains impaired. While exercise training has been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity,
      mechanisms facilitating this benefit remain unclear. Peripheral adaptations in the skeletal
      muscle and vasculature provide at least some benefit, however reverse cardiac remodeling
      (beyond effects of pharmacological and device therapies) may be additive. The investigators
      propose to study the impact of 2 different types of exercise on cardiac morphology as well as
      systolic and diastolic performance and related functional gains. The investigators will
      compare traditional aerobic training to a novel regimen of inspiratory muscle training (IMT).
      IMT is a specific type of exercise training that may be particularly useful for frail,
      infirmed HF patients who are unlikely to tolerate aerobic training. Effects of IMT on
      remodeling have not been previously studied.

      The proposed echocardiography pilot study builds on a funded VA Merit F0834-R "Exercise
      Therapy to Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms; Sorting Mechanisms of Benefit" (Exercise therapy)
      PI, Forman that compares different modes of exercise training in older (age 50yrs) systolic
      (EF 45%) HF patients. The original study assesses peripheral mechanisms affected by exercise
      training, but was not designed to assess cardiac remodeling. The proposed pilot study
      provides a vital complementary analysis, i.e., it adds assessments of cardiac remodeling as
      well as related changes in systolic and diastolic performance.
