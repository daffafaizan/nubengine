    
      This is a prospective, multi-center clinical study designed to evaluate the long-term safety
      of the Tendril MRIâ„¢ lead implanted with any SJM Brady MRI pacemaker or similar model (SJM
      Brady MRI system) in subjects with a standard bradycardia pacing indication through 60 months
      of follow up.

      Additionally, the study will assess the safety of the pacemaker system in subject(s)
      undergoing clinically indicated MRI scan(s). Any enrolled subject implanted with the SJM
      Brady MRI system may be included in this evaluation if they are scheduled for or planning to
      have a MRI scan during the course of the study.
