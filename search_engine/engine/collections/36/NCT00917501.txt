      of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for the treatment of adolescents with active depressive
      symptoms and a high risk for developing mania (i.e. the patient has a bipolar parent and meet
      DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder). (2) To use proton magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (1H MRS) (i.e. prefrontal neurochemistry) and red blood cell (RBC) omega-3 fatty
      acid levels to examine potential mediators of treatment response to omega-3 fatty acids in
      adolescents with a high risk for mania.
