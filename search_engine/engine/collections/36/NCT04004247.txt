    
      High Flow Oxygen through nasal cannula is widely used in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory
      failure of heterogenous etiology with very good patients compliance.

      However, the evidence of what level of PEEP or pressure support (if any) with different flow
      rates is weak.

      Our goal is to determine these effects and compare them with standard approach with
      non-invasive ventilation via full face mask.
