    
      Lymphocytic alveolitis in HIV-infected patients probably represents a local immune response
      to HIV-infected cells in the lung. The intensity of lymphocytic alveolitis may therefore
      reflect the viral load in the lung. If so, treatment that reduces viral load in the lung
      (e.g., HAART) should also decrease the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the
      alveolar space and should return pulmonary immune responses toward normal.

      Patients are stratified by CD4 count: less than 200 cells/mm3 or 200 - 500 cells/mm3. BAL is
      performed and blood samples are collected prior to initiation of HAART and after 1 and 6
      months of HAART. If a patient has detectable HIV in the lung after 6 months of HAART, the
      patient is asked to submit to an optional fourth BAL after 12 months of HAART. BAL fluid and
      cells are analyzed for HIV viral load, percent lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets. Responses
      in the lung are compared to simultaneous changes in these variables found in the peripheral
      blood. Each patient serves as his/her own control.
