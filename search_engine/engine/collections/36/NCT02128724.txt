    
      This study will be a single-centre, open-label, 3+3 cohort, dose escalation phase I study of
      the use of buparlisib in combination with thoracic radiotherapy. Patients with incurable
      NSCLC requiring palliative thoracic radiotherapy will be eligible for entry.

      The first three cohorts of patients will be treated with escalating doses of BKM120. These
      patients will be treated with buparlisib for a total of fourteen days. One week after
      commencing buparlisib, patients will start palliative radiotherapy treatment. Radiotherapy
      treatment will be delivered as 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period. Maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) will be determined and a further 6 patients will be treated at this dose. Response
      to buparlisib treatment will be based upon changes in tumour hypoxia and perfusion as
      detected by 18F-Miso PET-CT scans and perfusion CT scans respectively.

      In the event that no changes are detected in tumour hypoxia or perfusion in cohorts 1-3, an
      optional group of patients (cohort 4) will be recruited. These patients will receive
      buparlisib treatment for a total of 28 days. Three weeks after commencing buparlisib, this
      cohort will receive palliative radiotherapy with 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period.

      Samples from the patients will also be analysed:
