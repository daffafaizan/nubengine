      EmoTrak with a wait list control group. After two weeks, the active control group becomes the
      treatment group. All participants will be evaluated four times from at baseline to two
      months. The measures to explore for any pre and post change are stress reduction on the
      emotional exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and improved resilience on
      the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
