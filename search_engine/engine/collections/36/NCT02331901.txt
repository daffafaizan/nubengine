      getting chronic post-concussion symptoms (PCS) but also biomarkers in the brain to find out
      if this group with prolonged symptoms has measurable changes in the brain which could explain
      the persisting symptoms.

      Several biomarkers and brain areas have been investigated as possible sites of injury after
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The nature of the diffuse PCS makes corpus callosum (CC),
      thalamus (THA) and hippocampus (HIP) interesting because of their central position and
      connection to widespread motor, sensory and cognitive processes and other brain areas.

      In most prior studies conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has failed to detect
      pathology especially in the later phase. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and Diffusional
      Tensor Imaging (DTI) are more sensitive to microstructural changes and might serve as
      biomarkers in the middle brain after mTBI.

      It is hypothesized that there will be a difference in the microstructure of the thalamus,
      corpus callosum and hippo campus as measured with DKI between two groups of mTBI subjects
      with and without PCS. Secondary it is hypothesized that DKI are more sensitive than DTI in
      the measure of microstructural changes.
