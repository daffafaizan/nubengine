    
      Pilot feasibility trial to examine the acceptability and efficacy of compassion-based
      intervention in reducing indices of psychopathology (i.e., internalized weight stigma, mood
      symptoms), and improving weight management outcomes (i.e., physical activity behaviour,
      dieting behaviour, weight loss) among women with mood disorders undergoing lifestyle weight
      management. In this proof of concept study, adult females with a diagnosis of major
      depressive disorder of bipolar disorder will be randomized into two arms: weight management
      treatment as usual + psychoeducation group; weight management as usual + control.
