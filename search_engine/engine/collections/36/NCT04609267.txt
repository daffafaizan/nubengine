      9 (PHQ-9), a clinically accepted tool for diagnosing major depressive disorder. The purpose
      of the study is to examine if the new delivery system of the PHQ-9 is effective at capturing
      participant depression levels. The new version uses a Mirror device, which is similar to a
      smart television with a mirror interface. The device records auditory responses to the PHQ-9
      through Amazon Alexa. We will be comparing the responses from the Mirror device to those
      given on the clinically established paper format. If proven effective at capturing depression
      levels of patients, future studies may investigate if the new format can be used to improve
      at home clinical care.
