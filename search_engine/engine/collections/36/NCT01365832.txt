      possible mechanism underlying cardiovascular disease in patients with OSA is systemic
      inflammation. CRP, an acute phase reactant secreted by the liver, is one of the most actively
      studied biomarkers of low-grade inflammation, and numerous studies have shown that higher CRP
      levels are associated with high mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease in men
      and women. In patients with OSA, the question as to whether or not CRP levels are elevated is
      still under debate. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in the
      management of OSA, conflicting data also exist regarding the effects of CPAP on CRP levels.
      However, none of the existing studies assessed the influence of gender on the CRP evolution
      pattern. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate possible gender differences in
      CRP evolution in patients with moderate to severe OSA, free of medical comorbidities, 3 and 6
      months after the start of effective CPAP treatment.
