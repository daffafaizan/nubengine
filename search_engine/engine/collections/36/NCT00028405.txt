      determine the suitability of the treatment. In those patients that qualify the entry
      criteria, a light delivery catheter will be directly inserted in the tumor through a minor
      surgical procedure. The patients will then be injected with the photosensitive drug, LS11.
      One hour following the drug injection, light energy will be delivered from the light delivery
      catheter for a period of 1-24 hours. The duration of the light treatment for a given patient
      may be based on various factors including when a given patient enters the study. Following
      the delivery of light energy, the light delivery catheter will be removed from the tumor. The
      insertion and removal of the catheter will be carried out under the guidance of CT scan. The
      patients will be asked to take precautions from external light exposure for a period of time.
      The patients will undergo CT scan and other tests on days 7, 14 and 42 to evaluate safety of
      the treatment, tumor cell death and treatment response. Blood samples will be taken at
      different time points to examine the clearance of the drug from the body.
