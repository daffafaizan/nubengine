           (including forensic, pediatric, cardiac and neuropathologists) to determine whether a
           possible, probable or definite cause of death can be identified and whether additional
           studies might be helpful in determining a specific cause of death.

        -  For case investigations that are open/active, the registry offers cardiac pathology, and
           neuroimaging/neuropathology consultations.

        -  For those cases determined to be unexplained/undetermined- access to genetic analysis
           (whole exome sequencing) when viable samples are available. Additional genetic analysis
           opportunities for biological parents and some family members. For more information,
           please see our Genetics Frequently Asked Questions.

        -  Study the risks that lead to sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC).

        -  Provide families with a review of their child's death through a case review report.

        -  Identify at-risk individuals with the hopes of gaining knowledge to establish prevention
           strategies to reduce the chances of sudden unexplained death in the future.
