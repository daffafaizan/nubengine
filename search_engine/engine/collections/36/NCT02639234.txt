    
      This is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of Vigil™ autologous tumor
      cell immunotherapy and nivolumab PD-1 inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC that is progressive on or after one prior platinum-based systemic therapy
      (ALK or EGFR mutation-targeted therapy should have been received if appropriate mutation
      present).

      Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection,
      or thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion) may elect to have tumor tissue procured for
      manufacture of Vigil™ vaccine. Patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive
      doublet therapy comprising of (i) Vigil™ 1 x 10^7 cells by intradermal injection every 2
      weeks for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses and (ii) nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous
      infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Three to six weeks after tissue procurement has
      occurred eligibility will be reconfirmed by the study site. Subjects must begin the study
      regimen within 6 weeks of tissue procurement. Radiological assessment of tumor response will
      be performed at screening, Cycle 5 (Week 9) and approximately every 2 months thereafter until
      progressive disease unless the subject is lost to follow-up, withdraws consent for study
      related procedures, or initiates another cancer therapy. Tumor biopsy for correlative studies
      should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 5 (Week 9). Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained before tumor procurement,
      and prior to initiation of study therapy on Day 1 at Cycle 1 (Week 1), Cycle 5 (Week 9),
      Cycle 9 (Week 17) and EOT.
