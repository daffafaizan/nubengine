        1. To develop a web-based interactive decision support tool to incorporate tailored
           information regarding risks and benefits of the treatment options (from regression-based
           prediction models derived on the 35,000 patients already in the MBSC registry) with
           information regarding other salient attributes of the treatment options (derived from
           focus groups and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders including bariatric
           surgery patients, bariatric program staff, and surgeons).

        2. To perform a quasi-experimental study comparing the decision support tool with usual
           care to determine its effects on patient decisions (treatment choice, knowledge,
           treatment-preference concordance, and decisional conflict) and on patient outcomes
           including weight loss, patient satisfaction, and improvements in quality of life after
           surgery.

      This research is closely aligned with the goals of PCORI and will have direct impacts on
      patients and caregivers by providing information that is required to improve healthcare
      decision-making for this prevalent, damaging, and costly condition.
