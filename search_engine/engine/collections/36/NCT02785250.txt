      effectiveness study to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD) of epacadostat in
      combination with DPX-Survivac and cyclophosphamide.

      The Phase 2 component was initially a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of DPX-Survivac + cyclophosphamide with or without the RP2D of
      epacadostat. The design of the study has been amended to a single arm study in which up to 16
      evaluable subjects will be enrolled to received DPX-Survivac plus intermittent low dose
      cyclophosphamide (i.e. treatment arm 2).
