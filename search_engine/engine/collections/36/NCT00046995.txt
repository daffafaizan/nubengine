        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with completely resected stage IIB or III
           colon cancer treated with adjuvant chronomodulated vs standard schedule fluorouracil and
           leucovorin calcium with or without carboplatin.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the dose intensities of fluorouracil and carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and disease stage (IIB vs III). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (standard schedule): Patients receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV continuously and
           leucovorin calcium (CF) IV on days 1 and 2.

        -  Arm II (standard + carboplatin schedule): Patients receive 5-FU and CF as in arm I plus
           carboplatin IV on day 1.

        -  Arm III (chronomodulated schedule): Patients receive 5-FU IV continuously and CF IV
           continuously on days 1-4.

        -  Arm IV (chronomodulated + carboplatin schedule): Patients receive 5-FU and CF as in arm
           III plus carboplatin IV continuously on days 1-4.

      Quality of life is assessed.

      Treatment in all arms repeats every 14 days for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 660-800 patients will be accrued for this study.
