      regarding type of DES including the thickness of strut, eluted drugs, type of polymer,
      generation of the DES will be provided after sufficient encryption. Likewise, all information
      regarding drug prescription, including the total number of pills prescribed during the
      period, patients' compliance and dosage of drugs will be provided after sufficient
      encryption. After decrypting the information provided to establish a database suitable for
      analysis, all eligible patients will be divided into two or more groups according to the type
      of DES or drug use pattern after DES implantation, which include:

        1. 1st-generation vs. 2nd-generation DES

        2. Durable polymer vs. bioresorbable polymer 2nd-generaion DES

        3. Ultra-thin strut vs. Conventional strut vs. Thick-strut DES

        4. According to the type of eluted drugs

        5. DAPT duration after DES implantation

        6. Type of anti-platelet therapy after cessation of DAPT

        7. Intensity of statin therapy after DES implantation

        8. According to use of nitrate donor or vasodilator after DES implantation

        9. Use of anti-hypertensive agents after DES implantation

       10. Use of glucose-lowering agents in diabetic subset of patients
