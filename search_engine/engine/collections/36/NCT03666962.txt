      informed consent, blood samples were collected to detect the anti Xa factor activity after
      taking the drugs. Meanwhile, the medication compliance of the patients during the treatment
      was also collected.

      Dedicated tests based on anti-Xa activity for rivaroxaban and apixaban and anti-IIa activity
      for dabigatran concentration was conducted. Blood samples are divided into peak concentration
      and valley concentration. Peak concentration (Cmax) refers to the highest serum concentration
      after administration for at least one week in the study. Valley concentration (Cmin), the
      lowest concentration during administration, is usually obtained from the lowest concentration
      between the initial time of administration and the next time the drug is administered at a
      steady state (continuous medication for more than 1 weeks.).

      A compliance questionnaire was conducted to collect the compliance of the drug during
      treatment. The Morisky, Green, and Levine Adherence Scale (MGLS) was used to evaluate the
      medication adherence of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) patients.

      Based on the results of data analysis, the correlation between anti Xa/IIa activity test
      results and medication compliance was analyzed, making the anti Xa/IIa activity concentration
      a simple measure to predict the compliance of patients.
