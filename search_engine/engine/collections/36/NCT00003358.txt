      in combination with IP cisplatin in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in
      this patient population. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of IP gemcitabine administered
      with IP cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive intraperitoneal
      cisplatin on day 1 plus intraperitoneal gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15. No treatment will
      be given on day 22. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. Patients receive up to 4 courses of
      therapy. Dose escalation of gemcitabine continues in cohorts of 3 patients until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of
      6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients are followed every 3 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
