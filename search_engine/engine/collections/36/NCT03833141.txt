      available for Canadian patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

      This study is an observational cohort study of patient reported outcomes (PROs) within
      real-world settings for participants who are prescribed benralizumab for treatment of
      uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma. Patients will be recruited in select clinics across
      Canada.

      Survey data for each participant in the study will be obtained at the following time-points:

        -  Baseline (Week 0)

        -  Short-term follow up: 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks after baseline

        -  Long-term follow-up: 24- and 56-weeks after baseline
