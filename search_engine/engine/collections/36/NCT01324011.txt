      diabetes are expected to increase even further as rates of obesity rise. While there is
      evidence that diabetes self-management training is effective in improving metabolic control,
      and modest weight loss can delay the onset of diabetes, the investigators have limited
      knowledge of the best approach to self-management training from a family perspective in high
      risk groups such as African Americans. Family remains a valued dimension of African American
      life and may be an important behavioral context for interventions to improve disease
      management and health outcomes. Nonetheless, there are no trials of family-based
      interventions to improve diabetes self-care and achieve weight loss that have involved adult
      families.

      Participants: A total of 80 pairs (index participant + family member) or 160 adults will
      participate in this trial where a 20-session behavioral weight loss intervention will be
      tested. Participants include overweight or obese African Americans with type 2 diabetes and a
      paired co-participant identified as an overweight or obese adult family member without type 2
      diabetes. Family members may self-describe as non-African Americans.

      Procedures (methods): Study participants will be enrolled in a randomized controlled trial
      using a 2:1 random allocation to the special intervention (a 20-session family-based
      behavioral weight loss intervention) or a usual care group (controls). Following the trial,
      participants in the usual care group will receive a 6-session weight management intervention
      (over a 2-month period) based on the 20-session special intervention.
