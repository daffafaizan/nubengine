    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment received), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial), parallel-group (each treatment group will be treated at the same time),
      multicenter (more than one clinical site) study in healthy human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-uninfected adults. The main study will be conducted in 3 phases: a 6-week screening
      period; a 48-week vaccination period; and a follow-up period to the final main study visit at
      Week 72. A Long-term Extension (LTE) phase (approximately 3 years after Week 72) will be
      performed for participants randomized to Group 1 or Group 2, who receive all 4 vaccinations
      and are negative for HIV infection at Week 72. The approximate duration of the study will be
      approximately 78 weeks for participants not participating in the LTE phase and approximately
      222 weeks for participants participating in the LTE phase but not receiving a late boost
      vaccination and approximately 246 (12-month follow-up) or 294 (24-month follow-up) weeks for
      participants receiving a late boost vaccination. Participants safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
