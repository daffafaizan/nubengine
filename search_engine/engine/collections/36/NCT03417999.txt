      associated with negative medical, psychological, and social consequences. To reduce this
      stress, and to facilitate separation from parents and the induction of anesthesia, children
      are often given a sedative prior to undergoing a procedure. Dexmedetomidine is a highly
      selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties.
      While off-label in its use, the administration of dexmedetomidine by the intranasal route has
      become a popular and effective technique for sedation in children because it is non-invasive,
      easy to administer, well tolerated, and relatively fast in onset. Despite this, little
      consistent data have been published on its onset time, duration of action, or optimal dose.
      The only available pharmacokinetic (PK) data on dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients is in
      children who were administered IV dexmedetomidine. We are proposing a prospective open-label
      inter-subject cohort dose-escalation pharmacokinetic study to obtain peak dexmedetomidine
      drug concentration level in plasma and the corresponding time point following intranasal
      administration in the pediatric patient with cardiac disease.
