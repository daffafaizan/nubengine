      CRRT and ECMO treatment for critically ill children,we choose sepsis children especially
      those who are combined with septic shock as research object.

      Furthermore,refractory shock is the therapeutic indications of ECMO. According to their
      clinical manifestation and severity of the disease,they are treated by CRRT or/with ECMO in a
      non-randomized way.

      Comparing the laboratory index and prognosis of critically ill children treated by CRRT and
      those treated by ECMO,we aim to investigate the the timing ,curative effect of ECMO in the
      treatment of septic shock especially refractory shock.

      The critically ill children who treated by CRRT are divided into three groups according to
      their treatment mode of CRRT. The laboratory index and prognosis are also be compared to
      investigate curative effect of CRRT in the treatment of septic shock.

      The study also include severe sepsis children without CRRT or ECMO treatment as a control
      group.
