      in Japanese healthy adult men. This study consists of two studies to evaluate bioequivalence
      (Study 1) and the effects of food (Study 2). Study 1 (split into a Pilot phase and a Pivotal
      phase) will look at bioequivalence between a single-dose of TAK-438ASA tablet versus a
      single-dose combination of TAK-438 tablet 10 mg and aspirin enteric-coated tablet 100 mg.
      Study 2 will look at the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-438ASA tablet.

      The study will enroll up to 440 participants in total (Study 1 + 2). For Study 1, 12
      participants per group (24 participants in total) will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups for the pilot study to estimate the
      sample size of Pivotal study. After pilot study, 202 participants as a maximum per group (404
      participants in total) will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  TAK-438ASA tablet (Period 1) + TAK-438 10 mg tablet and Aspirin 100 mg tablet (Period 2)

        -  TAK-438 10 mg tablet and Aspirin 100 mg tablet (Period 1) + TAK-438ASA tablet (Period 2)

      For Study 2, 6 participants per group (12 participants in total) will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  TAK-438ASA tablet (Fasted condition) + TAK-438ASA tablet (Fed condition)

        -  TAK-438ASA tablet (Fed condition) + TAK-438ASA tablet (Fasted condition) This
           single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
           study is approximately 18 days. Participants will make two visits to the clinic and be
           hospitalized for eight days in total.
