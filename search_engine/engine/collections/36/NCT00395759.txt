      conditions typically are associated with dry eyes and include tear film deficiency due to
      ocular or systemic disease, lid resurfacing problems, and contact lens wear. The artificial
      tears are used to alleviate the dry eye symptoms. The administration of an artificial tear to
      the eye can disrupt the tear layer and this disruption could then result in a decrease in
      contrast sensitivity.1 - 6

      Temporal changes in tear film structure (e.g., drying of the tear layer) can distort the
      optical wavefront as it passes through the tear layer and subsequently reduce contrast
      sensitivity.1 Theoretically, any substance applied to the tear layer that alters its
      structure could affect contrast sensitivity. Previous work in our lab has demonstrated that
      Refresh Liquigel when applied to the tear layer of non-contact and contact lens wearing
      subjects can decrease contrast sensitivity.4, 5, 7 In this study, we propose to examine the
      effects of a new investigational artificial tear on contrast sensitivity and optical
      aberrations for up to 30 minutes after administration into the tear layer of normal and dry
      eye subjects. A questionnaire will also be used to determine the opinions of the subjects
      concerning this new artificial tear.
