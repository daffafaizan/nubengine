      study in 6 healthy adult male participants to characterize the absorption, metabolism and
      excretion of 14C-JNJ-63623872. The total study duration will be approximately of 16 days per
      participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study
      commences on Day 1); open-Label Treatment Phase(that is, Day 1); and Follow-up (that is, up
      to Day 16). All the eligible participants will receive 14C-JNJ-63623872 at a dose level of
      600 milligram. Participants will enter the study site on Day -1 and stay at the study site at
      least until Day 8. Urine, feces, whole blood samples, plasma, nasal mucus and saliva samples
      will be collected up to Day 8. Unchanged JNJ-63623872 will be determined in plasma and, if
      feasible, in saliva. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
