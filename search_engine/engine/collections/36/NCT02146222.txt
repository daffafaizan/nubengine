    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 (VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase
      inhibitor X-82) when administered in a 2 week on, 1 week off schedule (Cycle #1).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 administered in combination
      with docetaxel every 3 weeks (Cycle #2).

      III. To determine the change in vascular parameters using 3'Deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT)
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to X-82 alone (Cycle #1).

      IV. To determine the change in vascular parameters using FLT PET/CT to X-82 in combination
      with docetaxel (Cycle #2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of intermittent X-82 with docetaxel.

      II. To measure the change in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels with
      changes on FLT PET/CT.

      III. To measure changes in X-82 pharmacokinetics with changes on FLT PET/CT.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential X-82 with docetaxel in disease
      sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort) II. To evaluate the objective response rate of
      sequential X-82 with docetaxel in these disease sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive high dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 2-15. Beginning course 2, patients also receive docetaxel intravenously
      (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive low dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 PO QD on days 2-15
      and docetaxel IV as in Arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients receive VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 as in Arm I and
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
