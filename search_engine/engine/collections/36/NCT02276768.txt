      clinical study include the evaluation of visceral pain intensity under rectal distension
      following the oral administration of either of two doses of GIC-1001 or of either of two
      doses of GIC-1002, equimolar to the first formulation, or of placebo in 90 healthy subjects.

      The barostat intra-balloon pressure required to elicit pre-defined rectal sensory symptoms
      (i.e. first sensation, need to defecate, urgency to defecate and pain) will also be
      determined. Rectal sensory symptom ratings and rectal compliance under increased rectal
      distension will also be evaluated.

      The contribution of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to the colonic analgesic activity of GIC-1001 by
      comparison to that of GIC-1002 will be evaluated following steady state pharmacokinetic
      analysis. To further comprehend the non-linear, U shape dose response curve observed with
      GIC-1001 in a previous Phase II a trial.

      Finally, the safety of GIC-1002 in healthy volunteers will also be evaluated.
