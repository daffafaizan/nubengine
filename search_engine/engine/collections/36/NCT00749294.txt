      Hospital, and Bangrak Hospital. One hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled from both
      hospitals. Anogenital wart patients presented in Rajavithi General Hospital and the STI
      clinic at Bangrak Hospital will be recruited prospectively. All patients will be treated
      according to standard medical guidelines or usual care of the institutes. After the baseline
      assessment, the patients will have follow up visits with their physicians and will also be
      interviewed at the clinical sites three time approximately at day 7 (-2+7 days), month 1 (+-7
      days), and month 6 (+-7 days) until they are cure. At month 6 (+-14 days), telephone
