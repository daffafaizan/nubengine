      after surgery, and are associated with patients' dissatisfaction after anesthesia and
      surgery. Orthognathic surgery is widely performed for the correction of dentofacial
      deformities. Despite of improved anti-emetic prophylaxis, patients undergoing orthognathic
      surgery are reported to have a high incidence of PONV, especially those after bimaxillary
      surgery.

      It is known that activation of central cholinergic system plays an important role in the
      development of PONV. Muscarinic antagonists such as scopolamine can block muscarinic
      receptors in the cerebral cortex and produce anti-emetic effects. Penehyclidine is a new
      muscarinic antagonists which selectively block M1 and M3 receptors. Our previous study
      indicated that single-dose of penehyclidine injected before anesthesia induction was
      associated with a reduced risk of PONV during the first 6 h postoperatively.The mean
      elimination half-life of penehyclidine following single administration is about 10.35 h.
      Hence, a single-dose penehyclidine may only produce a short duration of antiemetic effect.

      The investigators hypothesize that continuously administrated penehyclidine during
      perioperative period reduces PONV more effectively than single-dose injection in patients
      undergoing bimaxillary surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of
      continuous administered penehyclidine in preventing PONV in patients undergoing bimaxillary
      surgery.
