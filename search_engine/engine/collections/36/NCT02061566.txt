      potentially devastating problems in clinical medicine. When kidneys lost their filtering
      function, a lot of dangerous metabolites were accumulated in the body, including urea,
      nitrogenous waste products and uremic toxins. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is an anionic uremic toxin
      that is accumulated in the serum of patients with uremia. In previous study, the
      investigators successfully induced AKI animal model. IS enhanced intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in IL-1β-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      (HUVECs) that this may play a critical role in the progression of AKI. However, the molecular
      mechanisms of ICAM-1 expression in IS-treated IL-1β-treated HUVECs need to be elucidated.
      HUVECs incubated with 0.2 or 1 mM IS for 24 h did not cause cytotoxicity. The IL-1β-induced
      ICAM-1 expression in HUVECs was significantly enhanced by IS pretreatment. Furthermore, the
      regulation of adhesion molecule expression involves a complex array of intracellular
      signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and transcriptional factors. A better understanding of this might provide
      important insights into the prevention of AKI.
