      incurable with conventional therapy. With an incidence of approximately 70,000 cases
      diagnosed in the United States (US) per year, the disease is rare.

      This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with bendamustine and
      rituximab. Patients will receive induction therapy with venetoclax, bendamustine and
      rituximab for six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). There will be an interim analysis after 19
      patients are enrolled to evaluate for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast
      breakdown of cancer cells which can lead to electrolyte and kidney problems.

      Tumor assessments will be performed after Cycle 3-4 and at end of induction therapy.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained in the course of standard biopsy
      or surgery) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available).

      Mandatory bone marrow aspirate (obtained in the course of standard biopsy) and peripheral
      blood sample will be collected at the end of treatment for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD).
      MRD measures the disease remaining after treatment. Optional peripheral blood samples will
      also be collected for future research.
