    
      Purpose of the Study: Determine the effect of deep vs low vs moderate hypothermia on
      neurocognitive function, brain functional connectivity, and leukocyte SUMOylation patterns
      after surgical circulatory arrest.

      Hypothesis: Deep hypothermia is superior to moderate hypothermia in reducing postoperative
      cognitive decline and preserving brain functional connectivity and that low hypothermia is
      non-inferior to deep hypothermia.

      Design and Procedures: 273 informed and consenting patients who are scheduled for elective
      proximal aortic reconstructive surgery (ascending aorta + aortic valve or root) with
      concomitant proximal hemi- or total arch replacement via median sternotomy will be randomized
      to deep (<20°C), low (20.1°C-24°C), or moderate (24.1°C-28°C) hypothermia during circulatory
      arrest. Cognitive testing using a standard battery will occur preoperatively (baseline), at 4
      weeks, and at 1 year after surgery. Neuroimaging procedures before surgery, and at 4 weeks
      and 1 year after surgery will consist of high-resolution anatomic, resting-state fMRI
      (rs-fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequences. To characterize leukocyte
      activation, whole blood will be drawn at 5 time points: at baseline (prior to surgery),
      before circulatory arrest, 10 minutes after reperfusion, 10 minutes after CPB, and 4 hours
      after CPB.
