        -  To evaluate the efficacy of flaxseed on hot flash scores in women with a history of
           breast cancer or other cancer or in women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for
           fear of increased risk of breast cancer as measured by a daily prospective hot flash
           diary.

        -  To evaluate the side effect profile of flaxseed in this population.

        -  To evaluate the effects of flaxseed on mood (per the Profile of Mood States) and broader
           menopausal symptoms (per the MENQOL), daily interference from hot flashes (per the
           HFRDIS), and perception of benefit (per Global Impression of Change).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years vs ≥ 50 years); treatment with
      tamoxifen citrate, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors (yes vs
      no); duration of hot flashes (≤ 9 months vs > 9 months); and daily frequency of hot flashes
      (4-9 vs ≥ 10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral flaxseed in the form of a bar similar to a granola bar once
           daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo bar once daily. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 6-12 weeks. Patients in arm II may crossover to receive treatment as in arm I after
           6 weeks.

      Patients complete questionnaires (Hot Flash Diary, Side Effect Experience Questionnaire,
      Profile of Mood States, Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, and Menopause Specific
      Quality of Life) at baseline and periodically during treatment. Patients are contacted by
      telephone at the end of weeks 2, 4, 5, and 7 to assess product tolerability, document
      compliance, encourage completion of questionnaires, and address problems.
