    
      This multi-center, phase II study will be conducted in two parts and assess the clinical
      benefit, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ulixertinib (BVD-523) in patients
      with advanced malignancies.

      Part A (tumor histology agnostic) will be open label and enroll patients to one of six groups
      based on their tumor alteration.

        -  Group 1: Patients with tumors, other than colorectal cancer (CRC), having a BRAF
           alteration that results in an amino acid change at positions G469, L485, or L597.

        -  Group 2: Patients with tumors, other than CRC, having a defined Class 2 BRAF alteration
           (see Appendix 2 of protocol).

        -  Group 3: Patients with tumors, other than CRC, having an atypical BRAF alteration (non
           V600) that is not specified in Group 1 or Group 2.

        -  Group 4: Patients with CRC having any atypical BRAF alteration.

        -  Group 5: Patients with tumors, other than CRC, harboring alterations in MEK1/2.

        -  Group 6: Patients with CRC harboring alterations in MEK1/2.

      Part B (tumor histology specific) will randomly enroll patients with one of up to three
      specified tumor histologies to receive either ulixertinib or the physician's choice of
      treatment in a 2:1 ratio. Tumors must harbor a specified MEK or atypical BRAF alteration. If
      a patient progresses on physician's choice of treatment, crossover to the ulixertinib arm is
      permitted.The specific histologies to be included in this part will be selected based on
      available data and discussion with the clinical investigators, the medical monitor, and the
      sponsor.
