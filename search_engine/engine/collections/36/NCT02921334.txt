      control group.In intervention group,tracheotomy is performed. And then, patient is switched
      to noninvasive ventilation by masking the tracheotomy tube. If the patient presents distress
      in noninvasive ventilation, he or she is switched to invasive ventilation. If the distress
      relieves, patient is switched to noninvasive ventilation again until the patient successfully
      weans from ventilator. In control group, the patient is weaned as the conventional methods.
