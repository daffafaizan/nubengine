        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan when administered with gemcitabine in
           patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the optimal dose and time interval for this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
