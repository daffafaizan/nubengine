      injectable collagen scaffold transvaginal injection for POF women. The serum of each patient
      was kept and sent for laboratory test before the surgery. HUC-MSCs were isolated and cultured
      in vitro and the biomarkers of HUC-MSCs were detected using Flow cytometry detection. The
      HUC-MSCs with injectable collagen scaffold were then injected directly into bilateral
      ovaries. The outcomes of patients were examined after the injection. The patients are
      monitored for signs of follicle growth and growing follicles are stimulated with exogenous
      hormones, followed by oocyte retrieval and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).
