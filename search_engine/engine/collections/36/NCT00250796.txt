    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and time to progression of the
      combination of thalidomide, alfa interferon, and octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) in patients
      with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. If patients are eligible for and agree to take
      part in the study, they will be assigned to one of two treatment arms depending on SSR
      status. If SSR status is positive or unknown, patients will receive oral doses of thalidomide
      starting at 200mg a day and increasing to 800mg at increments of 200 per week depending on
      tolerance. They will also receive injections three times a week of alpha interferon and
      monthly injections of octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) 30 mg into their buttocks muscle..

      If the patient SSR status is negative, patients will not be given subcutaneous injections of
      octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) but will receive the thalidomide and alfa interferon only.
