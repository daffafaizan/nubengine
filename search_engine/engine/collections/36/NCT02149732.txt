      Treatment: After cultivating autologous Oral mucosal epithelial cell sheet, the sheet will be
      transplanted to the ocular surface of the patients

           transplantation, or who has difficulty in receiving long-term immunosuppressive
           treatment

        3. patient who agree this clinical trial

        4. patient with the eyes in which best corrected visual acuity is less than counting finger

        5. patient who is older than sixteen year old

      Exclusion criteria

        1. patient who has relevant corneal transparency
