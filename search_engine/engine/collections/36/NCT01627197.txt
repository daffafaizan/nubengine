      were even as high as 50%-62%.Five-year disease-specific survival and OS rates in the
      organ-confined disease (defined as â‰¤pT3a) were 78.9% and 68%, respectively. For the
      non-organ-confined disease (defined as pT3b or higher), the rates were about 36.8% and 30.3%,
      respectively.Systemic chemotherapy can only prolong survival for up to 14.8 months, although
      with multiple severe adverse effects, such as neutrocytopenia, infection/sepsis, renal
      dysfunction, mucositis, or gastrointestinal toxicity. Additionally, the mortality rate
      associated with systemic chemotherapy was about 1%-4%.Therefore, the objective of our study
      was to determine if adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy with GC was able to reduce the
      systemic drug toxicities and yield a better clinical outcome.
