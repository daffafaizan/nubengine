    
      Enrollment has been completed for the randomized portion of the study with ongoing evaluation
      of tumor response and safety. No additional subjects will be randomized or receive interferon
      gamma (IFN-γ).

      The non-randomized portion of the study is open for screening and enrollment. Eligible
      subjects will receive a single intratumoral injection of DNX-2401 into a recurrent
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma brain tumor using the Alcyone MEMS Cannula (AMC™) System
      (cannula). Tumor response and safety will be evaluated.

      After receiving DNX-2401, subjects will return to the clinic for study visits at regular
      intervals for safety monitoring, MRI scans and other assessments for up to 18 months.
      Thereafter, they will be followed closely for safety and survival.
