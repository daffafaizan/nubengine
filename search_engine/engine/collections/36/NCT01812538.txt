      4-way crossover study evaluating the effect of DIC075V on QTc intervals in healthy subjects.
      Two doses of DIC075V are tested and include moxifloxicin as a positive control and normal
      saline as the placebo arm. On 4 separate occasions separated by at least 72 hours, subjects
      are given single IV or oral (moxifloxicin) treatments. ECGs are acquired from a continuous
      Holter monitor and selected timepoints will be evaluated. These ECGs will be 15 seconds in
      duration and extracted in triplicate. Monitoring will continue for 24 hours with each
      treatment. The primary ECG endpoint is the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Fridericia
      correction (QTcF). Secondary endpoints include the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Bazett
      correction formula (QTcB). In addition, a population-specific regression model will be
      constructed with QT plotted against RR (the time elapsed between 2 consecutive R-waves).
      Finally, QT parameters are explored graphically in relation to PK variables Cmax, Tmax and
      AUC.
