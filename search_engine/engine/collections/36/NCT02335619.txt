      according to whether or not they have clinics scheduled on 2 specific half days each week, to
      coincide with PSMPC clinics. New patients attending the specified clinics under each
      oncologist will be automatically fall under whichever group their oncologist has been
      assigned. Control patients will be those seen at clinics other than the 2 specified
      intervention clinics.

      Patients will be approached for study participation in the waiting room of the GI clinic as
      they await their first oncology appointment. Those who agree to participate will be asked to
      complete a symptom assessment questionnaire at baseline and once a month for 4 months. This
      timing is meant to coincide with their regularly scheduled follow up appointments with the GI
      oncologist.

      Symptom scores from the completed assessment forms will be entered into a study database,
      created with the BC Cancer Agency IDs of the study participants alongside an anonymized study
      ID.
