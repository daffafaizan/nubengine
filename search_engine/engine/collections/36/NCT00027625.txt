        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib when given in combination with
           temozolomide in patients with malignant primary glioma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gefitinib. Patients are stratified
      according to use of concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-35 and oral temozolomide once daily on
      days 8-12 for the first course only. For the second and subsequent courses, patients receive
      oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28 and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3-6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-14
      months.
