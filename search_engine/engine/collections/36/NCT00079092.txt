      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma
           treated with thalidomide and procarbazine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral procarbazine once daily on days 1-5 and oral thalidomide once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then before every odd course.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
