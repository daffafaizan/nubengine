      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on hematopoietic recovery in patients with
      hematologic malignancies. II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the frequency of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in these patients after this
      therapy. IV. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of donor leukocyte infusions at relapse in
      these patients. V. Determine the response rates and survival of these patients after this
      therapy. VI. Determine the immune reconstitution of patients undergoing this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -9 to -5, cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on day -5, and antithymocyte globulin IV over 10 hours on days -5 to -2.
      Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients who achieve complete
      remission (CR) and then relapse or patients who achieve less than a CR before day 60 receive
      donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) over 30 minutes. DLI are repeated as necessary for persistent
      disease. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, then at 1 and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
