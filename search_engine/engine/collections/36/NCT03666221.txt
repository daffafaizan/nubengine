      nasopharyngeal cancer, which was significantly higher than radiotherapy alone. The efficacy
      of radiotherapy combined with Nimotuzumab has not been confirmed in recurrent nasopharyngeal
      cancer.In this study, Phase II clinical trials were performed. The patients were treated with
      Nimotuzumab which were used concurrently with IMRT. The efficacy and toxicity will be
      assessed.
