      effect of treatment on sexual functioning in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 352 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 10 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Paroxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet/capsule, daily, orally for up to 5 weeks.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study is approximately 7 weeks. Participants will be contacted by telephone 2 weeks
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
