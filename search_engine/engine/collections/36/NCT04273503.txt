      activities and application of a community toolkit for healthy weight loss delivered by
      trained interventionists from Hispanic and Somali communities to their social networks. Using
      a pre-post study design, 4 social networks of adults with approximately 32 network
      participants will receive the intervention. Primary outcomes, measured 3 months after
      implementation, will include feasibility measures of acceptability, implementation, and
      practicality. Secondary outcomes will include BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure,
      fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, physical activity level, dietary change, and
      health-related quality of life.

      Eligibility criteria include (1) self-identification as Hispanic or Somali, (2) member of an
      HPs social network, (3) ageâ‰¥18 and <65 (4) willingness to participate in all aspects of the
      study; and (5) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria include (1) pregnancy at the
      time of enrollment and (2) serious medical conditions or disabilities that would make
      physical activity difficult.

      We will test how best to integrate a social network intervention within an existing
      evidence-based regional health promotion infrastructure (WellConnect) that will enhance its
      potential dissemination and community-wide uptake
