      systematic review has shown that no trial comparing the effectiveness (utility) of 2nd-tier
      NIPS with that of first-tier NIPS has been published . Further it is important for health
      care decision makers to have evidence produced in Canada since the geographical context of
      healthcare can affect uptake as well as patient decision and thus their healthcare
      trajectories. There is a need for a trial that is between an explanatory trial and a
      pragmatic trial to provide the types of answer that we aim to document in the present state
      of knowledge on NIPS-based screening strategies in Canada. Our Objective is to perform a
      pan-Canadian large-scale comparative utility (clinical outcomes) study of first-tier NIPS
      (expanded or not) as compared to the new standard of care (NIPS as a 2nd tier test performed
      much later during pregnancy and only in high risk pregnancies).
