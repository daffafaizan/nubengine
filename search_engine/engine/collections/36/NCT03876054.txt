      are representative of the real-world use of these devices. Enrollment caps will be
      implemented to ensure patients from approved indications are represented. Individuals who are
      scheduled to receive an implantable Abbott neurostimulation system are eligible for study
      consideration. The study will enroll up to 2,000 subjects from up to 100 participating
      centers. Subject enrollment is expected to be completed within 7 years; subjects will be
      followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 13 years, including
      enrollment, data collection from all subjects, and study close out.
