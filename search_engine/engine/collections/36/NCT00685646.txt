        -  Evaluate the time to treatment failure in prostatic cancer patients with metastatic bone
           disease receiving maximum androgen-blockade therapy with vs without zoledronic acid.

        -  Evaluate the time to first skeletal-related events in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the overall survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the extent of disease on bone scan in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pain scale and FACES pain-rating scale in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive maximum androgen-blockade therapy and zoledronic acid for up to
           24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive maximum androgen-blockade therapy for up to 24 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
