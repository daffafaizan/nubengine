      epinephrine per 1.0 cc of Belotero in the treatment of etched-in fine facial lines. 30 adults
      scheduled to have blended Belotero injected into fine lines of the cutaneous lip, and/or
      radial cheek area, and/or nasolabial folds, and/or melolabial folds, and/or forehead will be
      evaluated. The blended Belotero will be injected intradermally into these etched-in fine
      lines. The patients will be given diary cards to document potential adverse events. 2 weeks
      after receiving injections of the blended Belotero the subjects will return to have
      photographs taken, have their treated fine lines evaluated, and complete a self assessment
      questionnaire. Touch-up injections are common clinical practice and if additional touch-ups
      would improve their result, those subjects can be re-treated at this visit. Those subjects
      who are touched up will return to the clinic for an additional follow up visit and
      photographs 2 weeks later. All subjects will return to the clinic 12 weeks and 24 weeks after
      their last injection for photographs and evaluations. Improvement assessments will be made by
      investigator ratings at each visit. Investigator ratings for the cutaneous lip and the
      forehead area are based on the Merz Aesthetic Validated Assessment Scales. Investigator
      ratings for the radial cheek area, nasolabial folds, and melolabial folds are based on the
      Validated Lemperle Facial Wrinkle Scales.
