      Fifteen (15) patients will be randomized to receive active study medication and 5 patients
      will be randomized to receive vehicle control. After undergoing screening procedures,
      potential patients will enter a 14 day baseline phase where baseline data will be collected.
      Pending successful completion of the baseline phase, patient will enter a 28-day treatment
      phase where they will be randomized to receive either once daily subcutaneous injections of
      E1 plus G1, as separate injections or once daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle control
      (as 2 separate injections). Patients will receive once daily doses in the morning after
      breakfast for a period of 28 days. Upon completion of treatment, all patients will continue
      in the follow-up phase for an additional 6 months and will return to the clinic for monthly
      visits. Throughout the study, patients will remain on their insulin regimen and will maintain
      a diary record of insulin intake and blood glucose levels.

      Pancreatic beta cell function or insulin secretion is best measured by determination of
      c-peptide (which is co-secreted with insulin in a 1:1 ratio). An arginine stimulated
      c-peptide test will therefore be performed at frequent intervals during the study. Patients
      will be injected with a solution containing arginine, a normal constituent of food that
      increases insulin release from beta cells into the blood. After the injection seven blood
      samples for c-peptide tests will be collected over 10 minutes.
