    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine toxicity profile of the combination of anti-AXL fusion protein AVB-S6-500
      (AVB-S6 -500) and durvalumab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective response rate to combination AVB-S6-500 and durvalumab therapy.

      II. To estimate the median immune-related progression free survival (irPFS) as well as
      overall survival (OS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 after
      treatment with combination durvalumab and AVB-S6-500.

      III. To investigate molecular and immunological changes associated with the combination of
      AVB-S6-500 and durvalumab; specifically to describe changes in T cell populations (including
      but not limited to CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3) and cell proliferation, as well as report changes in
      the proportion of macrophage phenotypes M1 and M2 (with phenotypic markers potentially
      including arginase1, CD11b, PDL-1, and CD206).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate blood and tissue based biomarkers for immune related adverse events and
      disease progression.

      II. To investigate impact and possible sensitization of pretreatment with AVB-S6-500
      monotherapy on subsequent combination of durvalumab and AVB-S6-500.

      III. To evaluate for molecular and immunologic differences between pre-treatment with single
      agent AVB-S6-500 as compared to durvalumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation of anti-AXL fusion protein AVB-S6-500, followed
      by a phase II study. In Phase I, patients receive both anti-AXL fusion protein AVB-S6-500
      (intravenously [IV] over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15) and durvalumab (IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1) every cycle.

      In Phase II, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive anti-AXL fusion protein AVB-S6-500 IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 15,
      and 29 of cycle 0, and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Beginning cycle 1, patients
      also receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycle 0 continues for 6 weeks and
      subsequent cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 22 of cycle 0 and on day
      1 of subsequent cycles. Beginning cycle 1, patients also receive anti-AXL fusion protein
      AVB-S6-500 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycle 0 continues for 6 weeks and subsequent
      cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for at least 90
      days.
