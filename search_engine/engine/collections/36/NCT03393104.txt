      than using either MCE or PE alone following 8-weeks of therapeutic session, at 3-month
      follow-up.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of three intervention groups that include
      MCE plus PE group, MCE group, or PE group using a block random technique based on an
      electronic randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment
      of all clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline, 8 weeks after randomization and at 3
      months follow up.

      Primary outcomes will be functional disability and pain intensity. Secondary outcomes will be
      quality of life, fear-avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophizing, global perceived recovery and
      physical performance (finger-floor test, repeated sit-to-stand test, and the 50-foot walk
      test) Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and post hoc tests. All
      statistical analyses will be performed on IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY,
      USA) at alpha level of 0.05.
