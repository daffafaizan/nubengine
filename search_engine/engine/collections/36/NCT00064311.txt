        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of ravuconazole for the prevention of invasive
           fungal infections in patients undergoing non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this drug, in terms of frequency of
           breakthrough fungal infections and requirement for empirical antifungal therapy, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on concurrently administered cyclosporine in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug with and without cyclosporine in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral ravuconazole once daily beginning within 48 hours of the chemotherapy
      preparative regimen and before the initiation of cyclosporine. Treatment continues until
      blood counts recover in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 8 patients receive escalating doses of ravuconazole until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 8
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
