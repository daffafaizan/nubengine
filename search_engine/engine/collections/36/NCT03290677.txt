      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved each aspect of this therapy,
      however this research study is unique because it combines them as a treatment option for the
      participant's disease. That has not been approved by the FDA.

      In this research study, The investigators are...

        -  Continuing the participant on the participant's immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy even
           though the participant's doctor believes that the participant's cancer is growing. Since
           the participant's cancer is growing, there is only a small chance the participant will
           respond to continued drug therapy.

        -  Taking a biopsy of the participant's cancer to confirm there is cancer growing in the
           location to be treated.

        -  Performing cryoablation on an enlarging tumor. This involves passing a special needle
           into the participant's body (cryoprobe) to freeze tumor and kill a small part (not all)
           of the participant's cancer. Your immune system will respond to the damage caused by
           freezing part of the participant's tumor.

        -  The investigators are hoping to demonstrate that combining post-progression immune
           checkpoint inhibitor therapy with cryoablation is safe, and may induce and/or restore an
           immune response to cancer in other places in the participant's body
