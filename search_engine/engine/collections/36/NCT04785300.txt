      related neurodegenerative disorders are largely unknown. Aging is the major risk factor for
      AD. Moreover, individuals with AD suffer from significantly more co-morbid conditions than
      demographically matched older adults. This study is an open-label pilot study of intermittent
      administration of the senolytic drug regimen Dasatinib (D) + Quercetin (Q) in symptomatic
      adults over 55 with clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's
      biomarker positivity by tau-PET.
