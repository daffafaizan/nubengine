      as high as 90%. However, the relatively high rate of complications such as pneumothorax,
      hemoptysis, pulmonary hemorrhage, severe chest pain, and bad tolerance in patients limits its
      application.

      EBUS-GS is an emerging technology, Kurimoto in 2004 performed transbronchial lung
      biopsy(TBLB) assisted by EBUS-GS, and the sensitivity of diagnosing lung cancer was 81%, and
      it was proved to be a safe procedure with very small amount of pneumothorax and hemoptysis.

      Till now there is only one randomized controlled study comparing the diagnostic value of
      CT-TTNB and EBUS-GS; however, it did not complete the enrollment of patients on schedule. In
      addition, all the other studies were retrospective. Hence this prospective study was
      performed to determine the diagnostic value and safety of EBUS-GS and CT-TTNB for PPLs.
