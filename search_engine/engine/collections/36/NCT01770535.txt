      patients don't respond to this treatment. As with any chemotherapy, paclitaxel is associated
      with unpleasant side effects. We are doing this study to try and understand what is happening
      in cancer cells in different individuals after paclitaxel treatment that make them respond
      differently to the same treatment. We hope that this study will enable us to develop a method
      to identify women who are suitable for this form of treatment. We also want to understand why
      some cancer cells don't get killed with paclitaxel. This information will help us to select
      treatment to suit an individual patient, and thus improve the outcome of treatment and avoid
      giving treatment that will not benefit the patient.
