      side effects. This study attempts to determine which drug is more efficacious as prophylaxis
      against PCP in patients who cannot tolerate trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

      Patients are evenly divided between two treatment arms to receive either aerosolized
      pentamidine every 4 weeks or dapsone orally three times weekly. Follow-up data is collected
      every 3 months, and patients are clinically evaluated every 6 months. Patients who develop
      PCP or a severe or persistent study drug toxicity may be switched to the alternative study
      drug at the clinician's discretion. Average duration of follow-up is 2 years.
