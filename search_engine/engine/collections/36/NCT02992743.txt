    
      This is an open label pilot study of gene modified autologous T cells for the treatment of
      advanced myxoid/ round cell liposarcoma or high-grade myxoid liposarcoma.

      Subjects with the HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 allele, whose tumor expresses
      the NY-ESO-1 antigen and who meet study entry criteria will be eligible for enrollment.
      Following enrollment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis for collection of autologous cells
      for processing and manufacture into the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell investigational product.

      Leukapheresis is performed to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T
      cells. When the manufactured NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will undergo
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by a single
      infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T (transduced cell range: 1 to 8 billion cells) that will be
      administered on Day 1.
