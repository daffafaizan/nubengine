      belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. Invega is approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Initial data suggest a promising role for
      Invega in the treatment of bipolar disorder with minimal adverse events of weight gain. We
      propose to study the safety and efficacy of Invega therapy in children and adolescents with
      Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder. The study results will be used to
      generate hypotheses for a larger, randomized, controlled clinical trial with explicit
      hypotheses and sufficient statistical power.

      The proposed study includes 1) use of a 8-week design to document the response rate, 2)
      assessment of the impact of Invega on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial
      function) and cognition, and 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.
