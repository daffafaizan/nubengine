    
      This is a single-center, open-label, exploratory, prospective study. Among patients who
      undergo coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) prior to TAVR, those with moderate or
      severe stenotic lesions will be included in the study. Patients from whom consent is obtained
      following TAVR will be enrolled in the study.

      Among patients who undergo TAVR at the Kobe University Hospital from September 2018 to March
      2022, those who are found to have moderate or severe stenosis on cCTA performed before
      surgery and judged to clinically require ischemia evaluation will be included in the study.
      At the time of pre-TAVR coronary angiogram, iFR (iFR before TAVR) will be measured. The cCTA
      data collected from patients whose consent is obtained following TAVR will be anonymized and
      sent to HeartFlow, Inc., where the FFRctï¼ˆFFRct before TAVR) values will be calculated using
      their cardiovascular dynamics analysis program. FFR (FFR after TAVR) and iFR (iFR after TAVR)
      will be measured using a guide wire that is capable of sensing pressure after TAVR is
      performed. Furthermore, FFRct (FFRct after TAVR) is calculated from cCTA taken after TAVR.
