      purchase traditional behavioral health and non-traditional services in order to remain
      outside of institutional settings. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
      this model on participant outcomes, service costs, and user satisfaction among people with
      serious mental illness. Adults with serious mental illness served in the Texas public health
      system will be randomly assigned to SDC versus services as usual and assessed at baseline,
      12-month, and 24-month follow-up. Mixed effects random-regression analysis will test for
      longitudinal changes in outcomes between the two study conditions. Differences in service
      costs will be analyzed using generalized linear models with negative binomial and
      zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Non-traditional expenditures by the SDC
      participants will be examined descriptively. Service satisfaction in both study conditions
      will be assessed at one- and two-year follow-up.
