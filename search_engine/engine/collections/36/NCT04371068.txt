      arthroplasty. Identification of the causal organism is crucial for successful treatment.
      However, microbiological diagnosis of PJIs remains a challenge notably because bacteria are
      embedded in biofilm adhered to the material. Recently, dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment of
      prosthesis has been proposed as a new strategy to dislodge bacteria from biofilm, thus
      becoming an alternative to sonication to improve the yield of the microbiological diagnosis.

      In this study, the investigators evaluate the interest of a commercial device using DTT, the
      MicroDTTect system (Heraeus, Hanau, Allemagne), for the diagnosis of low-grade chronic PJIs
      compared to the conventional culture of periprosthetic tissue (PPT) samples.
