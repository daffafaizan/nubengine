      exercise program compared to treatment-as-usual in subjects with a moderate or severe
      depressive episode in the context of unipolar depression or bipolar affective disorders.
      Numerous previous studies suggest that exercise may help to improve the symptoms of
      depression. Moreover, exercise was shown to enhance neuroplasticity in adults whereas
      depression results in decreased neuroplasticity. Here, we aim at elucidating whether a newly
      developed supervised, Internet-based, individualized exercise program of the Institute of
      Sports Science and the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University Mainz is
      more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than treatment-as-usual. Furthermore, this
      study will clarify if severely depressed subjects are able to adhere to an internet-based
      exercise therapy.
