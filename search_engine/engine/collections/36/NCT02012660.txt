      population of adult patients admitted in the emergency department of a primary and tertiary
      care teaching urban hospital. We will compare the prevalence of hyponatremia between summer
      and winter periods. We will describe the types of observed hyponatremia and describe the
      characteristics of the patients suffering of moderate to severe hyponatremia.
