    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and economic effectiveness of a
      pharmacogenomic (PGx) approach to prescribing medications in patients with high-risk
      polypharmacy in an integrated healthcare delivery system.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients who receive the RightMedÂ® PGx test from OneOme, LLC
      with subsequent counseling of their prescribers by a study pharmacist, as needed, on the
      appropriateness of their prescribed medications will experience lower one-year follow-up
      healthcare utilization and expenditures compared to control patients who receive usual care.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Healthcare expenditures: 6- and 12-month changes in total healthcare expenditures from
           the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) perspective

        2. Healthcare utilization: 6- and 12-month changes in hospitalizations, emergency room
           visits, medical office visits, and telephone encounters

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Medication changes: Counts of 6-month medication and/or dose adjustments in targeted
           medications

        2. Medication congruence: Description of counts of RightMed test recommendations accepted
           by prescribers

        3. Medication adherence: 6- and 12-month changes in percent of days (PDC) covered for
           targeted medications

        4. Pharmacy expenditures: 6- and 12-month changes in outpatient prescription medication
           expenditures from the KPCO perspective
