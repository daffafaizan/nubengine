      damaged brain changes over the first 12-months post stroke. The prevalence and severity of
      stroke related arm disability is increasing and the prospect of optimal recovery is poor.
      Studies have demonstrated that stroke survivors with severe disability lack early indicators
      (<7-days to <1-month post-stroke) of a good prognosis, such as active movement at the
      shoulder and wrist and integrity of the corticospinal tract. This has propagated the clinical
      belief that this cohort are unlikely to functionally benefit from rehabilitation efforts.
      However, it is possible that indicators of potential for recovery - either neuroanatomical or
      clinical - may present in individuals with severe stroke later, that is beyond the early
      time-period. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of the potential for ongoing improvements
      in motor performance in response to intensive interventions that are undertaken 6-months or
      more post-stroke. This therefore, implies that there is some degree of untapped recovery
      potential. However, as very few studies have longitudinally explored the potential indicators
      of recovery in a severe cohort, the dynamic capacity of the severely damaged remains unknown.
      Thus, there is a need to determine 'who recovers', 'who does not recover', and 'why' to be
      able to promote optimal arm recovery in people with severe impairment after stroke. We will
      assess stroke survivors <4-weeks, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months post stroke using a range
      of neuroimaging and clinical outcome measures. The findings from this study will build the
      foundations for more personalized health care options for people with severe arm impairment
      post stroke.
