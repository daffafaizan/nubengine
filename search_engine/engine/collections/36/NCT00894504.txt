      reduce skin toxicity. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 14 days (2 weeks). During each
      treatment, panitumumab will be administered first, then carboplatin, then gemcitabine. All
      drugs will be administered according to standard guidelines. Patients will be re-evaluated
      for response after completion of 3 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment. Patients with objective
      response or stable disease will continue treatment. Subsequent re-evaluations will occur
      every 6 weeks. Patients will continue treatment with all three drugs until tumor progression,
      or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. If patients experience toxicity caused by
      gemcitabine/carboplatin and are continuing to benefit from treatment, panitumumab can be
      continued as a single agent (at the same dose and schedule), at the discretion of the
      investigator, until disease progression occurs.
