      be randomly allocated to dexmedetomidine group or control group. Patients from both groups
      will receive midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, remifentanil and CIS atracurium for total
      intravenous anesthesia. BIS value will be controlled between 40-60 during surgery. Patients
      of dexmedetomidine group will receive a loading does of 1ug/kg dexmedetomidine since 15 mins
      before induction, and receive another 1ug/kg of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.5ug/kg/h for 2
      continuous hours during surgery. Patients of control group will receive same amount of normal
      saline. Serum will be collected from patients of both groups at before induction and 1h
      post-surgery. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line will be treated with patient serum from both
      groups. The effects of dexmedetomidine on cellular proliferation, migration and metastasis
      will be measured.
