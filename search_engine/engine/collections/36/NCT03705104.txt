      experience moderate-to-severe chronic pain, i.e., pain having lasted more than 3 months.
      Chronic pain is also the most common cause of sick leave and disability pension in Norway.
      Despite a clear request from the authorities, e-health interventions for chronic pain has not
      yet been tested and implemented.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an interactive e-health intervention
      for people living with chronic pain, using outcome measures such as pain intensity, pain
      acceptance, anxiety/depression and quality of life.

      The e-health intervention will first be tested in a pilot study with 50 patients with
      different pain diagnoses and eventually in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 240
      patients with different pain diagnoses. The intervention will consist of one face-to-face
      introductory group followed by 9 app-based modules containing cognitive behavioral pain
      self-management material. The 9 modules will be distributed over minimum 27 days (minimum 3
      days per module). The participants in the randomized controlled trial will be randomly
      assigned to use the e-health intervention or to a treatment as usual control group. . Both
      groups will receive outcome measures at baseline, immediately post intervention (or maximum 8
      weeks), at 6 months and at 12 months.
