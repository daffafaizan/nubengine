      kg/m2), sedentary men and women, all of whom will undergo a 9-month Weight Loss (WL)
      intervention (6-mo intensive phase and 3-mo reduced contact phase), followed by a 9-month
      self-managed follow-up phase with minimal contact, to test our overall hypothesis that
      intervening on Sedentary Behavior (SitLess) will enhance long-term Weight Loss in this age
      group. The diet element of the intervention is identical across groups, but groups differ by
      activity intervention: 1) structured, moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise (EX) (WL+EX); 2)
      intervening on SB throughout the day (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess).
