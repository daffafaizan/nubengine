    
      Melan-Cohort should constitute the first multicentric cohort with various objectives:
      prognostic, therapeutic, cognitive and medico-economical studies on melanoma. Patients will
      be recruited in all of the dermatology departments of APHP (dermatology departments from
      AMBROISE PARE, Saint-Louis, BICHAT-Claude Bernard,Henri-Mondor, Cochin-Tarnier, and Tenon
      hospitals). For all included patients, a standard file is filled comprising all
      anatomy-clinical useful data and epidemiologic ones, including sun exposures. Blood is
      harvested to collect DNA, RNA, serum, plasma at inclusion and at regular intervals and in
      case of progressive disease. Procedures for sentinel lymph node biopsies have been
      homogenized. An informed consent is obtained for each patient included in the cohort. A
      steering committee meets on a regular basis, and genetics or pathology subgroups have been
      constituted. An electronic CRF is available using the Intranet of APHP hospitals. Specimens
      are stored using high quality standards.
