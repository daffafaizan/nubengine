      developed in collaboration with CMT experts, Patient Advocacy Organizations (PAOs) and the
      biopharmaceutical company Pharnext.

      Eligible participants install a study app on their smartphone. Researchers access aggregated,
      anonymised data via a cloud-based research portal.

      The platform provides benefits to participants, which it is hoped will encourage persistence
      with data submission; these include options to upload electronic documents such as scans, a
      clinically-validated Knowledge feature, and access an online CMT community.

      The aggregated data are available in close to real time via "dashboards" and can be analysed
      according to a number of pre-set criteria (e.g. disease stage, age, geographic location).

      State-of-the-art technologies and security policies are used in the platform to ensure
      industry-standard data storage and privacy for all users. Participants' personally
      identifiable information will remain confidential at all times, and researchers will not be
      able to identify individuals.

      The study is ethics-approved in all scope countries and led by a Scientific Advisory Board
      comprising representatives from international patient associations, patients and key opinion
      leaders from each country, and study leads from both Pharnext Société Anonyme (SA) and
      Vitaccess Ltd.
