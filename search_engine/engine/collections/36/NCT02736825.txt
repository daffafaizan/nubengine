    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, parallel arm,
      non-inferiority, pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultherapy
      treatment with prototype 2 simulines transducers (4-3.0 Smm and 4-4.5 Smm) at energy level
      (EL) 2 is non-inferior to treatment with standard transducers (7-3.0 mm and 4-4.5mm) at EL 2
      for lifting the lower face and neck and to demonstrate the safety of treatment with prototype
      2 simulines transducers is similar to treatment with standard transducers.

      Changes from baseline in quantitative measures of neck and submental lift will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, Merz Jawline Grading Scale
      scores, 3D volumetric changes from baseline to post treatment, patient satisfaction and
      patient-reported improvement will be obtained.
