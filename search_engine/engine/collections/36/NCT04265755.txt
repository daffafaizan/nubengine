      response to erenumab and genetic biomarkers.

      Subjects with episodic or chronic migraine will be treated with Erenumab 70mg or 140mg for a
      4-week baseline/screening period, followed by a 24-week treatment period.

      Subjects will collect migraine-related parameters daily using an eDiary and blood samples
      will be collected for biomarker research. All analysis will be descriptive in nature.
