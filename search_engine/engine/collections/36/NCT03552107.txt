      chart review. The primary endpoint will be weight change in patients on Lorcaserin and
      average duration of Lorcaserin treatment over time (up to 1 year). Secondary endpoints will
      include changes in vital signs, liver function, glucose, and lipids. In addition, time on
      treatment, reasons for discontinuation of medication, and changes in healthcare utilization
      (to include inpatient and outpatient utilization) will be examined. This is a retrospective,
      one-arm observational study that will include chart reviews of 157 patients who have been
      treated in the clinic.
