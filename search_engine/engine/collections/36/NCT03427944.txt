      dobesilate is known as microcirculation protective agent, the investigators will further
      study its effect of non dialysis patients with chronic renal failure and explore the
      feasibility of calcium dobesilate in treatment of renal microvascular injury, the
      investigators will provide new ideas and theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment
      of chronic renal failure.
