      of three motor-related white matter fibers according to the BDNF genotype from 2 weeks to 3
      months after stroke onset; one is a the majority of fibers from M1 to medullary oblongata
      (CST), another is the intrahemispheric connection from M1 to ventral premotor cortex (M1PMv),
      and the other is the interhemispheric connection between bilateral M1s (CC). There were also
      to investigate the relationships between motor impairment and tract-related FA of white
      matter tracts in each BDNF genotype
