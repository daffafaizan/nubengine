      drugs, repeated botulinum toxin applications or intrathecal baclofen to reduce spasticity and
      increase functionality. During the Covid-19 pandemic period, these patients could not come to
      their controls due to reasons such as difficulty in reaching the doctor, fear of infection
      transmission, could not continue physiotherapy, repeated botulinum toxin applications could
      not be performed and necessary operations could not be performed. In this cross sectional
      study, investigator aimed to analyzed the effect of Covid-19 pandemic on the
      physical-psychosocial and cognitive state of the children, to benefit form the health,
      education services and the caregiver's quality of life with telemedicine.
