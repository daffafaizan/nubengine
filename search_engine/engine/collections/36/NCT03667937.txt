      case of venous ulcers, it is estimated that more than 80% of these wounds may be colonized or
      infected by bacteria, which is associated with its chronification by delaying the healing
      process.

      The most widespread therapeutic strategy in routine clinical practice is the use of silver
      dressings, due to its high antimicrobial power, although the effectiveness of these in venous
      ulcers is not supported by solid evidence. In addition, there are some uncertainties about
      the possible adverse effects of systemic absorption of silver molecules, as well as bacterial
      resistance to silver and the high cost associated with prolonged treatments.

      In this sense, a novel method to deal with this problem is the use of dressings with high
      hydrophobic power, such as CUTIMEDÂ®.
