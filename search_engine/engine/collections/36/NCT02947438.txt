    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group two arm study to establish
      the therapeutic equivalence, safety and tolerability of EPIAO® as compared to EPREX® in the
      treatment of CKD related anaemia in subjects who are on haemodialysis. A total of 264
      subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment arm A will receive
      EPIAO® 1-3 times a week, intravenously for period of 52 weeks and treatment arm B will
      receive EPREX, 1-3 times a week, intravenously for period of 52 weeks.
