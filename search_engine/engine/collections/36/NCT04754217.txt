    
      The VG-PMCF has a multicenter, observational, two group design in which 260 implanted
      subjects will be prospectively followed through 5 years after implant of an Abbott Valved
      Graft device in 2 groups:

      Group 1: VAVGJ (N=200), including implants of VAVGJ in native or prosthetic valves Group 2:
      CAVGJ (N=60), including implants of CAVGJ in native (n=30 subjects) or prosthetic (n=30
      subjects) valves

      Study enrollment will occur at up to 30 global centers. The study will enroll patients
      expected to be implanted with an Abbott Valved Graft who meet all other study eligibility
      requirements.

      Subjects will be followed for 5 years post-implant. Study visits or data collection will
      occur at baseline, implant, discharge, and annually post-implant. In-office visits will occur
      at 1-, 3- and 5-years post-implant, and telephone follow-up will occur at 2 years and 4 years
      post-implant.
