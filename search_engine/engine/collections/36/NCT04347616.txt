      leukemia (AML) exploiting administration of ex vivo-generated allogeneic natural killer (NK)
      cells with preceding non-myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy with or without subsequent
      in vivo IL-2 cytokine support.

      This is a prospective phase I/IIa study. The first phase is a IL-2 dose-escalating safety
      study in nine patients. The second phase of the study is designed as a Simon's optimal
      two-stage single-arm phase IIa study, comprising eighteen patients. Prior to NK cell
      infusion, all patients will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Cy/Flu) based
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy. On day 0, all patients will receive a fixed dose of 1.0-3.0 x
      10^9 allogeneic umbilical cord blood-derived NK cells (UCB-NK cells). These cells are
      generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from an allogeneic UCB
      unit.

      In phase I of the study patients will receive UCB-NK cells without subcutaneous (SC) IL-2,
      with lower dose SC IL-2 or with higher dose SC IL-2 (n=3 per treatment group). After
      establishing the safety of UCB-NK cells combined with SC IL-2, we will continue with phase
      IIa of the study, with eight patients in the first stage (including the three patients from
      phase I with comparable IL-2 dose) and if clinical efficacy is achieved an additional ten
      patients in the second stage.
