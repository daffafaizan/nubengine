      the advance of the timing of sleep to earlier hours, often earlier than desired. These
      age-related changes are found in even healthy individuals who are not taking medications and
      who are free from sleep disorders. In addition to these sleep disturbances, many older
      individuals curtail their sleep voluntarily, reporting similar rates of sleep restriction
      (sleeping less than 7 or less than 6 hours per night) when compared to young adults. Whether
      voluntary or not, insufficient sleep has medical, safety and metabolic consequences. In fact,
      converging evidence in young adults suggests that sleep restriction per se may impair
      metabolism, and that reduced sleep duration is associated with weight gain, obesity,
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. An understanding of how the circadian and
      sleep homeostatic neurobiological processes responds to increasing homeostatic sleep
      pressure, and the effects of sleep restriction on metabolism at different ages, should
      provide information on the regulation of sleep and metabolism in aging, as well as direction
      for future treatments. In the present study, we will study the separate impacts of chronic
      sleep restriction (while minimizing circadian disruption) and chronic circadian disruption
      (while minimizing sleep disruption) and a poor diet on metabolism.
