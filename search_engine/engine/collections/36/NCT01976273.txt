      diagnosed with at least a 2X2 cm patch of melasma on each side of their face (forehead or
      cheek). Starting at 2 weeks before treatment (week 2), both sides will be pretreated and
      primed with 4% hydroquinone with, if necessary, 2.5% hydrocortisone cream BID. On the
      treatment day (2-weeks) and 6-weeks one half of the subject's face will receive glycolic acid
      peels and the other half of the face will receive 1064nm Q-switch laser. This study is a
      pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.
