      Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Patients will be screened for
      eligibility for up to 28 days prior to entry into the study. The starting dose will be 2.5
      mg/day (once daily). The period for DLT assessment is 21 days from the first dose of FN-1501.
      Evaluation of a cohort of at least three (3) patients completing DLT assessment at any given
      dose level is required prior to determining the next dose level and dose regimen for the
      subsequent cohort.

      After the first patient in the cohort receives the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose, subsequent patients
      in that cohort will not be dosed until the first patient has been evaluated for at least 48
      hours to exclude unexpected acute toxicity. The continuous safety evaluation will be
      performed by investigators, the medical monitor, and the sponsor. A Safety Monitoring
      Committee (SMC) will determine dose levels to be administered and dose regimen during dose
      escalation based on the data available from the previous dose levels. If an MTD is not
      identified due to paucity of DLTs, the RP2D will be determined based on pharmacokinetics,
      safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.

      If a patient wishes to continuously receive study treatment on completion of Cycle 1, the
      patient can continue study treatment in 21-day Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles (same as Cycle
      2, all of 21 days' duration), defined as administration of 3 times per week for 2 weeks
      followed by one week off, at the discretion of the investigator.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      FN-1501 based on pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary efficacy.
