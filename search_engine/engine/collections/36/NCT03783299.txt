    
      This study is the second phase of work in Champasak Province, Southern Lao PDR, building off
      a formative phase of work that characterized the demographics, occupations, migratory
      patterns, health-seeking behaviors, and social networks of mobile and migrant populations
      (MMPs) in four target districts. This phase of the study now aims to determine the
      effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of proactive targeted
      test-and-treat activities using high-sensitivity malaria rapid diagnostic tests (HS-RDTs) for
      reducing Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Champasak Province among (1) village
      residents and (2) mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) and other high-risk populations
      (HRPs).

      The study will specifically assess the role of HS-RDTs, a diagnostic test that offers
      potentially ~10-fold greater sensitivity than standard RDTs, in active case detection at both
      the village-level and in forest-going HRPs for decreasing prevalence and incidence of P.
      falciparum in target areas. The effectiveness of these interventions will be compared
      independently and in combination against areas with no study interventions (standard of care)
      over the course of implementation (planned for October 2017 - November 2018).

      The two main study interventions are mass test and treat (MTAT) using HS-RDTs in
      village-based populations, and peer navigator (PN) led focal test and treat (FTAT) using
      HS-RDTs in forest based HRPs. Primary outcomes will include PCR-based P. falciparum
      prevalence at endline. Following a baseline cross-sectional survey in November-December 2017,
      the interventions will consist of 3 rounds of MTAT spaced throughout the year, with potential
      to reduce to 2 based upon initial prevalence estimates, and ongoing FTAT by PNs among forest
      and forest-fringe HRPs, with the primary evaluation to be conducted through an end-line
      cross-sectional survey in November 2018.
