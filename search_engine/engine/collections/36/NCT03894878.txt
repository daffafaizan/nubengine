      in ethnically diverse populations, which otherwise would not have been detected using
      commercially available warfarin tests. Furthermore, retrospective review of clinical outcomes
      (percent time in therapeutic range, time to reach therapeutic international normalized ratio
      (INR), INR â‰¥ 4, major bleeding event, ischemic stroke) of study participants will determine
      the clinical utility of genetic variant risk scores. Study outcomes will provide guidance on
      future directions for optimizing dosing algorithms for warfarin that combine pharmacogenetic
      principles with clinical dosing.
