      HLA-matched donors. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen. However,
      auto-HSCT with BUCY conditioning regimen appears to have higher relapse rate. To reduce the
      relapse rate, IDA is added in the conditioning regimen. In this study, the safety and
      efficacy of IDA+BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in intermediate-risk AML
      patients undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.
