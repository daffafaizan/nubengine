      disease (CAD). Through the inhibition of activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity
      directed against key facets of the disease process, namely a) inflammation, b) atherogenic
      lipid profiles and c) the atherosclerotic process. Non-clinical and clinical data from recent
      studies have demonstrated the benefit of early and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy to
      reduce cardiovascular risk. Recent clinical studies have provided a strong association
      between levels and cardiovascular event risk. The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology
      study (Study No. AN-CVD-2222) will examine the effects of 2 different doses of A-002 compared
      with placebo, on enzyme levels and activity after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the
      effect of treatment on inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein
      [CRP]), lipid levels and lipoprotein subclasses and other soluble biomarkers (e.g., ICAM-1,
      VCAM-1, TNF, MCP-1 etc) will also be assessed.
