    
      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Test the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art web-based portal with home-based wireless
           medication adherence devices and behavioral economic feedback mechanisms in preventing
           vascular events or re-hospitalization in the 12 months following hospital admission for
           AMI

        2. Deploy a new model of evidence based evolutionary learning that uses rapid cycle
           innovation in 3 successive planning cycles over the 36 months of this proposal

      Patients will be randomized into 1 of the 2 study groups.

        1. The control group will have their health insurance claims records analyzed over a 12
           month period for comparison to the participants in the intervention arm.

        2. The intervention group:

      (1) will use the GlowCaps, a remote monitoring and reminder pill bottle; (2) will be assigned
      an engagement advisor from the study team; (3) be asked to provide the study team with names
      and contact information of up to 3 family members or friends as support partners for
      medication adherence; (4) will be eligible for daily sweepstakes-based engagement incentives
      in which eligibility to win will be conditional on medication adherence; (5) can choose to
      modify their preferences for Way to Health platform communication methods during the study.

      The group receiving the program intervention will also have their claims data analyzed for
      the 12 months post-enrollment.
