      800 unique oral bacterial species identified with more species expected to be added with
      further sampling and identification. As with microbiota of other sites in the human body, a
      balanced oral microbiota is essential to maintaining the health of the human host.
      Streptococcus salivarius is a pioneer species that colonizes the human oral cavity from
      birth, and remains a predominant member of the commensal microbiota throughout life. This
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is conducted to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of a Streptococcus salivarius DB-B5 strain.
