    
      This is a one-arm phase II interventional study in patients with breast cancer to investigate
      whether memantine can prevent cognitive decline during chemotherapy. The investigators will
      recruit 56 participants referred to the University of North Carolina (UNC) Breast Center
      outpatient clinic for initiation of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, perform a cognitive
      assessment within one week of initiating and four weeks after completion of chemotherapy, and
      treat with memantine 10 mg twice daily between the pre- and post-chemotherapy study
      assessments (estimated duration: 12-26 weeks, depending on the chemotherapy regimen).
      Cognitive function will be assessed objectively using a computerized cognitive assessment
      (Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS) test) and a standard neuropsychological battery. To assess
      subjective cognitive function, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS) Cognitive Function measure will be used. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, menopausal
      status, and sleep are comorbidities known to affect cognitive function, and therefore will be
      assessed as covariates pre- and post-chemotherapy. Depression, anxiety, health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) and functional status will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. The
      feasibility of the investigator's study by monitoring recruitment, retention, and adherence
      to memantine will be assessed.
