      loss and is the most effective treatment. Although the effect of changing body image on
      occupational and social experiences in patients undergoing bariatric surgery has been
      examined, there is not enough information about the body awareness and the factors affecting
      these patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the body awareness and the factors
      affecting the bariatric surgery.

      In this study, body composition (with body analyzer), body awareness (with Body Awareness
      Questionnaire), physical activity level (with International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire-Short Form), joint position feeling (with photography method), quality of life
      (with Short Form-36), depression status (with Beck Depression Inventory) and cognition (with
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test) of all participants will be evaluated when they come
      routine doctor control.
