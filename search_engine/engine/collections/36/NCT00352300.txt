      I. Establish the feasibility of adjuvant dose-dense carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by
      pegfilgrastim, in terms of absence of grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities without major
      dose delays or additional hematological support (e.g., red blood cell or platelet
      transfusions or admission for febrile neutropenia), in patients with stage III-IV ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer, or carcinosarcoma cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the percentage of patients who develop â‰¥ grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity from
      this regimen.

      II. Estimate the clinical response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Assess the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Patients also
      receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
