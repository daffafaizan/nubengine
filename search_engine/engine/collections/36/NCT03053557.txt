      prototype version of Social Skills Coach in terms of its use among mental health consumers
      and clinicians. The intervention aims to improve social and daily living skills and community
      functioning among people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. A mixed methods
      approach will be taken to collect quantitative data at baseline and follow-up. Quantitative
      data collection includes the use of surveys that comprise validated instruments. Qualitative
      data collection will occur at the end of the study and will include the use of
      semi-structured interviews to capture experiential information. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a social skills training course (control group) or to a study arm
      using the Social Skills Coach program (treatment group). The study aims to demonstrate proof
      of concept for a larger effectiveness trial.
