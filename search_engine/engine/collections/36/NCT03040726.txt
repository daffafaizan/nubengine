    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy (i.e. change in nausea numeric rating scale [NRS] from baseline
      between day 5-15) of fixed dose netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride (palonosetron)
      (NEPA) for chronic nausea in cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the secondary outcomes (e.g. proportion of patients who achieved their
      personalized nausea goal, antiemetic use, nausea episodes duration/frequency) for NEPA versus
      (vs.) placebo.

      II. To assess the adverse effects associated with NEPA and placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive netupitant orally (PO) and palonosetron hydrochloride PO on days 1,
      6, and 11 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO on days 1, 6, and 11.
