    
      OBJECTIVE: The aim objective is to compare the neurophysiological effects of the surgery
      versus neural mobilization exercises added to surgery versus only neural mobilization
      exercises on temporal summation and noxious inhibitory pain system and their relationship
      with the improve of symptoms, with pain and disability in patients with Carpal tunnel
      syndrome.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized parallel-group trial. BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) such
      as a neuropathic pain condition with altered pain modulation and wind-up, but there is a
      clack of knowledge if some therapies could have a positive effect.

      METHODS: In the Humans study, 54 patients with CTS will be randomly allocated to either a
      surgery group (n=18) or Surgery with neural exercises group (n=18) or neural exercise group
      (n=18), the groups with neural exercise will received 10 sessions. The primary outcome will
      be conditioned pain modulation, temporal summation, pain intensity,. Secondary outcomes will
      be hand disability assessed with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, pinch-tip grip
      force, and the symptom severity subscale of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire,
      neuropathic pain questionnaire (DN4), psychological questionnaires (anxiety, catastrophizing,
      kinesiophobia depression and fear avoid questionnaires), and pressure pain threshold.
      Patients will be assessed baseline and post-treatment, 1, 3 and 6 months after the last
      treatment by an assessor unaware of group assignment Patients were assessed at. Analysis was
      by intention to treat, with mixed analyses of covariance adjusted for baseline scores.
