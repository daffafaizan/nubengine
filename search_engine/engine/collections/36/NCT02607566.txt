      to gather data on the feasibility and acceptability of yoga compared to a contact control for
      glycemic control. The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled study with
      participants randomly assigned to 1) Yoga intervention, or 2) A standard exercise (SE) group
      program (comparison-control). Focus groups will be conducted with participants at the end of
      the intervention to identify facilitators and barriers to yoga practice and to examine their
      perceptions and beliefs about yoga and its relationship to stress and diabetes management.
      The investigators will explore the effect of yoga on stress (biomarker = salivary cortisol)
      that may act as a mechanism of action underlying the efficacy of yoga for improved glycemic
      control. The investigators will also measure HbA1c levels, fasting and postprandial plasma
      glucose at baseline, end of treatment (12-weeks), 6- and 9-month follow-ups. Study
      feasibility and acceptability will be assessed using participant recruitment, attendance and
      retention rates, and compliance with study protocols and satisfaction with the program.
      Participants will also attend a focus-group discussion of the program at the end of
      treatment. Results from this study will provide scientific basis for a future larger clinical
      trial. Yoga, if found to offer advantages for glycemic control, can have potential for high
      impact on current practices of diabetes management.
