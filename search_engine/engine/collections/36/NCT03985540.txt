      treatment protocol for Processing Speed and Learning and memory impairments, well-validated
      in other neurological populations, to individuals with SCI with objectively observable
      deficits in these areas and document efficacy on standard neuropsychological testing; (2)
      assess the effectiveness of the interventions in persons with SCI utilizing global measures
      of everyday life; (3) evaluate the long-term benefit of treatment. Prior to enrollment in the
      study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo a 2-part screening: (1) an initial
      screening examination via telephone during which basic information will be gathered and (2) a
      detailed, in-person screening that will be completed on if the subject passes the initial
      screen. Individuals must meet full screening criteria to be eligible for participation.
