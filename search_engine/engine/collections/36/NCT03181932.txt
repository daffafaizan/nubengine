    
      This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to examine the safety and efficacy of AeroVanc in the treatment of
      persistent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) lung infection in patients
      diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). After the Screening period to confirm study eligibility,
      subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either AeroVanc 30 mg
      twice daily (BID), or placebo BID (1:1 active to placebo) by inhalation for 24 weeks or 3
      dosing cycles (Period 1). Upon completion of Period 1, subjects will receive open-label
      AeroVanc 30 mg BID for an additional 24 weeks or 3 dosing cycles (Period 2), to evaluate
      long-term safety of AeroVanc. A dosing cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment followed by
      28 days of observation.

      Subjects on a 28-day cyclical on/off anti-Pseudomonal antibiotic regimen will enter the
      Screening period at a time such that the Baseline visit coincides with the end of their
      anti-Pseudomonas antibiotic cycle. Study drug will thereby be administered during the
      off-cycle, and subjects can then resume anti-Pseudomonal therapy during the 28-day
      observation period. Subjects continuing alternating anti-Pseudomonal therapy can continue
      their treatment during the study drug administration, and observation period.

      The primary and secondary analyses will be conducted in subjects â‰¤21 years old. Subjects >21
      years old will be analyzed separately as a supportive analysis.
