      injury. Now, we plan to contact all patients and invite them to participate. The patients
      will be asked to

        1. complete a questionnaire battery

        2. visit the movement laboratory at Link√∂ping University for an objective assessment of
           knee function and

        3. have an x-ray of both knee joints.

      Baseline information including associated injuries, treatment and activity level exist for
      all the patients. At that time, rehabilitation was normally completed after 4-6 months for
      non-operatively treated patients, and nine months after ACL surgery.
