      shown that independently of moderate to vigorous physical activity, the amount of time spent
      sedentary predicts poorer health outcomes. This means that in addition to exercising, it is
      important to reduce prolonged periods of sedentary behaviours to improve health. For people
      with depression and long term conditions, milder forms of physical activity may be more
      appropriate due to higher levels of pain and fatigue resulting from exercise. Reducing
      sedentary behaviours by substituting them with mild physical activities such as walking is a
      potential avenue to improve health outcomes in this population group.

      To date, no intervention has been developed to reduce prolonged periods of sedentariness in
      people with depression and long term health conditions within the UK. This feasibility study
      aims to refine a behaviour change intervention to reduce sedentary time in this population
      group. The intervention has been developed through reviewing the literature on interventions
      to increase physical activity (a systematic review), an interview study to explore sedentary
      and physical activity behaviours within this population group, and through patient and public
      involvement.
