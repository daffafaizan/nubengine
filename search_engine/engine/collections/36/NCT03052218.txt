    
      The proposed study is a single-center, observational and prospective study which will be
      conducted at the Pediatric Emergency Department, Geneva Children's Hospital.

      This study will begin in January 2016 and will last one year. 53 patients are planned to be
      enrolled.

      Children receiving oral tramadol as a pain killer at the emergency department, as part of
      their routine care, will be informed of the current study. Patients willing to participate
      will be included in the study after signing the inform consent (or respectively his/her
      parents or legal guardians). A unique oral dose of dextromethorphan (0.15 mg/kg) will be
      given to the participant for CYP2D6 phenotyping (T0).

      Two hours later, capillary whole blood will be sampled to 1) measure the metabolic ratio
      dextrorphan/dextromethorphan (MRDOR/DEM) in order to determine CYP2D6 phenotype (validated
      metrics for CYP2D6 phenotyping), 2) measure tramadol and its active metabolite
      O-desmethyltramadol (M1), and 3) to genotype for CYP2D6. Saliva sample will also be performed
      to genotype for CYP2D6. Pupillometry will be performed before administration of tramadol, at
      T0 and then 1 to twice per hour, throughout the patient's stay at the emergency department.
