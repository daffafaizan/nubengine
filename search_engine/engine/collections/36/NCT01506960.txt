        1. Test the ability of the new NIRS IVUS system to detect lipid pool

        2. Evaluate the accuracy of the NIRS IVUS system for localization of lipide rich plaque:
           superficial vs deep

        3. Improve diagnostic accuracy of OCT for detection of lipid using information from NIRS
           IVUS
