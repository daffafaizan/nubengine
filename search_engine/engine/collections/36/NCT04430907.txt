      population to target in order to increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Central
      Pennsylvania.

      Despite being available for almost a decade, uptake of the HPV vaccine in the US remains
      below other countries, including England, Scotland, and Australia. In fact, in 2017, only 67%
      of US girls aged 13-17 had obtained even one dose of the HPV vaccine series. Due to low rates
      of HPV vaccination in the United States and Central Pennsylvania, effective interventions are
      needed to help increase these rates.

      While vaccination is recommended at a younger age, it is effective among women 18-25 years
      old. Based on clinical trial data, giving the vaccine to this age group has resulted in
      reduced abnormal Pap test findings, referral for colposcopy, and treatment related to
      abnormal cervical cytology. However, the HPV vaccine is not usually discussed during prenatal
      care or routinely administered during pregnancy. Previous studies have shown that offering
      other vaccines postpartum (e.g. tetanus or pertussis) has been successful.

      By offering the vaccine to this demographic group, the investigators could potentially
      discover an untapped target population to help increase rates of HPV vaccination.
