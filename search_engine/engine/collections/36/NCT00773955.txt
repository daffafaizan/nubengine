      I. To determine the objective response rate of R-(-)-gossypol in patients with recurrent
      chemotherapy-sensitive extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

      II. To determine the time to disease progression. III. To determine the overall survival. IV.
      To assess the toxicities associated with this drug. V. To explore whether intratumoral Bcl-2
      family member expression correlates with sensitivity to targeting by R-(-)-gossypol.

      VI. To explore whether the administration of R-(-)-gossypol causes specific induction of the
      intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically during treatment for pharmacodynamic analysis. Peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells are analyzed via protein isolation and western blotting for Bcl-2,
      cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, and caspase activation. Available tumor tissue blocks
      are assessed by immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
