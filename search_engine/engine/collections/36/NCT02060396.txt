      to acquire more information on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      low-dose enteric-coated ASA, and to characterize the variability (coefficient of variation),
      accuracy and precision of a novel biomarker of ASA action, i.e., quantification of the extent
      of COX-1 acetylation at serine-529, using a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography
      multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique. This biomarker will be then
      used in another clinical study in the target population, i.e. FAP patients, treated with
      low-dose ASA which that will be performed by Prof Angel Lanas (University of Zaragoza,
      Spain).

      Twenty four healthy volunteers recruited among the hospital and laboratory personnel will be
      enrolled and treated with ASA (100 mg enteric-coated tablet per day, Adiro) for 1 week.

      Blood samples will be collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h after the first and the last dose of ASA to assess the extent of
      inhibition of serum TXB2, as an index of platelet COX-1 activity, and plasma levels of ASA
      and salicylate and the extent of COX-1 acetylation in circulating platelets. Moreover, the
      investigators will assess the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation in whole blood by
      the PFA-100 system. Twenty four hours urine samples will be also collected to measure
      11-dehydro-TXB2 (TX-M), an index of systemic TXA2 biosynthesis in vivo.

      Healthy subjects will take their daily ASA under fasting conditions and will abstain from the
      use of ASA and other NSAIDs for at least 2 weeks before enrolment.

      All volunteers will be attended at the Clinical Research Unit of the University Hospital
      Lozano Blesa.
