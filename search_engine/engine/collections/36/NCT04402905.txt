      disease managed in the hospital sector.

      Few data have been published on moderate forms, requiring no hospitalization, of strict
      outpatient management.

      These so-called moderate forms, however, constitute the majority of cases of COVID-19
      (approximately 80%).

      In the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department of Pitie Salpetriere, COVIDOM pilot site,
      at the beginning of March, during the intensification of the epidemic in France, a weekly
      telephone consultation was set up to take care of people tested for COVID + by PCR, or people
      not tested by PCR, or even tested with negative PCR but symptomatic and followed at home,
      suffering from moderate form of COVID-19, as well as their contact cases if they wished.

      Telemedicine is particularly suitable in this epidemic context, ensuring continuity of care,
      while limiting face-to-face consultations, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination.

      Given the novelty of this infection, it is important to be able to best characterize these
      ambulatory forms, as well as their evolution, in order to manage these patients, and to offer
      primary care physicians a more detailed description of these forms. , which they are and will
      be called upon to take care of, general medicine being central to dealing with the epidemic.
