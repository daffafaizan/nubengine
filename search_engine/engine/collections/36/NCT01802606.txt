      surgical-site infection (SSI) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention [5-6].

      We chose cefazolin sodium and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection as peri-operative
      antibiotics. Cefazolin sodium is an effective antibiotic with a short plasma elimination
      half-life against gram-positive cocci (GPC) except for enterococci and meticillin-resistant
      staphylococci. It is recommended as one of the prior antibacterial agents used for clearing
      cuts and preventing infection in many countries including China. Levofloxacin sodium chloride
      injection has a wide anti-bacterial spectrum composed of gram-negative bacteria and
      gram-positive anaerobic bacteria including anaerobic bacteria. It can remain a high
      concentration in urine, so it is recommended as an attractive antibiotic for urinary tract
      operation [5].

      In the control group, we gave normal saline as placebo by intravenous drip infusion for 30-60
      min before operation. Cefazolin group and levofloxacin group received intravenous
      administration of cefazolin sodium 1000 mg and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection 200 mg,
      respectively, for 30-60 min before operation.
