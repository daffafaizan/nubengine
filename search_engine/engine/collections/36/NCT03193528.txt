      harboring BCa. VUC is the most widely used urine-based assay for detecting BCa; however, it
      fails to detect approximately 50% of low-grade or early stage BCa when it is most curable.

      Because of this severe limitation, patients with hematuria (microscopic or gross) will
      undergo an invasive examination of the urinary bladder, where a miniature camera is inserted
      into the bladder. We propose to improve upon the non-invasive detection of BCa by further
      validating a multiplex ELISA assay directed at a BCa-associated diagnostic signature in
      voided urine samples of patients with gross hematuria.
