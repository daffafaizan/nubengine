      progesterone levels in subject's voluntarily undergoing monitored infertility treatment
      cycles including controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with oral agents or gonadotropins and
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Ultimately, the
      potential applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring in IVF cycles will be
      assessed.
