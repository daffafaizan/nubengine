    
      This is a Phase I dose-escalating safety study aimed at identifying the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) for an outpatient regimen while exposing the minimum number of patients to a dose
      less than MTD. The anticipated accrual will be approximately 15 patients and the study will
      take one year to complete. Patients will receive Proleukin® (Registered Trademark)
      subcutaneously at their assigned dose level once per day for 5 days approximately every eight
      weeks for a total of 6 months. A cycle of therapy is defined as 5 days of Proleukin®
      (Registered Trademark) plus antiviral therapy followed by 7 weeks of antiviral therapy alone.
      If tolerated, each patient will receive 3 cycles of therapy and, following completion of
      three cycles, will be eligible for extended treatment. IL-2 injections will be delivered by
      study personnel on an outpatient basis for at least the first cycle of therapy.
