      obtain qEEG data on normal, healthy individuals to include in a normal control database for
      use in comparison with patients with CO poisoning and other types of brain injury. The use of
      anti-depressant medication use is relatively common in the general adult population. There is
      varying opinion whether anti-depressant medication alters an otherwise normal clinical EEG.
      We have included healthy individuals taking anti-depressant medication to determine if those
      medications influence the EEG. The EEG data will be collected, analyzed, and stored for use
      in future research studies and for clinical care. Evaluating patients with qEEG methodology
      may assist in diagnosis and treatment.
