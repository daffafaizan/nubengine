      attractive cervical cancer prevention strategy for resource poor settings which lack the
      infrastructure for establishing and maintaining complex screening programmes.Feasibility and
      costs of setting up and sustaining an HPV vaccination programme will depend on whether it can
      be added onto an existing health programme within schools, if one exists, or whether it has
      to be established as a separate health intervention. Other factors will also affect vaccine
      coverage. For example, uptake and overall effectiveness will be critically dependent on
      parental and community acceptability of a vaccine that prevents a sexually transmitted
      infection and how the vaccine is promoted and delivered by health-care providers will
      influence its uptake and acceptability.

      This study will determine feasibility, uptake and acceptability of different delivery
      strategies of school-based HPV vaccination in Tanzania, examine factors related to acceptance
      or refusal of vaccination and measure the cost of implementing a school-based HPV vaccination
      programme in Tanzania.

      Three doses of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, (GardasilÂ®; Merck & Co) given
      at 0, 2 and 6 months, will be provided to 5000 primary school girls at 134 randomly selected
      schools in Mwanza Region in Tanzania. Selected schools will be randomly assigned to one of
      two delivery strategies (age-based or class-based) and coverage and acceptability of these
      vaccine delivery strategies will be compared. Qualitative research will be conducted before,
      during and after vaccination to examine barriers to vaccination and reasons for failure to
      complete vaccination as well as general community perceptions. To determine factors
      associated with refusal a case control study will be conducted on a 1:1 sample of 350 vaccine
      refusers and 350 accepters. The costs of introducing and scaling up HPV vaccines in schools
      will be estimated using established costing methods.
