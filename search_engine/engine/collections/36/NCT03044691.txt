      recommendations to screen and counsel parents. The specific aims of this study are to: (1)
      Develop and deploy an electronic short screening tool for tobacco and nicotine product use
      into pediatric primary care workflow in conjunction with clinician and office staff training
      on the 6As and parent screening through the use of trained Clinical Practice Facilitators,
      clinician-engaged adaptations of the intervention to fit their practice workflow, and support
      for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) to engage pediatricians in implementing the best
      practices; (2) Gather pilot data about the effectiveness of the intervention on clinician
      adherence to best practices and changes in practice capacity for change, adaptive reserve,
      and clinician self-efficacy; and (3) Examine the congruence between documentation of the
      intervention in the electronic health record (EHR) and youth report of the intervention.
