      fluticasone plasma concentration, which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct
      measure of systemic exposure. Twelve children 1-6 yrs with well-controlled persistent asthma
      were treated with HFA-FP pMDI, 2 actuations of 110 Âµg twice daily. The drug was administered
      by conventional polycarbonate or anti-static valved-holding chambers with masks in an
      unblinded, randomized, crossover manner each for at least three days. A blood sample was
      collected one hour after the last dose when adherence documented by electronic monitor was
      100%. FP plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
      assay. Results evaluated using regression analysis.
