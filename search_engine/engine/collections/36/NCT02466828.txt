      feasible with qBOLD and it correlates with established histopathological markers of hypoxia
      and angiogenesis, and targeted intraoperative oxygen measurement.

      All patients will undergo surgery as part of their standard treatment. By coregistering the
      hypoxia map on presurgical MRI we will be able to do the following:

        1. Obtain targeted biopsies of the hypoxic areas and none hypoxic areas and correlate them
           with gold standard marker of tissue hypoxia by immunohistochemistry for hypoxia induced
           factor-1α (HIF-1α).

        2. Draw Volumes of interests (VOI) over areas >0.5-cm3 (amenable to accurate
           intra-operative O2 measurement) with the lowest and highest oxygen saturation (SO2)
           values. VOIs will be then imported into the neuronavigation system (Stryker) for
           targeted placement of clinically approved Licox® oxygen-sensing probe (Integra
           NeuroSciences).
