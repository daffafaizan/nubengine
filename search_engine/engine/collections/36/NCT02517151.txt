    
      The study will evaluate a 6 months therapy with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose.

      Patients will undergo a 2-5 days screening period and then will be treated every 4 weeks with
      iron supplementation/placebo.

      At every visit, hematology and blood iron levels will be evaluated. Treatment will be
      temporarily stopped in case of either Hemoglobin levels above 16 g/dl or ferritin above 800
      ng/ml (level decreased to 500 ng/ml in case of Transferrin-Iron Saturation Percentage above
      50%).

      Study team will be composed of blinded and unblinded personnel and dedicated infusion devices
      will be used to ensure the double blinding.
