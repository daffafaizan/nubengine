      postoperative analgesia following primary TKA. Eligible primary TKA patients must be ASA I -
      III and require less than 20 mg oxycodone daily (or its equivalent). Exclusion criteria are:
      allergy to anesthetics, contraindication to regional anesthesia, sensory/motor disorder
      involving operative limb, non-english speaking, ASA IV or greater, psychiatric or cognitive
      disorders, incarceration, renal insufficiency with Cr > 2.0 and hepatic failure. When
      patients agree to participate in the study the following data will be collected by the
      research staff: ASA physical status, age, height, weight, gender, quantitative opiate use,
      numeric pain score with visual descriptors, painDETECT score (form included), WOMAC score
      (form included) and baseline Pain Management Questionnaire. When designated through
      randomization, intra-articular catheters will be placed intraoperatively by the surgeons, per
      usual protocol. ACC's will be placed postoperatively in the PACU. The catheters will exit the
      bandage in a similar fashion to blind the personnel collecting data, postoperatively. Those
      collecting data will not be blinded from identifying patients in the control group, as no
      catheter will exit the bandage. Potential risks for each procedure, which will be explained
      to the patient, include: bleeding, local infection, local anesthetic toxicity in the form of
      seizure and cardiac arrest and neuropathy. The preceding are commonly listed though
      infrequent complications of both procedures. Continuous ultrasound will guide the placement
      of the ACC.
