    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, blinded clinical trial whereby consented
      study subjects will be enrolled into two study cohorts: an Acute Respiratory Infection cohort
      and an Asymptomatic cohort. Subjects (children/adolescents, adults and elderly) with
      suspected community acquired Acute Respiratory Infection will be enrolled in the Acute
      Respiratory Infection cohort and subjects without infectious illness will be enrolled in the
      Asymptomatic cohort. All subjects will undergo FebriDx testing (study device) and results,
      blinded to subjects and treating physicians, will be compared to a Clinical Reference
      Algorithm supervised by clinical experts to arbitrate the presence and type of infection
      (bacterial or viral); the experts are also blinded to the results of FebriDx testing.

      The FebriDxÂ® test is a rapid, point-of-care (POC) test that uses a fingerstick blood sample
      to identify patients with a pathogen induced host immune response through in-vitro detection
      of both Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and c-reactive protein (CRP) directly from a
      whole blood sample. MxA is an intracellular protein that becomes elevated in the presence of
      acute viral infection and CRP is an acute-phase inflammatory protein that is elevated in the
      presence of a systemic bacterial and/or viral infection.
