      in Memphis, Tennessee who choose to participate in the Program. These participants are not
      patients of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The Program will be implemented over a
      three-day period. Each student will attend two presentations and six hands-on activities led
      by St. Jude faculty and research staff on topics within their expertise, such as cells and
      cancer, and healthy living. Printed materials to be distributed as part of the St. Jude
      Cancer Education for Children Program have been developed by a multi-disciplinary team of St.
      Jude employees and local educators and reviewed by national experts for scientific accuracy
      and appropriate readability. Material includes three illustrated children's books, a
      laboratory manual, and activity sheets.

      One pre- and two post-tests will be administered by designated school teachers. The tests
      consist of 10 multiple-choice questions per each of three modules(cells, cancer, and healthy
      living), validated by a group of experts for readability and content relevance. Knowledge
      acquisition will be assessed by taking the differences from first post-test to pre-test
      scores, obtained from 10 questions on each component of the intervention, and using
      one-sample signed rank test to evaluate the improvement in the knowledge scores. A similar
      analysis will be undertaken by taking the differences from the 2nd post-evaluation to the 1st
      post-evaluation for each participant to assess knowledge retention.
