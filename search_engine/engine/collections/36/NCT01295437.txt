    
      Inguinal hernioplasty was performed under local anesthesia in 300 patients in day-case
      surgery by the same surgeon and exactly by the same surgical technique. The patients were
      randomized to receive either a partly polypropylene-polyglactin mesh (Vypro II, 100 hernias),
      a lightweight polypropylene mesh (Premilene LP, 100 hernias) or a conventional densely woven
      polypropylene mesh (Premilene, 100 hernias). Pain, patients discomfort and recurrences of
      hernias were carefully followed 5 years after surgery.
