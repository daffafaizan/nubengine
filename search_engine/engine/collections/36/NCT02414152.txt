      corticosteroid administration may result in preservation of some or all of the hearing. For
      patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have failed to respond to corticosteroid
      therapy, this study will be offered to determine if anakinra is a safe and effective
      alternative therapy for clinical hearing restoration. The investigators have previously
      demonstrated that IL-1beta inhibition (with anakinra) in a small cohort of patients with
      steroid resistant autoimmune inner ear disease was effective in demonstrating audiological
      improvements.
