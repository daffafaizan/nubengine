      known by the general public. The metastatic stages have dramatic rates of survival: 25% at 1
      year and 2% at 5 years with a median of about 6.2 months. However, in the last ten years, the
      treatment of metastatic forms has undergone a real revolution.

      Its high metastatic potential for a very low initial tumor mass, gives evidence of a great
      aggressiveness. The cutaneous melanoma is resistant to the main therapeutics (chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy). Thanks to the emergence of immunotherapies and targeted therapies anti-RAF
      (Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma) and anti-MEK (Mitogen-activated Extracellular) the
      prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma has considerably improved, increasing the
      number of "long-term survivors".

      However, these treatments can cause many adverse effects that can impact patients' quality of
      life, despite a better tolerance compared to conventional chemotherapies. To our knowledge
      there are no data regarding the quality of life of patients with metastatic melanoma
      currently in remission.For this purpose, it is necessary to obtain solid data using validated
      questionnaires. Thus, we have chosen to evaluate quality of life using specific
      questionnaires to better understand patients' expectations, their difficulties, and then to
      improve the relationship between the patient and the physician.
