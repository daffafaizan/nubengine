    
      The specific aim of this project is to adapt and pilot a tailored intervention to promote CRC
      screenings in a rural Appalachian Kentucky emergency department (ED) in order to: (a)
      evaluate the feasibility of providing a cancer screening promotion intervention in an
      emergency department (ED) that serves a rural Appalachian community; and (b) assess the
      effects of the intervention on barriers to CRC screening, stage of readiness to screen and
      CRC screening engagement. The first phase of the project will involve the adaptation and
      pretesting of the intervention. This phase will take approximately 6 months. The second phase
      of the project will involve piloting the intervention and evaluating its efficacy and
      feasibility and will take place over the following 18 months. We will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to examine the efficacy and feasibility of delivering the LHA delivered MI
      intervention to promote CRC screening in persons waiting in a rural Appalachian emergency
      department (ED) for non urgent complaints. We will evaluate efficacy by measurement of CRC
      screening status at baseline and three and six months post intervention.
