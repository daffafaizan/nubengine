      limitations in activities-of-daily- living (ADL's). Current cognitive rehabilitation methods
      mostly rely on paper-and-pencil tasks targeting isolated domains, which is not consistent
      with everyday-life. Besides limited ecological-validity, paper-and-pencil tasks are not
      accessible for most stroke patients whose dominant arm is paretic. Virtual Reality (VR) has
      shown to be a solution for the development of accessible and ecologically valid systems, but,
      does it have more impact than a paper and pencil personalised intervention?

      Through a participatory design approach, with health professionals, the investigators have
      developed:

        -  a motor-accessible and cognitive-personalized VR-based system, where conventional
           cognitive tasks were operationalized in meaningful simulations of ADL's (Reh@City) and;

        -  a web tool which generates personalised paper and pencil tasks( Task Generator).

      The investigators objective is to have a sample of 60 stroke patients between 40 and 70 years
      old, randomly allocated in three groups: the experimental group 1 were participants will
      perform 30 minutes of the VR training with Reh@City; the experimental group 2 were
      participants will perform 30 minutes of the paper and pencil training with the Task
      Generator, and the control group were participants will perform 30 minutes of conventional
      therapy (occupational therapy).
