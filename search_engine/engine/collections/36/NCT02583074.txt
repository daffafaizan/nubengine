      primary cranial-cervical dystonia to receive an implanted device for STN-DBS, and
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either neurostimulation or sham stimulation
      for 3 months.The primary end point was the change from baseline to 3 months in the severity
      of symptoms, according to the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale. Two masked dystonia
      experts who unaware of treatment status will assess the severity of dystonia by reviewing
      standardised videos.Subsequently, all patients will receive open-label neurostimulation;
      blinded assessment will be repeated after 6 months of active treatment.
