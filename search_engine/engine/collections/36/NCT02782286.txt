      Bucharest and will compare the analgesic effects of ketorolac tromethamine against morphine
      in low back pain.

      The patients will be randomised to receive either ketorolac 30 mg intravenous (diluted in 20
      ml of 0,9% saline) or morphine 0,1 mg/kg weight intravenous. A scale of 1-10 will be used for
      measuring the pain, and the effects of the treatment will be evaluated at 15 minutes and 30
      minutes from the administration of the drugs. After 30 minutes if there is no significant
      reduction of the pain a rescue therapy will be used : acetaminophen 1 g, sodic metamizole 1g
      both diluted in 500 ml saline and the other medication not used from the study (morphine or
      ketorolac tromethamine).
