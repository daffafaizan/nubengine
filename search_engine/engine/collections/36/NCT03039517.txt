    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if use of a pneumatic compression device
      (ACTitouch, Tactile Medical) is beneficial in improving or preventing the development of Post
      Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS). 84 patients who have a history of an acute proximal unilateral leg
      DVT diagnosed one or more months prior to enrollment, or diagnosed with a chronic proximal
      unilateral leg DVT at time of enrollment, on duplex or other imaging study will be randomized
      into two groups: the control group receiving the standard of care compression stockings and
      the intervention group receiving ACTitouch device.
