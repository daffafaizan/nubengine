      blood supply to the bone. This pathologic process results in the death of marrow and
      osteocytes and, in its final stage, femoral head collapse. The most widespread treatment in
      the early stage of this disease is core decompression. This surgical procedure involves
      drilling into the femoral neck through the necrotic area, which reduces pressure within the
      bone and allows more blood vessels to form. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical
      safety and efficacy of CD133+ enriched bone marrow infusion adjacent with core decompression
      in patients with a vascular necrosis of femoral head . Patients will undergo core
      decompression followed by CD133+cell infusion into the cored area. Clinical assessment
      includes a MRI, Harries Hip Score,SF36, Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), and the WOMAC
      osteoarthritis Index.
