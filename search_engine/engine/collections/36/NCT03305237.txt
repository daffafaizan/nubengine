      calorie' and it does not matter when calories are consumed across the day. Recent evidence
      has challenged this assumption, suggesting that we may utilize calories more efficiently when
      consumed in the morning relative to the evening, and this could be used as a beneficial
      strategy for weight loss - this is a newly developing field of investigation which merges
      circadian biology with nutrition (chrono-nutrition).

      Timing of food consumption is a modifiable factor influencing energy balance and body weight
      (and thus, disease risk). Previous research has shown that calories ingested at different
      times of the day have different effects on energy utilization, leading to differential weight
      loss, even at iso-caloric amounts. This study will aim to increase our understanding of the
      underlying behavioral and physiological mechanisms associated with differential weight loss
      and energy balance when calories are consumed predominantly in the morning versus in the
      evening.

      This study will be a cross-over study comparing large breakfast versus large evening meals
      (percent daily calories split between breakfast, lunch and dinner as 45-35-20
      (breakfast-loaded) or 20-35-45 (evening-loaded)) during energy restriction (Fed to measured
      RMR) on energy balance, through differences in both physiological and behavioural changes in
      energy expenditure and substrate utilization.
