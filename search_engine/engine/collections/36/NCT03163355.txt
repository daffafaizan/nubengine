    
      The degree of dysphagia is evaluated using Hyodo.Komagane score (0-12). Subsequently, a
      randomized, crossover trial using pureed rice containing a gelling agent (Softia U, Nutri
      Co., Ltd., Yokkaichi, Japan), or standard pureed rice is performed in patients with
      dysphagia.

      The extent of pharyngeal clearance after swallowing of each pureed rice and test jelly
      (Isotonic green jellyÂ®, Nutri Co., Ltd., Yokkaichi, Japan) is scored as follows:

        1. No remains

        2. Pharyngeal clearance is obtained after swallowing of test jelly once

        3. Pharyngeal clearance is obtained after swallowing of test jelly twice

        4. Pharyngeal clearance is obtained after swallowing of test jelly three times and more

        5. In spite of swallowing of test jelly, pharyngeal residues remain and/or penetrate into
           larynx.

      Evaluation Primary outcome: The pharyngeal clearance score (1-5) Secondary outcome: Patient
      feeling regarding pharyngeal clearance after the swallowing of pureed rice and/or test jelly
      (0 remains -100% complete clearance)
