      participation in military actions. The study revealed that if a military combatant was
      wounded during the action operation, his emotional and subjective feelings will 100% lead to
      the PTSD. Other scientists state about the PTSD remote treatment failure in 80% of the
      military combatants. The study evidences about 82.1% of the PTSD m-related wounds treatment
      failure, which was essential for the subsequent studies. Some authors state about treatment
      effectiveness of psychopharmacological drugs and psychotherapy, which is rather questionable.
      Traumas and somatic diseases in the PTSD patients are known to accumulate their negative
      effects. So, definition of the PTSD treatment failure predictors may improve treatment
      outcomes.
