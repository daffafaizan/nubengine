      CBGT in improving core symptoms of social anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, self,
      esteem, disability and quality of life. A secondary aim is to examine whether treatment gains
      are maintained over a 6-month period. Exploratory aims of the study are to: 1) determine if
      the MBI-SAD enhances self-compassion and mindfulness relative to CBGT; 2) determine if
      changes in self-compassion and mindfulness mediate the clinical response to the MBI-SAD; and
      3) explore moderators of treatment response.
