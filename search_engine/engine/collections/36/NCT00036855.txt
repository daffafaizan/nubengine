      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8) when preceded by rituximab in children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive
      lymphoma for which no autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (AuPBSCT) is
      planned. (Group A) If the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in group A is purely hematological,
      determine the MTD of IDEC-Y2B8 when combined with rituximab, AuPBSCT, and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      in a second group of children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive lymphoma. (Group B)
      II. Determine the DLT of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these patients. III. Determine the
      dosimetry of indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan preceded by rituximab in these patients.

      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these
      patients.

      V. Assess the immune cell depletion (B-cell and T-cell) and recovery in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      VI. Determine the human anti-mouse antibody response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A (no planned peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC] support): Patients receive rituximab IV
      over 4-6 hours followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10 minutes
      on day 0 and undergo whole body imaging. Patients may then receive rituximab IV over 4-6
      hours followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 7.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each subgroup (A1, A2, and A3) receive escalating doses of
      IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (subgroup A1 closed as of
      10/8/04). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Some patients receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 35.

      GROUP B (planned PBSC support): Patients receive rituximab, IDEC-In2B8, and IDEC-Y2B8 as in
      group A. Patients also receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 21 and filgrastim
      (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 22 and continuing until blood counts recover or day
      35.

      If the DLT in group A is purely hematological, cohorts of 3-6 patients in group B receive
      escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as in group A.

      Patients in both groups are followed at days 63, 90, 180, 365, and then annually thereafter.
