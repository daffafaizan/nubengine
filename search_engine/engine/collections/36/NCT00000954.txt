      agents to reduce the tumor burden, and they also require treatment with other possibly
      effective antiretroviral agents such as ddI or ddC to ameliorate (delay) the development of
      opportunistic infections.

      In Phase I, eligible patients with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma are randomly assigned to either
      ddI or ddC in combination with DBV chemotherapy. On the average, patients receive 12-44 weeks
      of combined chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy. If vincristine is deleted from Phase I
      because of excess neurotoxicity, it will not be administered as part of the combination
      chemotherapy if that treatment is continued in the Phase II study. The Phase II trial
      proceeds when at least six cycles (12 weeks) of DBV have been completed by six patients
      enrolled in Phase I, and an overall evaluation of tolerance to each combination treatment
      plan has been completed. Study medication is administered as in Phase I, with the possible
      deletion of vincristine. All patients who complete DBV chemotherapy with complete or partial
      response or stable disease will continue to receive the originally assigned investigational
      antiretroviral drug (ddC or ddI) for an additional 24 weeks.
