      joints, and "simple" which involves only cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue.

      prophylactic antibiotic should not be given in a clean simple lacerations, and should be
      given when a bone is involve (open fracture). But there is not enough data, weather
      prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be given when only tendons are involved. The
      investigators will examine 2 groups of 30 patients each with clean hand lacerations involving
      tendons. One group will be treated with prophylactic antibiotic and the other wont be
      treated, randomly. The investigators assume that the rate of wound infection wont be
      different between the 2 groups.
