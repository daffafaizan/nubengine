      different days the investigators will take two blood samples (one in the morning at 8 am,
      before the iron intake and one in the afternoon at 4 pm) to determine the plasma hepcidin
      level. The intake of the iron supplements will be at least 48 hours apart from each other, to
      exclude any impacts of the previous iron intake to the next measurement.

      The participants will take the iron supplement supervised at 8 am after overnight fasting.

      All blood samples will be performed for analysis of CRP and hepcidin. The investigators will
      measure the CRP in the blood sample to exclude any impacts of inflammation to the hepcidin
      measurement and use a CRP â‰¤5mg/l as a cut-off. If the CRP is higher than 5mg/l the
      investigators will exclude the measurement from our analyses and repeat the measurement at
      another day.

      The first two blood samples will be taken at 8 am and at 4 pm on the same day and after
      overnight fasting to find the baseline hepcidin, the other blood samples will be taken at 8
      am before the iron intake and at 4 pm also on the same day and also after overnight fasting.
