    
      A 12-week three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects between
      the single-player game, competitive game and a control group (i.e. conventional training) on
      the motivation, exercise duration and functional improvement in a rehabilitation program. A
      mix of quantitative method (i.e., questionnaire) and qualitative methods (i.e., interview and
      observation) were used. The outcome measurements were: (1) motivation: Intrinsic Motivation
      Inventory (IMI), (2) participation: exercise duration, (3) functional improvement: nine-hole
      peg test (NHPT) and box and block test (BBT), and (4) user feedback.
