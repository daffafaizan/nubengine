      procedures for upper gastrointestinal bleeding at all AdventHealth hospitals in Central
      Florida. This information will enable quality control of patients undergoing treatment for
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding across all campuses in the AdventHealth system in Central
      Florida and hence improve the delivery ot care extended to the investigator's patients.
