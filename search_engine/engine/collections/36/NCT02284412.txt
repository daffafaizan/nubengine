      spontaneous reversal of a moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade on regional lung
      ventilation. This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group double blind trial in rats. A
      total of 18 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats will be used, 6 in each treatment group. The
      animals will be randomized in one of three groups, in a 1:1:1 ratio. This randomization will
      be performed according to a computer-generated randomization list. The first group will
      receive neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. The second group will receive sugammadex. The third group
      will receive water for injection. Reversal agents will be administered at a train-of-four
      (TOF) of 0.5, as measured with AMG.

      The investigators will assess regional ventilation by means of micro-CT scanning during
      spontaneous breathing after the TOF ratio has reached â‰¥ 0.9. This way, the investigators can
      accurately reconstruct airway morphology. The different airway sections can then be linked to
      the corresponding lung tissue, and a full anatomical picture is thus rendered. A comparison
      of morphological scans at different breathing levels (e.g. end-inspiratory and
      end-expiratory) will allow us to model breath-by-breath regional airway and alveolar
      recruitment.
