      suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study will be
      conducted in 4 phases: a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to Day 1
      intranasal dose; a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (Days 1-25); an 8-week initial
      post-treatment phase (Days 25-81); and a subsequent phase to complete a full 6-month
      post-treatment follow-up (Days 81-200). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and
      pharmacogenomic evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule. The duration
      of the participant's participation will be approximately 29 weeks. If you or a loved one are
      having thoughts of suicide, please seek immediate medical help. Go to the emergency room or
      call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
