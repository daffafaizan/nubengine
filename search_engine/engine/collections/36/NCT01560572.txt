      treated with basiliximab induction and a three day course of steroids followed by a steroid
      free maintenance regimen consisting of standard-dose tacrolimus OD and mycophenolic acid.
      Group 2 will be treated with Basiliximab induction followed by standard-dose tacrolimus OD,
      mycophenolic acid and steroids. Group 3 will be treated with basiliximab induction followed
      by standard-dose tacrolimus OD for six months, whereafter the dose will be reduced plus
      mycophenolic acid and steroids. The total study period will be 2 years. Primary endpoint will
      be renal function, proteinuria and microalbuminuria measured 6, 12, and 24 months after
      transplantation. Renal function will be measured by serum Creatinine, Creatinine clearances
      and Nankivell GFR (4). Secondary endpoints will be the degree of tubular atrophy and
      interstitial fibrosis and the degree of arteriolar hyalinosis in renal biopsies taken at 12
      and 24 months after transplantation. Biopsies will be evaluated according to the Banff '07
      Criteria for Renal Allograft Biopsy Interpretation (appendix II). Quantitative morphometric
      analysis of interstitial fibrous tissue will be performed using the digital image analysis
      technique. Other secondary endpoints are patient and graft survival, the incidence of
      allograft rejection, cardiovascular accidents, pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, the
      number of antihypertensives, lipid profile, the incidence of malignancies, the incidence of
      infectious complications, the incidence of post transplant diabetes mellitus and the
      development of osteoporosis.
