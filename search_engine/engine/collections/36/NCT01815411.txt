      (AndoSanTM) leads to a clinical, biochemical and genetical improvement in RA. The experiment
      will be carried out for 21 days in 15 eligible RA patients. In order to increase the
      scientific value of the project we will use, a as far as possible, an age matched control
      group of RA patients with steady medication and no intervention. The control group of 10-15
      patients will be answering the same questionnaires and give the same samples of blood and
      feces.

      Partial aims: To compare prior to (day 0) and after (day 21) daily (30 ml x 2) ingestion of
      Andosan the effect of this therapy on:

        -  general blood samples (leucocytes, CRP, liver and renal function tests), including
           erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SR) and pentraxin 3 (PTX3)

        -  level of blood cytokines and analytes
           (IL-1α/-1ra/-2/-4/-5/-6/-7/-8/-9/-10/-12(p70)/-13/-15/

           RANTES,VEGF;27-plex) -level of inflammatory marker calprotectin in feces and blood in
           patients

        -  genetic expression in blood leukocytes (microarray) -number of swollen and tender
           joints, morning stiffness, Disease activity score 28 calculated by ESR (DAS28-ESR), RA
           impact of disease score (RAID), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), visual analogue
           scale (VAS) for patient's and physician's global assessment of disease activity, life
           quality (SF-36 version 2), fatigue score.
