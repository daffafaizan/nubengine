      associated infertility. Despite having amenorrhea and markedly elevated serum gonadotropin
      levels, approximately 50% of women with 46XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure have
      ovarian follicles that function intermittently. These follicles are faced with high serum LH
      levels. Normally, women have their LH levels in the range of 3-14 u/L except in the
      preovulatory stage, when it rises above 20 u/L. At that level it works on LH receptors on the
      granulosa cells and transforms the follicle in the corpus leutium. In POF, continuous high
      level of LH prematurely lutienizes growing follicles and thereby causes follicle dysfunction.
      We have shown by histological examination that inappropriate luteinization is a major
      mechanism of Graffian follicle dysfunction in these women.

      We have found that approximately 50% women with premature ovarian failure have LH levels in
      the normal range while they are taking 100 mcg per day of our standardized transdermal
      estradiol therapy.
