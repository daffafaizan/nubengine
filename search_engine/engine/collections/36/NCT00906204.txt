    
      This study is designed to confirm the one-year safety of single-dose rabbit anti-thymocyte
      globulin induction at kidney transplantation, compared to the conventional administration of
      the same overall dose divided into four smaller doses across four days. Two randomized groups
      of kidney transplant recipients will be each administered the drug Thymoglobulin according to
      a different dosing regimen. The control group will receive the usual and traditional regimen
      of a total of 6 mg/Kg divided into 4 doses, 1 on the day of transplantation and 1 each day on
      the next 3 days. The experimental group will receive the same total Thymoglobulin dose, 6
      mg/Kg, but entirely on the day of transplantation.

      The study will be double-blinded, with placebo doses of Thymoglobulin administered as needed
      to enrollees in the experimental group. Enrollment is targeted at 165, with 150 subjects
      needed to complete the study for adequate evaluation.
