      Short Title The Peer Support Intervention

      Study Design Prospective randomized study

      Study Duration 2 years

      Study Population 250 Youth (ages 10-24 years) with virologic failure

      Study Outcomes Primary Outcomes

      1. Virologic suppression rate in the The Peer Support Intervention group compared with the
      standard of care group following 48 weeks in the Peer Support Intervention.

      Secondary Outcomes

        1. Frequency of acquired drug resistance mutations among youth failing ART.

        2. Baseline prevalence of psychological distress among adolescents and young adults failing
           first line therapy

        3. Prevalence of psychological distress (measured using PHQ-A and SSQ) after 48 weeks of
           enrolment in the Peer Support Intervention compared with the standard of care

        4. Association between self-reported adherence, pill counts and objective surrogate markers
           of adherence obtained from plasma (viral load), DBS and hair (tenofovir concentrations).

        5. Effectiveness of point mutation assays for the detection of drug resistance as compared
           with standard sequencing techniques.

      Description of Intervention Youth with evidence of virologic failure defined as an HIV VL>400
      copies/mL on two consecutive occasions at least 1 month apart will be eligible for
      enrollment. Youth will be randomized to a community based peer counseling support group or
      clinic based standard of care, with viral load, and drug monitoring evaluations at 3 month
      intervals to determine the efficacy of the intervention in improving adherence and virologic
      suppression.
