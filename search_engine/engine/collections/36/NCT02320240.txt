      databases from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Within each cohort, a
      nested case-control analysis will be performed to estimate incidence rate ratios (RR) of AKI
      associated with SNRIs compared to SSRIs using conditional logistic regression, with
      adjustment for high-dimensional propensity scores at baseline. The overall effect across
      sites will then be estimated using meta-analytic methods.
