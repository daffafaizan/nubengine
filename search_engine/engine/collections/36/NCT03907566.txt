      Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals among adult patients
      with swallowing disorders.The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion
      validity of the instrument will be investigated. The internal consistency will be assessed
      using Cronbach's alpha. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 % confidence
      intervals will be calculated for test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the scale
      will be determined by assessing the correlation between the The Turkish Oropharyngeal
      Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals and Turkish Eating Assessment Tool.
