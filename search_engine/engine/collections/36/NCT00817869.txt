      the wards for up to 6 months. Then, half of the wards will have the new floor laid. Wards
      will be chosen to receive the new floor, or remain with a standard floor, by chance. The new
      floor has 'shock-absorbent' properties. We will study all the wards for another 12 months.
      This will allow us to compare the new flooring with the normal flooring.
