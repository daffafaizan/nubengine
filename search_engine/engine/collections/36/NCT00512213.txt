      increases postoperative malnutrition and immunity reduction. Therefore, postoperative
      complication and infection rates after major surgery exceed 30% [3-6].

      The nutritional risk score (NRS) [1] is based on the ESPEN (European society of parenteral
      and enteral nutrition) screening guidelines and identifies patients who are likely to benefit
      from nutritional support. Patients with a NRS ≥ 3 are considered severely undernourished, or
      to have a certain degree of severity of disease in combination with certain degree of
      malnutrition [7].

      In a prospective cohort study patients with a NRS ³ 3 had significant more infectious and
      overall complications after major abdominal surgery [4, 7, 8]. Several studies showed a
      benefit by nutritional support on complications [3, 5, 6]. International guidelines suggest
      therefore preoperative oral nutritional support for malnourished patients undergoing major
      surgery [9]. However, it remains controversial whether standard enteral nutrition (SEN) or
      immunonutrition (IN) is preferable [9].

      IN, containing arginine, ribonucleic acid and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids aims to
      improve the nutritional status, immunological function and clinical outcome [5, 10].
