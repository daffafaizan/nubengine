      training (PFMT) is recommended as first line treatment but PFMT is not always efficient and
      some women cannot comply with the intensive PFMT needed to obtain effect because of weakened
      or damaged muscles caused by vaginal delivery and age related changes.

      Hypothetically alternative methods could be used to enhance the effect of a strength-training
      program. A low intensity training program with a simultaneous partial occlusion of the blood
      supply for the training muscle, so called "Kaatsu" training has been found to increase muscle
      strength faster than ordinary strength training but with much less effort. It seems difficult
      to make occlusion of the pelvic floor muscles during PFMT but a study found that low
      intensity training of the quadriceps femoris with partial occlusion of the blood supply did
      not only increase muscle strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle but also of the biceps
      humeri muscle if that muscle was trained with low-load training and no occlusion in the same
      training session. The specific reason for this this "cross-transfer effect" could not be
      fully explained but it was believed to be caused by a systemic effect caused by growth
      hormones. The aim of this study is therefore to examine if Kaatsu training offered in
      relation to a low-load PFMT program can increase the effect of PFMT in women with SUI
