      into low satisfaction with treatment. Unstable glycemic profile resulting in high glycemic
      variability depends on the adjustment of insulin dosing to the current needs of the organism.
      The calculation of prandial insulin dosing is a complex process which involves such factors
      as preprandial blood glucose level, the amount of food taken, the glycemic index of
      carbohydrates, the insulin/carbohydrate exchange ratio, the active insulin level following
      the previous bolus. Currently, in patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion (CSII) insulin pumps are equipped with bolus calculators which help to calculate
      prandial insulin dosing and thus contribute to improve post-prandial blood glucose levels.

      The aim of the study was to determine whether the patient's support expert VoiceDiab system
      have stabilised diurnal glucose profile in children with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin
      pumps.
