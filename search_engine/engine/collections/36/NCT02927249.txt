    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial of aspirin (300 mg
      daily) in early stage node-positive HER2 negative breast cancer patients. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 within stratum defined by: Hormone Receptor status (HR positive vs HR
      negative), body mass index (<30 vs â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) and stage (Stage II vs III).

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect of aspirin versus placebo upon
      invasive disease free survival (iDFS).

      Primary objective To compare the effect of aspirin (300 mg daily) versus placebo upon
      invasive disease free survival (iDFS) in early stage node-positive HER2 negative breast
      cancer patients.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To compare the effect of aspirin versus placebo in early stage node-positive HER2
           negative breast cancer patients upon:

             1. Distant disease-free survival

             2. Overall survival

             3. Cardiovascular disease (see Section11.3)

        2. To compare the toxicity of aspirin versus placebo in early stage node-positive HER2
           negative breast cancer patients.

        3. To assess adherence to aspirin and placebo among early stage node-positive HER2 negative
           breast cancer patients.

        4. To bank tumor and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), plasma and urine collected at
           baseline and sequential plasma and urine collected 2 years later for future measurement
           of inflammatory markers.

        5. To determine if there are subgroups of participants characterized by lifestyle factors
           associates with greater inflammation for whom there is greater benefit of aspirin versus
           placebo upon iDFS.

      Patients are followed up to 10 years after study enrollment.
