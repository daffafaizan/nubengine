      the introduction of 'malaria camps' by the Odisha State Malaria Control Program where teams
      of health workers visit villages to educate the population, enhance vector control with
      long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and perform
      village-wide screening with rapid diagnostic tests and treatment for malaria. The camps
      appear to be very effective but this is hard to assess in the context of ongoing changes such
      as LLIN introduction. The long-term goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      malaria camps (MCs) by determining if they reduce malaria, and to characterize malaria
      transmission in MCs. The major objective to achieve this is through a quasi-experimental
      study (i.e., pretest-post-test control group design) of the effectiveness of the
      intervention, to determine if MCs reduce the prevalence of clinical and asymptomatic malaria
      as detected by PCR. In the first year, villages will be assigned across three study arms: arm
      1 to receive new MCs; arm 2 is a control with no MCs but with standard malaria control; and
      arm 3 consists of villages already in receipt of MCs to study longer term effects. In the
      second year, both arm 1 and arm 2 villages will receive the intervention (i.e., a
      non-randomized stepped-wedge design). MC effectiveness will be evaluated from epidemiologic
      surveys and PCR detection of malaria prevalence with and without MCs.
