    
      This is a single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag to treat
      chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia（CIT）. These subjects have been treated with recombinant
      human thrombopoietin（rhTPO） or interleukin 11（IL-11） before, the platelets can rise to normal
      or reach the effective standard, but after the re-application, the effective standard is not
      reached, or the effective standard is still not reached after the rhTPO 300U/kg/d treatment
      for 14 days. The investigator will assess the changes of the platelet counts after the
      treatment of eltrombopag from week 1 to week 24, and observe incidence of adverse events
      during the treatment of eltrombopag.The investigator will complete the 4 weeks safety
      visits（once a week），if the subjects end or withdraw from the clinical trial.
