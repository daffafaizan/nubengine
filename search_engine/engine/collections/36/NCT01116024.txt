    
      The ATS 3f Enable Aortic Bioprosthesis is intended for those patients whose prognosis without
      surgical replacement of the diseased natural valve is unacceptably poor in terms of survival
      and/or quality of life in the opinion of the attending physicians. For these patients, there
      are a number of widely accepted prosthetic heart valves in use.
