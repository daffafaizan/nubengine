      randomly assigned to first-visit foam sclerotherapy- or to scheduled treatment group. The
      primary outcome for this study is time to ulcer healing.

      For this study, based on Oulu University Hospital's retrospective data (partly published in
      Pihlaja et al 2020) of venous ulcer healing the investigators assumed Hazard Ratio 1.5 for
      venous ulcer to heal in first-visit foam sclerotherapy group compared to scheduled treatment
      group.

      Assuming drop-out of 10% this study recruits total of 248 patients (a=0.05, b=0.2).

      For the primary outcome the follow-up time is one year. In both groups endothermal ablation
      and/or foam sclerotherapy are used to treat the ulcer-related insufficient veins and truncal
      insufficiency. Class 2 thigh-high compression, or best possible compression therapy patient
      tolerates is facilitated in both groups
