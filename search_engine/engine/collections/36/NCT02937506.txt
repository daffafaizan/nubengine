      commonly performed in outpatient surgery or endoscopy centers. There is an increase in the
      use of propofol for sedation because of the short duration of action and quick turn around
      time. Propofol has been studied extensively for safety and efficacy but patient satisfaction
      and preference with use has not been well documented in prospective, randomized setting. In
      the context of the recent changes in healthcare reimbursement where patient satisfaction is
      becoming an important metric providing data that could improve patient satisfaction is
      needed.

      Patients who presented for a colonoscopy with the Principal Investigator were approached to
      participate in the study. After obtaining consent the patients were randomized to anesthesia
      with propofol or control without propofol per random number tables provided by the
      statistician. The anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist were asked to remove the paper with
      the assignment from the envelope to determine which medications to give the patient. Pre-op,
      intra-op, and post-op data were collected by registered nurses blinded to the anesthetic. The
      day one follow-up phone call was made by the resident who was blinded to the anesthetic. Data
      were collected in the pre-op, intra-op, and post-op areas by the researchers who were blinded
      to the medications used.
