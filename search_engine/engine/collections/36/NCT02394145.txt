      mortality, and confers an increasing risk of stent thrombosis even when dual antiplatelet
      therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) is administered. Patients with severe CKD or end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) exhibited higher platelet reactivity to clopidogrel
      than did those with normal renal function. We recently reported platelet inhibition by
      ticagrelor was markedly greater than by clopidogrel in patients with ESRD on HD. But exact
      mechanism of high platelet reactivity in ESRD patients was not fully evaluated. A possible
      postulation would be genetic influence. To investigate this issue, we will evaluate genetic
      polymorphism in patients with normal kidney function and ESRD on HD according to different
      doses of clopidogrel and ticagrelor. Genetic test will be assessed polymorphism of ABCB1,
      PON1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and P2Y12.
