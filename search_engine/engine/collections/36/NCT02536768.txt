      track initiation counseling for patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy; 2) Enhanced
      adherence counseling for unstable patients on HIV treatment; 3) adherence clubs for stable
      patients on HIV treatment; 4) decentralized medication delivery for stable patients on HIV
      treatment; and 5) early tracing of all patients who miss an appointment by two weeks. This
      study will also estimate for each study site an overall "adherence guideline impact" to
      provide an indication of the effectiveness of the package as a whole.

      In addition, the study will estimate the cost of each of the interventions listed above
      compared to standard of care. Finally, the study will describe the cascade of care for
      tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes, three other chronic diseases for which little
      information currently exists. To evaluate these interventions the study team will work with
      the National Department of Health (which will implement the interventions) to randomize 24
      clinics in 4 provinces 1:1 to receive the interventions or continue standard of care. All
      evaluations will use data routinely collected by the clinics, with no study interaction with
      subjects. A total of 8,256 patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 20 months to
      estimate short- and long-term outcomes.
