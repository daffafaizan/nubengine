      pericardial tissue. The tissue is created by treating bovine pericardial tissue with Edwards
      Integrity Preservation. It incorporates a stable capping anticalcification process, which
      blocks residual aldehyde groups known to bind with calcium. Tissue preservation with glycerol
      allows the valve to be stored without a traditional liquid-based solution, such as
      glutaraldehyde. Therefore, valve is stored under dry packaging conditions and consequently
      does not require rinsing prior to implantation.

      The novel tissue preservation technology significantly improves hemodynamic and
      anticalcification properties compared with the standard Perimount valve in an ovine model
      (Flameng et al., 2015). The RESILIA tissue has been studied in the COMMENCE trial: Two year
      data show that the NYHA class improved in 65.7% of patients, effective orifice area after
      implantation was 1.6 ± 0.5 cm2; mean gradient was 10.1 ± 4.3 mmHg; and paravalvular leak was
      none/trivial in 94.5% of patients (mild to moderate in 0.5%) (Puskas et al., 2017).

      On the sizes 19 - 25 mm the INSPIRIS RESILIA Aortic Valve™ has been outfitted with the VFit
      technology, which incorporates two novel features designed for potential future
      valve-in-valve procedures: fluoroscopically visible size markers and an expandable cobalt
      chromium alloy band. No clinical data are available that evaluate the use of the INSPIRIS
      RESILIA Aortic Valve™ in patients to date.
