      than in IBD patients without any other affected family members, the investigators designed
      genetic and fecal microbiome analysis for 60 patients form 30 families.

      After extracting the DNA from blood samples, whole genome sequencing will be performed and
      data will be comprared with the previously reported variances. Novel variances or incidence
      of specific variances will be measured.

      Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism array using Immunochip will be performed to search
      common genetic variants and to calculate genetic risk score of IBD.

      In this study, fecal microbiome is a surrogate marker for the enviromental aspect of
      pathogenesis of IBD. The investigators assumed that family members are sharing similar mode
      of lifestyle therefore we're presumed that their fecal microbial composition is alike.

      Comparing genetic and microbial datas altogether with the data from unaffected family
      member(Healthy internal control), investigators expecting to explain the genetic and
      enviromental aspect of IBD pathogenesis.
