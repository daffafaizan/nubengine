      effects on the quality of life, pain, and related functional status in women with bilateral
      hallux valgus (HV). Study included 27 right-dominant women. Demographic data, HV angle,
      weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing subtalar pronation (SP), and navicular height were
      recorded. Visual Analog Scale, Foot Function Index (FFI), and the American Orthopaedic Foot
      and Ankle Society (AOFAS) MTP-IP along with AOFAS Mid foot (MF) Scales, and SF-36 were used.
      HV angle, weight-bearing SP, and pain intensity of the left foot were higher. HV angle of
      left foot was correlated with all sub-sections of FFI, pain parameter of AOFAS MTP-IP, and
      pain and total score of AOFAS-MF Scale ). HV angle of left foot was correlated with physical
      role, pain, and social function sub-domains of SF-36. Right HV angles were correlated with
      right foot pain and non-weight-bearing SP.Increasing HV angle and pathomechanical changes in
      rear foot were correlated. Besides, although all participants were right-dominant, their left
      foot problems were more highlighted.
