      specifically visceral fat is metabolically active and can be detrimental to health. Abdominal
      obesity is especially high in postmenopausal women (prevalence rates 50- 70%) in whom
      estrogen deficiency may lead to accumulation of excess visceral fat. Although estrogen
      replacement therapy is effective in preventing visceral fat accumulation, its adverse effects
      warrant a search for a safer phytochemical that exerts estrogenic properties. Soy, containing
      isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds), is a promising dietary component in reducing abdominal
      obesity in menopausal women. The favorable effects of isoflavones were already demonstrated
      in animal studies.The effects of soy compounds as a dietary component in preventing and
      reducing abdominal obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities will be examined among
      menopausal Women. We will use quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging (qMRS/I)
      to determine dose and effects of soy supplementation for preventing and treating abdominal
      adiposity. The results from this study will shed light on the application of soy as a novel
      dietary approach in preventing and managing abdominal obesity among peri- and early
      menopausal women.
