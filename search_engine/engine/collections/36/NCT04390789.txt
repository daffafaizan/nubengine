      followed by cleaning, shaping and obturating the canals.Although initial root canal therapy
      has been shown to be a predictable procedure with a high degree of success, failures can
      occur after treatment. Recent publications have reported failure rates of 14%-16% for initial
      root canal treatment. In order to prevent tooth loss in such cases, nonsurgical retreatment
      or apical surgery is often indicated.

      In this study subjects will be assigned to either the single-visit and multi-visit
      nonsurgical endodontic retreatment. The allocation will be performed once the chemomechanical
      preparation is completed.

      Clinical and radiographic success rate will be considered as primary outcome. Follow up will
      be carried out every 3 months, till 12-month period.

      Pain intensity will be considered as secondary outcome.
