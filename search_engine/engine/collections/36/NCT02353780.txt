    
      Single center, randomized, assessor-blinded, observational longitudinal assessment. Subjects
      will be randomized to treatment with an anti-TNF therapy, tocilizumab or abatacept and
      evaluated at baseline, and after 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy. All biologics will be
      administered subcutaneously (SQ). A blinded assessor will perform clinical disease activity
      assessments and blood samples will be obtained for mechanistic studies.

      After randomization, patients must take at least one dose of the assigned medication and must
      maintain their baseline prednisone and oral disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)
      medications until they have received their first dose of assigned medication to be considered
      per protocol participants. During the first 3 months of therapy, patients and their
      physicians will be permitted to taper but not increase corticosteroids. Adjustments of study
      medication or oral DMARDs will not be permitted during the first 3 months of the study except
      as outlined in the protocol. Adjustments or additions of analgesics will be permitted
      throughout the study period.

      Following randomization and treatment initiation, study participants will be seen in the
      clinic at 1 month (3-5 weeks), 3 months (10-14 weeks), and 6 months (22-30 weeks) after the
      initiation of therapy; at each time point, a blinded clinical disease activity assessment
      will occur and blood samples will be obtained for mechanistic studies. The occurrence and
      severity of unanticipated problems will be recorded continuously throughout the study.
