      treatment and long-term treatment of corticosteroid and immunosuppressor.

      If patients are eligible, which CMV-DNA are more than 10^3 copies, it will be randomly
      distributed in low-dose IL-2 and ganciclovir group, or ganciclovir group. Low-dose IL-2 is
      defined as 1 million IU per day subcutaneously, The CMV-DNA levels will be monitored until it
      turned out to be negative. In this period, we will simultaneously monitor the immune response
      in regard to CMV infection, including innate immune response, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, natural
      killer cells, and adaptive immune response, such as CMV specific CD8+ T cells, T helper cells
      and so on.

      We will follow these patients for at least 3 months after drug withdrawal. If patient
      belonging to any of these two groups develops a viral infection, then the patient will
      receive treatment with ganciclovir.
