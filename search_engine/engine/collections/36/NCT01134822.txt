    
      The overall objectives of this study are

        -  Discover and validate novel biomarkers and gene expression profiles for use in
           subsequent intervention studies in patients with IPF

        -  To prospectively validate a panel of previously published biomarkers in patients with
           well characterized idiopathic fibrosing lung disease

        -  Investigate genetic associations and epigenetic modifications which affect disease
           severity and progression

        -  Prospectively evaluate longitudinal disease behaviour in patients with IPF and NSIP with
           a view to developing composite clinical end-points for subsequent use in intervention
           studies in patients with IPF

      Biomarkers that can be used for the following purposes will be identified:

        -  Identify patients (Diagnostic)(e.g. discriminate between health and disease)

        -  Correlate with disease severity (extent of disease, staging of disease)

        -  Predict clinical progression (Prognostic)(stable vs progressive disease)

        -  Track response to therapy (Therapeutic response)- Predict response to known efficacious
           treatments & Correlates with changes in clinical endpoints/mortality/quality of life

        -  Predict risk of exacerbations (could be used to prevent exacerbations or reduce their
           severity)

        -  Correlate with complications and/or comorbidities (e.g. biomarkers of Pulmonary Arterial
           Hypertension, Gastro Oesophageal Reflux in IPF, etc)
