      development due to the chemical substances it contains, especially carbon monoxide and
      nicotine. According to the hypothesis of this study presented, the effects of smoking on the
      fetus can be determined by the liver circulation and hepatic metabolism. The basic assumption
      of this project is; Compensatory and pathological findings can be seen in the fetal liver
      circulation in babies of mothers who smoke and the findings can be valuable in predicting the
      direction of fetal development (growth retardation or normal development). In this study, the
      flow and shunt amounts in the fetal hepatic vessels in normal and smoking pregnant women will
      be calculated with the help of Doppler US.Therefore, we try to delineate pathological
      circulatory pattern in these fetuses and shed light to the mechanism of smoking-induced
      abnormal fetal development. In addition, the effects of other maternal demographic factors,
      cigarette amount, cotinine and expiratory carbon monoxide levels (or any correlation between
      them) on hepatic circulation and fetal development will be examined.
