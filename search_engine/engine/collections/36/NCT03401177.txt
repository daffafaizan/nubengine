      known about the long-term effect in early phase tendinopathy, when used as a supplement to
      treatment as usual, namely heavy slow resistance training and training load reduction. In
      this study, NSAIDs will be used, which works through COX inhibition, which again inhibits
      Prostaglandins, in this way investigators attempt to dampen the initial inflammation and
      pronounced cell activity that is thought to be present in early phase tendinopathy. With this
      project, it will be attempted to investigate whether initial dampening adds to the effect
      achieved through heavy load resistance training, which is thought to stimulate structural
      repair and regeneration in the tendon, by applying appropriate load to the tendon tissue,
      thereby stimulating the tendon cells to repair and regeneration.
