      resection of sessile colorectal polyps sized â‰¥20 mm conducted with intention to treat
      analysis. Detailed data regarding lesion characteristics (size, location, Paris
      classification, granular or non-granular surface morphology and Kudo pit pattern),
      procedural, clinical and histological outcomes and complications are noted. Multivariate
      analysis will be performed to identify risk factors for Endoscopic Mucosal Resection failure
