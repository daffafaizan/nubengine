      birth in a shorter delay as possible, but minimizing the risk of multiple pregnancies. TLT
      was introduced few years ago in clinical practice and allows the continuous follow up of the
      embryo development. In IVF centers, embryos are preferentially cultured in TL system with
      undisturbed environmental conditions. This provides information about the development of the
      embryos in time intervals of 15min and adds kinetic criteria for embryo evaluation and
      selection. In conventional incubator, the follow up of embryo development consists in 3
      static time point observations. Many reviews and observational studies have discussed the
      value of time-lapse monitoring but it is as yet unclear, however, whether the TLT improves
      the results of IVF. It has been suggested that the clinical benefits of applying new
      technologies should be verified and documented by randomized controlled trials. Moreover, the
      cumulative live birth rate and the delay for conception were rarely reported. The study aims
      to evaluate the results of the first IVF attempts comparing classical embryo culture in
      standard incubator and embryo culture and follow up in TLT. The hypothesis is that the
      undisturbed culture and the selection based on continuous time-lapse images improve the
      results of the single embryo fresh transfer and increase the cumulative live birth rate.
      Patients will be randomized the day of the puncture for the type of culture: standard
      incubation or TLT. The results of the fresh and successive vitrified-warmed embryo transfer
      will be prospectively collect and patients will be followed until live birth. The attempt
      will be considered ended after a live birth, if all the frozen embryos are transferred, after
      24 months follow up or after surrender.
