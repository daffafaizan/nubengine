      by decreased platelet count and increased risk of bleeding, primarily due to immunoglobulins
      G(IgG)autoantibodies opsonizing the individual's platelets,resulting in markedly enhanced Fc
      receptors(FcR)-mediated phagocytosis and destruction by macrophages in the
      reticuloendothelial system within spleen Severe ITP defined as :Patients who have clinically
      relevant bleeding that mean that patients have bleeding symptoms at presentation sufficient
      to mandate treatment,or occurrence of new bleeding symptoms requiring additional therapeutic
      intervention with a different platelet-enhancing agent or an increased dose.Prednislone is
      the standard intial first-line therapy in naÃ¯ve ITP patients.Prednislone is usually given at
      0.5 to 2mg/kg until platelet count increase(>30-50 *10^9/L )which may require several days to
      several weeks,however prednisone should be rapidly tapered after 4 weeks to avoid
      corticosteroid related complication. In a trial to shorten the duration and reduce adverse
      effects of corticosteroids treatment. Dexamethasone in a dose of 40mg/day has been
      administered for 4days (equivalent to~400mg of prednisone per day) achieved 85% initial
      reponse and sustained response 50% of adult cases of ITP at 6 months follow up
