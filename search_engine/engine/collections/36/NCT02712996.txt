      following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most prominent symptoms
      manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other functional domains.
      Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat TBI-acquired
      attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This study, by
      highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of this type of
      treatment for the patients.
