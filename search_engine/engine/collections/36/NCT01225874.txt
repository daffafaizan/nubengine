        -  To provide the clinical and laboratory data necessary for placing each patient with ALL
           onto the proper therapeutic trial. (Classification)

        -  To provide an administrative base to capture classification data for correlative studies
           in ALL treatment protocols and series of historical protocols. (Classification)

        -  To provide appropriate induction regimens for patients who may then enter risk specific,
           post-induction therapeutic trials. (Induction therapy)

        -  To determine the correlation between event-free survival (EFS) and the following
           measures of minimal-residual disease (MRD)/early response (ER): 1) the rate of
           peripheral blast count disappearance and the absolute blast count on day 8 as determined
           morphologically, by flow cytometry, and using molecular techniques; 2) Marrow morphology
           on day 8, and; 3) MRD as determined by flow cytometry and molecular techniques on bone
           marrow and peripheral blood samples on day 29. (Induction therapy)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Classification study: Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples are collected and may be
           analyzed for B- and T-lineage antigen screening; cytochemical stains; cytogenetics
           (karyotype); immunophenotype screening for MLL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1; immunophenotype
           detection of minimal-residual disease (MRD); FCM ploidy (DNA index); trisomies 4 and 10
           (FISH); molecular testing for BCR/ABL, MLL rearrangements, E2A-PBX1, and TEL-AML1;
           molecular detection of MRD - Tγ, Tδ, or IgH; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell
           bank; special T-ALL reference laboratory studies (role of tumor suppressor genes in
           T-ALL and drug sensitivity profiles in T-ALL); special study for mature B-ALL
           [t(18;14)(a24;q32)] by FISH; and hematopathology consultation concerning morphology and
           cytochemistry. The immunophenotype results are used to assign patients to a treatment
           protocol, to assign patients to post-induction (day 28) risk group and treatment for
           patients with B-precursor (non-T, non-B) ALL, and to use as reference laboratory MRD
           results.

        -  Induction therapy study: Patients are entered on stratum 3 (three drugs) for NCI
           consensus standard-risk disease (age < 10 years and WBC < 50,000/mm³) or stratum 4 (four
           drugs) induction therapy for NCI consensus high-risk disease (age ≥ 10 years and/or WBC
           ≥ 50,000/mm³ or CNS3 disease or testicular disease).

             -  Stratum 3: Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-28;
                vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM)
                on day 4, 5, or 6; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; and methotrexate IT on
                day 8 (some patients also receive methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22).

             -  Stratum 4: Patients receive oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-28; vincristine
                sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; IM SC-PEG E. coli asparaginase IM on days 2,
                5, 8, 12, 15, and 19; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-20 minutes on days 8,
                15, and 22; and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 8 (some patients also receive
                methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22).

      Based on day 29 bone marrow results, patients may start consolidation therapy, undergo
      retesting in a week, or receive 2 additional weeks of therapy. Additional therapy comprises
      oral prednisone thrice daily for 14 days; vincristine sulfate IV and daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15-20 minutes on days 29 and 36; and IM pegaspargase on day 29, 30, or
      31. After successful remission induction, patients are assigned to COG-P9904, COG-P9905, or
      COG-P9906 based on the classification study.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration on day 8 to determine the prognostic significance of
      early remission in the context of this therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 4 years and
      annually thereafter.
