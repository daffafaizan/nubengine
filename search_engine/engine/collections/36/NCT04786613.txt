      patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis is intra-articular hyaluronic acid therapy. In
      this prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, interventional study, a total of 90
      patients with stage 2-3 knee osteoarthritis according to the kellgren lawrence classification
      who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Eligible participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of the three groups using computer-generated random numbers. In
      the first group, 2 ml linearly linked 20 mg 1.0% hyaluronic acid injection in 5 sessions, in
      the second group 2 ml linearly linked 32 mg 1.6% hyaluronic acid injection in 3 sessions and
      in the third group 2.4 ml linearly linked 48 mg 2.0% hyaluronic acid injection in a single
      sessions will be applied. Participants are going to evaluate before injection, and at the
      1-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain
      during activity, at rest, and at night, with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) change in pain, stiffness and physical function score, the
      change in the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) time and the change in the patient's daily
      activities with the numerical global patient assessment scale.
