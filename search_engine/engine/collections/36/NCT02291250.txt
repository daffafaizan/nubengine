    
      Sixteen overweight/obese volunteers from the Aberdeen area will be recruited into a
      randomised controlled study. Volunteers will be randomised into four groups matched for BMI
      and age and given 200 grams of blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins) or greencurrants
      (which naturally contain no anthocyanins), followed by an OGTT.

      The consumption of the currants will be followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
      with Polycal (complex carbohydrate) or glucose (simple carbohydrate) as the carbohydrate
      load.

      There will be a one week minimum wash out period between each intervention. All interventions
      will be randomised and blinded as far as possible in a cross-over design where the volunteers
      are acting as their own control. The volunteers will be asked to consume a low phytochemical
      diet three days prior to taking the currants all occasions. In addition, they will be asked
      to record what they ate over the same period in a simple food diary.

      The following intervention will be carried out on 16 overweight/obese male/postmenopausal
      female non-smoker volunteers:

        1. Control: sugar matched (matched to currant sugar content) water with polycal (complex
           carbohydrate load)

        2. Blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins; 200grams) with polycal (complex carbohydrate
           load)

        3. Blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins; 200grams) with glucose (simple carbohydrate
           load)

        4. Greencurrants (which naturally contain no anthocyanins; 200grams) with polycal (complex
           carbohydrate load)

      Note: the polycal will contain the equivalent glucose load as given in intervention 3
      assuming complete hydrolysis of all carbohydrates.
