      motor function by NIBS in patients with CP. We hypothesize that NIBS can augment the VCT
      effects on neuromotor control and UE motor function in patients with CP because combined
      therapy integrated peripheral modification techniques (VCT) and central modulation (NIBS).
      These effects may further enhance the activity of daily living (ADL), participation, and
      health related quality of life (HRQOL). This project is executed in the following two phases:
      to investigate the augmented effects of VCT on neuromotor control and UE motor function in
      patients with CP by rTMS in phase 1 (0-1.5 years) and tCS in phase 2 (1.5-3 years).
