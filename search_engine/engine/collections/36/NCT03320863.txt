    
      Fifty subjects will be selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomized to either
      the intervention group or the sham control group. Each subject will be randomly fitted with
      an Enso or a sham device and will be instructed to self-administer treatment daily for one
      hour or more per day for four weeks in both cohorts. Throughout the duration of the study,
      data will be recorded via a smartphone application regarding treatment usage and intensity,
      pain levels, the subject's impression of any changes in their functionality, and their opioid
      and non-opioid medication intake. Medication usage will also be tracked through the use of
      CURES 2.0 information and pill counts at specified study visits. Additional functional
      testing will be conducted at each study visit.

      At the 4 week visit, the study blind will be broken, and subjects who were randomized to the
      sham group will be given the opportunity to cross over for an additional week in the study,
      using the active device.
