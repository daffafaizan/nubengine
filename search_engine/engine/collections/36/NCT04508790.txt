      I. To estimate the response rate and to evaluate the antitumor activity of the three-drug
      combination, leflunomide, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone, in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution,
      time course, and duration.

      II. To obtain estimates of response duration, depth of response, clinical benefit, and
      survival (overall and progression-free).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) on days 1-28, pomalidomide PO on days 1-21, and
      dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
