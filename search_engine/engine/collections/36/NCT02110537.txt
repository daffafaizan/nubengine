      sham-controlled clinical trial with 2 parallel arms. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      acupuncture, a total of 80 persistent AF participants will be recruited and randomly assigned
      to active acupuncture and sham acupuncture group. Both group commonly take antiarrhythmic
      medication during study period. These patients who are resistant to drug therapy will get a
      electrical cardioversion. After cardioversion, the recurrence rate and duration of atrial
      fibrillation free time will be evaluated.

      This trial consists of 2 weeks of observation and medical therapy, 2 weeks of acupuncture
      intervention before EC, EC and acupuncture intervention, 7 weeks of additional intervention,
      and 5 weeks of follow-up. After randomization, participants receive 10 sessions of
      acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks. The outcome is assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 week
