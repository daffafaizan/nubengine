      and stroma outside of the internal epithelial lining of the cavum uteri, affecting up to 10%
      of reproductive age women. It is rarely found in extrapelvic locations.This form of
      endometriosis may be difficult to diagnosis due to pleomorphic presentation. Despite complete
      excision with a safe margin and histopathological examination has been considered as
      definitive diagnosis and primary therapeutic treatment for extra-pelvic endometriosis, what
      is understood mainly comes from case reports and retrospective observations with limited
      number of cases. Moreover, approximately 6%-14% of patients with PEM who had underwent
      narrowly operative resection still suffered recurrent lesions, while risk factors were barely
      identified.

      Patients with endometriosis at different sites in our hospital were collected for analysis of
      clinical characteristics namely demographic information, medical history, surgical records,
      pathological and imaging reports, serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), peri-operative
      medication. During long-term follow-up, prognosis of individuals could be identified by
      telephone or clinical interview. Based on data from medical records or clinical observation,
      risk model predicting recurrence will be established by comparing patients with different
      outcomes or exposed to different risk factors. Thus, management of endometriosis might be
      improved. Hopefully, pathogenesis of recurrent and primary endometriosis might be explained.
