      measure the effects of vitamin D at (10,000IU/day) versus placebo on balance and falls in
      Parkinson's disease. The investigators will measure static, dynamic, and ambulatory balance,
      as well as strength, falls, and cognition before and after 16 weeks of therapy. Dynamic
      posturography will be used to measure static and ambulatory balance, a device called
      iMOBILITY will measure a timed up and go, and strength will be measured with the Biodex
      machine checking knee flexion and extension. Multiple quality of life and cognitive tests
      will also be performed.
