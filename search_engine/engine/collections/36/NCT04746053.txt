      development abnormalities. HNF1b is also a candidate gene involved in the development of the
      renal tract and the Mullerian system but there is no data in the literature regarding the
      ovarian function and clinical gynecological profile of these patients.

      The main objective of this study is to study the ovarian function of patients with HNF1B
      abnormality, followed in the reference centers of Toulouse and Paris University Hospitals.
      The secondary objectives are to know the gynecological profile of these patients.

      A dosage of AMH will be added to the usual balance, whatever the phase of the cycle and a
      pelvic ultrasound will be performed. Patients will be received in a dedicated consultation to
      complete a questionnaire on gynecological and obstetric history, as well as their personal
      and family history. There will be no gynecological examination during this consultation.
