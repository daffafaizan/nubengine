      study aims to: (1) evaluate whether excitatory tDCS of the mPFC and inhibitory tDCS of right
      dlPFC enhances exposure therapy relative to sham tDCS; (2) determine whether tDCS effects are
      moderated by baseline negative prognostic indicators; and (3) determine whether tDCS effects
      are mediated by pre-post changes in vigilance to threat, in-session fear reduction, and
      contextual memory for the exposure context. If successful, the project may discover a
      potentially effective exposure therapy augmentation, and may enhance knowledge of the
      behavioral, cognitive, affective, and neurobiological factors that moderate and mediate acute
      treatment response and maintenance of treatment gains. This knowledge may inform treatment
      development efforts for more debilitating forms of pathological fear.
