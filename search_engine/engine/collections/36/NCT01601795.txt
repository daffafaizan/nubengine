      The study will compare the maximum postoperative troponin levels in the isoflurane and
      sevoflurane groups as a direct quantitative marker of damaged myocardial cells. Maximum
      troponin levels should be reached within the first 24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      A) Hemodynamic stability during on-pump

      The investigators will compare the hemodynamic stability during CPB between the isoflurane
      and sevoflurane group. Therefore the total dosage of noradrenaline used during the surgery
      will be measured.

      B) Washin and Washout Kinetic

      Kinetics of washin and washout of sevoflurane and isoflurane during CPB will be investigated
      and described.

      C) Extubation time and length of stay in the intensive care and in hospital

      Time to extubation and the length of stay in intensive care unit and in hospital will be
      documented.

      D) Mortality after 30 days

      The mortality after 30 days will also be monitored. If the patient is no more in the hospital
      a phone call will be made.
