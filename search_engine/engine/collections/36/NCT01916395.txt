    
      Migraine is a neurovascular process involving the brain and related structures.
      Neuroinflammatory substances such as CRP, CGRP, VIP, SP, and prostaglandins are liberated
      during the migraine. Elevation of these markers may be associated with other conditions which
      contain an inflammatory component such as coronary artery disease. VIP is an inflammation and
      pain transmission, and thus are markers of sensory nociceptive neurons.

      During this study, the subjects will have the following inflammation markers analyzed:
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Vasoactive Intestinal
      Polypeptide (VIP), and Substance P (SP).
