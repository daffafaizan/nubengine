      (LDH), but the mechanism remains unclear.The existing researches mainly focus on the
      mechanical mechanism of the local stability reconstruction of the lumbar spine. Our previous
      study found that LDH patients have lumbar CNS motion control disorder, and preliminary
      studies have shown that Tuina can improve the lumbar CNS motion control efficiency, also fMRI
      studies found that abnormal motion related brain areas had an active trend during the acute
      phase and a suppressed trend in the chronic period.Therefore,we hypothesize that Tuina could
      improve the lumbar CNS motion control in LDH patients, and could response to the effect of
      local mechanical lumbar as well as bidirectionally regulate the function of lumbar
      stabilizers, which facilitates the stable reconstruction of lumbar. This project will
      illuminate the effect of Tuina improving the lumbar CNS motion control by applying the latest
      fMRI, surface electromyography and data mining technology to the acute and chronic LDH
      patients with a combination of efficacy and experimental verification to reveal the mechanism
      of CNS bidirectional regulation of paraspinal muscle activity by the response of related
      brain regions to mechanical effects after Tuina on the lumbar. This project provides a new
      thinking to the research of the therapeutic mechanism of LDH, which is a scientific
      significance.
