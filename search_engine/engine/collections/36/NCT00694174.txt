      Painful procedures (injections, heel lances, and circumcisions) are part of normal routine
      newborn care. Studies have demonstrated that newborns have increased sensitivity to pain when
      compared with older children and adults. Pain assessment and management is an important
      component in the overall care of the newborn infant and safe, effective analgesics are
      needed.

      Pain assessment is complicated by the infants' verbal and cognitive limitations. Heart rate,
      blood pressure and oxygen saturation are commonly monitored in the nursery in response to
      pain, yet these parameters are affected by handling, illness, medications, as well as by
      pain. Skin blood flow has been documented to increase in premature newborns undergoing
      painful procedures in the Newborn Intensive Care Nursery. In the present study, Laser Doppler
      Imager technology will be used to define changes in skin blood flow response to heel lance
      and oral sucrose administration in normal newborn infants.
