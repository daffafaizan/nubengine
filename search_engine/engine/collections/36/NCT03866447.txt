      common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80-90%
      of teenagers. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty Many
      treatment options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes; such as eating
      healthy, medications (topical and systemic) and medical procedure.Despite of the availability
      of many therapeutic modalities, none of them has proved to be ideal. Recently, Vitamin D was
      proved to be an exciting option for treating many chronic inflammatory dermatological
      diseases. It appears to have systemic antimicrobial and other effects that may be crucial in
      a variety of both acute and chronic illnesses. Vitamin D regulates the immune system,
      Furthermore, it has antioxidant and anti-comedogenic properties. So, Vitamin D deficiency
      maybe involved in the pathogenesis of Acne Vulgaris . Thus,Vitamin D use could potentially
      reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescription and boost therapeutic response, either as a
      monotherapy or in combination with other anti-acne medications. High glycemic food intake and
      excessive consumption of dairy products as well as of saturated fatty acids were all
      suggested to have an influence on AV course. In addition, obesity has been reported to be
      associated with acne. Interestingly, genetic studies found out that obesity can drive down
      vitamin D levels So, there seems to be a theoretical background about the association between
      Acne Vulgaris, Vitamin D and obesity
