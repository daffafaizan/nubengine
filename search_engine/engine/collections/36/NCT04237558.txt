    
      Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. It is the commonest major gynecological
      surgery, next to caesarean section, with millions of procedures performed annually throughout
      the world.Approximately 90% of hysterectomies are performed for benign conditions.

      Although there are many approaches to hysterectomy, which depend on clinical criteria,
      certain patients may be eligible to be operated in any of the several available approaches.
      The optimal route of hysterectomy for a patient will depend on the pathological nature, size
      and shape of the vagina and uterus, uterine descent, endometriosis and the likelihood of
      pelvic adhesions, adnexal masses, previous pelvic surgery, available hospital technology,
      devices and the surgeon's preference.

      Approaches to hysterectomy may be broadly categorized into four options: abdominal
      hysterectomy (AH); vaginal hysterectomy (VH); laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) where at least
      some of the operation is conducted laparoscopically and robotic-assisted hysterectomy
      (RH).Vaginal and laparoscopic procedures are considered "minimally invasive" surgical
      approaches because they do not require a large abdominal incision and, thus, typically are
      associated with shortened hospitalization and postoperative recovery times compared with open
      abdominal hysterectomy.

      This study will be a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the surgical performance and
      outcome of total laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to non-descent vaginal hysterectomy,
      using bipolar vessel sealer, in cases of abnormal uterine bleeding in order to reach the
      optimum technique with lower cost to be easily applied to low resource settings.
