      the general population and many populations with other chronic diseases. This exceptional
      risk is explained in part by known risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other
      uremia-related factors, including vascular calcification and stiffness, autonomic
      dysfunction, and a high burden of circulating inflammatory mediators. However, additional
      unidentified risk factors also likely contribute to the disproportionately high prevalence of
      cardiovascular morbidity in hemodialysis patients. Blood pressure variability may represent
      one plausible cardiovascular risk factor. Data from nonuremic human populations show an
      association between greater blood pressure variability and cardiovascular events,nonfatal
      cardiovascular events,stroke,and increased left ventricular mass. There has been
      comparatively little work examining the causes and effects of blood pressure variability in
      hemodialysis populations. So the purpose of this study is to explore the factors associated
      with interdialytic blood pressure variability in maintenance hemodialysis patients,
      especially the association between volume status and blood pressure variability.
