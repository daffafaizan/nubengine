      disability in individuals under 50 years of age. Many different health organizations
      (American Headache Society etc.) recommend regular physical activity and exercise for the
      treatment and prevention of migraine. However, the relationship between aerobic exercise and
      migraine is still not completely clear. Unfortunately, a research database to validate the
      benefits of exercise for people with migraine is still being developed.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of physiotherapy program and review the
      associations between neck movements, pain, temporomandibular movements and quality of life in
      individuals with migraine.

      The study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region
      (2020-06-30 No.BEC-SR(M)-266).
