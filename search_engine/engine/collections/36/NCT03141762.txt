      first 12 months post hospital discharge in patients following an ICU admission. It also aims
      to determine factors at hospital discharge which may predict future falls risk at 12 months
      and examine the physical activity levels of ICU survivors. Furthermore, it also will
      investigate the relationship between falls, fear of falling and activity limitations and
      participation restriction. It is a multicentre study over three sites: UK Healthcare,
      Melbourne Health and Austin Health. All adult patients in intensive care that have been
      mechanically ventilated for over 24 hours, and remain in the ICU more than 4 days will be
      considerer for inclusion. The primary outcome measure is a 12 month falls diary which
      commences on hospital discharge. There will also be Physiotherapy assessments just prior to
      hospital discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months post hospital discharge.
