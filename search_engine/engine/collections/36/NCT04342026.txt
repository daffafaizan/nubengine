      surgery in childhood, increases the risk of fertility disorders and cancer. As a major public
      health objective, it's the subject of numerous recommendations. Its frequency is increasing
      in some countries faster than a single genetic cause could not explain it. It may occurs in a
      geographic cluster. The cause of cryptorchidism involves genetic, hormonal and environmental
      factors. Animal studies suggest that endocrine disruptors interfere with fetal testicular
      migration. The aim of the study is to find out if some environmental exposition may be
      associated with cryptorchidism.
