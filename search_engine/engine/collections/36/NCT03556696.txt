    
      Prospective Randomized Monocentric Clinical Trial during propofol anesthesia.

        -  inclusion: ASA 1, 2 or 3 adult patients scheduled to undergo burn wound surgery in a
           Burn Center (University Hospital of Lille, France)

        -  arm 1 : Remifentanil will be automatically administered by an expert system guided by
           heart rate, blood pressure and the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI).

        -  arm 2 : Remifentanil will be administered by a target controlled device using the Minto
           pK/pD model.

        -  propofol is administered throughout the procedure with a target controlled device using
           the pK/pD model of Schnider. The target will be guided by the BiSpectral index values.

        -  primary endpoint : overall normalized remifentanil administration.

        -  secondary endpoints : relative amount of time spent in a state of hemodynamic reactivity
           ; relative amount of time the ANI spends in the [0-50], [50-70] and [70-100] windows ;
           relative amount of time the BIS spends in the [0-40], [40-60] and [60-100] ; hemodynamic
           status at various times during anesthesia ; total amount of target modifications of
           remifentanil and propofol ; total amount of morphine administered in PACU ; total amount
           of ketamine administered in PACU ; incidence of nausea/vomiting in PACU ;
