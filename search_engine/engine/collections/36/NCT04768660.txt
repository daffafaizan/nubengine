      shown promising results in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus is chewing gum after
      surgery. However, this has not been investigated in upper gastrointestinal surgery such as
      pancreatic surgery. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chewing gum
      treatment on patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy due to pancreatic or periampullary
      cancer.

      This study was conducted as a phase-III trial. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic tumours
      scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy were included. The treatment group received chewing gum
      postoperatively and standard care. Controls received glucose solution and standard care.
