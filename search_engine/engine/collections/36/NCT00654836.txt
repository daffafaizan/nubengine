      Primary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients with locally recurrent or
           metastatic breast cancer treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
           nanoparticle formulation, and bevacizumab as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate in these patients.

        -  To determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and bevacizumab IV on days 1, 22 and 43.
      Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8 ,15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archived tumor tissue samples are assessed by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) for various biomarkers. Levels of Notch-1, Notch-4, cyclin A,
      cyclin B, Jagged-1, and DLL4 in tumor-associated endothelial cells are correlated with
      response in both estrogen- and progesterone-positive and negative tumors, and independently
      of p53 status.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
