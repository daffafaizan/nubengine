      organ damage. Increased sympathetic nerve activity is reported to be one of the mechanisms of
      morning hypertension; however, there are no available data that show whether strict home
      blood pressure control, especially in the morning period, can reduce target organ damage.We
      will evaluate whether strict morning blood pressure control by sympathetic nervous system
      blockade using an alfa-blocker, doxazosin, and with the addition of a beta-blocker if needed,
      can reduce hypertensive target organ damage.
