      properties of kava, a natural dietary supplement. The investigators will conduct a one week,
      double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial of kava, dosed at three 75 mg capsules per
      day, vs placebo, in adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Clinical measures of anxiety,
      blood, and urine will be obtained. Biomarkers of interest include PRKACA, cortisol, urinary
      TCE, and NA5HT. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment. The participants will
      also be followed for 12 weeks after the end of treatment to identify any potential rare
      adverse events, particularly liver toxicity, that appear in a delayed fashion.
