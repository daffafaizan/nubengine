      by dose-dependent toxicity, primarily myelosuppression, and by the emergence of
      drug-resistant HIV strains. It is anticipated that the combination of AZT with either ddI or
      ddC may promote higher antiviral efficacy, with acceptable toxicity and less likelihood of
      development of drug-resistant strains, than AZT alone.

      Approximately 1200 patients are randomized in a 2:1:1:2 ratio to one of the following four
      treatment arms: AZT plus ddI, AZT plus ddI placebo, AZT plus ddC placebo, and AZT plus ddC.
      Average follow-up is 2 years.
