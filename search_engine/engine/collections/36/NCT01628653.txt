      consisted of 24 one-hour face-to-face sessions (Lee, Park et al. 2009) was developed based on
      the spaced retrieval training (SRT), which was effective in improving memory retention span
      of very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease patients. The Ubiquitous SMART (U-SMART) by
      transforming the current SMART to a self-administered program using an application working on
      IPAD was developed, and was examined its feasibility and efficacy in the elderly individuals
      with mild cognitive impairment.
