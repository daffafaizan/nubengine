      and Swain 1996; Josseffson et al 2001; Yoshida et al 2001) and 23% to 36% in the developing
      world (Rahman et al 2003; Patel et al 2002; Husain et al 2006).

      In developed countries, studies indicate that maternal depression is associated with
      long-term emotional, cognitive and behavioral problem in children. There is evidence of link
      between maternal psychopathology to physical health of child. Research evidence also
      indicates that long-term negative impact of postnatal depression is on the mother's mental
      health, on infant's development and on the marital relationship (Reay, Fisher, Robertson,
      Adams and Owen 2005).

      because of high prevalence of maternal depression in low income countries like Pakistan, the
      present study is designed to test the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for women
      with maternal depression. The participants will be recruited from Civil hospital Karachi and
      also from three different communities. total 50 participants will be recruited and randomized
      to 2 groups: either intervention or TAU group. Assessment will be done on baseline, after
      completion of intervention and 3 months after completion of intervention. Assessment will
      include Edinburg Postnatal depression scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder-7 and Rosenberg Self Esteem scale. Participants in intervention group will
      receive 12 sessions of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)
