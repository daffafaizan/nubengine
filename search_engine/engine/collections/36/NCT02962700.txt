    
      A prospective, randomized, clinical study ,including septic shock patients with acute renal
      failure, aged over 16 years. Patients were randomized to receive either CVVH or IHD for renal
      replacement therapy. Intermittent haemodialysis was carried out during the first 4 h at day 1
      and day 2 of the study period. Systemic haemodynamics and interstitial tissue concentrations
      of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained at baseline, 6, 12,18 and 24 hours
      after initiation of renal replacement by using muscle microdialysis.
