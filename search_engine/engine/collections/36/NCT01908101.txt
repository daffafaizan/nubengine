      I. Progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Frequency of alopecia with absence or decrease to < 50%.

      II. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia of < 30%.

      III. Incidence of sensory neuropathy (all grades) to < 25%.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the role of circulating endothelial cell precursors (CEPs) and apoptotic
      circulating endothelial cells (CECs), in predicting early response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
