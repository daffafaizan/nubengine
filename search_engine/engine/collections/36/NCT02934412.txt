    
      This study will consist of a 27-day screening period (Days -28 to -2), clinic check-in (Day
      -1), a treatment day (Day 1), a 10-week treatment period and a study completion evaluation
      (Day 71) as shown in above figure.

      A review of blinded interim PK data will be conducted by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) to
      confirm the study sampling schedule captures the full PK profile of SHR-1314. This interim
      analysis will be conducted for Cohort 1 and may be conducted for subsequent cohorts if serum
      SHR-1314 concentrations in Cohort 1 or any of the subsequent cohorts are below the limit of
      quantification of the assay preventing evaluation of the PK profile.

      The expected duration of participation for each subject will be up to 99 days. Subjects who
      are withdrawn for reasons other than safety may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.
