    
      The severity of dysmenorrhea pain experienced by subjects will be evaluated on a VAS, ranging
      from zero (no pain) to ten (very severe pain). Subjects will be asked to use the VAS scoring
      system to record, on a provided sheet, their experienced menstrual pain level daily during
      menstrual bleeding for a total of three consecutive menstrual cycles.
