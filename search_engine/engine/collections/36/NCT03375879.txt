      ptosis surgery provides any benefits for the patient or is unnecessary. The investigators
      hope to show through questionnaires based on the patient's experience after their surgery to
      see if the bandage contact lens has provided any benefit for the patient. This is a
      randomized control trial in which patients undergoing bilateral ptosis surgery (Fasanella
      servat procedure) will have one of their eyes randomized to receive a bandage contact lens
      after surgery while the other eye will not receive anything.In this randomized control trial,
      patients requiring surgery with bilateral ptosis will have one eye randomized to receive a
      bandage contact lens whereas the other eye will not after their surgery. Follow up will occur
      in one week where the outcomes will be obtained through questionnaires.
