    
      This multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase 2 will investigate the efficacy and safety
      of PVSRIPO alone (Arm 1) or in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor (Arm 2). Following a 6
      participant safety run-in period, up to approximately 50 participants with cutaneous or
      mucosal melanoma who previously failed anti-PD-1 blockade will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      either PVSRIPO or PVSRIPO plus an anti-PD-1.
