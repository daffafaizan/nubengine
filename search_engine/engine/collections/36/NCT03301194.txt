      The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the RAMP-HT of the HA in
      primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

      The objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the long term (5-year) effectiveness of RAMP-HT compared to usual care in
           reducing cardiovascular complications, end-stage renal disease and all-cause mortalities
           in a cohort of primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline

        2. Estimate the direct medical cost of RAMP-HT and other health services among primary care
           HT patients with or without complications

        3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT, compared to usual care, in gaining one QALY
           in primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension

      Hypotheses:

        1. RAMP-HT is more effective in reducing 5-year cardiovascular complications, end stage
           renal disease and all-cause mortality among primary care patients with uncontrolled
           hypertension compared to usual care

        2. The direct medical cost of RAMP-HT patients, for the same disease complication status,
           is not higher than that of usual care except for the RAMP-HT cost

        3. The direct medical cost of HT patients with one or more complications is higher than
           that of HT patients without any complication

        4. RAMP-HT is cost-effective compared to usual care, i.e. ICER per QALY gained is below the
           threshold value of 1 annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita of Hong Kong, which
           is the benchmark recommended by the World Health Organization
