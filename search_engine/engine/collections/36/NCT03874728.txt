      University of Liverpool. Participants will be subjected to several standing and walking tests
      while wearing three types of footwear in a randomised order: (i) a minimal shoe, (ii) a
      conventional shoe, and (iii) barefoot. Participants' physical function, stability during
      standing and walking and an activity of lower leg muscles will be assessed in each of those
      three footwear conditions. Participants will also be asked about perceptions of footwear,
      regarding a minimal shoe and a conventional shoe. At the end of assessments, participants
      will be asked to complete several walking bouts while wearing a minimal shoe with "smart"
      shoe insoles, to determine "smart" insoles' validity in obtaining gait characteristics
      against a gold standard measure. Finally, those participants who volunteer to take part in a
      two-week follow-up study, will be asked to wear the minimal shoes with "smart" insoles during
      daily life for two weeks, After two weeks, they will be asked to fill in an online
      questionnaire asking them about total time they used the minimal shoes and insoles and about
      how satisfied they were with them.
