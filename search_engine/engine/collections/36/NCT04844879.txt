    
      This is a prospective, multicentre, single-arm, open, confirmatory clinical investigation to
      assess the efficacy and safety of a navigation system providing personalized soft tissue
      balance data in medially-stabilized total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      Participants will be informed about the study, both orally and in writing, during a
      preoperative visit. The investigator will answer any questions that may arise and will
      collect the informed consent. During the study, enrolled participants will be able to
      withdraw at any time and for any reason.

      The study is conducted according to the following schedule:

        -  V1 : Inclusion during a preoperative visit

        -  V2: Surgery

        -  V3: Follow-up visit at 2 month post-surgery

        -  V4: Follow-up visit at 6 months post-surgery

        -  V5: Follow-up visit at 12 months post-surgery

      The following data will be collected:

        -  Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Knee Society Score (KSS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and
           patient satisfaction at 6 months and 12 months of follow-up;

        -  Radiological analysis at 2 and 12 months of follow-up;

        -  Surgical time (min);

        -  Necessity of soft tissue release to obtain ligament or patellar balance;

        -  Time to discharge (days);

        -  Device deficiencies and peri- and postoperative adverse events.

      A web-based data collection tool will be used as Electronic Data Capture (EDC). All the
      information required by the protocol will be collected in electronic case report forms
      (eCRF).

      The statistical analysis will be performed according to a pre-established statistical
      analysis plan. Missing values will not be replaced by estimated values but will be considered
      as missing in the statistical analysis.
