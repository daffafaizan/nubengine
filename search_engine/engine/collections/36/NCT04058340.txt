    
      Three visits have been planned during the entire study. During the first visit, all patients
      included in the study will have the following procedures: questionnaire tests, lung function
      tests, taste perception tests (gustometry) and exfoliative cytology of the nasal mucosa.

      Patients with confirmed Pseudomonas aeruginosa presence in the airways will be randomly
      assigned to the Lactizole-Placebo group and the Placebo-Lactizole group, with a
      recommendation to take laktizol (3 ml) for 3 weeks at the concentration determined during the
      preliminary examination, in the nebulization 2 times per day) or placebo (3ml 0.9% NaCl
      solution in nebulization 2 once a day). The first nebulization of the solution issued during
      the visit will take place during the visit; each patient will undergo a clinical and
      spirometric assessment after 20 minutes of observation from completed nebulization.

      During the second visit (after 4 weeks from visit 1), the first visit procedures will be
      repeated for all patients. Patients in the Lactizole-Placebo group will be recommended to
      take a placebo for 4 weeks (3 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution in nebulization 2 once a day); on the
      other hand, patients from the Placebo-Lactizole group will be advised to take lactisol for 4
      weeks (3 ml of the solution in the concentration determined during the preliminary
      examination, in the nebulization 2 once a day). The first nebulization of the solution issued
      during the visit will take place during the visit; each patient will undergo a clinical and
      spirometric assessment after 20 minutes of observation from completed nebulization.

      During the third visit (after 4 weeks from visit 2), the first visit procedures will be
      repeated for all patients.
