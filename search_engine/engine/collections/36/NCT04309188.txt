      literature is demonstrating enhanced sports performance using stroboscopic vision
      training.1,2,5 The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to measure the effect of
      a stroboscopic visual training in a high school softball season in comparison to controls.
      Athletes in the control group will go through normal practice drills for hitting and
      fielding. The stroboscopic training (experimental group) will use the strobe glasses during
      hitting and fielding drills two times a week in practice. The brand of strobe glasses is
      Senaptec Strobe. Athletes in both the experimental and control groups will have their vision
      assessed at the beginning of the season and end by The West Texas Vision Center. Measurements
      for vision will include developmental eye movement, vergence ranges, Randot stereopsis test,
      accommodative ranges, acuity, and stereo scores. On-field performance measurements will be
      collected for batting statistics including on-base percentage, batting average, slugging
      percentage, and hard-hit ball percentage in both the experimental and control groups. The
      current year batting statistics will be compared with the prior year statistics if enough
      at-bats occurred. In addition, to the vision and on-field hitting performance proprioception
      balance using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) will be measured at the beginning of
      the season and end for both groups. Our data will provide quantified information for coaches,
      athletes, and health care providers concerning the benefits of the strobe glasses warrant
      buying to enhance sports performance. Additionally, we wish to determine whether visual-motor
      and proprioception balance changes occur after the training.
