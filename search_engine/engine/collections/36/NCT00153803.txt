      its oral administration and favorable adverse event profile makes this agent an excellent
      candidate to incorporate into combined modality therapy in the early stages of lung cancer.
      Based on these data, erlotinib is an attractive novel approach to maintenance therapy in
      unresectable stage III NSCLC following completion of concomitant chemoradiation. Although, a
      subset of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC will be long-term survivors following
      chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy, the vast majority relapse within the first year
      following therapy and eventually die from chemotherapy refractory disease. We hypothesize
      that the introduction of an potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the epidermal growth factor
      receptor following effective concomitant chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin
      will prolong the progression-free survival time for these patients.
