      resting metabolic rate on energy intake in individuals at or close to energy balance.

      The present study was based on secondary analysis using the non-intervention control
      conditions of five separate studies conducted between the dates of 1998 and 2007. In total,
      242 subjects (114 males; 128 females; mean body mass index = 25.6 Â± 5.0 kg/m2) were included.
      In these studies, body composition (air displacement plethysmography), energy expenditure
      (indirect calorimetry and flex heart rate) and energy intake (weighed dietary records) were
      measured using common procedures.
