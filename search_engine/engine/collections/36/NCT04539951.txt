      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) according to APA（American Psychological
      Association）guideline. Nevertheless, a large proportion (40% or more) of patients response
      only partially or not at all to treatment with a SSRI. On the basis of the existing sparse
      literature, pharmacotherapy options for treatment-refractory OCD outlined in current
      treatment guidelines include 1) treatment with higher than usual doses of an SSRI, 2) switch
      to a different SSRI, 3) switch to a different class of medication, 4) augmentation with a
      dopamine blocker, and 5) augmentation with a glutamatergic agent. This proposed Randomized
      Controlled Trial (RCT) study is a multi-center clinical study with a total of 13 centers that
      specialize in OCD patients. A randomized block design will be used in this study and all
      eligible participants accepted into this study will undergo an initial course of
      pharmacotherapy (phase I), and non-remmitters will be randomly allocated to five treatment
      arms (phase II). In phase I all participants will be treated for sertraline for 12 weeks.In
      phase II,The 5 arms will comprise 1) treatment with higher than usual doses of sertraline, 2)
      switch to fluvoxamine, 3) switch to venlafaxine, 4) augmentation with memantine, and 5)
      augmentation with aripiprazole. Clinicians and patients will know which treatment arm is
      being employed, but raters will be kept blind to treatment group.
