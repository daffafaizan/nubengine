      failure which necessitates invasive mechanical ventilation. It is well known that one of the
      bundles for enhanced recovery of such cases is the daily interruption of sedation . Recently
      studies have demonstrated the feasibility of just using sedation for initiation of mechanical
      ventilation, then utilization of no sedation technique as a more this offers less side
      effects .
