      I. To determine the efficacy of nivolumab in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) in
      terms of overall response rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour on days 1 and 14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
