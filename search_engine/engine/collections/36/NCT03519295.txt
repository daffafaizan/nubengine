    
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is a rare disease, its incidence increases
      worldwide and no standard therapy is currently available to treat metastatic or relapsing
      cases. SCCA is mostly induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) infections with HPV-related
      oncoproteins (E6 and E7) expressed in more than 90% of cases.

      Based on the preliminary results of the Epitope-HPV02 study and although it provide proof of
      concept data on taxane-based chemotherapy efficacy in SCCA, complete responses observed after
      6-8 cycles of chemotherapy has not translated into long-term remissions .

      Combining immunogenic chemotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 might be a convenient way to increase
      the diversity of antigens released by tumor and T cells.

      So for the SCARCE study, we hypothesized that combination of mDCF (8 cycles) with MPDL32801
      (12 months) might induce synergy and improve the rate of long-term PFS rate.

      The aim of the SARCE study is to provide a valuable proof of concept to establish immunogenic
      chemotherapy and anti-PDL1 as a standard of care for SCCA patients with poor clinical
      outcomes and to take advantage of the presence of HPV antigens in most patients (HPV 16 and
      18 genotypes are involved in 90% of SCCA) to set up a specific immunomonitoring program based
      on tumor samples and blood-derived lymphocytes to better understand the potential synergisms
      between immunogenic chemotherapy and anti-PDL1 and to identify valuable biomarkers of
      treatment efficacy.
