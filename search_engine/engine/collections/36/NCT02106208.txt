    
      This is a multi-center randomized crossover controlled feeding study. Briefly, adult men and
      women will be recruited in the Quebec City and Winnipeg metropolitan area through the media
      (newspaper, radio), local lipid clinics and mailing lists (n=90).

      Participants will be randomized to a series of 5 experimental diets of 4 weeks each: 1-
      Cheese diet, 2- Butter diet, 3- Carbohydrate (CHO) diet, 4- MUFA diet, 5- PUFA diet. Usual
      energy intake will be estimated at the beginning of the study using validated tools.
      Experimental diets will be provided as part of a full feeding protocol under carefully
      controlled isocaloric conditions to maintain body weight constant. All meals and foods will
      be provided to participants so that control for energy and macronutrient intake will be
      optimized. The breakfast meal will represent approximately 30% of the daily energy intake
      whereas the lunch and dinner meals each will provide 35% of daily energy intake. Participants
      will be instructed to consume their entire meals. A seven-day cyclic menu will be used. The
      diets will be separated by washout periods of 4 weeks. Blood samples will be collected on two
      consecutive days before and after each dietary phase. The mean of the two consecutive
      measurements will be used in the analyses.
