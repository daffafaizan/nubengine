    
      This is a double-blind, sham-surgery controlled study of stereotactic, intracranial injection
      of SB623 cells in patients with fixed motor deficits from ischemic stroke. The study will be
      conducted at approximately 65 sites in the United States.

      Two cohorts, Group 1 (2.5 and 5 million SB623 cells combined) and Group 2 (sham placebo),
      will be included in this study. Subjects who are randomized into this study will receive
      either 2.5 million SB623 cells, 5 million SB623 cells or sham surgery at a 1:1:1
      randomization ratio. Randomization will be performed via an interactive web/voice response
      system (IXRS), stratified by Screening mRS score (recorded in the IXRS at the clinical site).
