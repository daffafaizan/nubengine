      deficiency and to confirm a specific diagnosis. Patients with a known immunodeficiency
      syndrome are studied in detail to identify the gene mutation, to assess the effect of the
      mutation on the gene product, and to establish cell lines for further in vitro assessment of
      the genetic defect. The function of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP) in hematopoietic
      cells is studied.

      Family members of patients with X-linked disorders are studied to identify carrier females.
