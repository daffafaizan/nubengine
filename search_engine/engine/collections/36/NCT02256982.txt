      cholangiocarcinoma. Radiation therapy is used for many other types of malignancies, but its
      use for the treatment of this form of gastrointestinal cancer has been limited. This
      treatment is still being studied as research doctors are trying to find out more about its
      use in the treatment of your form of gastrointestinal cancer. Short course photon radiation
      and short course proton beam radiation therapies are FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
      approved radiation delivery systems. This study will also test the safety of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is treatment given as a first
      step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery, is given.
      Adjuvant therapy is additional cancer treatment given after the primary treatment to lower
      the risk that the cancer will come back.

      The current standard of care for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is to offer
      surgical resection to all patients who have resectable disease and are able to tolerate a
      major surgical intervention.

      The study interventions involved this trial may include one or more of the following:

        -  Chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and Cisplatin)

        -  Surgical Resection and Lymphadenectomy

        -  Radiation Therapy
