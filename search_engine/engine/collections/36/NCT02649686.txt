      called trastuzumab that targets the HER-2 receptor. Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many
      types of cancer. This drug is an antibody and laboratory tests show that it works by allowing
      the immune system to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune response. This may help
      to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown
      to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it
      is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.

      The use of durvalumab when receiving standard treatment is being studied because it is
      thought that one way of over-coming resistance to the standard therapy is to add a drug that
      activates the immune system, as durvalumab has been shown to do, thus "re-sensitizing" immune
      function to kill cancer cells.
