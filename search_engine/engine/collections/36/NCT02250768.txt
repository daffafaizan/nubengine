      RIF was defined as patients failed to conceive (beta-hCG < 5 mIU/mL) after at least 03 embryo
      transfers (fresh and frozen) with 06 top quality embryos or more.

      Ovarian stimulation was performed using GnRH antagonist protocol. All matured oocytes were
      inseminated by ICSI. Injected oocytes were cultured in medium supplemented with 2ng/ml of
      GM-CSF (Embryogen, Origio) until day of transfer. Embryo evaluation was performed at ﬁxed
      time points of 18 and 44 hour after fertilization. Embryo transfer was performed 2 days after
      ovum retrieval.

      Luteal-phase support was provided using progesterone gel (Crinone 8% 90 mg, twice a day;
      Merck Serono) and estradiol per os (Valiera 2mg, twice a day; Laboratorios Recalcine). Serum
      hCG was measured 16 days after oocyte retrieval, and if positive, an ultrasound scan was
      performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12.
