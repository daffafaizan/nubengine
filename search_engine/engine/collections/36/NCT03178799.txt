      However, most fracture sufferers did not receive secondary prevention for osteoporosis to
      decrease future fracture risks. Since 2014, the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH)
      Healthcare system established fracture liaison services and were certified as gold (main
      hospital, MH) and silver (Beihu branch, BB) medal for best practices. Our preliminary results
      showed that compared with national average data, hip fracture patients under FLS may have
      lower mortality rate. However, randomized control trial (RCT) is still needed to confirm
      results from observational studies.

      Aims: to compare clinical outcomes for patients under FLS and usual care at the NTUH MH and
      BB.

      Method: Four hundred subjects with new hip fracture or newly identified vertebral fracture
      are randomly assigned into FLS and usual care (UC). FLS subjects received
      osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultations on diet, medications, exercise,
      fall preventions given mainly by care managers with followed up telephone call at 4, 8, 12,
      18, 24 months then annually for up to 10 years. Care managers will perform baseline
      assessments and follow them by telephone annually for up to 10 years for UC subjects. Major
      outcomes include bone mineral density assessment rate, calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis
      medication initiation and adherence rate, fall and fracture incidences, mortality, and
      healthcare resource utilizations.

      Anticipated results: Provide evidence on benefit of FLS in RCT on osteoporosis evaluation,
      medication initiation, mediation adherence, calcium, vitamin D, protein, exercise adherence,
      fall, re-fracture, mortality and other outcomes.
