      As a standard of care, you will be having surgery to remove allograft tissue that has failed
      or because there were other complications following your earlier transplant. You will be
      separately consented for this surgery, which will describe the procedure and its risks in
      detail.

      Tissue Research:

      If you agree to take part in this study, leftover sample of the removed allograft bone will
      be collected and used to learn about the properties (such as bone strength, bone density, and
      new bone formation) of the removed transplant tissue. This tissue will be stored at the
      University of Arkansas for use in this study. Any remaining leftover tissue will be destroyed
      by the end of December 2011.

      Data Collection:

      Before you have surgery, you will have an x-ray. This is also part of standard of care. If
      you take part in this study, this x-ray will be used to learn about the properties of the
      transplant tissue.

      All other information will be coming from your medical record, either from your past visits
      or as a result of your surgery. The information being collected will include information
      about your graft during the time it was within your body and observations made by your
      surgeon at its removal.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after your tissue and data are collected.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 200 patients will be enrolled on this multicenter
      study. Up to 20 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
