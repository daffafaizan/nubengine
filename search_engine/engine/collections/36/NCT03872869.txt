      programs for individuals with X-ray-verified hip OA. The patients were randomized to 1 of 3
      groups; namely Hip School, TCA, or a group receiving no intervention. A total of 89 subjects
      attended the baseline appointment and were randomized to one of the three groups. Physical
      function was assessed using, the Hip Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (HOOS, Swedish version L.K
      1.1), an observational assessment of movements the Body Awareness Scale Movement Quality (BAS
      MQ) and the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). For assessment of HRQL the Medical Outcomes Study
      36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used. The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES)
      records the patient's self-reported judgment of what he/she can do regardless of the degree
      of functional limitations or skill. Six months after the final intervention all subjects were
      examined and assessed following the same procedure as at baseline. The 12 months follow-up
      contained the three questionnaires, HOOS, ASES and SF- 36 were sent out by mail. The results
      showed significant improvement in physical function and self-efficacy within the
      interventions groups Tai Chi and Hip School. The Tai Chi showed improvement in BAS MQ,
      focusing on body awareness and quality of movements, and in self-efficacy between baseline
      and 6- month follow-up. The Hip School group showed significant improvement in BAS MQ between
      baseline and 6-month follow-up.
