      will receive the telephone follow-up (five calls for six months: 1st call in one week and the
      others calls month by month until six months) and two face to face counseling (1st meeting in

      hospital discharge.

      The educational program consist in information about the use of Warfarin and approach the
      specific topics in Power Point®Slides: Physiology: Definition of oral anticoagulants,
      mechanisms of action and clinical indication; Medication: Dose, time, storage and duration of

      their units; Signs /Symptoms: Report underdose (thrombus formation) and overdose (bleeding),
      seek health care.

      After the orientations with Power Point®Slides, the patients receive one booklet with the
      same informations and the researcher answer any questions that patients have about the
      anticoagulation therapy.

      In this moment (at hospitalization) the researcher also collects the data about symptoms of
      anxiety and depression using the validated questionnaire.

      During the telephone calls the researcher talk with the patient about the topics that were
      approach in the educational intervention and motivate the patient to follow the
      recommendations for they have a successful treatment.
