      schematically divided into two portions: a vertical portion which mean that an increase in
      preload secondary to volume expansion will induce an increase in stroke volume; and a flat
      portion which mean that a same increase in preload will not induce an increase in stroke
      volume. Stroke volume increase is due to a myocardial contractility improvement. Nowadays
      this improvement cannot be assessed using classical monitoring used at the bedside (left
      ventricular ejection fraction, fractional area changes, etc â€¦). A new method is available to
      assess left ventricular contractility at the bedside. Two-dimensional speckle tracking images
      with echocardiography allows one to track a natural myocardial marker within the myocardium
      by standard transthoracic echocardiography. It provides unique insights into myocardial
      function such as tissue deformations and strain rate, which is the rate of deformation. This
      method is more sensitive than classical echographic left ventricular ejection fraction
      evaluation. Few data are available about the potential interest of speckle tracking to track
      an improvement of left ventricular contractility following a volume expansion in intensive
      care unit patients.

      This study is observational, prospective in one center. Patients needing a volume expansion
      will benefit from an echocardiography (stroke volume and longitudinal strain assessment)
      before and after fluid challenge (500mL of crystalloids).

      The follow up will be restricted to the duration of volume expansion. The last data will be
      collected just after the end of volume expansion.
