      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of from ESPO to monthly Pegol-Sihematide injection
      for the treatment of anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease（CKD）, who are on
      maintenance dialysis. Study included a period of 4 weeks for screening, 8 weeks for baseline,
      16 weeks for dose adjustment, 8 weeks for evaluation, and 28 weeks for extensional treatment
      period. All patients who passed the screening were received ESPO in baseline period, then,
      eligible patients were centrally allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive Pegol-Sihematide or
      ESPO. Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between
      10.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more. The primary efficacy end point was the
      mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation
      period; non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence
      interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher. Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis
      of an adjudicated composite end point.
