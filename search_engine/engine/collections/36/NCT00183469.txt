      disorder-related depression is especially complex because of the presence of mania symptoms.
      Lamotrigine and divalproex are commonly prescribed medications for depression. However, their
      effectiveness in treating bipolar depression has not been thoroughly evaluated. Studies have
      shown that combining lamotrigine with another antidepressant may be more effective in
      reducing depressive symptoms than lamotrigine alone. This study will provide participants
      with either lamotrigine alone or in combination with divalproex and will determine which
      regimen is more effective in reducing symptoms of bipolar depression.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to a daily regimen of either lamotrigine and
      divalproex or lamotrigine and placebo for 8 months. Participants will be assessed at study
      entry, at two unspecified times during the study, and at the end of the study. During each
      assessment, participants will undergo a brief interview and complete a questionnaire about
      their depressive symptoms, any physical manifestations of their depression, and their overall
      level of functioning in daily activities.
