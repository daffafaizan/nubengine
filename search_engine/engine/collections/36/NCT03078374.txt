      International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2,0 - 3,0 will be reached on anticoagulation therapy
      with Warfarin. Along with Warfarin, Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) will be administered in dose
      of 100mg per day. Enrollment for the study will take place in 1-6 weeks post implant of
      HeartMate 3. Low-intensity anticoagulation protocol will be started at 6 weeks after implant.
      Target INR of 1,5-1,9 will be maintained and ASA will be administered in dose of 100mg per
      day with adjustments based on VerifyNow testing. Follow up will last for 12 months after
      HeartMate 3 implantation. Subsequently, the objectives of the study will be analyzed and
      evaluated.
