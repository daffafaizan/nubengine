      a small number of patients. The effect of the pulses on the therapeutic window will be
      assessed.

      Stage 2 will perform a short-term chronic evaluation (30 minutes and if safe, 1 week) in a
      larger number of patients.

      In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (after 30 minutes):

      - MDS-UPDRS-III (Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part
      III)

      In essential tremor (ET) patients (after 30 minutes):

      - FTM (Fahn Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale)

      In PD patients (after one week):

        -  MDS-UPDRS-III

        -  PDQ-39 (Parkinson's disease questionnaire - 39 items)

        -  NMSS (Non-motor Symptoms Scale)

      In ET patients (after one week):

        -  FTM

        -  QUEST (Questionnaire for Quality of Life in Essential Tremor)

        -  MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)

      Stage 3 will then focus on long-term evaluation (upto 2 years). The same tests are used as
      after the one-week testing.
