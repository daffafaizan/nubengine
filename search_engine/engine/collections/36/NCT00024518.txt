      pancreatic beta-cells. The onset of clinical symptoms represents the endpoint of a chronic
      progressive decline in beta-cell function when the number of functional beta-cells descends
      below the critical mass required for maintenance of euglycemia ([1], [2]). However, the
      pancreas still retains the ability to produce a substantial amount of insulin. The goal of
      secondary prevention in T1DM is to avert further destruction of the remaining beta-cells and
      therefore delay or stop entry into the final stages of the disease associated with end organ
      damage.

      The rationale for this study is to interfere with the autoimmune beta-cell destruction early
      on in order to preserve as much residual endogenous insulin production as possible. We plan
      to administer oral interferon-alpha (IFN-a) on a daily basis, which has been shown to modify
      the clinical course of diabetes, to alter cytokine release, and reduce expression of T cell
      activation markers in an animal model ([3]) and a pilot project in humans (S. Brod,
      University of Texas, unpublished data). The one-year study is designed as a double blind
      randomized protocol using either 5,000 or 30,000 units of IFN-a versus placebo. Five centers
      will participate in this protocol (University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston;
      Dallas; Children's Hospital, St. Paul, MN; Kansas City and NIH, Bethesda, Maryland).
