      Occupational Therapy (OT) clinics according to limitation in participating of daily
      occupations. As well these children often demonstrate behavior or emotional difficulties. The
      primary treatment goal is promoting participation yet many times the treatment focuses on
      child's performance skills and not on occupation based activities. Respectively its outcome
      measures are the child performance skills. This study will document the therapeutic
      intervention, and evaluate its impact on child participation as well on his performance
      skills and emotional aspects. Participants will be recruited from waiting list for
      Occupational Therapy at Clalit Health services, Child Development Institute, and will be
      evaluate four times. First time on referral to waiting list ( At the present time due to long
      waiting list, children are waiting about three to four months before starting OT
      intervention), second time before treatment, third time after three of treatments and last
      follow-up after three months.
