      with remimazolam. Female subjects were selected because they represent the population at
      greatest risk for victimization in drug-facilitated sexual assault. In addition, females have
      a slower ethanol metabolism, therefore, the effects of remimazolam, if coadministered with
      alcohol, may last longer. Hence, this population represents the worst-case scenario in
      evaluating the risk of remimazolam misuse in drug-facilitated assault.
