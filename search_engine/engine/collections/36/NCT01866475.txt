    
      A prospective, study to determine the safety of intraosseous (IO) access for a period up to
      48 hours, in healthy adult volunteers and volunteers with a history of being
      health-compromised, including patients with mild to moderate renal disease (National Health
      and Nutrition Examination Survey Stage 1 to 3) and/or patients with controlled diabetes.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive IO access in the proximal tibia insertion site or the
      proximal humerus insertion site using the EZ-IO intraosseous vascular access system. The
      hypothesis is that there will be no serious complications for the subjects during a 48 hour
      IO catheter dwell time in either place.
