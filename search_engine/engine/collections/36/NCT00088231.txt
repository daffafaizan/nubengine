    
      Rationale: The purpose of this study is to combine PTK-787, a potent orally vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor (in disorders where VEGF is known to be
      involved in the pathophysiology), with Imatinib mesylate (IM), a protein-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor of abl, Bcr-Abl, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-Kit (in same
      disorders where these kinases are believed to be important). The potential synergy between
      oral agents that inhibit these kinases in disorders where each of the two agents have some,
      but inadequate, single agent activity is being studied in this protocol. We will also have an
      opportunity to assess if there is any correlation between response and individual kinase
      mutations e.g., c-Kit in patients with AML. If improved outcomes are observed, further
      studies will be indicated to investigate which, if either, agent is predominantly responsible
      for such a benefit - these studies will be facilitated by the availability of more potent
      e.g., (AMN107 as an abl inhibitor), (Bevacizumab, AG013736 as VEGF inhibitors) agents which
      will help to define the relative importance of the various inhibitory activities.

      Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTK
      787 and imatinib mesylate, when given in combination to patients with refractory acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP).

      To determine the efficacy (response rate, survival, time to progression, time to treatment
      failure, duration of response) of the MTD in these study populations.
