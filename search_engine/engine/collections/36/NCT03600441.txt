      Free Survival (PFS), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Overall survival (OS), safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and changes in health related
      quality of life. Patients may receive treatment until disease progression, death,
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. An independent data safety monitoring
      committee (iDMC) will evaluate the data pertaining to the futility and decide whether the
      study should stop or continue to the second stage. If the study continues to the second
      stage, a total of 139 patients will be studied.
