        -  Determine the complete response rate and one-year disease free survival of pediatric
           patients with HIV-related malignancies treated with interferon alfa.

        -  Determine the toxicity of interferon alfa alone and in combination with antiretroviral
           therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction: Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14.
           Patients with advanced stage III or IV undifferentiated lymphomas or B-cell acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia also receive hydrocortisone intrathecally (IT) combined with
           cytarabine IT on day 14.

        -  Maintenance: Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of induction
           receive interferon alfa SC 3 times a week beginning on week 1. Treatment continues for a
           minimum of 4-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients who received IT therapy during induction receive the same IT therapy at 4, 8,
           and 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually for survival until entry
      on another POG protocol.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within
      4.2 years.
