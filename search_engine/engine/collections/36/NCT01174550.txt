    
      Pragmatic randomized trial of clinical effectiveness of diagnostic testing strategies for
      coronary artery disease (CAD), to be performed in outpatient settings including acute and
      primary care and cardiology offices. Qualifying patients presenting with new or worsening
      symptoms suspicious for clinically significant CAD who require diagnostic testing and have
      not been previously evaluated will be randomized to an initial strategy of either anatomic or
      functional testing. All subsequent decisions regarding additional testing, medications and/or
      procedures will be at the discretion of the responsible clinical care team Within the
      functional testing arm, the subject's care team will select the specific test to be performed
      (exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), stress nuclear, or stress echocardiogram (echo))
      consistent with 'usual care' in that practice setting. The subject's care team will be
      provided with 'Information sheets' summarizing current standards for test interpretation and
      preventive care, but specific medical treatment will not be mandated by the trial.
