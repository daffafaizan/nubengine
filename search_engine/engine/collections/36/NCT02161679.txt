      combination with carboplatin administered in 3-week treatment cycles for up to 8 cycles, in
      patients with triple-negative breast cancer that have received at least two prior treatments.
      The secondary objectives are to obtain data concerning pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity.

      This is a multi-center study. Eighty patients are planned to be enrolled, with an equal
      distribution between the two groups. All patients will receive a starting dose of
      IMMU-132administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. For those
      patients assigned to also receive carboplatin, carboplatin will also be administered on the
      same schedules starting 30 minutes after the completion of IMMU-132 administration. Patients
      may receive up to a maximum total of 8 cycles (16 doses), but patients with a complete
      response, partial response or stable disease at that time, or patients who had achieved an
      objective response, but relapsed after discontinuing treatment, may continue to be treated
      based on physician discretion. Follow up is then required until resolution or stabilization
      of any treatment-related toxicity, and patients with stable disease or objective responses
      must also continue evaluations until survived.
