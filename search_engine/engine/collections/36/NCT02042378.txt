    
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) that inhibits a specific DNA repair pathway known as base
      excision repair (BER). PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown to effectively kill tumors
      with a defect in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Clinical benefit has been observed in patients with a gBRCA
      mutation as well as in those with a somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutation. Clinical data have also
      shown that pancreatic cancer patients with a gBRCA mutation benefit from PARPi treatment.
      Clinical activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer combined with the
      paucity of 2nd line therapies support evaluation of rucaparib in pancreatic cancer patients
      known to harbor a deleterious BRCA mutation.
