    
      The study objective is to develop a tailored based strategy for ovarian stimulation in IVF
      patients using AMH, BMI, AFC and inhibin B.

      300 patients will be stimulated with rec FSH and an antagonist pituitary inhibition protocol,
      and randomized (at random computer generated numbers) in 2 arms:

        1. control group: standard care recFSH based on age, basal FSH and AFC.

        2. study group: modified dose of Rec FSH based on AFC with a correction factor based on BMI
           and basal AMH level.

      FSH administration: 20IU per antral follicle (from 2-5mm) corrected as follows:

      Correction factor for

      AMH:

      <1 pMol/L X4 1-6 pMol/L X2 7-18 pMol/L X1 >18 pMol/L X0.5 BMI 16.5-18.5 X0.75 18.5-25 X1
      25-30 X1.25 30-35 X1.5 35-40 X2 Primary endpoints: number of mature follicles and eggs
      collected at egg retrieval; amount of rec FSH used.

      Secondary endpoints: fertilization rate; cleavage rate; clinical pregnancy rate; inhibin B
      and AMH levels during ovarian stimulation.
