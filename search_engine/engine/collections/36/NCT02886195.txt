      subjects recruited in this study are NSCLC patients mutant for EGFR gene (19del or L858R).

      Subjects in the concurrent therapy group were given EGFR-TKIs treatment plus concurrent
      chemotherapy. Patients in the sequential treatment group were assigned to sequential
      EGFR-TKIs followed by chemotherapy group, which received TKIs monotherapy and then
      chemotherapy alone after disease progression; and sequential chemotherapy followed by
      EGFR-TKIs treatment, which was given first-line chemotherapy for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by
      maintenance therapy with EGFR-TKIs.

      The endpoint of this study included clinical efficacy and safety.
