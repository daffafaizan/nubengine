      observed in HIV patients. Despite treatment, CMV retinitis can result in severe visual
      impairment and CMV disease is associated with reduced survival time. HIV patients receiving
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infection who have CD4 counts less than
      100 cells/mm3 may be at increased risk of CMV infection and its complications. Valganciclovir
      was approved by the FDA on March 29, 2001 for treatment of the symptoms of CMV retinitis in
      patients with weakened immune systems, including people with HIV and AIDS. This study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of valganciclovir in preventing CMV organ damage in HIV
      patients.

      This study will last approximately 6 years. Step 1 is the longitudinal screening phase of the
      study. Patients at high risk for CMV disease who are enrolled in the study will be screened
      every 8 weeks for CMV in the blood; medical history assessment, physical examination, and
      blood work will occur at each visit. Additional blood collection to monitor HIV infection
      will occur every 16 weeks. Patients will undergo opthalmologic examination every 24 weeks.
      Patients who develop detectable CMV in their blood during Step 1 then enter Step 2 of the
      study.

      In version 3.0 of this study, participants who test positive for CMV viremia or who are
      currently in Step 2 will be automatically enrolled into Step 4 and will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups: 1) 900 mg valganciclovir twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 900 mg
      valganciclovir daily, or 2) placebo. Participants will enter Step 3 if and when they develop
      CMV end-organ disease, at which point all participants will be offered 900 mg valganciclovir
      twice daily for 3 weeks, then 900 valganciclovir daily thereafter.
