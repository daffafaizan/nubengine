      of cannabidiol oral solution (OS) compared with SOC treatment for a period of 17 weeks in
      participants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The duration of Part A will be
      approximately 29 weeks total, which includes a 1- to 2-week screening period, a 4-week
      baseline period, and a 17-week treatment period (including a 2- to 5- week titration period).
      For participants who do not wish to continue into Part B of the trial, there will be an up to
      2-week taper period and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks after the end-of-taper visit).
      Part B will be available to participants who complete Part A of the trial and continue to
      meet all eligibility criteria, and for participants whom the investigator feels continued
      treatment in Part B represents a favorable risk-benefit assessment for the participant. Part
      B will evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of cannabidiol OS for a period of 52
      weeks in participants with TSC. All participants in Part B will receive cannabidiol OS. The
      duration of Part B will be approximately 59 weeks total, including a 2- to 5-week titration
      period for those participants randomized to SOC treatment only in Part A of the trial, a
      2-week taper period, and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks and end-of-taper visit).
