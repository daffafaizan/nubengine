      in the side with MOPs compared with the side without MOPs? Population: Orthodontic patients
      with bilateral extraction of the upper first premolar (Split mouth design trial)
      Intervention: Distal movement of the upper canine with Selective MOPs (distal to canine) in
      one hemi-arch Comparison: Distal movement of the upper canine without MOPs in the other
      hemi-arch Outcome: Canine and first molar movements

      GENERAL AIM:

      - To evaluate the effect of selective micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) on the amount of distal
      movement of the upper canine, the M-D inclination of the canine and the mesial movement of
      the upper first molar.

      METHODS

      OVERVIEW OF DESIGN Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial in split mouth design.

        -  Randomly assign upper canines in to 2 sides in a split mouth design study: one side to
           receive intervention (MOPs) and the other side as a control (without MOPs).

        -  Then follow both sides for three months

        -  Split mouth design method: The investigators are going to randomly assign to the
           patients' left or right sides, one side for the intervention and the other side for the
           control (to eliminate the possibility of selection bias).

        -  Blinding: It is not possible to blind participants and clinical staff, but the
           investigators are going to blind the operators who will perform the measurements and the
           data analysis (single-blinded).

      The participants will be with orthodontic fixed appliances (MBT prescription slot 0.022
      "x0.028", canine torque 0 °), with working arches 0.019 "x0.025" stainless steel and with
      bilateral extractions of the first upper premolars for 6 months or more. For this moment the
      crowding must be resolved and there must be a space of 3 or more millimeters between the
      canines and second premolars.

      The 4 upper incisors will be consolidated with a 0.010 "stainless steel ligature below the
      arch to prevent opening of anterior spaces.

      Observation:

        -  No transpalatal arch (TPA) will be used in any of the participants

        -  It is going to place a mini-implant in the palate for reference point before the start
           of the experiment PLANS FOR RECRUITMENT Patients of the Clinic University (UniCIEO) and
