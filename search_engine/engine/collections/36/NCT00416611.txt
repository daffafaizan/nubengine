      trained to implement guidelines in treating arterial hypertension.

      There will be a baseline recording of patients with arterial hypertension and then physicians
      will have to complete a one page form (by ticking pre-specified boxes) about the baseline
      status of the patients and will have to report the measures they took to improve awareness,
      treatment, and effective control of arterial hypertension. After a six month effort,
      physicians will have to complete the same form at study completion. Previous training of
      physicians and the fact that they will have to report their success in treating hypertension
      will hopefully contribute to an increase in number of hypertensive patients at blood pressure
      target, and will minimise the target organ damage. The estimated reduction in coronary heart
      disease risk will be evaluated by a comparison of this risk (as evaluated by a risk engine,
      i.e. PROCAM) at study completion with that of baseline.
