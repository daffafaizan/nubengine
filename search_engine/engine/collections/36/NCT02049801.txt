      I. Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MEK162 (MEK inhibitor MEK162) in patients with
      RAS-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when combined with sequential induction chemotherapy
      (3+4) as measured by development of grade 3-4 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analyze downstream inhibition of RAS signaling following therapy with single-agent MEK162
      with exploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) studies.

      II. Perform preliminary efficacy analysis of combination of MEK162 and induction chemotherapy
      (3+4) in patients with RAS-mutated AML by measuring complete remission rate, 2-year overall
      survival, and duration of response.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days -4 to -1 and days 5-18, cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 24 hours on days
      1-4, and idarubicin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Patients may receive a second course of
      induction at the discretion of the principal investigator.

      POST-REMISSION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 24 hours on days
      1-3, idarubicin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2, and MEK inhibitor MEK 162 PO BID on days
      4-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
