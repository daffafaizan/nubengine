      interventions for people with psoriasis. The aim of this study is to determine the benefits
      of individual psychotherapy on quality of life for people with psoriasis receiving medical
      treatment versus a control group (awaiting group) treated with medical treatment, without
      psychotherapy.

      This is an experimental randomized trial with control group. Quality of life, symptoms:

      pruritus, scaling and pain, distress and the illness will be measured before and after the
      intervention using psychological and quality of life questionnaires, and dermatological
      evaluations for 120 subjects.

      The investigators expect that the experimental group scores at the end of the psychotherapy
      program will be less than 4 points in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pruritus, scaling and
      pain. The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DQLI) expected to be less than 4 points from the
      initial score, and the patients are expected to present less than 7 points in Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The experimental group scores will be less than the
      control group for quality of life, symptoms and distress.
