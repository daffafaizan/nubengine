      or lead to more serious conditions, IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort and distress.
      The effectiveness of acupuncture in treating various conditions has been investigated in
      numerous studies. However, little is known about acupuncture's efficacy in treating IBS. This
      study will determine whether acupuncture can alleviate the symptoms of IBS, including pain
      relief with defecation, changes in stools, and changes in the frequency of bowel movements.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive bi-weekly sessions of either
      active or placebo acupuncture or no treatment for 6 weeks. Study visits will occur at study
      start, Week 3, and Week 6 (study completion). At each study visit, blood collection will
      occur to measure levels of cortisol, a stress hormone associated with IBS. Participants will
      also complete questionnaires about their IBS symptoms. Selected participants will be
      interviewed at each visit, in order to determine whether participants' interpretations and
      understanding of IBS influences their response to treatment. Any subject who does not receive
      active acupuncture during the trial is eligible for 6 free acupuncture treatments after the
      study is over.
