    
      To determine degree of vessel trauma and adverse remodeling of the proximal forearm radial
      artery, using ultrahigh resolution (55 MHz) ultrasound, following distal radial artery access
      (dTRA) for cardiac catheterization compared to standard forearm transradial access (fTRA) at
      90 days post-procedure. Secondary outcome measures will include metrics of procedural success
      at 24 hours, as well as functional assessment of pain and motor strength of the ipsilateral
      upper extremity at 90 days post-procedure.
