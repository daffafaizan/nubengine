    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 2D and 3D imaging performance of the CARESTREAM
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner ("investigational device") against the
      commercially available 2D and 3D predicate devices. The study undertaken will demonstrate the
      safety and effectiveness of the investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      (CBCT) 2D imaging functionality by comparing against the predicate CARESTREAM DRX-1 GOS
      detector used on adult cadaver specimens to capture the image pairs.

      The study will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational CARESTREAM
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) 3D imaging functionality by comparing against the
      reference PHILLIPS Multi Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) scanner used on adult cadaver
      specimens (body part) to capture 3D volumetric exams using the anatomy of both upper and
      lower extremity specimens. The adult cadaver specimens will receive multiple x-ray exposures
      using the predicate devices for both 2D and 3D imaging. Target images from cadaver specimens
      will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality, and the data will
      be included in a comparative evaluation.

      The live human subject portion of the study will be performed on healthy volunteers. Each
      volunteer will sign an Informed Consent after which will receive only one 3D volumetric exam
      using the investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner. Target
      images will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality according to
      a radiologist reader scale applicable to 3D volumetric imaging.
