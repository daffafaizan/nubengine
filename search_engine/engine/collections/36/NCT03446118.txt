      similar to how esophageal distention is assessed at barium fluoroscopy. The following
      sequences and rationale will be used for the examination:

      A sagittal 50mm thick multiphase FIESTA and multiphase SSFSE will be performed while the
      patient drinks water. The temporal resolution of the images will be approximately 1 image
      every 1.5-2 seconds. The images will be used to assess the lumen caliber and the wall
      thickness during maximal distension as pseudothickening can occur with decreased luminal
      distension.

      Sagittal SSFSE with fat suppression, sagittal FRFSE T2-weighted images with fat suppression,
      axial DWI and sagittal DWI will be performed to asses for edema and inflammation within the
      esophageal wall.

      axial FS SSFSE or FIESTA will be performed and targeted to the region of stricturing.

      Dynamic sagittal imaging will be performed following IV contrast to assess for mural
      hyperenhancement which can be seen mural inflammation and delayed enhancement which can be
      seen in fibrosis. Sequential acquisitions will be performed beginning at 40 seconds following
      IV contrast injection. Delayed acquisitions will be performed at 5 min and 7 min. Patients
      will be asked to perform swallowing during the image acquisition to reduce the potential for
      pseudoenhancement secondary to under distension.
