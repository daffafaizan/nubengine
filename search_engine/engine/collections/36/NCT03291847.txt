      outpatients to buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance, and 40 matched methadone controls. Subject
      treatment data, including medical and obstetric histories, drug use histories, demographic
      information and psychosocial information will be extracted from patient charts. Weekly urine
      toxicology testing will provide information regarding other substance use/misuse during the
      time of study participation. Study participants will undergo 2 60 minute maternal and fetal
      neurophysiologic monitoring sessions on one day at 4 points during gestation: 24, 28, 32 and
      36 weeks, at times of trough (just before sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone
      daily dose) and peak (2 1/2 hours after dosing) maternal drug levels. Fetal cardiac (heart
      rate, heart rate variability, heart rate accelerations) and movement (total fetal movement,
      number and duration of movement bouts) and the correlation between the two (fetal heart
      rate-movement coupling) will be determined. Maternal physiologic measures will include heart
      period and variability, vagal tone, skin conductance and respiratory data. All maternal and
      fetal measures, with the exception of blood pressure, will be computed in 1-minute intervals
      and averaged over the 60 min recording. Infant birth data and birth parameters, and neonatal
      abstinence syndrome scores will be extracted from patient charts. Infants will undergo
      neurobehavioral testing using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral
      Scale, a 30 minute harmless assessment of infant functioning, on days 3, 14 and 30 of life.
