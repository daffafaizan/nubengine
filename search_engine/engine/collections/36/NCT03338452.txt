      adherence due to their ability to suppress the drive to eat. They are also gaining popularity
      in public, despite some concerns regarding the quality and timeline of changes of body
      composition and the effects on health parameters of whole organism.

      For effective weight loss, energy deficit is required. Very low energy (600 - 800 kcal)
      ketogenic diets have been extensively studied.

      The proposed study combines low energy (800 - 1500 kcal) and ketogenic diet intervention. The
      aim of the study is a comprehensive determination of quality of body mass loss, metabolic
      states changes, physical and psychological performance changes, and inflammatory and hormones
      profile changes during and post a 12-week low energy ketogenic diet intervention.
