      States each year. Most smokers are aware of the health consequences and want to quit, but
      have difficulty doing so. Only 3-5% of smokers who quit on their own are successful. Since
      the vast majority of those who attempt to quit will fail, the need for better approaches to
      smoking cessation is clear and urgent. A safe and effective means of blocking the effects of
      nicotine would be of considerable interest as a potential treatment for tobacco use.
      Vaccination to produce nicotine-specific antibodies may be viewed as an alternative method of
      blocking nicotine effects. Nicotine is a small molecule that does not elicit an immune
      response in animals of humans. In order for the immune system to respond to this hapten,
      nicotine can be combined or bound to a larger molecule in a unique manner so that an immune
      response is mounted against nicotine. Nabi Biopharmaceuticals has developed a conjugate
      vaccine (NicVAX) that consists of 3'-aminomethylnicotine bound to Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      exoprotein A, an exotoxin that has been made non-toxic by an amino acid deletion. Subjects
      will be randomized to one of four treatment groups.

      Within each treatment group, 75 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (NicVAX:Placebo),
      yielding a total of 50 active and 25 placebo subjects for each treatment group. There will be
      12 subjects enrolled in a fifth open label arm to evaluate immunogenicity. A quit date will
      be set at the end of week 7 or at the end of week 5, depending on the dosing schedule.
      Continuous abstinence will be measured between the end of week 18 and the end of week 26.
