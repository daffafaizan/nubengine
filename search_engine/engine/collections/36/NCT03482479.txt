    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 4.5 mg nightly in improving self-reported
      physical health in patients with vasculitis.

      At study enrollment, each patient will be randomized to receive either LDN for 6 weeks
      followed by oral placebo for 6 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks followed by LDN for 6 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure and some secondary outcome measures are patient-reported and will be
      recorded every 3 weeks, or every 6 weeks
