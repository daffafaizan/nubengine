      C infection in patients with clear hepatitis C infection and those who develop chronic
      infection. We hope to determine immune responses that are important for eliminating the
      infection. Currently, the treatments for hepatitis C are not effective for everyone. For
      those patients enrolled who begin hepatitis C treatment, we will evaluate the immune system
      of people who respond compared to those who do not respond. If the patient is HIV positive,
      the change in hepatitis C immune response once various HIV medicines (antiretrovirals) are
      started will also be examined. Any treatment for hepatitis C or HIV will be determined by the
      patient's primary physician and will not be affected by enrollment in the study.

      Blood samples of ~70 cc will be obtained no more than once per week. Patients who begin
      hepatitis C therapy or antiretroviral therapy if HIV coinfected will provide serial specimens
      for examination. Patients who undergo liver biopsy as a part of their routine hepatitis care
      will provide a sample for further studies of the immune response to see if it is different in
      the liver compared to the blood.
