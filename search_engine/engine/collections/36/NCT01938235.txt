      Those who agree to participate will be immediately randomized to one of two groups: a 24-h
      infusion of exenatide; or a 24 h infusion of placebo. We will assess the ability of exenatide
      to reduce ischemic injury. This study will serve as safety evaluation study as well as a
      pilot for a larger multicentre trial powered for clinical outcomes.
