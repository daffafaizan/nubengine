      appreciating the physiologic challenges that the burn injury poses to the body. Major burn
      injury not only results in local damage from the inciting injury, but in many cases results
      in multisystem injury. Initial efforts are focused on resuscitation, maintaining hemodynamic
      stability, and airway management. Intermediate efforts are focused on managing the
      multi-organ failure that results from systemic inflammatory mediators that result in diffuse
      capillary leak and surgical therapy. Finally, efforts shift to issues with chronic wound
      healing, pain management, restoration of functional capabilities, and rehabilitation.. Burn
      injury in children continues to be a major epidemiologic problem around the globe. Nearly a
      fourth of all burn injuries occur in children under the age of 16, of whom the majority are
      under the age of five This provides a team of pediatricians, surgeons, anesthesiologists,
      intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists, and other healthcare providers with a unique
      opportunity to make a multidisciplinary collaborative effort.
