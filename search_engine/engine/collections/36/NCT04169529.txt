      refers to a collection of diseases that lead to the key feature of irreversible airflow
      limitation and breathing related problems. Of those with COPD, 46% experienced at least one
      exacerbation within the previous year and 19% needed hospitalization. The financial burden of
      COPD is also evident, in that over $32 billion was spent for COPD care in the United States
      in 2010 and it is expected to be close to $50 billion in 2020.

      Reducing healthcare utilization associated with COPD patient management (i.e. short-term
      readmission and chronic disease management) is a critically important unmet need for
      patients, caregivers, and hospitals. Early detection, prevention, and treatment of COPD
      exacerbation would aim to reduce this high morbidity and cost. To help reduce these
      exacerbations and improve disease management, sensors in a minimally invasive device can be
      used to identify factors that are associated with exacerbations.
