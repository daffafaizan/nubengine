      dedifferentiation of β-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Significant increase in
      IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in the pancreas and in the serum levels were determined in type 1
      diabetic patients at diabetes oneset. This data indicated that this proinflammatory mediator
      serve as a biomarker of advanced autoimmunity. We aimed to investigate the relationship
      between Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and T1D and the effect of those cytokines on
      β-cell function.
