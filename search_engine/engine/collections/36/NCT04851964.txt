      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults with severe, chronic
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized globally.
      Subjects will receive tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection using
      the accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS), over a 52-week treatment period. The study also
      includes a post-treatment follow-up period of 12-24 weeks for participants who complete the
      52-week treatment period.
