      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin in patients with
           advanced mesothelin-expressing malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the induction of antibody against this drug with its pharmacokinetics in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1
      followed by SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
