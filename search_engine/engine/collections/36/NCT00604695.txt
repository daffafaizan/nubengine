      efficacy of the administration of low-dose adjunctive intracoronary (IC) tenecteplase during
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI). Efficacy will be assessed by measurements of both the angiographic
      characteristics of the culprit lesion as well as by measurements of epicardial flow and
      myocardial perfusion in the territory of the infarct-related artery. This study will also
      evaluate the safety of administering low-dose IC tenecteplase to subjects undergoing primary
      PCI for STEMI treated with standard therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
      inhibitors). Safety endpoints include the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction
      (MI), abrupt vessel closure, subacute stent thrombosis, and TIMI major and minor bleeding
      events.

      Prompt reperfusion therapy with primary PCI in patients with STEMI improves clinical outcomes
      through salvage of myocardial tissue. The proposed pilot trial is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive low-dose IC
      tenecteplase in conjunction with standard medical therapy during primary PCI for STEMI. We
      hypothesized that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance fibrinolysis at the site of the
      culprit lesion leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction. As reduced dose tenecteplase
      will be injected directly into the coronary artery increasing local concentration of the drug
      with minor systemic effects, an improved safety profile is also expected from this mode of
      administration.
