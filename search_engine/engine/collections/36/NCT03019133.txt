      may impair recovery. While noise is widely cited as the most common cause of sleep disruption
      in the ICU setting, its contribution to sympathetic activity in critically ill patients is
      not known. This is an important knowledge gap, because noise initiates a sequence of
      physiological changes including vasoconstriction, raised diastolic blood pressure, pupil
      dilatation and muscle tension. Furthermore, noise is implicated in sympathetic arousals,
      resulting in a release of adrenaline which prevents relaxation and consequently prevents the
      patient from falling asleep.

      The investigators plan to study the effect of noise masking and noise reduction on stress
      related physiological parameters in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Subjects
      will be randomized into 3 separate groups: control, noise reduction, and noise masking. The
      investigators will compare the heart rate and blood pressure variability between and within
      the groups to determine the effects of treatment assignment on these variables. Non-invasive
      measurements obtained from the bedside monitor will be collected using physiological data
      acquisition software.
