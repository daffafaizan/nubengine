      prognosis, and there are no effective treatments recommended by the guidelines. TIPS could
      downgrade the ascites and improve Child-Pugh scores. TIPS has been a common management model
      for RA for end-stage liver disease. There is no prospective study evaluating TIPS plus
      thermal ablation. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to
      find out it.
