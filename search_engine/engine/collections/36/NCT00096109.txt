      I. To determine the response rate of 17-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
      (tanespimycin) in patients with refractory/resistant metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with refractory/resistant
      metastatic breast cancer when treated with 17-AAG.

      III. To correlate patients' her2/neu status with response to 17-AAG treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive tanespimycin IV over 1-6 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at day 30, every 10-12 weeks until disease progression, and then every
      3 months thereafter.
