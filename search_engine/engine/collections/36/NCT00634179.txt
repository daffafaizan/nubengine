    
      This study will assess whether adding bortezomib (Velcade) to R-CHOP (in a new combination
      called VR-CHOP) can further improve outcomes in patients with indolent NHL who have not
      previously received treatment.

      Patients who are eligible to take part in the study will receive VR-CHOP at the doses of
      Velcade and vincristine established in phase 1. Patients will receive VR-CHOP for up to 8
      cycles of treatment (each of 21 days duration). During treatment, patients will be assessed
      for their response to therapy and for possible side effects. All patients will go on to
      receive maintenance therapy after completion of their initial treatment as designed by the
      protocol.
