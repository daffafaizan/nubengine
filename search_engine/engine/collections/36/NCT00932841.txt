      with irritable bowel syndrome: Children will be recruited from the pediatric gastroenterology
      clinic at The Children's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. Eighty four children will be
      enrolled in this controlled, double-blinded, randomized study. All children will have had a
      prior evaluation by a pediatric gastroenterologist who has diagnosed these patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome and excluded organic disease as a cause of the child's abdominal
      pain.
