      biomarkers from naturally voided urine.

        1. Urine specimen collection. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
           the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and informed consent will be obtained
           from all subjects. Biomarkers diffused passively from prostate tissue to the urethra and
           will be collected from naturally voided urine. Urine will be collected in a sterilized
           specimen cup containing 10 vol% RNA stabilizer and 1vol% antibiotics and stored in a
           refrigerator for less than a week before shipping the sample to the laboratory

        2. To measure the electrical signals from the four different biomarkers in the urine, the
           four sensing channels in the extended gate of an field-effect transistor biosensor will
           be conjugated to antibodies, thus capturing different biomarkers.

        3. Without any pretreatment, urine will be added directly to the four different sensing
           channels. After 20 min of reaction time in the four channels, the bottom gate voltage
           shifts will be measured at the reference current (1 nA). Each urine sample will generate
           four independent sensing signals from the corresponding biomarkers. The set of sensing
           signals collected for each patient will be then analyzed.
