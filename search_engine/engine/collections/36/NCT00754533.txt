           2 or 3 training sessions a week, 21 sessions altogether. Each training session consist
           in cycling on an ergometer. In the interval training group, the training session
           alternates one minute at 100% workload at the ventilatory threshold and one minute
           active pause at 50% workload at the ventilatory threshold; total exercise time is 20
           minutes. In continuous training, the training session lasts 20 minutes at 80% workload
           at the ventilatory threshold.

        -  Exercise testing: Exercise capacity is measured before and at the end of the exercise
           training program and at 6 month follow-up. A first exercise test with respiratory gas
           exchange is performed 2 weeks after hospitalization: this is the baseline exercise test.
           The protocol consists of 3-min warm up at a workload of 30 watts. At each stage, the
           workload is increased by 10 or 15 watts per min. Patients are instructed to maintain a
           speed of 55 to 65 rotations per min. Four exercise tests with gas analysis are
           programmed during cardiac rehabilitation: three maximal tests (before exercise training
           program to precise exercise intensity during the sessions, after training program to
           evaluate the primary end point and at 6 months) and one sub maximal exercise test during
           the tenth session to adjust the intensity of training exercises (this test is stopped
           when the ventilatory threshold is obtained).
