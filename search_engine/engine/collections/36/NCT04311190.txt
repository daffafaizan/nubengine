      Intensive Care Unit (ICU), little research investigating family member's contributions to
      care, including its outcomes on family itself and on patient care, has been rendered
      available. To assess the effects of a family engagement program on family members'
      satisfaction and on patients' well-being and quality of life. A quasi-experimental study with
      two non-randomized groups (94 per each group) will be performed in two general ICUs of an
      Academic Italian Hospital. The intervention will be carried out in a single ICU and consists
      of family members' involvement in the care of their beloved one with bed physical exercises
      and simple care tasks. Participants will be assessed for outcomes including the family
      satisfaction, assessed with the FS-ICU tool within 48 hours after the patient's discharge
      from ICU, the patient's sense of well-being, measured with a visual analogue scale within 30
      minutes after the time period of a visit, and the quality of life, investigated with the
      SF-12 questionnaire within the first 48 hours after admission in ICU, at three and six months
      after ICU discharge by telephone. First, this study constitutes a significant step in a
      research agenda aimed at deepening the nursing sensitive outcomes in ICUs and the quality of
      hospital care. Secondly, result from this study may have the potential to better understand
      how families may modify patients' outcomes and whether the family members would benefit from
      an engagement program.
