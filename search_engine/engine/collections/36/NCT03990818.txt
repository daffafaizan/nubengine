      indication of the relative change in the fluid balance. If possible, the change in hydration
      level should be quantified. The test is done on patients during hemodialysis. Extracted
      amount of fluid is used as the primary reference to the bioimpedance measurements, but other
      references will also be used.

      The measurement is made using bioimpedance measured with four electrodes and over a large
      frequency spectrum. Impedance measurements are made every 20 seconds throughout the test
      period. The measurement is recorded in a memory (flash) on each patch. At the same time as
      measuring bioimpedance, the temperature in the patch is recorded.

      After completion of the test, the data is transferred to a computer for analysis. As a
      reference, extracted amount of fluid, weight change, blood samples and clinical evaluation
      are used.
