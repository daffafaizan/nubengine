      proteinuria. It usually appears in the third trimester and occurs most frequently in
      primigravidas. Preeclampsia may be complicated by life-threatening conditions including
      seizures, severe hepatic dysfunction, renal failure and coagulopathy; it is one of the
      leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia is cited as the
      leading cause of maternal death in surveys of maternal mortality in Mexico (25% of maternal
      deaths).

      Specific Aim 1. To assess the efficacy of L-arginine supplementation with antioxidant
      vitamins delivered in a medical food in reducing the incidence of preeclampsia in a high-risk
      population. Two other groups will receive the food (bars) either with antioxidant vitamins
      alone or without vitamins in order to test the impact of vitamin supplements on prevention of
      preeclampsia. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that supplemental L-arginine in
      combination with antioxidant vitamins will significantly reduce preeclampsia (hypertension
      and proteinuria) and its complications in a high-risk population (women whose blood pressure
      is > 140/90 after 20 weeks gestation without proteinuria). Secondary hypotheses to be tested
      include that antioxidant vitamin supplementation contributes to the reduction in
      preeclampsia; that supplemental L-arginine and antioxidant vitamins will improve neonatal
      outcomes (reduced incidence of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation); that
      preeclampsia is correlated inversely with plasma L-arginine levels, directly with the plasma
      levels of the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), and
      inversely with urinary NO metabolites, a marker of endogenous NO production; and that
      preeclampsia is inversely correlated with maternal plasma levels of antioxidant vitamins.
