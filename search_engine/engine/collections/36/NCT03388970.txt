      which often leads to long-term coma and severe neurological dysfunction. The amount of
      cerebral hemorrhage is directly related to the prognosis of the patients, and a small number
      of patients still suffer from the adverse consequences of delayed bleeding after active
      treatment. Vitamin K1 is a necessary ingredient in the liver to produce clotting factors II,
      VII, IX, and X, and vitamin K1 supplementation increases clotting function. On the contrary,
      vitamin K1 increases the risk of thrombosis. In this study, patients with spontaneous
      intracerebral hemorrhage (excluding rupture of aneurysm and vascular malformation) will be
      randomly divided into experimental group and control group. All the patients in the two
      groups were treated according to the guideline of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.
      Patients in the experimental group was treated with intravenous injection of vitamin K1 20mg
      once a day for 2 days after admission, and the patients in control group was treated with
      normal saline as a control. The hematoma volume, coagulation function, platelet levels and
      GCS scales of the two groups will be recorded in 0d, 1d, 3d, 7d post bleeding stroke,
      furthermore, length of ICU stay and total hospitalization, incidence of complications during
      hospitalization are to be recorded. During the follow-up, mRS score will be recorded at 1m
      and 6m post bleeding stroke. Finally, the effectiveness and safety of early vitamin K1 use in
      reducing the risk of bleeding and improving prognosis in patients with spontaneous
      intracerebral hemorrhage will be analyzed.
