      Radiation therapy remains the principal treatment for NPC. The most frequently occurred
      radiation-related side effect is probably the radiation-induced oral mucositis (OM), which
      affects up to 100% of NPC patients receiving radiation therapy. Although intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) has been widely used in China nowadays, the incidence of
      radiation-induced oral mucositis is still high. OM can decrease patients' oral intake and
      nutrition, leading to dehydration, weight loss, and declining performance status that may
      require intravenous fluid hydration, feeding tube placement, and hospitalization. OM also may
      increase opioid use. When severe, oral mucositis increases the risk of infection and may
      compromise clinical outcomes by necessitating treatment breaks, dosage reductions, and
      reduced therapy compliance. Common clinical management strategies include bland rinses,
      topical anesthetics and analgesics, mucosal coating agents, and systemic analgesics. However,
      none of these interventions has been supported by conclusive evidence. In China, a quadruple
      mixture, composed of dexamethasone, gentamicin, vitamin B12, and procaine, is commonly
      prescribed when NPC patients begin to suffer from radiation-induced OM.

      Oral Ulcer Gargle (FORRAD®) is a proprietary viscous liquid mucoadhesive hydrogel
      formulation. It creates a palliative barrier over injured mucosa, to prevent and to cure
      radiation-induced OM.

      The objective of this randomized phase II study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Oral
      Ulcer Gargle (FORRAD®) as an intervention for radiation-induced OM in the treatment of NPC,
      compared with the commonly used quadruple mixture, which is composed of dexamethasone,
      gentamicin, vitamin B12, and procaine.
