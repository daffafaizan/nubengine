    
      NSCLC is an area of oncology in which clinicians are beginning to use specific
      tumor-associated molecular aberrations to assign and/or prioritize targeted therapies for
      patients. At this early stage, multiple hurdles remain before molecular profiling becomes a
      routine part of thoracic oncology practice. In particular, to develop specific targeted
      therapies for patients whose tumors harbor rare mutations, it will be important to identify
      appropriate candidates, design the appropriate trials, and execute the trials with adequate
      numbers to achieve the necessary endpoints. Implementation will facilitate realization of the
      promise of molecularly tailored therapy, which could lead to more effective treatments with
      fewer side effects.
