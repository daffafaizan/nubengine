    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, 5-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of
      meal type and timing on migalastat HCl pharmacokinetics in healthy male and female subjects
      between the ages of 18 and 65 years. A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled such that
      approximately 14 evaluable subjects complete dosing and critical assessments. Subjects will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment sequences and will receive each treatment over the
      course of 5 successive weekly periods including a single dose of migalastat HCl 150 mg in the
      fasting state as the reference treatment. There will be at least a 7-day washout period
      between each dose of migalastat HCl and a follow-up visit approximately 7 to 10 days after
      the last dose in Period 5.

      All subjects will be screened within 28 days of admission to the clinical unit. In each
      period, subjects will check in to the clinical unit the day prior to drug administration and
      have relevant assessments to ensure continued eligibility for dose administration. On Day 1
      of each period, subjects will receive a single dose of migalastat HCl within 1 of the
      following 5 treatment regimens as follows:

        -  150 mg migalastat HCl in the fasting state (reference arm)

        -  150 mg migalastat HCl with simultaneous consumption of a glucose drink

        -  150 mg migalastat HCl 1 hour before consumption of a high fat meal

        -  150 mg migalastat HCl 1 hour before consumption of a light meal

        -  150 mg migalastat HCl 1 hour after consumption of a light meal

      Subjects will be confined to the clinical unit for 24 hours after dosing with serial blood
      samples collected for PK analysis. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring
      clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, and AEs.
