    
      SEPAGES is a new type of longitudinal couple-child cohort with repeated clinical examinations
      during pregnancy and childhood, extensive collection of repeated biological samples from both
      parents and the child, use of new technologies to assess exposure to air pollution (GPS,
      personal dosimeter etc.) Throughout the study (during pregnancy and the first years of the
      child's life), clinical examination and many biological tests (urine, blood, hair) are
      performed. Exposure to different environmental factors are made several times during
      pregnancy and the first years of the child's life thanks to personal dosimeters, GPS and
      accelerometers. During labor and childbirth a number of samples are taken (placenta, tissues,
      blood, urines, hair, meconium and breast milk). Finally, during the study a number of
      evaluation questionnaires are given to volunteers via a computer platform in order to have a
      better understanding of the environment in which they are living.

      The SEPAGES cohort follows the rule of the biomedical research. Informed consents are signed
      by both the father and the mother during the inclusion visit which takes place in the
      hospital. All ethical and data privacy agreements had been obtained : a favorable opinion was
      issued by the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP) on November 13th, 201 and by the
      CCTIRS (Comité Consultatif sur le Traitement de l'Information en matière de Recherche dans le
      domaine de la Santé) on January 09th, 2014. The study was authorised by the Agence Nationale
      de Sécurité du Médicament(ANSM), on Decmber 17th, 2013 and by the Comité Nationale de
      l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) on June 26th, 2014.
