      in the United States. Several gene mutations and cancer syndromes have been identified that
      are found in greater frequency in individuals with PDAC, including the breast ovary cancer
      syndrome (BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations). We have recently generated mouse models of pancreatic
      cancer in which we found that deletions of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 cooperate with K-ras
      activation and p53 mutations to increase the rate of tumorigenesis via accelerated
      progression of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN). However, only BRCA1 deletions
      were associated with the development of concomitant Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms (MCNs),
      suggesting potentially distinct pathways for BRCA1- and BRCA2-mediated tumorigenesis in the
      pancreas. Our primary aim is to determine if germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 result in
      different pre-neoplastic pathways to pancreatic cancer, as in our murine model. Genomic DNA
      will be isolated on normal tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatic resection
      for pancreatic cancer, IPMN or MCN. Tissue will be genotyped for the three most common
      founder mutations in Ashkenazi Jews. In the cases in which BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are
      found, heterozygote normal and abnormal tissue will be microdissected to look for loss of
      heterozygosity at the BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the interaction
      of p53 and Kras with BRCA1 and BRCA2 by sequencing p53 and Kras in PanIN as compared to IPMN
      and MCN lesions.
