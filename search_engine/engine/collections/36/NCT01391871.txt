    
      Objective: The aim of the trial is to compare vascular healing and vasodilation at 3 months
      after deployment of PRO-Kinetic drug-eluting stent and Endeavor Resolute zotarolimus-eluting
      stent in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      Design: A prospective, randomized and controlled study comparing coronary flow reserve and
      coverage of the PRO-Kinetic DES and Endeavor Resolute DES implanted in acute coronary
      syndrome. OCT and CFR measurement at 3 months. Clinical follow up is scheduled at 3, 6 and 12
      months.

      Primary endpoint: Uncovered stent struts and CFR at 3 months after stent implantation.

      Secondary clinical endpoints: MACE and stent thrombosis.

      Enrollment: 40 patients (20 receiving PRO-Kinetic DES and 20 receiving Endeavor Resolute
      DES).
