      involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and that drugs that intervene in this
      transmission may be therapeutic weapons in addressing the symptoms and cognitive deficits of
      this pathology. Among these drugs, particularly memantine is a strong candidate in view of
      their efficacy in antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and their good safety
      and tolerability profile. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      memantine association with treatment with a combination of two drugs, including quetiapine
      with lithium and quetiapine with aripiprazole in young patients with bipolar disorder type 1
      non-responders or partial responders and evaluate the impact of this association cognitive
      functioning of patients. An experimental study, randomized, double-blind, bipolar patients
      with type 1, of both sexes, aged 18 to 40, ambulatory or hospitalized, at any stage of the
      disease, seeking treatment in the Mood Disorders Program (GRUDA) of Institute os Psychiatry
      (IPq) of Sao Paulo University (FMUSP). Patients will come from ARIQUELI Project (Missio, G.
      et al, 2013 submitted Trial registration - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:. NCT01710163).

      The study will be conducted in two stages: I - initial administration of memantine or placebo
      for 8 weeks; II - Maintenance administration for more 4 months.
