      surface of the hands and fingers are the main predilection sites. Cryotherapy is frequently
      used to eradicate common warts via necrotic destruction of HPV-infected keratinocytes or by
      inducing of an effective cell-mediated immune response. However, the cure rates of
      cryotherapy are only around (44-47%) .

      Intralesional antigen immunotherapy represents a promising therapeutic approach for the
      treatment of different types of warts, particularly if multiple and/or recalcitrant.

      The investigate the efficacy and safety of combined 'cryo-immuno-therapy' versus
      intralesional tuberculin purified protein n immunotherapy alone for multiple common warts.

      Although intralesional immunotherapy - compared to conventional therapeutic methods - has
      been generally along with better outcome, lower incidence of side effects and less
      recurrence, it is not still approved as a standard method of treatment in patients with wart
      , because the majority of available studies are open-labeled and randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials are very scarce.

      The immune system plays an important role in the spontaneous resolution of warts. The immune
      mechanisms against HPV include the development of cell-mediated immune response with
      activation of T helper1 (Th1) lymphocytes resulting in long-term immunity . Stimulation of
      the immune system would clear warts in other locations, eliminating the need for the local
      treatment for each individual wart .

      Multiple studies support the use of intralesional PPD injection as an effective and valuable
      treatment option due to its systemic effect, especially for patients with multiple warts,
      with the benefit of clearance of both treated and distant warts.
