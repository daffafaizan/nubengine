    
      Primary objective To determine whether axitinib given on an individualized dose/schedule for
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma following immunotherapy with PD-1 and PD-L1 Inhibitors leads
      to improved progression-free survival (PFS).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To characterize the objective response rates in patients given axitinib on an
           individualized dose/schedule.

        2. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of an alternative method of axitinib titration.

        3. To characterize the anti-tumor effect, as measured by change in tumor burden per RECIST
           1.1, of axitinib titration performed after initial RECIST PD on axitinib.
