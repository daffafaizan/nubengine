      volunteers. Suboptimal, both under- and overdosing of antibiotics is an important threat in
      this patient category. Given the time-dependent character of beta-lactam antibiotics
      continuous dosing as opposed to traditional intermittent dosing is likely to render better
      target attainment and maintenance and might improve clinical outcome.
