    
      This is an open label pilot, single-center, non-randomized trial is designed to evaluate the
      tolerability and preliminary activity of the combination of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) with metformin for resectable and locally-advanced pancreatic/periampullary
      cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objectives of this study are to:

      1) To determine if the addition of metformin to SBRT adds minimal additional toxicity for
      patients with A). borderline-resectable or B). not surgically resectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical/pathological response and resectability rates associated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) on days -11
      to -1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 days a week for 5 weeks and receive
      concurrent metformin hydrochloride* by mouth, two times a day for 5 weeks. Patients undergo
      laparotomy on week 6 (or weeks 5-7). ). Systemic therapy continues as soon as it is
      considered feasible by the treating physicians.

      *NOTE: Metformin hydrochloride should be stopped 2 days before laparotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
