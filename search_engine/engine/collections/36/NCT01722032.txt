      (92%) of caregivers of an overweight/obese child inaccurately perceived that their child was
      in a normal BMI category. Foreign-born caregivers were significantly more likely to
      inaccurately perceive their child's BMI percentile category, versus US-born caregivers
      (OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.48-0.88). Specifically, those born in South America [OR=0.59. 95% CI,
      0.36-0.98), Central America/Mexico (OR=0.59, 95% CI,0.41-0.85), and Caribbean Hispanic
      nations [OR=0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.83) were significantly less likely to accurately perceive
      their child's BMI category, versus US-born caregivers.

      Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that foreign-born parents of preschool-age
      overweight/obese children in particular do not accurately perceive their child's BMI status.
      Pediatricians and other healthcare providers serving foreign-born caregivers may consider
      additional healthy weight counseling for these families.
