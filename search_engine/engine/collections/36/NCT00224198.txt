      as appropriate for other organs). The typical routine medical studies to be carried out may
      include: chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral), non-contrast high resolution CT scan
      of the chest, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, general
      hematologic studies, general serologic studies, /immunologic studies, biochemical analyses
      (including carboxyhemoglobin to measure blood carbon monoxide levels in order to accurately
      evaluate the diffusion capacity in individuals who smoke since smoking increases the blood
      levels of carbon monoxide), alcohol blood test, urinalysis, urine chemistries (including
      blood or urine nicotine and cotinine test to evaluate urine for active or passive exposure to
      nicotine), blood or urine drug screening (to evaluate use of recreational drugs and/or mood
      altering medications), pregnancy test (if applicable) and HIV serology. Also, a sweat
      chloride and sweat rate test may be performed by the physician to evaluate participants with
      a possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

      The study individual will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a combination of bronchial
      brushing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or bronchial wall biopsy. The primary factor for
      determining if an individual will have bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) and/or brushings
      and/or biopsies is the particular lung disease affecting the individual. This will depend on
      the known mechanism relevant to the pathogenesis of the particular disease. For example, in
      individuals with asthma, the samples may include airway brushing and airway biopsies; in
      contrast, in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sampling may
      include airway brushings, airway biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Other determining
      factors include: the amount of moderate sedation (if used) and the amount of analgesia used;
      the maximal dosage of topical lidocaine that is allowed per procedure; allergic reactions to
      any of the medications used in the procedures; and individual's tolerance to the procedure.
