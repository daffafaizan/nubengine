      doses administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors. Each subject will participate in
      only 1 dose group and will receive a single dose of test article, followed by a 1-week
      observation period, and then will receive the test article administered once-daily by mouth
      in cycles consisting of 28 days. Subjects will be enrolled in groups of 3 to 6. Adverse
      events and dose-limiting toxicities will be assessed from the first single dose.
