      intervention (RHI) works for reducing chronic pain in 100 adult cancer survivors who have
      completed active treatment. The RHI will be compared to an attention control condition
      (relaxation recording). qEEG measurement will be obtained while listening to the RHI at weeks
      0, 2, and 4 to explore if brain states are related to hypnotic analgesia during the 4-week
      study period in 20 study participants.

      The study has the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Does the RHI work? Evaluate the efficacy of RHI in reducing self-reported pain
      intensity (primary outcome), pain interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep
      disturbance (secondary outcomes) at 4 weeks compared to the attention control condition
      (relaxation recording). Hypothesis: RHI will significantly reduce pain intensity, pain
      interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance at 4 weeks.

      Aim 2: For whom does the RHI work? Examine if psychological factors (hypnotic suggestibility,
      mental absorption, treatment outcome expectancy, fear of cancer recurrence, resilience,
      self-efficacy) influence the relationship between RHI and pain intensity at weeks 0, 2, and
      4.

      Aim 3: How does the RHI work? a. Compare brain activity as measured by electroencephalogram
      (EEG) in cancer survivors with chronic pain (n=30) receiving the RHI relative to the
      attention control condition (relaxation recording) at weeks 0, 2, and 4. b. Explore the
      effects of brain activity on pain intensity at weeks 0, 2, and 4. In addition, structured
      interviews will be conducted with participants to understand facilitators and barriers
      associated with undergoing EEG at three time points and perceptions on how the intervention
      works to reduce pain.
