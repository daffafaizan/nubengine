      women who need antipsychotic treatments and are in their reproductive years. The fear of
      harmful effects from antipsychotic on fetus and unplanned pregnancy commonly causes
      non-adherence to treatments. Even for those who are willing to maintain their antipsychotic
      treatments during pregnancy, the fear of potential harmful effects from antipsychotic on
      fetus can still exist. It is well known that non-adherence to antipsychotic treatments in
      patients with schizophrenia can cause most to relapse and poor treatment response. The
      consequences of relapse not only increase personal suffering, but also increase family and
      societal burden.Clearly, it is important to evaluate the safety of antipsychotics during
      pregnancy. However, up to now, most information about antipsychotics on reproductive safety
      and the effects on infant development come from case reports, case series, and retrospective
      studies.So the study was to investigate the developmental effects of antipsychotics on
      infants who were exposed to as fetus.
