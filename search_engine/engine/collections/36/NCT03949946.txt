      in survival rate. The current screening method has been shown to lead to overtreatment,
      prompting the development of accurate early detection approaches targeting underlying
      clinical features. Patients with BRCA1/2 and TP53 genes are at risk of breast cancer and
      receive annual surveillance. However, the current diagnostic approach relies on detecting the
      changes to the growth of tumour only once cancer is well under development. Detecting earlier
      changes to breast fatty tissue may detect patients earlier and more accurately.

      Breast fatty tissue is composed of different fatty acids and a difference in the fatty acid
      composition has been shown in BRCA1/2 gene carriers. Measurement of lipid composition can be
      achieved using a specialist magnetic resonance spectroscopy method, but is limited to
      sampling a small area and is unable to provide the full picture of lipid composition
      distribution during early cancer growth. Recently, magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging,
      through combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging approaches, has been developed
      to provide lipid composition maps of the entire breast.

      The investigators propose to perform lipid mapping in the breasts of 20 genetic mutation
      carriers at high risk of breast cancer and 20 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to
      examine the sensitivity of the method. The overarching aim is to improve early and accurate
      cancer detection in genetic mutation carriers at high risk of breast cancer through the
      assessment of whole breast lipid composition.
