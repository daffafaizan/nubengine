      the immune system, predisposing individuals to recurrent infections, allergy, autoimmunity,
      and malignancies. Clinical descriptions have already been made for more than 200 PIDs, for
      which over 150 forms of PID have been molecularly characterized .

      A population prevalence of diagnosed PID in the United States at approximately 1 in 1,200
      persons.

      A part from local registration in some centres there is no national registry of PID in Egypt,
      and hence, the prevalence of these disorders in the investigator's population is still
      unknown .

      An increasing number of PID are recognized, and effective treatments are possible. Early use
      of prophylactic antibiotics and replacement immunoglobulin can prevent significant end organ
      damage and improve long quality of life in these patients .

      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is an essential plasma derived medicine that is lacking in developing
      countries .IgG shortages leave immune deficient patients without treatment, exposing them to
      devastating recurrent infections from local pathogens. A simple and practical method for
      producing IgG from normal plasma collected in developing countries is needed to provide
      better, faster access to IgG for patients .

      Magdy EL-Ekiaby, et al 2010 introduce the concept of small-scale ("minipool") plasma
      processing methods implementable with minimum infrastructural requirements. They developed
      viral inactivation and protein purification technologies in single-use equipment to prepare
      virally safe solvent/detergent-filtered (S/D-F) plasma Producing a 90%pure immunoglobulin
      fraction in disposable single-use devices for transfusion as well as minipool S/D-F
      cryoprecipitate to treat bleeding disorders.
