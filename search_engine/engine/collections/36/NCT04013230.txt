      2016. Experts have estimated that the world will have more obese children and adolescents
      than underweight at the year 2022. Preventing and reversing excess weight gain in children is
      important since obesity often tracks into adulthood with adverse health consequences.

      Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective, to have a beneficial treatment
      outcome and have been proposed to have great potential to reach many children and improve
      cost effectiveness.

      This is a randomized controlled study with cross-over design. The intervention consist of a
      doctor's appointment, four group-based education sessions over four weeks, psychical activity
      on prescription and a 12-week web-based treatment program. The control group will have
      standard care treatment consisting of doctor's appointment and, in some cases, contact with
      dietician.
