    
      MOR107 is an angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R) agonist with the potential to treat a wide range
      of diseases through activation of the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system.

      In this study MOR107 will be administered to humans for the first time.

      The study will enroll healthy male subjects and is split into two sequential parts, both of
      which have a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled design.

      Part 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending
      doses of MOR107.

      Part 2 will evaluate the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and PK of three different
      doses of MOR107 in healthy male subjects who will be fed a low sodium diet in order to
      increase AT2R expression.
