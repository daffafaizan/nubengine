      lung cancer is nonsquamous NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) is a effective
      first-line treatment for EGFR mutations non-squamous NSCLC treatment. But those patients
      without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations show a poorer prognosis.
      Gemcitabine combined with cisplatin chemotherapy is an effective treatment measures for EGFR
      mutation-negative NSCLC patients, but the prognosis remains poor. Chemotherapy combined with
      targeted monoclonal antibody treatment may be better treatment options in these patients.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Bevacizumab blocks the ability of tumors to grow new blood vessels and spread. This
      randomized trial studies how well giving cisplatin and gemcitabine alone or in combination
      with Bevacizumab (Avastin) works in treating patients with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC
      without EGFR mutations. Accordingly, we have come to a scientific hypothesis that cisplatin
      and gemcitabine combination with Bevacizumab might be a better treatment strategy for stage
      IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type. It can improve the PFS of stage
      IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type. The primary endpoint is disease-free
      time to progression (PFS). The secondary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR),
      disease control rate (DCR), safety and quality of life (QOL). Through this study lay the
      foundation for further exploration of the non-squamous NSCLC first-line treatment in patients
      with EGFR wild-type strategy, and guide the rational application of bevacizumab.
