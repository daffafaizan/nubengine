      such material has been unquestionable for the last decades. However a number of issues arise
      lately regarding the biocompatibility or cytotoxicity or allergies regarding the degradation
      or oxidation particles within the bone or gum. Esthetics has been a concern as well specially
      in patients with thin biotype where the metal may produce a grayish look of the mucosa. For
      this reason the dental community and patients have raised much interest in ceramic dental
      implants as a tooth colored and metal free alternative for dental implants.

      Since 2006 CeraRoot ceramic implants have been available in the market.

      The reason for designing this PMCF is to evaluate the long term success of CeraRoot ceramic
      implants

      To achieve those objectives an observational study of patients that have received such
      implant is designed, using marginal bone loss as a primary response variable. It is estimated
      that a sample size 200 patients over the 5 year period is needed to achieve relevant data.
