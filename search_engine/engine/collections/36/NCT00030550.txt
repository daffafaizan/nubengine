        -  Determine the efficacy of thalidomide for the treatment of anemia in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine whether this drug reduces the frequency of leukemia transformation and
           decreases bone marrow blast percentage in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on neutrophil and platelet production and the number
           of episodes of febrile neutropenia in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System score (low and
      intermediate-1 vs intermediate-2 and high) and transfusion dependence (yes vs no). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on weeks 1-24.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on weeks 1-24. In both arms, patients
           who have not progressed to leukemia after 24 weeks of therapy may receive open-label
           thalidomide for an additional 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
