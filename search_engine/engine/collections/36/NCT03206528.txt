    
      This is an observational, cohort-based, single-site, prospective clinical study enrolling up
      to 100 patients who are hospitalized in the internal ward. There is no control group.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

        1. Evaluate the body temperature measured by the ear unit and validate its accuracy.

        2. Evaluate the accuracy of SPO2 signals and results by comparing the readings to a gold
           standard device with a finger sensor.

        3. Evaluate the ECG and respiration signals recorded by the patch device by comparing them
           to the signals recorded by a patient monitor with standard leads.

           The secondary objectives of the study are:

        4. Usability - evaluate the ease of use of the device by medical staff and patients (e.g.,
           positioning, activation, replacement of patch, understanding processes and
           requirements).

        5. Evaluate the signals quality and the patch adherence after 5 - 7 days on the chest.

      The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the Vital Signs Monitoring System
      (VSMS) for its intended use/proposed indications. Data will be collected while the VSMS is
      adhered to each patient for the entire hospitalization period, up to 7 days. There is no
      follow-up required.
