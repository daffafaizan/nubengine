      response (<20 IU/mL) at 12 months after switching treatment.

      Patients who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will switch from Baraclude® 1 mg to
      Baracle®. Assessment of treatment response at 12 months is performed by comparing
      undetectable HBV DNA rates between baseline and 12 months after switching therapy.
