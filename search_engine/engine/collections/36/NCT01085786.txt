    
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the 14-day sequential therapy ( esomeprazole
      plus amoxicillin dual therapy for 7 days followed by triple therapy with esomeprazole,
      clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 7 days) or 14-day hybird therapy (esomeprazole plus
      amoxicillin dual therapy for 7 days followed by quadruple therapy with esomeprazole,
      amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 7 days) can achieve an eradication rate
      equal to or more than 95%.

      A total of 240 subjects will be asked to participate in this study.

      H. pylori-infected patients are randomized to either a 14-day sequential therapy
      (esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily for 7 days followed by esomeprazole 40
      mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days) or a hybrid
      therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily for 7 days followed by
      esomeprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice
      daily for 7 days).

      Eradication efficacy is assessed by a follow-up endoscopy with rapid urease test and
      histological examination eight weeks after the end of anti-H. pylori therapy. The eradication
      rates of the two study groups will be compared.

      A successful regimen is defined as a regimen achieving an eradication rate equal to or more
      than 95%.
