    
      Patients seeking an initial outpatient physical therapy evaluation for non-surgical shoulder
      impingement with pain, who own iPhones with iOS 8 or later. Patients will be randomized into
      the study group or the control group, and be seen at least once per week by their physical
      therapist for the duration of the therapy episode, or up to 12 weeks. The study group will be
      asked to strap to their wrist a small, measurement device and download a smartphone
      application. The App communicates with the wearable device and reminds them to complete their
      therapy and provides patients visual instruction, feedback on exercise quality, and exercise
      count for the prescribed physical therapy. The control group will only have traditional
      in-clinic therapy as deemed clinically necessary by the PT.
