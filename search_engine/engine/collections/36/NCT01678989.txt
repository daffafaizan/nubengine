      abnormalities in the studied regions, regions that predispose to the development of our
      understanding of PBB will shed light on the etiology of the disorder. In this study, the
      cranial MRI findings and clinical features in adolescents with bipolar disorder and the same
      age and sex matched children who have parents with BD and healthy controls were investigated.
      Since there is few studies that evaluate these three groups, there is a need to increase our
      knowledge on this issue.
