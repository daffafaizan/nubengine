      mutation of TEK and PIK3CA, which activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. As an important
      protein kinase downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway, mTOR can serve as a potential therapeutic
      target for BRBNS. Experiments of mice have shown that rapamycin inhibited the progression of
      venous malformation lesions. There are a few human cases reported using rapamycin treatment.
      The investigator's study is designed to be a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label,
      single-arm clinical trial to investigate its efficacy and safety.
