      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/AML vaccine as a
      treatment for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab as a treatment
      for AML.

      In this research study, the investigators are determining if the DC/AML vaccine can be used
      safely in subjects with acute leukemia after finishing chemotherapy, and whether the DC/AML
      vaccine is capable of producing immune responses against leukemia alone. Cancer cells are
      foreign to the body and have unique markers that distinguish them from normal cells. These
      markers can potentially serve as targets for the immune system. An immune response is any
      reaction by the immune system; a complex system that is responsible for distinguishing us
      from everything foreign to us, and for protecting us against infections and foreign
      substances.

      The Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune
      system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. Unlike a standard vaccine that is used to
      prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can fight cancers that
      are already in the body. Laboratory studies have shown that when dendritic cells and tumor
      cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses against the
      tumor and, in some cases, cause the tumor to shrink.
