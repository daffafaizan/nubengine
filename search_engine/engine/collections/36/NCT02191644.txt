      diabetes were randomly assigned to a control group (normal diet with refined rice) or a
      whole-grain group (replacement of refined rice with whole-grains and legumes). This dietary
      intervention replaced approximately 7% of carbohydrate-derived energy with approximately 4%
      of protein-derived energy and approximately 3% of fat-derived energy.
