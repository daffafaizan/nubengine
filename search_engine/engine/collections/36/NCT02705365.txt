      Specific Aim 1: To develop a patient navigator (PN) program for lung screening for patients
      who are current smokers, aged 55-77 years, potentially eligible for lung screening and are
      receiving care at community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with MGH.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the new lung screening PN program in
      improving screening rates and increasing use of tobacco cessation services in a randomized
      controlled trial.

      Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that equity is maintained in rates of lung screening and in
      follow up of abnormal chest CT results, comparing eligible smokers from CHCs with eligible
      smokers from other practices within the MGH primary care network.
