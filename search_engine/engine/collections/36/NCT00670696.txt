      tetracaine base per gram. Adequate anaesthesia can usually be achieved following a 30 minute
      application time for venopuncture and a 45 minute application time for venous cannulation.
      The hypothesis is that Rapydan medicated plaster is more effective than tetracaine gel in
      preventing venous cannulation related pain when applied for the recommended treatment
      durations of 30 minutes and 45 minutes respectively. This study has been withdrawn and no
      additional data is available.
