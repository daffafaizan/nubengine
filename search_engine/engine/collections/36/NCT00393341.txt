      and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in tumor angiogenesis as surrogate markers and in the
      efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies in breast cancer (22-27). Furstenberger et al. (22)
      reported that CECs were significantly elevated in breast cancer patients and decreased during
      chemotherapy (anthracycline and/or taxane based). However, EPCs (CD34+/VEGFR-2+) as well as
      their progenitor cell population CD133+/CD34+ and the population of CD34+ stem cells
      increased together with VEGF, erythropoietin and angiopoietin-2 levels. Their data suggest
      that chemotherapy reduces mature CECs, while mobilizing the EPC population. Using real-time
      PCR and flow cytometry, they also showed that CD146, an endothelial cell specific antigen,
      was significantly increased in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients compared to healthy
      controls (23). Other studies also reported increased circulating EPCs in breast cancer
      patients in addition to CECs (24,25). In another study, circulating EPCs were not increased
      in cancer patients despite the high plasma VEGF levels (26). Another interesting aspect is
      that Mancuso et al (27) showed that CEC kinetics correlate with progression-free and overall
      survival but not circulating progenitor cells in metastatic breast cancer.
