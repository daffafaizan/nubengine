      have been historically poor and are now known to require multimodality treatment. A standard
      non-surgical treatment option for patients with localized, intermediate and high-risk PC is
      radiation therapy (RT) in combination with short- or long-term androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT).

      The benefit of pelvic nodal RT in this setting is unclear, previous studies have been
      equivocal. There is a growing body of evidence to demonstrate that use of hypofractionated
      (HypoFx) RT may be a safe method for increasing the dose of RT, while also decreasing normal
      tissue toxicity.
