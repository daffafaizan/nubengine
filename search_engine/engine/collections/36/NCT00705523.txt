      concurrent administration of the abused drug, combined agonist/antagonist therapies promote
      both initial and sustained abstinence. Based on varenicline's specific affinity for the
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are implicated in alcohol reward circuitry, it appears
      to be a good candidate for treatment of alcohol dependence. Alcohol can exert its reinforcing
      and dopamine-enhancing effects through activation of nicotinic receptors. In addition to its
      partial agonist activity at heteromeric α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, varenicline
      has also been shown to be a full agonist at homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
      That full agonism at α7 may be key in reducing alcohol withdrawal and craving during early
      alcohol abstinence, and thus reducing relapse, as α7 receptors are implicated in the neural
      reward circuitry activated by alcohol use.
