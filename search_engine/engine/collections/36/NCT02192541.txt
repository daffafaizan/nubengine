    
      BACKGROUND:

        -  Ganetespib is a non-geldamycin synthetic inhibitor of Hsp90 that has demonstrated
           activity against multiple cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts in preclinical models.
           Inhibiting the Hsp90 chaperone complex results in the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases,
           polyubiquination, and proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, including
           transcription factors and proteins involved in angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth
           factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), hypoxia-inducible
           factor 1 (HIF-1), signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 (STAT-3);
           growth factor independence rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF), epidermal growth
           factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), insulin-like
           growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR); resistance to anti-growth signals cyclin-dependent
           kinase 4 (CDK4); tissue invasion and metastases mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor
           (MET), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2); and avoidance of apoptosis protein kinase B
           (AKT), rat insulin promoter (RIP), Survivin, B cell lymphoma (Bcl-2).

        -  HIF-1-alpha activation has been implicated in mediating resistance to anti-angiogenic
           therapy; recent evidence implicates a greater role for Hsp90 in direct modulation of
           VEGF signaling.

        -  Combining Hsp90 inhibition with ganetespib and anti-angiogenic therapy with
           Ziv-Aflibercept, a soluble fusion protein with high binding affinity for vascular
           endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B), and
           placenta growth factor (PIGF), presents a rational novel strategy for improving upon and
           overcoming resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      - To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination
      of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept in patients with refractory gastrointestinal carcinomas,
      non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess modulation of HIF-1-alpha as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy with the
           combination of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept

        -  To assess modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression using
           89Zr-labeled, EGFR-targeting antibody panitumumab positron emission tomography
           (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging of tumor lesions prior to and following treatment
           with study drugs

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas,
           non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas with
           disease progression after at least one line of standard therapy

        -  Participants in the expansion phase must demonstrate EGFR expression on archival tumor
           samples and have disease amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and
           post-treatment biopsies

        -  No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, no radiation or chemotherapy
           within 3 weeks prior to enrollment; patients must have recovered from toxicities of
           prior therapies to at least eligibility levels prior to enrollment.

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  Ganetespib will be administered intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day
           cycle. Ziv-Aflibercept will be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and
           15, during a 28-day cycle.

        -  The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design, whereby patients
           are dose-escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed.

        -  Once the MTD is established, 10 additional patients will be enrolled to the expansion
           phase, at the MTD, and tumor biopsies will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic
           endpoints. During cycle 1 of the expansion phase, ganetespib will be administered
           intravenously weekly, on days 8 and 15 with omission of day 1 treatment to accommodate a
           baseline biopsy pre-ganetespib but after administration of Ziv-Aflibercept. For all
           subsequent cycles, ganetespib will be administered days 1, 8, and 15. Ziv-Aflibercept
           will still be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and 15, of a 28-day
           cycle.

        -  PET/CT imaging with 89Zr-labeled panitumumab will be performed to evaluate tumor
           distribution prior to and following treatment with study agents.
