      patients with HE whose initial presentation follows a clearly defined, reversible
      precipitating event or those with stable, chronic HE. We hypothesize that a majority of these
      patients can be withdrawn from daily lactulose therapy without deterioration of cognitive
      function, and that lactulose withdrawal will improve symptoms and quality of life for these
      individuals. We propose to carry out a comprehensive battery of clinical, laboratory,
      microbiological and psychometric evaluations before and after lactulose withdrawal. We will
      closely follow changes in cognitive function and re-institute lactulose therapy at the first
      sign of clinical deterioration. Through multivariate analysis we propose to develop a model
      to discriminate between treatment dependent and treatment independent patients.
