      small bowel Crohn's disease. A PillCamâ„¢SB capsule (Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) is an
      ingestible, disposable video camera that transmits high quality images of the small
      intestinal mucosa. This enables the small intestine to be readily accessible to physicians
      investigating for the presence of small bowel disorders such as Crohn's disease. It has been
      demonstrated that capsule endoscopy identifies Crohn's disease when other methods are not
      helpful. Diagnostic yields of 70% have been reported in small series of studies performed in
      suspected small bowel Crohn's disease.

      This study is designed to determine the accuracy and clinical impact of Capsule Endoscopy in
      detecting suspected small Bowel Crohn's Disease whose initial evaluation was non-diagnostic.
      It will also serve to better understand the impact of capsule endoscopy on the natural
      history of the disorder.

      Patients will be randomized to undergo capsule endoscopy either one week or five weeks after
      enrolment. This will allow assessment of the natural history of this form of Crohn's disease
      and ensure that any changes in CDAI and QOL after capsule endoscopy are not merely a result
      of this natural history.
