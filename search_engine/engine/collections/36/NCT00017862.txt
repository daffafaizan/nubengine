    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of humanized monoclonal anti-IL5
      antibody, SCH 55700 in reducing peripheral blood eosinophilia in patients with either
      hypereosinophilic syndrome or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Patients with hypereosinophilic
      syndrome refractory to or intolerant of therapy with conventional therapy (steroids,
      hydroxyurea and interferon alpha) will be admitted on this protocol. Additionally, subjects
      with eosinophilic gastroenteritis refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy (systemic
      glucocorticoids) will be admitted on this protocol. A thorough clinical evaluation will be
      performed with emphasis on potential sequelae of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. A
      baseline bone marrow will be obtained to exclude neoplasia and to assess the degree and
      nature of eosinophilipoiesis. Blood cells and/or serum will also be collected to provide
      reagents (such as DNA, RNA, and specific antibodies) for use in the laboratory to address
      issues related to the immunologic basis of FHES and GE as well as their pathogenesis and
      treatment. Following intravenous administration of a single 1 mg/kg dose of the humanized
      monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody, SCH 55700, patients will be followed in an inpatient setting
      for a minimum of 72 hours for monitoring of adverse effects secondary to the infusion.
      Followup visits will be scheduled monthly for 1 year or until the peripheral eosinophil count
      returns to baseline. Patients showing a reduction in eosinophilia and evidence of clinical
      improvement will be eligible to receive 5 additional doses of 1 mg/kg of SCH 55700 at monthly
      intervals.
