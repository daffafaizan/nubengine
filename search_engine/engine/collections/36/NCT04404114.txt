      older than 20 years old and received renal sonography examination in the emergency department
      of National Taiwan University Hospital. The investigators examined the participants' kidneys
      by recording the kidney size, cortical thickness, possible lesions and elasticity by
      shear-wave elastography. These data combined with the participants' medical history and renal
      function revealed by blood examination will be analyzed. This study was designed to determine
      the correlation between renal cortical elasticity and chronic kidney disease.
