      used as a source of antidiabetic compounds, from its seeds, leaves and extracts in different
      systems of medicine in asia. Fenugreek is traditionally used in India, especially in the
      Ayurvedic and Unani systems. Preliminary animal and human studies suggest possible
      hypoglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties of fenugreek seed powder taken orally. In a
      randomized placebo controlled study conducted by Gupta et al showed that two month treatment
      with the hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds improved glycemic control in 12
      non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients. In addition, there was improvement in
      insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile. Fenugreek extract was also well tolerated in
      diabetic patients.

      In the proposed study, hydroalcoholic Fenugreek seed extract will used add-on to the existing
      therapy in patients with type-2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of the extract will be
      evaluated using standard methodology.
