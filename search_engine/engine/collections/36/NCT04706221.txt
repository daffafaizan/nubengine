      to severe clinical complications ranging from mild anemia to fatal hemorrhagic shock.
      Monitoring and detecting these fluid changes postoperatively can be complicated, and standard
      operating procedures vary. The Cardiac Monitor, Model 1500 (CM-1500), uses a personalized
      approach by non-invasively and simultaneously monitoring five (5) physiological parameters,
      including bioelectrical impedance, ECG Amplitude, PPG Amplitude, heart rate, and skin
      temperature.
