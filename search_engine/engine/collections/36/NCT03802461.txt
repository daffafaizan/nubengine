    
      This is a multisite, open-label randomized controlled internal pilot trial designed to assess
      the feasibility of a larger trial aimed at determining the effectiveness of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) by enema in short and long term intestinal decolonization of
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Forty (40) asymptomatic adult patients
      intestinally colonized with CPE will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a bowel
      preparation followed by FMT by enema route, versus standard of care (no intervention). FMT
      will be provided by the University of Toronto Microbiota Therapeutics Outcomes Program
      (MTOP), using standardized operating procedures for recruiting and screening FMT donors,
      manufacturing FMT and administering FMT by enema. The feasibility outcomes are: successful
      randomization of 40 patients within 12 months, retention of >90% (36/40) of patients up to 6
      months, and provision of FMT at a non-primary study site in at least one patient. Data on the
      clinical and exploratory outcomes will be collected but not analyzed in this pilot study. The
      primary clinical outcome is incidence of intestinal decolonization of CPE at 3 months.
      Secondary clinical outcomes include: time to decolonization of CPE; incidence of CPE clinical
      infections up to 12 months post-intervention; incidence of intestinal decolonization of CPE
      and other antibiotic-resistant organisms (extended spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae
      - ESBLs and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci - VRE) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
      post-intervention; and, safety profile. As an exploratory outcome, changes in fecal
      microbiome composition will be examined before and after intervention. This study leverages
      existing support, research infrastructures and expertise - including the Toronto Invasive
      Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN), Toronto Antimicrobial Resistance Research Network
      (TARRN), and the University of Toronto Microbiota Therapeutics Outcomes Program (MTOP) - to
      optimize feasibility regarding patient recruitment and FMT administration.
