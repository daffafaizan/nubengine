      reperfusion by the inflation of a blood-pressure cuff over the systemic blood pressure for
      brief periods. The procedure is simple, safe and with no clear side effects. In clinical
      studies covering acute cardiology RIPC has effectively reduced myocardial injury,
      postoperative cardiovascular complications and cardiac mortality. Recently, the effect of
      RIPC on attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury has been investigated in non-cardiac surgery
      as well. The organ specific ischemia-reperfusion injury, systemic oxidative stress and
      inflammatory response were attenuated due to the intervention but a complete understanding of
      the underlying protective mechanisms of RIPC is however still lacking.

      Experimental and clinical studies have implicated that the stimulus of RIPC is transmitted
      from the preconditioned tissue to other tissues and organs by humoral, neural and systemic
      anti-inflammatory mediators. The humoral and neural pathway are thought to be dependent on
      endogen substances such as adenosine, bradykinin, nitrogen oxide (NO) and
      calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP).
