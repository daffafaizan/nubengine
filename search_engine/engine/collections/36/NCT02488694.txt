    
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study of maintaining pan-ERBB blockade following
      platinum-based induction chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutated, metastatic NSCLC
      progressing after first-line treatment with afatinib.

      Patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with afatinib will be screened while
      receiving an induction phase which consists of at least three but not more than four cycles
      of cisplatin/carboplatin plus pemetrexed given in 21-day cycles. Patients who do not progress
      (i.e. complete or partial response, or stable disease - CR, PR or SD) after completion of
      three or four cycles induction chemotherapy will then be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive
      maintenance therapy with either afatinib (40 mg/d, or last dose if reduced during first-line
      treatment) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m² every 21 days, or 375 mg/m² if dose was reduced during
      induction therapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient consent
      withdrawal.
