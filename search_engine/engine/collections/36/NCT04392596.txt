      reported incidence of osteoporosis, based on measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), in
      patients with AS ranging from 18.7% to 62%. Measurement of trabecular bone score (TBS) is a
      novel tool used to evaluate bone microarchitecture. Aim of the work: to compare bone quality
      using TBS between AS patients and healthy controls and to evaluate factors associated with
      TBS in patients with AS. Patients and methods: A total of 40 male AS patients recruited from
      Outpatient Clinic of Rheumatology, Mansoura University Hospital. 40 age-matched healthy males
      as matched control. TBS was analyzed using DXA images over exactly the same region as the
      lumbar BMD assessment (L1-L4). Lumbar spine DXA images were reanalyzed using TBS iNight
      software version 2.1 (Med-I maps, Merignac, France). Patients were divided in 3 TBS groups
      according to guidelines for fracture risk: any TBS >1.31 was considered as normal; TBS values
      between 1.23 and 1.31 were consistent as partially degraded structure; and any TBS <1.23 was
      considered as degraded structure
