        -  Quantifying the effects in terms of disability associated with chronic pain

        -  Quantifying the effects on the cognitive (affect, anxiety, depression).

        -  Study the correlation between pain and oxidative stress.

      Methods :a controlled, randomized single-center prospective trial, according to a ZELEN
      modified scheme

      Intervention treatment : Pain treatment by a process of Virtual Reality 3D. The intervention
      protocol consists of 3 sessions of immersion in a 3D environment of 17 minutes per week for 4
      consecutive weeks.

      Conducting the study: an inclusion visit, then the intervention protocol for patients in the
      arm "Virtual Reality" during 4 weeks, and then a monthly follow-up visit for 4 months.
