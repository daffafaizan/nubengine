      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen), total knee arthroplasty is
      associated with acute moderate-to-severe postoperative pain requiring opioids treatment. We
      compare the efficacy of SSTS and oral Oxycodone in this context.

      After written informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned postoperatively to SSTS or
      Oral oxycodone group at a ratio 1:1. Pain scores, mobilization and patient satisfaction will
      be analyzed.
