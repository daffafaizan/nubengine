      the surgeon to use. The use of 3D measurements is independent of patient positioning, which
      results in more accurate measurements of the glenoid version and inclination measurements in
      shoulder replacement surgery.

      Pre-operative planning with Blueprint can accurately predict intraoperative implant selection
      within one size. Also, pre-operative planning leads to case efficiency and improved
      functional outcomes at 6 months post-operative compared to Baseline.

      The objective of this study is to characterize implant size accuracy, planning time,
      functional outcomes, and procedural time (i.e., surgical time) using Blueprint planning
      software in subjects who are candidates for reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
