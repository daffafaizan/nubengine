      be vulnerable for future psychological difficulties after their child's admission to the
      Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Bristol Children's Hospital. Both mothers and
      fathers of children admitted to PICY for a duration of at least 12 hours will be invited to
      participate in this study. Screening measures will be used to identify vulnerability to
      future post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Where one or both of the parents
      has been scored as high risk they will be randomised to receive the intervention or the
      control arm of the study (ratio 1:1). The intervention involves a follow-up clinic two months
      pots admission, staffed by the unit Clinical Psychologist, a PICU doctor and PICU nurse. In
      the control arm no follow-up clinic will be offered (i.e. current standard care).

      Objectives:

      i) To investigate the recruitment rates, clinic attendance and follow-up rates in order to
      perform an accurate sample size calculation for a larger study.

      ii) To carry out initial statistical analysis to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence
      interval of developing PTSD, anxiety and depression after being offered the follow-up
      intervention as opposed to not being offered it.

      iii) To assess the acceptability of providing targeted follow-up both to those who receive it
      and those who are excluded due to low risk.

      The study is of importance to the public because not only does PTSD negatively affect quality
      of life, it is also associated with increased use of health care services and resources.
