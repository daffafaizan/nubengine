      (HAART), liver disease has become a leading cause of death among HIV-infected persons in
      Western cohorts, primarily affecting those co-infected with hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV,
      HCV). However, data are sparse on liver disease in HIV-infected populations from Uganda and
      other African nations, where the etiologies of liver disease are broader and include
      aflatoxin, schistosomiasis and other infectious and environmental agents. Our previous
      noninvasive study in rural, Rakai, Uganda indicates that the prevalence of significant liver
      fibrosis is high among HIV-infected individuals (17%) and is 50% higher than in
      HIV-uninfected persons, although the prevalence of viral hepatitis B co-infection is low
      (5%). The study presented here is a biopsy-based study that follows up on these results with
      the objectives of defining the etiology of liver disease and describing the mechanisms of
      HIV-accelerated liver fibrosis in this setting.
