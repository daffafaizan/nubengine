      worldwide. Neuropathic pain in the feet related to peripheral neuropathy is one of the most
      common symptoms associated with HIV. This pain is difficult to treat and medications are not
      effective. Chronic pain in people with HIV is related to higher levels of disability and poor
      quality of life.

      Psychological treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can improve quality of life
      for people with chronic pain in general (not HIV-related), and there have been efforts to
      provide more accessible versions of CBT over the Internet. However, it is not known whether
      Internet-based CBT is helpful for people with HIV and chronic pain.

      The current trial will explore the feasibility of a newly developed form of online CBT called
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which we have called "ACT OPEN") for people with HIV and
      painful peripheral neuropathy. Participants will be recruited from HIV clinics in London, UK.
      Participants will be randomly chosen to receive the new ACT OPEN treatment right away or
      after waiting for 5 months. The treatment lasts for 8 weeks. Participants will complete
      self-report questionnaires to assess pain, functioning, and mood at the beginning of the
      study and 8 weeks and five months later.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a larger trial evaluating the
      impact of online ACT for people with HIV and chronic pain in their feet. Key feasibility
      parameters that will be evaluated will include an estimate of the recruitment and retention
      rates, treatment completion rate and satisfaction, and an estimate of the effect size of
      changes in standard pain outcome measures.
