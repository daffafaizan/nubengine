      for developing respiratory disease. Given the strong relationship between parental smoking
      and child health, many studies have evaluated the efficacy of interventions to modify
      parental smoking behavior and thereby reduce children's exposure to second- and thirdhand
      tobacco smoke, including the use of cotinine levels in children. There are several local ETS
      exposure intervention programs for The Barbara Bush Children's Hospital patient population
      and their families. The state of Maine and MaineHealth fund a free 24-hour tobacco cessation
      hotline (The Maine Tobacco Helpline) which combines evidence-based behavioral counseling
      techniques and free nicotine replacement therapy (gum, lozenge, or patch). MaineHealth also
      runs a tobacco cessation campaign (The Breathe Easy Coalition) that provides print materials
      and trainings aimed to reduce smoking in public housing, hospitals, behavioral health
      facilities, and higher education. The Breathe Easy Coalition's Smoke-Free Housing program
      provides education about the effects of secondhand and thirdhand tobacco smoke and asks
      families to pledge to keep tobacco smoke out of their home. This study aims to combine all
      three of these strategies (child cotinine feedback, tobacco cessation counseling, and written
      materials on ETS) to create a cohesive ETS exposure reduction program for the Barbara Bush
      Children's Hospital inpatient population, and determine the feasibility of a future study
      that would evaluate whether cotinine testing is helpful for changing smoking behaviors in
      this target population.
