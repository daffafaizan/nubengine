           cause several symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain, or urinary symptoms
           according to size and location. Steadily, lesser invasive surgeries have been preferred
           for such benign disease (laparotomy, laparoscopy, and then single-port surgery).2,3

        -  However, these minimal approaches, laparoscopic morcellation of preoperatively
           suspicious leimyoma, have the potential risk of peritoneal seeding of postoperative
           diagnosed leiomyosarcoma in the pathological examination.4 Currently, safe morcellation
           is also required during myomectomy while using a lesser invasive surgical approach such
           as single-port surgery or natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery (NOTES).

        -  During single-port surgery or embryonic NOTES (E-NOTES) via an umbilicus, handling of
           myoma into different directions could be quite a big challenge. Fortunately, myoma is
           enough hard to pull with string and has a tendency not to rupture during manipulation of
           these strings.

        -  These concepts lead to traction of anchoring sutures during E-NOTES for myomectomy
           applied in the current case. Safe morcellation could be guaranteed, because direction
           morcellation via an umbilicus is possible in an endobag.

        -  This useful and safe surgical approach needs to be confirmed in multi-centers in terms
           of feasibility and morbidity.
