      vivo. Tumor VEGF expression is correlated with the severity of disease in patients with
      gastric cancer and some authors have suggested using circulating VEGF as a prognostic factor
      or tumor marker.In addition to producing proangiogenic cytokines, recent data demonstrate
      that tumors can produce antiangiogenic cytokine as well. It has been suggested that, in
      humans, the generation of antiangiogenic compounds in the presence of a primary tumor
      suppresses the growth of distant metastases. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in mice
      and in patients with clear cell renal cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. However,
      the presence of endogenous antiangiogenic cytokines in patients with gastric cancer has not
      been reported.
