      with open-loop or triggered, closed-loop cueing. PD+ FOG patients will be studied before and
      after 6 weeks of training (total of 18 sessions) and one month later (to begin to assess
      retention). The two intervention groups will receive training sessions designed to enhance
      implicit motor learning and avoidance of FOG. This will be the first study to assess these
      novel paradigms. If the results support the hypotheses, further studies will be needed
      including a placebo-controlled trial. 20 subjects will be included in the feed-forward,
      open-loop group (OLG) and 20 in the feedback, closed-loop group (CLG) (based on power
      analysis to provide 80% power at Î±=0.05). Participants will be recruited on a rolling
      admission basis (about 2 subjects per week over ~20 weeks) and will be randomly assigned to
      one of the 2 groups. Pre, post and retention effects will be tested without knowledge of
      group assignment. A (repeated measures) mixed models statistical approach will be used to
      evaluate within and across group effects over time, adjusting for baseline values. The study
      will be conducted under the auspices of the Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics and the
      Movement Disorders Unit (MDU) at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. At all times during
      training and testing, the subjects will be closely monitored by a research assistant to
      ensure safety.
