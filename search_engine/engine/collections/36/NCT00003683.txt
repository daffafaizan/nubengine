      ifosfamide and doxorubicin in patients with metastatic sarcomatoid renal cell cancer. II.
      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the effect of this
      regimen on the survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 and ifosfamide
      IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
