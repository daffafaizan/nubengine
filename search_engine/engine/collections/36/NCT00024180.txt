        -  Determine the in vivo biologic effect of FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with
           chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, or
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine any preliminary anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-decreasing, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma vs acute myeloid
      leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia).

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 10 patients per stratum receive decreasing doses of FR901228 until the minimal
      active dose is determined. If 5 or more patients show clinical or biological response, the
      subsequent cohort is treated at a lower dose. If fewer than 5 patients respond, the
      subsequent cohort is treated at a higher dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 20 patients (10 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
