      preparing for elective surgery will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be to select
      appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools and to employ them to characterize
      malnutrition prevalence and severity and establish cut-off values associated with
      malnutrition in this population. In years 2-5 of the research two-part research study, a
      pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be
      evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a perioperative protein-enhanced
      intervention compared to an educational control. Veterans who are malnourished or at risk of
      being malnourished will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either an education
      (nutritional counseling) control or high-protein perihabilitation arm. Participants in the
      high-protein perihabilitation arm will be provided with 30 grams of high quality protein
      supplements three times per day. The study will take place two weeks prior to an elective
      abdominal or GI surgery and will continue 4 weeks post surgery.
