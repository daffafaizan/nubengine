      after discharge has become an important problem. İntensive Care Unit Acquired
      Weakness(ICU-AW) is seen in most of the patients admitted in this unit. The biggest reasons
      for ICU-AW are; sepsis, multiple organ failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The use
      of measurement tools to evaluate disabilities during stay and after discharge in intensive
      care unit, is a subject that has been researched all over the world.. These measurement tools
      provide; monitoring and evaluation during the ICU admission and assessment efficacy of
      treatment in the unit. The Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool(CPAX) has been
      shown to valid, reliable and to exhibited strong clinimetric properties. CPAx is a numerical
      measurement tool, rated according to the 6-point Guttman Scale, from complete dependence to
      independence and consist of ten physical function parameters. This study is aimed at
      providing an translation and cross-cultural adaptation of Chelsea Critical Care Physical
      Assesment Tool (CPAx) and tested its reliability and validity. The protocol includes a
      pre-test of the Turkish version on 10 patients, a final revision, and a validation on a
      sample of 40 İCU patients.
