      treatment regimes of vitD3. Mothers, lactating or nonlactating controls will be randomized to
      either Group A: standard treatment(400 IU D3/d), Group B: (2,400 IU D3/d), or Group C: (6,400
      IU D3/d. Infants of mothers randomized to Group A will receive 400 IU D3/d (recommended
      practice) and infants of mothers assigned to Groups B or C will receive placebo. On 2/5/2009,
      the protocol was amended and the Group B arm was dropped; infants of active subjects
      randomized to Group B as of 2/5/2009 were put on open label treatment (400 IU D3/d) through
      study completion. Newly enrolled subjects after this date were randomized to Group A or Group
      C only.

      By measuring an array of indicators,calcium homeostasis and skeletal remodeling in the
      postpartum mother and the breastfeeding infant will be monitored. Through this study, the
      prevalence of vitD deficiency in the breastfeeding dyad and the utility of maternal
      therapeutic intervention with VitD3 will be assessed.
