      will receive capsules containing 650 mg Acetaminophen plus 400 mg Ibuprofen. Group B will
      receive capsules containing 600 mg Acetaminophen, 15 mg caffeine and 60 mg codeine. Capsules
      are placed in identical dossettes containing a seven day supply. Patients are instructed to
      start taking their medications post-op and continue until they are pain free. All
      participants are given a series of blank Visual Analogue scales and Likert scales and
      instructed to record their level of pain intensity and pain relief four times per day for the
      entire week. Peri-operative pain management will be standardized. Patients will not receive
      pre-operative analgesics. Intra-operative analgesia will be intravenous opioids as selected
      by anaesthesiology. No local/regional anaesthesia will be used. Intravenous ketorolac will
      not be allowed for trial participants. All patients will receive intravenous opioid and
      anti-emetic if required in PACU. Any patients with peri-operative complications or other
      problems requiring admission or alternative analgesics will be excluded.
