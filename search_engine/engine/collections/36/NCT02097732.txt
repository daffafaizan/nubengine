    
      This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction
      prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain metastases.
      Participants will be randomized to Arm A "Induction" (two doses of ipilimumab prior to SRS,
      two doses of ipilimumab after SRS) versus Arm B "No induction" (SRS first, followed by 4
      doses of ipilimumab). Participants will undergo multiple dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs of
      the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.
