      biomechanical instability of the corneal stroma. Treatment modalities are primarily glasses
      or contact lenses. It has been estimated that one out of five patients will progress to such
      an extent that a corneal transplant is necessary to regain useful vision.

      Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is a treatment modality that intends to halt progression
      of keratoconus. This study investigates the efficacy av CXL in stabilizing the cornea in
      keratoconus by means of a randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Participants are eligible for inclusion if progressive keratoconus is confirmed and the
      inclusion criteria are met. Follow-up after inclusion is at 1 week (treatment group), 1, 3, 6
      and 12 months. Pre- and post-inclusion examinations include measurement of uncorrected
      distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity (BSCDVA),
      Scheimpflug-topography and slitlamp examination.
