      accepting cholecystectomy. Is it better postoperation for this sort of patients? In other
      words, there is no specific indication for cholecystectomy in gallbladder benign diseases.
      Investigators want to explore the specific surgical indication for these patients so that
      surgeons could help patients make the best decision according to our evaluation model. This
      model may be a scale that summarizes and quantizes correlative factors of individual, which
      will be discussed by statisticians and experts of biliary surgery.
