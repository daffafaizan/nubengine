    
      MATERIALS & METHODS The study is divided in two groups

      1. Group 1-Localized osteosarcoma that have reported a post neoadjuvant chemotherapy primary
      tumor necrosis â‰¤ 60% Metformin will be administrated for 3 years maximum or until progression
      disease or if G3 or G4 toxicity is verified.

      37 patients as total population are necessary to evaluate a 3 yrs increase of EFS from 35% (
      historical data Tsuda Y ) to 60%,

      2. Group 2 Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients in Complete Remission after the first
      relapse.Metformin will be administrated for 3 years or until progression .

      The Event Free Survival of this second group will be calculated at 1 yr with the aim of an
      increase of EFS from 20%(historical data) to 45%

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE Sample size was calculated by the Expected Total Study
      Length minimization criteria to ensure a potency parameter of 80 % and point if there is a
      benefit in use Metformin compared to the historical control.

      EFS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier and the standard error will be used to calculate the
      interim analysis Z-factor as well as the final statistical analysis.

      The final statistical analysis will be performed

        -  Group 1 after 3 years after last patient enrollment

        -  Group 2 at 1 year from the last patient enrollment : EFS at 1 year

      OBJECTIVE

        1. Evaluate the event free survival (EFS) in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients with
           high risk of relapse compared to the historical control.

        2. Evaluate Metformin's toxicity as maintenance therapy.
