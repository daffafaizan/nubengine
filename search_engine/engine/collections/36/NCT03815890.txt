      in a pre-operative window of opportunity trial. As the data of the investigators generated in
      the TONIC trial (metastatic TNBC) indicate that low dose doxorubicin may 'prime' the tumor
      microenvironment (TME) resulting in higher response rates on nivolumab, in addition, cohorts
      for treatment with nivolumab plus low dose doxorubicin will be opened. Given the emerging
      data on other immunomodulatory strategies, this platform study allows opening additional
      cohorts for promising novel immune-oncology (IO) drugs for which a strong efficacy signal has
      been seen without drug safety issues. The investigators will study the TME and systemic host
      factors with specific emphasis on immunosuppressive processes that can potentially be
      targeted by novel IO agents to further optimize BC immunotherapy.
