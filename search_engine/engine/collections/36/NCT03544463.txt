      significantly to hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and other health problems.
      Intraoral devices, such as tongue retaining devices, palatal lifting devices and mandibular
      repositioning devices designed to increase the patency of the airway and to decrease airway
      obstruction, are used to treat OSA. To this end, the investigators are conducting a
      prospective, self-controlled, first-night order cross-over and evaluator-blind pivotal study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNAP® Sleep Therapy System (iNAP®), a tongue and soft
      palate retaining intraoral device, in adults with OSA.
