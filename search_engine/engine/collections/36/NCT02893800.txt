      address care solutions for a growing number of PwD and CG in the absence of a cure for
      (Alzheimer's) dementia.

      Methods: A user study with two free available locating watches. In educational sessions PwD
      obtain a locating watch and their CG a smartphone with the application of the locating watch
      installed on it. By using a cross-over design each dyad (PwD and CG) obtaining both locating
      systems. The designed educational session hopefully ease subsequent use and make it more
      enjoyable. The dyads will use each system over four weeks in their real environment.
