      determined by the patients usual preoperative MAP. Thus, the trial will evaluate whether
      tailoring the MAP target for the period of cardiopulmonary bypass to within 10 mmHg of the
      patients usual MAP, but < 90 mmHg (and thus achieving pressures during bypass within the
      patients usual autoregulatory range) reduces major neurologic and cardiac morbidity and
      mortality, as well as cognitive complications, thereby improving post-operative quality of
      life.
