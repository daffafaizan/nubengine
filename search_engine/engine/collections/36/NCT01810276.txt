      trauma patients. The initial volume and early growth of the hematoma are critical
      determinants of mortality and functional outcome. As our population ages, a significant and
      growing number of patients present with ICH while on antiplatelet therapy. Bleeding is a well
      known complication of this therapy. It is likely that patients with ICH who are exposed to
      antiplatelet therapy would have an increased risk of hemorrhage growth and poor outcome
      compared to patients that are not using antiplatelet therapy. There are no pharmacologic
      agents that can reverse the antithrombotic effect of aspirin or the thienopyridines. There is
      a paucity of published data, one small phase one trial and two retrospective studies that
      address the use of platelets as a means to reverse the effects of antiplatelet therapy in
      patients suffering ICH. In addition, transfusion of platelets may be associated with
      transfusion reactions, such as infection and fluid overload. Furthermore, these patients are
      then exposed to the very thromboembolic complications the antiplatelet therapy was designed
      to prevent.

      Given the lack of data, which is primarily retrospective and likely underpowered, The
      investigators feel it's important to conduct a trial to more definitively study the efficacy
      of antiplatelet reversal in patients with life threatening ICH. Furthermore, it would be
      important to understand that, if there is a benefit to antiplatelet reversal in patients with
      ICH, that this benefit will outweigh the risks of antiplatelet reversal.
