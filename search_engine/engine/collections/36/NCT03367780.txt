    
      Primary objective of this prospective observational study is to determine the gland-based
      dose-effect relation between conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) and long-term loss
      of acinar cells, per salivary gland type. The study population consists of a maximum of 20
      patients with HNSCC referred for high-dose (CC)RT. There is no therapeutic intervention.
      Diagnostic intervention is PSMA PET/CT.
