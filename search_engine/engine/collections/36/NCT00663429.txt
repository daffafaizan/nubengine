      regimen has demonstrated a response rate of more than 20% using the criterion of a 50%
      reduction of bidimensionally measurable disease. In the more recently reported ECOG phase III
      study of chemotherapy in carcinoid tumors (E1281), patients were randomly assigned to
      treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) plus doxorubicin or 5FU plus streptozocin. The median
      progression free survival durations were disappointing. They were 4.5 months in the 5FU plus
      doxorubicin arm and 5.3 months in the 5FU plus streptozocin arm. Overall survival durations
      recorded in the trial were also suboptimal at 15 and 24 months respectively. There is no
      clear survival benefit for cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label extension study of the safety and efficacy of
      atiprimod treatment in patients with low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma who
      have metastatic or unresectable local-regional cancer and who have either symptoms (diarrhea,
      flushing and/or wheezing) despite standard therapy (octreotide) or progression of
      neuroendocrine tumor(s) (defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or a 20%
      increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions during the 6 months prior to
      enrollment in CP-106). Atiprimod will be administered orally as a single daily dose of 60
      mg/day for 14 days, followed by a 14-day treatment-free period (i.e., 1 treatment cycle = 28
      days).
