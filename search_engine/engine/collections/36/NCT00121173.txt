      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine in
           preventing cervical cancer in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-16-positive grade
           2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  Determine the effect of this vaccine on the histology of cervical tissue specimens from
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in lesion size and HPV viral load in patients treated with this
           vaccine.

        -  Determine the cellular, humoral, and local tissue immune responses in patients treated
           with this vaccine.

        -  Correlate measures of immune response with clinical response in patients treated with
           this vaccine.

        -  Correlate measures of immune response in patients treated with this vaccine with those
           observed in the preclinical model.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine subcutaneously once in
           weeks 0, 4, and 8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients undergo colposcopy in week 8, 15 and 19 and a therapeutic loop electrosurgical
           excision procedure (LEEP) in week 15.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the safest dose is determined.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive vaccine as in phase I but at the safest dose determined in
           phase I. Patients also undergo colposcopy and LEEP as in phase I.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed annually for 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 150 patients (approximately 12 will be treated in phase I
      and 25 will be treated in phase II) will be accrued for this study.
