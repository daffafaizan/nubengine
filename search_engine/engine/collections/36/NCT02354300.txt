      in a small percentage of patients which can result in long term complications including
      stroke, hemorrhage, and even death.

      The formation of microemboli during the insertion of the device has not been evaluated.
      During insertion, there is significant disruption of blood flow and this may be a source of
      intracranial microemboli.

      This study will use transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) to evaluate the blood flow during
      the placement of flow diverters to try to determine why these embolic events occur.
