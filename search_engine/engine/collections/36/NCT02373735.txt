      fluid therapy on the blood loss and postoperative outcomes in radical cystectomy. Patients
      were randomized to fluid management to maintain <10% SVV (group A), or to undergo fluid
      management during radical cystectomy to maintain SVV 10-20% (group B). Intraoperative blood
      loss and hemodynamic parameters, perioperative laboratory data, and postoperative
      complications were compared between two groups.
