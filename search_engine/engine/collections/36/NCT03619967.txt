      injected in the participants: technetium radiocolloid, indocyanine green and methylene blue.
      Initially, the surgeon will identify the location of the sentinel lymph node per standard of
      care by using a handheld gamma-probe and by visual inspection of the wound site. While the
      surgeon is locating the sentinel lymph nodes in the underarm surgical wound site, the
      investigators will be recording the fluorescent signals from the same site with the
      bio-inspired multispectral camera.

      All resected tissue from the patient will be imaged with the multispectral camera before
      sending samples for pathology analysis. Results obtained from the multispectral cameras will
      not be presented to the surgeon during the surgery in order not to influence their surgical
      decision.
