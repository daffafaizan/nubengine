      vaccine hesitant parents. The video includes an expert in pediatric infectious diseases
      answering these common questions as well as 3 parental accounts of children who contracted
      vaccine preventable diseases. Also, the interventional group will be provided with two
      handouts: one listed information on how parents can find accurate vaccine information on the
      internet, and another that addresses more common concerns of vaccine hesitant parents and
      available for our use from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Center website.
