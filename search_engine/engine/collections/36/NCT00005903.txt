      recombinant-methionyl human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (r-metHuGDNF) will be
      compared with the contralateral intralenticular infusion of a placebo solution, both
      continuously administered using chronically implanted catheters and pumps in up to 10
      patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Safety will be evaluated by analyzing implant-,
      post-implant-, and treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, and
      disease status. Efficacy will be studied by comparing left and right sided neurologic
      function using validated clinical scales as well as by putative surrogate biochemical and
      radiographic measures.
