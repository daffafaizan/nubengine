      early is of potential benefit, as is probably an aggressive treatment regimen trying to
      achieve goals for factors such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipids, smoking, physical
      activity and weight.

      This study compares traditional non-invasive tests such as stress-ecg, modern non-invasive
      tests such as holter-analysis, modern ECG analysis, stress-ecco cardiography and tissue
      Doppler against the gold standard today for assessing coronary artery disease, coronary
      angiography, in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one cv-risk factor (i.e smoking,
      premature familial coronary artery disease (CAD)), hypertension) irrespective of symptoms or
      signs of CAD.

      The participants are included in a randomized-control trial for 2 years where one arm
      receives standard treatment and one receives treatment after a multi-interventional program.

      End-points include: glycemic control, lipid control, weight control, blood pressure control,
      and effects on inflammatory parameters.
