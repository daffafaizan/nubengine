      immaturity and an increased susceptibility toward skin barrier disruption or percutaneous
      absorption.

      The epidermal barrier function resides in the outermost epidermal layer , the stratum corneum
      , which is the region of terminal skin differnatiation and is composed of corneocytes . The
      hydrophobic components of the lipid matrix provide the epidermal permeability barrier and
      protect against excessive water loss and irritant penetration , whereas the corneocytes and
      the cornified envelope provide mechanical strength to the stratum corneum.

      The skin in the diaper area is predisposed to irritation by the prolonged contact with
      irritants , such as urine and feces as well as by diaper occlusion, with leads to an increase
      in hydration and skin ph. Overhydration promotes degradation of "the brick and mortar"
      structure of stratum corneum, contributing to impraired barrier function.
