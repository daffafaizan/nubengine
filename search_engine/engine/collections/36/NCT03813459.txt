    
      SubSynD is a prospective, observational, multicenter clinical study, involving 400 patients
      in Intensive Care Units, to assess subsyndromal delirium.

      A systematic screening for delirium and subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is done with Intensive
      Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU).
      Scales are applied once per day until ICU discharge or for up to 14 days of being in ICU.

      The investigators access three different groups of patients: non-delirium, delirium and
      subsyndromal delirium. It is intended that either ICDSC or CAM-ICU, paired with a Richmond
      Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) be administered once per day (i.e. with first assessment
      in the morning). All patients with abnormal CAM-ICU or ICDSC features, beside the underlying
      cause of delirium and SSD are included. In addition, data regarding baseline demographic and
      clinical characteristics will be collected as well as data regarding the procedure performed
      (see Case Report Form (CRF)).
