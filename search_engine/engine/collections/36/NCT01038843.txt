    
      Nocturia, defined as waking to urinate at least once per night between periods of sleep, is a
      common complaint which increases with age. VA106483 is a non-peptide drug VA106483 that is
      being developed for the treatment of nocturia in males.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of VA106483 on the number of times the
      subject needs to get up to urinate (nocturnal void) per night and to determine the effect on
      the time between the subject's bedtime and the time they first wake up to urinate.
