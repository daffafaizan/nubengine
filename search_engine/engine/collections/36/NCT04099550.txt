      glucose control remains a challenge. Combined use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring
      (RT-CGM) systems may promote improved glycaemic control.

      Thirty adult with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes are randomised to using either
      RT-CGM or self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for 1 week with lifestyle intervention.

      After 3 month, outcomes were glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose), weight, and lipid
      profile assessed pre- and post-intervention.
