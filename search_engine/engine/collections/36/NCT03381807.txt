      due to repeated or aggressive curettages and/or endometritis. As a result, there is a loss of
      functional endometrium in multiple areas and the uterine cavity is obliterated by
      intrauterine adhesions, which results in amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, infertility and recurrent
      pregnancy loss. Transcervical resection of adhesion (TCRA) is the main treatment for
      Asherman's syndrome; so far the effect is usually poor in moderate to severe refractory
      cases.

      Human amniotic epithelial stem cells (hAESCs) are derived from human amniotic epithelium.
      hAESCs retain the characteristics approximating to embryonic stem cells. Animal experiments
      have shown that the endometrial thickness and fertility of mice was significantly improved
      after intrauterine therapy with hAESCs. To further explore the role of hAESCs in Asherman's
      syndrome patients, this project will evaluate the safety of hAESCs and find an effective
      treatment protocols.
