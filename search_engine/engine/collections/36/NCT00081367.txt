      ethnic minority populations. Studies have shown that CBT designed for this high-risk
      population is successful at reducing suicide attempts in people with suicidal thoughts or
      attempts. This study will implement a CBT intervention into the community and will focus on
      increasing compliance with psychiatric, substance abuse, and medical treatment.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT plus standard care
      or standard care alone. Participants who receive CBT will have ten weekly sessions of
      treatment. Suicidal thoughts or attempts, hopelessness, depression, health care utilization,
      and overall psychological and social adaptation will be assessed. Assessments will be made 1,
      3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after study completion.
