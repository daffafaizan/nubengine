      Primary

        -  To determine if ALDH1 positivity, as determined by IHC staining, identifies a poor
           prognostic subgroup of women with early-stage breast cancer who have been uniformly
           treated with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

      Secondary

        -  To determine associations of ALDH1 expression with other known factors that have been
           determined on clinical trial SWOG-9313, such as estrogen receptor (ER) status, HER2
           status, TOPOII, cyclin E, and p27.

        -  To determine if ALDH1 positivity, as determined by IHC staining, identifies a poor
           prognostic subgroup within ER and HER2 subgroups in patients treated on clinical trial
           SWOG-9313.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor tissue samples from clinical trial SWOG-9313 are analyzed for ALDH1 expression by IHC.
