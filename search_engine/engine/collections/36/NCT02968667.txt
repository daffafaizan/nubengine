      participants of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Participants aged 18 years or older with
      DSM-V schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from outpatient mental health clinics in
      Jordan, were randomly assigned participants either to receive 6 weeks of a booklet form of
      intervention with face to face discussion, and treatment as usual [TAU] (intervention, n =
      56), or TAU (control, n = 56). Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately
      post-intervention (post-treatment1) and at three months follow-up. The primary outcome
      measure was change in helplessness score . Secondary outcomes for PDwS were psychiatric
      symptoms, recovery rate and quality of life.
