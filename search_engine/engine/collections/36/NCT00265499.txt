      bypass surgery involves the dissection of a rim of tissue surrounding the artery on either
      side. Although the benefits of ITA use are well established, there are certain limitations to
      its routine use. Recent studies, primarily observational, have suggested that skeletonization
      of the ITA (i.e. harvesting of the ITA alone) may overcome some of these limitations by
      improving conduit flow, increasing length, and reducing the risk of deep sternal infection in
      high risk patients. Furthermore, skeletonization of the ITA can potentially preserve
      intercostal nerves and reduce post-operative pain and dysesthesias associated with ITA
      harvesting. In order to assess the effects of ITA skeletonization, this is a prospective,
      randomized, within-patient study design in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      grafting.
