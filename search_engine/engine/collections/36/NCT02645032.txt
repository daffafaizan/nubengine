      be stratified according to age.

      The study procedure is as follows:

      Visit 1 (day-1 to -7): Screen participants by medical history, physical examination and lab
      investigations. Collect blood for safety and immunogenicity assessments.

      Visit 2 (day 0): Enroll, randomize and administer first dose of vaccine to eligible
      participants

      Visit 3 (day 3): Assess participant safety by medical history and physical examination

      Visit 4 (day 7): Record solicited adverse reaction 7 days post vaccination, and collect blood
      for safety lab assessments.

      Visit 5 (day 28): Assess participant safety, collect blood for immunogenicity assessments,
      and administer second vaccine dose

      Visit 6 (day 31): Participants safety will be assessed by medical history and physical
      examination

      Visit 7 (day 35): Record solicited adverse reaction 7 days post second vaccination.

      Visit 8 (day 56): Collect blood for immunogenicity assessments, assess participant safety,
      and fill in study completion form in the absence of any safety concern.

      This study is observer-blind: vaccine administrator and vaccine safety evaluator will be two
      distinct persons to avoid bias of safety assessment. Trial staff other than the vaccine
      administrator.
