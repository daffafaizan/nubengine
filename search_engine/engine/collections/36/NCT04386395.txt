      have a poor prognosis. Both the level of IL-6 and the severity of the lymphopenia have been
      associated to the poor prognosis. Better knowledge of the time evolution of the circulating
      immune cells subpopulations and functions will help to best tailor the treatment:
      anti-inflammatory strategy at the initial phase might be rapidly shifted to immune
      stimulation when immunodepression is diagnosed.

      It is then essential to assess the patients' immune status using flowcytometry methods to
      characterize both innate and adaptive immunity of the whole blood circulating immune
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After cell staining with the adequate cell
      markers, the flowcytometry (NAVIOS® Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) allowed to analyze the
      number and the function of the cells with an adequate gating strategy and the Kaluza®
      software v2.1 (Beckman Coulter). The data were then grouped by time intervals referring to
      the onset of symptoms and also to the ICU admission. The trend for innate immunity (monocytes
      number and subpopulations, HLA-DR expression) and for adaptive immunity (lymphocytes and
      subpopulations) will be analyzed. Since it is unknown if whole blood CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8
      lymphocytes elicit an "exhaustion" pattern and/or an abnormal response, an ex vivo testing of
      their reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins will be performed. This test of
      polyfunctionality will characterize the intracellular cytokine expression (IL-1 beta,
      TNFalpha, and INFgamma) both for CD4 and CD8 T cells.
