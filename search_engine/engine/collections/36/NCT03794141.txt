      and a modification of our earlier pilot intervention. Our intervention methods are general
      lectures of the effects of healthy diet (Finnish Nutrition Recommendations 2014) and healthy
      lifestyle for all participants. Effects on motivation, attitudes and preferences will be
      studied and verified by questionnaires and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and
      Alzheimer disease by analyzing clinical markers of lipid metabolism, general phenotype
      markers and profiles of nutritional markers. Nutritional biomarkers will verify also the
      self-reported changes of diet in the questionnaires and in digital food diaries.
