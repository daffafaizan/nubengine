      inhibitor, evaluating patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including breast,
      lung, sarcoma and melanoma as part of a 28-day treatment cycle. The study will employ a "3+3"
      dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is
      identified.
