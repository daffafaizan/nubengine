      PBMC are purified. T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen
      receptors (CARs) specific for GPC3. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the
      participant by intratumor injection at the dose of(1-10)Ã—106 CAR positive T cells. The cells
      perfusion process would only last for (1-2) min. GPC-CART cells are injected into each tumor
      focus only once.
