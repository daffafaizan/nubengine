      maintenance of effect of, the development of tolerance through exposure to, and safety of,
      Sativex® in the treatment of subjects with neuropathic pain. The study provided continued
      availability of Sativex® to subjects who completed the preceding double-blind neuropathic
      pain studies. Consenting, eligible subjects who had participated in previous GW Pharma Ltd
      (GW) randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies entered the study (Visit 1, Day 0) and
      commenced dosing. Study visits took place at Week 2 (Visit 2, Day 14), Week 14 (Visit 3, Day
      98), and Week 26 (Visit 4, Day 182). Subjects returned to the centre for an end of treatment
      visit at week 38 (Visit 5, Day 266). All subjects received Sativex®. This was followed by a
      five week randomised-withdrawal phase (Part B) for a subset of subjects. An end of study
      visit took place 28 days after Visit 5 (or 5b or 5c) or withdrawal from the study.
