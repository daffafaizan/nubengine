      closely linked with HIV acquisition among African Americans (AAs). However, no interventions
      have been developed to address SAVA syndemic risk-reduction for HIV-negative but high-risk
      heterosexual AA couples. This application builds on a qualitative study that was conducted
      during phase 1 of a NIDA-funded project. In phase 1, the investigators finalized and tested
      our recruitment protocol and conducted qualitative interviews with 16 couples who met study
      criteria. This application focused on phase 2 of the funded study. As part of this study the
      investigators will test an adapted 8-session couple-based SAVA syndemic informed
      risk-reduction intervention for HIV-negative, AA heterosexual couples who report intimate
      partner violence (IPV), and substance use. For this purpose, the investigators deliver the
      intervention to 20 couples who meet study inclusion criteria to test the adapted
      intervention. The intervention will be delivered online (via zoom) to individual couples.
      These couples will be recruited through social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) and
      advertising through local community-based organizations. The investigators will also inform
      the couples who participated in phase 1 qualitative interviews about the opportunity to
      participate in phase 2. Those who express an interest in participating in phase 2 will have
      to complete screening again to make sure they are eligible for the present study. This
      research will be done as part of a grant proposal funded by NIDA. Given the disproportionate
      impact of HIV on AAs, this study addresses a key gap in literature by testing the first SAVA
      informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual AA couples.
