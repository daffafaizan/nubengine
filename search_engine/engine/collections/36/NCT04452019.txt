      injuries, leading to shorter hospital stays, less contractures, and improved general
      function.

      The routine mobilization treatment in the rehabilitation of patients with severe brain
      injuries in Sunnaas Rehabilitation hospital is initial use of a tilt table where tilt angle
      is gradually increased, and when tolerated standing in a classic standing frame where the
      pasient's lower body is fixed to the device in an upright standing position.

      Innowalk Pro is a robotic standing device where legs are fixed, but passively moved by
      electric motors in an upright standing position. An assumption is that standing in Innowalk
      pro might be better tolerated at an earlier stage of rehabilitation than standing in a
      classic standing frame.
