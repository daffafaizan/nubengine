    
      A controlled release hydrophilic matrix (Controlled Therapeutics Ltd., East Kilbride,
      Scotland) which provides a gradual release of dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) was introduced
      in 1995 (Propess, Ferring Pharmaceuticals). This preparation is used for the initiation or
      enhancement of cervical ripening in women at or after term with a singleton pregnancy and a
      cephalic presentation. Prostaglandin E2 causes softening and dilatation of the cervix and
      subsequently produces uterine contractions which may induce labour.
