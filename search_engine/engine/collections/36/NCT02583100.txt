      rates of oro-nasal fistula after cleft palate repair. Fistula is an important potential
      complication of cleft palate repair.

      The study also evaluates feasibility of standardized outcome measurement in the care of
      children with cleft lip and palate, acceptability of standardized measurement, and
      acceptability of the audit and feedback intervention among surgeons.

      The results of this research will improve child health by enabling cleft surgeons to
      critically evaluate and improve their patient's outcomes.
