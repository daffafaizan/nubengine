    
      Device performance will be primarily evaluated in terms of the proportion of G4 System values
      that are within ±20% of the study meter reference value for glucose levels >80 mg/dL and ±20
      mg/dL at meter glucose levels <80 mg/dL. This proportion will be compared to the proportion
      of such points observed in the DexCom clinical study that will be used to apply for FDA
      approval of the G4 System (PTL 900360) for adults.

      Safety data of the G4 System will also be collected and safety will be characterized by the
      incidence of Adverse Device Effects, Serious Adverse Device Events, and Unanticipated Adverse
      Device Effects experienced by study participants.
