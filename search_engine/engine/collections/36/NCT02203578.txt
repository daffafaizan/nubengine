      I. To determine if romidepsin should be developed as a therapy for patients with
      steroid-refractory GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
