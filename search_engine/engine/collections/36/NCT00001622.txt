      in patients with essential hypertension and patients with hypercholesterolemia. We have
      performed intra-arterial infusion of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent drugs
      into the brachial artery with noninvasive measurement of the response of the forearm
      vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Those studies have allowed us to: a)
      demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension
      and in patients with hypercholesterolemia; and b) identify an abnormality in the
      endothelium-derived nitric oxide system that is responsible for endothelial dysfunction in
      these patients. Further studies to more precisely determine the intracellular processes that
      mediate this abnormality in endothelial function in these patients are limited by the
      inherent shortcomings of the in vivo technique. An alternative possibility is the study of
      human small vessels in vitro; however, the relationship between in vivo and in vitro vascular
      responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent agonists has not been established. In the
      present study, we propose to investigate this relationship in normal volunteers, patients
      with essential hypertension, and patients with hypercholesterolemia.
