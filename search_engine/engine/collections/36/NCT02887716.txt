      not have pathology likely to alter the fat content of the vertebrae. Or that fat content is
      potentially a reflection of brittle bones (osteoporosis, for example), and deserves to be
      known because it can be used to normalize the lipid fraction values with respect to age or
      from the level (L1 , L2, L3, L4 or L5) of the vertebra being studied.
