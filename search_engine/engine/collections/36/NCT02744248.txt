      (SPIO) can shorten the T2 relaxation time very effectively and reduces signal intensity in
      normal tissues. The mechanism of action increases after the particles have been phagocytosed
      by cells of the RES. Tissues with decreased RES function (e.g., metastases, primary liver
      cancer, cysts and various benign tumors, adenomas, and hyperplasia) retain their native
      signal intensity. In this study, investigators will characterize the PK profile, iron
      metabolism and preliminary efficacy of IOP Injection.
