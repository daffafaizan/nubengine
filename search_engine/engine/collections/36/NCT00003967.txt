      prolonged etoposide as second line therapy in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial,
      peritoneal, or tubal cancer. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this
      treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the response rate and time to
      disease progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral topotecan daily on days 1-5
      and oral etoposide daily on days 8-10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable side effects. Patients achieving partial or complete response or
      stable disease continue treatment for at least 4-6 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      topotecan and etoposide on increasing numbers of days until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no greater than 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
