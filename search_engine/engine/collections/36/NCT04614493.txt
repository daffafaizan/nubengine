      trial that will evaluate primarily the clinical efficacy of the device and will be to compare
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) between the standard of care treatment with concomitant
      ultrasound BBB opening versus standard of care alone. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common
      and aggressive primary brain cancer. Currently, prognosis is very poor, with a survival of
      about 15 months with current therapies. Although intensive treatments combining surgery,
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of GBM patients remains poor. New treatment
      strategies are urgently needed.

      In the brain, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the uptake of therapeutic
      agents. To encounter this BBB issue, Professor Alexandre Carpentier and his team developed an
      ultrasound medical device (SonoCloud), implanted in the skull during surgery. This highly
      innovative technique temporarily permeates the BBB, increasing drug delivery to the brain by
      five times. The SonoCloud, a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound device developed by CarThera, is
      one of the major innovations in this field, as shown by the encouraging results obtained in
      studies in recurrent GBM.

      The expected benefits of using the SonoCloud-9 experimental device prior to TMZ chemotherapy
      are the stabilization or reduction of GBM tumor volume on the one hand, and stabilization or
      improvement of the patient's neurological status on the other hand.

      Participation in the clinical trial will contribute to a better understanding of the safety
      and efficacy of opening the BBB. It will be possible to determine whether the BBB opening
      using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can be effective in treating GBM, in addition to the
      standard of care protocol.
