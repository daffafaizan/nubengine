      two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing acetaminophen 650 mg
      extended release gel tabs (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of OHM Laboratories Inc.
      (subsidiary of Ranbaxy) with Tylenol 8 hour extended release gel tabs (containing
      acetaminophen 650 mg) of McNeil Consumer & Speciality Pharmaceuticals in healthy, adult,
      human, male subjects under fasting condition.

      The treatments were assigned to the study subjects according to SAS generated randomization
      schedule. Each subject received a single oral dose either Test or Reference product in each
      period with 240ml of water at ambient temperature after an overnight fast of at least 10
      hours under supervision of a trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters inclusive of vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters and urine analysis) at base line were assessed. Laboratory parameters of
      hematology and biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.
