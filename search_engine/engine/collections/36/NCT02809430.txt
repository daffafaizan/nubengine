      2 IPR units of the University of Washington. Eligible stroke patients undergoing IPR were
      provided an intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) to increase tolerance and adherence to
      auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). The iCAP included patient education and encouragement, device
      adjustments, close monitoring of adherence and a 3-night run-in period of APAP to identify
      those patients who 1. have OSA and 2. have APAP tolerance-- defined as participant
      willingness to continue APAP during IPR and over the 3-month treatment period. If both
      criteria were met, APAP treatment with iCAP continued during the rehabilitation stay and over
      a 3-month period. The goal of the intervention was to achieve 50% of subjects meeting APAP
      adherence (an average â‰¥ 4 hours per night) over the 3-month treatment period. The
      investigators evaluated if demographic, co-morbid or stroke-specific factors predicted APAP
      adherence and assessed the relationship between APAP adherence and neurological recovery from
      stroke.
