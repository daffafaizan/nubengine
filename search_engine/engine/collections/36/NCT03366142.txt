      function. Decreased expression of the <=2 subunit of leukocyte integrins results in abnormal
      cell-cell and cell extracellular matrix adhesion. This disease is characterized by recurrent
      bacterial infections, impaired wound formation, and other aberrations of adhesion-dependent
      functions. The severe phenotype can be fatal, but patients with even moderate phenotypes are
      prone to infection and lose their teeth despite treatment.

      Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit of human interleukins
      IL-12 and IL-23. It is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active
      psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe Crohn s disease. By binding the shared p40
      subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, ustekinumab exerts clinical effects through interruption of the
      TH1 and TH17 cytokine pathways. Previous work at the NIH suggests that blockade of IL-17,
      which is highly expressed in the gingiva of people with LAD1, can reduce bacterial load and
      resolve inflammatory gingival disease. We have treated one patient with ustekinumab for 1
      year; during this time, he had no serious infections and there was a dramatic resolution of
      his inflammatory lesions. Our goal is to explore the potential of ustekinumab as treatment
      for LAD1 inflammatory disease.

      The objective of this open-label, proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of ustekinumab in 10 patients with LAD1. Participants will receive 5 doses of
      ustekinumab via subcutaneous injection over the course of 1 year. They will be evaluated for
      adverse events, as well as the effect of the drug on inflammatory lesions and biomarker
      expression.
