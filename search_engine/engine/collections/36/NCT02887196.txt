      their treatment for stage I-III breast cancer. The women will be asked to provide their
      opinions and desires for lifestyle intervention at four timepoints throughout treatment. In
      addition to qualitative data, basic clinical data will be collected (anthropometrics, vital
      signs, dietary intake, and physical activity). The primary goal of this pilot study is to
      investigate the anthropometric and behavioral changes that occur in patients undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      Aim 1: To better understand patients' attitudes toward and perceived barriers to nutrition
      and physical activity interventions during neoplastic treatment.

      Hypothesis: Patients' reported attitudes, motivation, and perceived barriers will change
      throughout treatment.

      Aim 2: To measure the physical and metabolic changes that occur throughout neoplastic
      treatment for breast cancer.

      Hypothesis: Over 50% of the participants will gain body weight during treatment and metabolic
      parameters will trend with body weight change.
