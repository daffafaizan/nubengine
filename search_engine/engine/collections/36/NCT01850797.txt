      multicentre stroke database regarding the optimal management of ischemic and hemorrhagic
      stroke during anticoagulation with nOAC. Specifically, we aim to obtain critical information
      regarding the epidemiology, natural history, laboratory and neuroradiological aspects,
      clinical consequences, and the effects of treatment (i.e. thrombolysis/interventional
      recanalisation in ischemic stroke and hemostatic therapy in ICH, respectively) in stroke
      during nOAC. The Registry is not limited to a specific new OAC but intends to examine stroke
      during use of any of the approved nOAC. The study is not designed to perform comparisons
      among the different nOAC.
