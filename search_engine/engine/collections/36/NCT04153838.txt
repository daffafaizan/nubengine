      severely impair cognitive abilities and general development. On a day-to-day level,
      completing everyday tasks, socialising successfully with peers, and getting on with school
      work can become much more difficult than it was before.

      Helpfully, supports and treatments are available that can reduce the negative effects of
      neurological impairment on a child's cognitive functioning in order to maximise developmental
      outcomes. However, to deliver appropriate interventions, we must correctly estimate the
      impact of injury or illness on cognitive abilities and accurately measure how successful
      treatments are at improving outcomes. Unfortunately, reliable ways of doing this simply do
      not exist at this time. Consequently, accurate disease (effects) monitoring is seriously
      undermined; potentially compromising a child's medical management and, thereby, future
      developmental outcomes.

      This study intends to addresses this grave shortcoming by developing reliable ways of
      measuring the cognitive effects of neurological disease or injury at diagnosis and beyond. Of
      note, by providing a mechanism to better inform clinical/medical management decisions,
      completion of this study will help contribute to health and social care aims of enabling
      children to realise their developmental potential.
