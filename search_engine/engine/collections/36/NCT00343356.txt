      TURBT or partial cystectomy were entered the trail. They were divided into 3 groups randomly:
      1, EPI plus BCG; 2, use BCG alone; and 3, use EPI alone. All the patients have been followed
      up for 28-40 months after surgery (average time was 36 months), and the frequency of
      bacterial, chemical cystitis and other local side effects were also observed.Results After a
      median follow up of 36 months, the number of recurrences in group 1 was significantly reduced
      than group 2 and 3 (p<0.05 vs group 2 and 3, x2-test). The frequency of bacterial, chemical
      cystitis and other local side effects was similar in group 1 and 2, whereas significant
      severe side effect was found in group 3 (p<0.05 vs group 2 and 1, x2-test). Allergic
      reactions, including skin rash, were more frequent in group 3, and other systemic effects
      were more frequent in group 1. Conclusion Biochemotherapy by single dose EPI plus sequential
      BCG intravesical is markedly effect in preventing the recurrence of bladder cancer after
      surgical management. Its side effects are low. This method is of high clinical value.
