      the effectiveness of PRF using the Ivivi SofPulse on knee pain severity in adults with mild
      to moderate knee OA. Potential subjects will complete questions related to medical history,
      inclusion / exclusion criteria, and OA symptom severity. Knee radiographs will be evaluated
      by the Principal Investigator (PI) or co-investigator for determination of knee OA severity
      based on the Kellgren/Lawrence criteria. Eligible subjects will enter a 1-week run-in period.
      After successful completion of the run-in period, subjects will be randomized to PRF
      treatment twice a day (Active) or sham treatment twice a day (Sham). All subjects will be
      followed for 4 weeks for purposes of the primary endpoint evaluation. Thereafter, the
      subjects initially allocated to Active will be equally allocated to Active or Sham and will
      be followed through 26 or 8 weeks, respectively. The subjects originally assigned to Sham
      will maintain this treatment regimen through 26 weeks.
