      with hepatocellular carcinoma. As there are a finite number of active patients at the
      institute, and no studies with sample size well established, has seen a sample size of 20
      patients.

      The duration of individual monitoring shall be one month to three visits (baseline, week 2
      and week 4 after receiving the first radiofrequency ablation). Each visit will be a
      nutritional assessment including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance, biochemical tests,
      Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) and Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF).

      Anthropometric measures to be taken are weight, height and arm circumference average.

      Bioelectrical impedance will be using a single frequency impedance meter (425 to -50 KHz,
      Range 0 to 10,000) Bioelectrical Body Composition Analyzer Quantium II RJL Systems. The team
      measured the subjects' impedance, resistance, reactance and phase angle by Lean Body program
      provided by the manufacturer.

      Hepatic encephalopathy be evaluated by testing PHES and was measured CFF, also also be
      measured ammonium, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, renin angiotensin aldosterone.
