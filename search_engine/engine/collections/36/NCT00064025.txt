      I. Compare the efficacy of medroxyprogesterone, in terms of induction of histologic response,
      in patients with progesterone receptor-positive vs progesterone receptor-negative
      endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus.

      II. Determine the early and late changes in gene expression at 72 hours and 21 days in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Examine the mechanisms surrounding the dynamic changes in endometrial tumor cells by
      determining possible correlations among histologic response, steroid receptor status,
      immunohistochemical measures of growth and apoptosis, and gene expression profiles in
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive medroxyprogesterone intramuscularly once approximately 3 weeks before
      surgical hysterectomy.

      A subset of 15 patients has tissue collected by pipelle biopsy or curettage at baseline, 72
      hours after medroxyprogesterone therapy, and during surgery for gene expression arrays.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
