    
      This project involves an interdisciplinary stroke database of demographic variables and
      clinical measures collected during routine acute care, inpatient rehabilitation admission and
      discharge as well as follow up questionnaires at 6 month and 12 months to examine stroke
      recovery.

      Our aim is to observe and describe the relationships between impairments and function,
      systematically characterize recovery patterns and examine short and long term rehabilitation
      outcomes.

      This project is purely observational, descriptive and non experimental. No rehabilitation
      interventions or treatment procedures are being introduced, modified or studied.
