    
      The purpose of this single arm intervention study is to determine if the fall rate (as
      measured by falls per 1000 patient days) for patients designated "high fall risk" decreases
      with the use of the PUP™ [Patient is UP Falls Prevention System] when compared to the
      historical falls rate data for the prior 12 months from those same nursing units within the
      OSUWM Brain & Spine Hospital. All Brain and Spine Hospital patients will be evaluated as to
      fall risk using the current fall risk assessment tool employed by OSU Medical Center and
      administered in the usual and customary fashion upon evaluation on the floor and Pod.
      Patients who are determined to be at a high fall risk will be approached to participate.
      Those patients who consent to participate in the study will remain in the study until a nurse
      removes the patient from high risk fall status or the participant has been discharged from
      the hospital. Any patient fall will to be reported and evaluated following current processes
      and procedures developed by the OSU Brain and Spine Institute as maintained with IHIS; the
      PUP™ as the intervention for this study will be an adjunct to those fall prevention processes
      already in place.
