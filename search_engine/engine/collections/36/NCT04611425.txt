      hospitalized in intensive care units for an acute respiratory failure in all countries. This
      situation has quickly led to massive shortage in masks, mechanical ventilation machines and
      common medications such as hypnotics. The reasons for such shortage are multiple: dramatic
      increase of the demand, production discontinuation because of shutdowns in multiple
      countries, and withholding of products by producing countries. All countries over the world
      are currently experiencing a major shortage in basic hypnotic medications (propofol,
      midazolam) in the intensive care as well as in the operating theatre. Remimazolam is a novel
      benzodiazepine with a short half-life that has been administered in patients undergoing major
      surgery, as well as in the intensive care unit. The Principal Investigator proposes to
      perform a pilot study assessing the benefit-risk ratio of Remimazolam in the critical care
      units of Nantes University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.
