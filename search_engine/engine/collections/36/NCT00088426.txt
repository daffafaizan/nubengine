      conception. It has a prevalence of 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and 1 in
      10,000 to 1 in 20,000 at term. In live born infants, the abnormalities associated with HPE
      are divided into three main categories: alobar, semilobar, and lobar HPE. A fourth variant,
      middle interhemispheric variant, has also been recognized. The purpose of this study is to
      increase our understanding of the genetic and clinical manifestations of HPE through detailed
      physical, psychological, developmental, neurologic, endocrinologic, and radiologic studies.
      We will examine the spectrum of clinical characteristics of HPE to facilitate early diagnosis
      and clinical management, including genetic counseling. Finally, we plan to assess the
      psychosocial impact of HPE on the family as a unit. Most patients and their families will be
      seen at the NIH Clinical Center. A subset may be examined outside the NIH, and a further
      subset, for the psychosocial studies, may be interviewed by phone.
