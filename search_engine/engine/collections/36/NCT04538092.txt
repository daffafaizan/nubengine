      protocols for preoperative, intraoperative or post-operative care. New standards are being
      created for minimally invasive spine surgery within orthopedics and some neurosurgical
      centers. This study will evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol
      for complex spine surgery performed for the treatment of ASD.

      Participants : Patients undergoing surgery aimed at treating adult spinal deformity are the
      subject of this research. This population was chosen as these procedures are often associated
      with prolonged length of stay (LOS), high post-operative narcotic use, and often require
      complex post-operative discharge planning.

      Procedures : Patients undergoing surgery to address the complications of ASD present a unique
      challenge in that this patient population is diverse, and there are multiple operative
      procedures available to treat the same condition. Given that there are currently no accepted
      or recommended Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for complex spine procedures, the
      investigators have developed an ERAS protocol at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in
      collaboration with the anesthesia department for the support of complex surgical patients.

      Hypothesis: Implementing a multi-modal enhanced recovery after complex spine surgery protocol
      will improve patient measured outcomes and patient functional outcomes leading to a
      statistically significant reduction in LOS, post-operative pain, complication rate, cost.
