    
      The study will proceed in four stages. Following stages I, II and III, all subjects will have
      the Postdose 1 (PD1) clinical and laboratory safety data reviewed by the Safety Evaluation
      Committee (SEC). If these data are acceptable, the next stage will be initiated.

        -  In Stage I, participants will be randomized to receive 3 doses of the 3x10^9vp/dose
           level Trivalent vaccine or placebo.

        -  In Stage II, participants will be randomized to receive 2 or 3 doses of the
           3x10^10vp/dose level Trivalent vaccine or placebo.

        -  In Stage III, participants will be randomized to receive 3 doses of the Trivalent
           vaccine with titers of 1x10^11vp/dose, 3x10^6vp/dose, 3x10^7vp/dose, or 3x10^8vp/dose or
           placebo.

        -  In Stage IV, participants will be randomized to all treatment groups. In addition, some
           participants will be randomized to an MRKAd 5 HIV-1 gag Monovalent vaccine. In this
           stage, participants will be pre-stratified by baseline Ad5 titers (=<200, and >200), to
           ensure an even distribution of participants with high and low Ad5 titers across the
           various treatment groups.
