      response rate when oral topotecan is given twice a day for 5 days versus once a day for 10
      days to patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of oral
      topotecan in these patients. III. Evaluate whether there are morphologic and/or cytogenetic
      subsets of the myelodysplastic syndromes that will respond optimally to this regimen. IV.
      Evaluate the change in the percentage of bone marrow blast cells in these patients during
      treatment. V. Evaluate the time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to FAB
      subtype: 1. Refractory anemia with excess blasts 2. Refractory anemia with excess blasts in
      transformation 3. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 4. Refractory anemia, refractory anemia
      with ringed sideroblasts, and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia Patients are
      randomized to receive oral topotecan either twice daily for 5 days or once daily for 10 days.
      Courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients are evaluated for hematologic response after the
      initial 2 courses, and then every 4 courses. If a partial response or hematologic improvement
      is observed, treatment continues until disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia,
      relapse, death, or irreversible toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response receive an
      additional 2 courses of therapy before discontinuation of protocol treatment. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every year for an additional 3 years, and at time
      of progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      13 months.
