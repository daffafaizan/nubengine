    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate in a pilot study a preliminary estimate of the overall change of metabolic
      syndrome score in men undergoing or who have undergone androgen-deprivation therapy for
      treatment or the control of prostate cancer.

      II. To assess the effectiveness of Atorvastatin (atorvastatin calcium) on the prevention of
      metabolic syndrome in men undergoing or who have undergone androgen-deprivation therapy for
      treatment or the control of prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the safety and tolerability of Atorvastatin in this patient population.

      II. To assess the impact of Atorvastatin on mean change in prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      and PSA velocity.

      III. The collection and banking of blood and serum on subjects for future analysis that will
      be proposed in future institutional review board (IRB) submissions.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive placebo orally once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive atorvastatin calcium orally once daily for 6 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and at 6 months
      thereafter.
