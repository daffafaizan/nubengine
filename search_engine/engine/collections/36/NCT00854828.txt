    
      Specific Aim #1: Compare the outcomes of surgery and nonoperative treatment in patients aged
      40 to 80 with ASLS defined as a lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and
      either of the following: Oswestry (ODI) score of 20 or more; or Scoliosis Research Society
      Quality of Life instrument (SRS-QOL) score of 4.0 or less, in the domains of pain, function
      and/or appearance.

      Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the impact of patient factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status,
      education) and comorbidities [mental health, body mass index (BMI) and bone mineral density
      (BMD)] on adverse events and treatment outcomes for both the nonoperative and operative arms.
      Incorporate these variables into a prediction model to help identify those patients most
      likely to benefit from either a surgical or nonoperative approach
