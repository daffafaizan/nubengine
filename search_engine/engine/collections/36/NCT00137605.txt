    
      A multicentre, randomized controlled trial using a two factorial design. Eighty patients will
      be randomly assigned to receive either Pneumovax (or Pneumo23 according to standard use at
      site) or heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) prior to reconstitution of the
      immune system or will have immunization delayed until their CD4 count is greater than 200
      cells/mm3 after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy. Randomization will be stratified
      by study centre. Variable block sizes will be used to try to prevent study personnel from
      guessing the next allocation. Random allocation lists will be generated by computer.
