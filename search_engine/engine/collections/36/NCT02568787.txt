      (RBAC) on outcome variables in persons with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This
      nutritional supplement is made from a water soluble extract of rice bran that has been
      partially hydrolyzed by the action of a natural enzyme complex extracted from Shiitake
      mushroom. Given that these micronutrients may be important for regulating the immune system,
      investigators will investigate the impact of RBAC on the following variables among 20 adults
      (18+ years of age and over) diagnosed with NAFLD:

        1. albumin

        2. 4-hydroxynonenal

        3. lipids

        4. liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
           alkaline phosphatase (ALP)

        5. malondialdehyde

        6. γ-glutamyltransferase

        7. cytokines (TNF-α, LT-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-2, IL-15,
           IL-8, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, IL-23, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-18)

        8. lymphocytes

        9. platelets

      Specifically, subjects will participate in a 3-month, two-group, randomized intervention,
      where one group (n=10) will take 1 gram/day RBAC and the other group (n=10) will take a
      placebo to compare differences in outcomes between the two groups. The results of the study
      are intended to address the multi-faceted physiological problems of NAFLD patients by testing
      the efficacy of a nutritional supplement intervention on multiple outcomes in this
      population.
