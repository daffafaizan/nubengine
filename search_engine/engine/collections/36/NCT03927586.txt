      memory, executive function and language. The age-adjusted prevalence of MCI in Taiwan is
      approximately 18%. The progression rate from MCI to dementia ranges from 10 to 15% each year,
      and over 50% of the MCI population will develop into severe cognitive impairment or dementia
      in five years. Early detection and intervention of the individuals with MCI may help delay or
      prevent progress from MCI to dementia, and reduce the burden of their caregivers and the
      medical expenses of the health-care system. Whilst numerous studies have established the
      potential benefits of cognitive or physical exercise training on cognition for individuals
      with MCI, some recent studies suggested that combining physical exercise and cognitive
      training may augment the intervention effects. Also, different combination methods -
      combining physical exercise and cognitive training either sequentially or simultaneously
      under a dual-task paradigm may impose differential cognitive challenges on the participants,
      and it is yet not clear which combination strategy has better training effects.
