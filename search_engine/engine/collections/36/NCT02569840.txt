      diet, whilst ensuring that an adequate nutritional intake is achieved with suitable
      alternative foods or prescribable feeds. A number of studies and clinical insights indicate
      that CMA is persisting longer than infancy, into later childhood and becoming more complex.
      If a child has CMA, eliminating the offending allergens whilst maintaining an intake of food
      that meets their nutritional requirements for growth and development is challenging due to
      the significant nutritional contribution these foods make to a child's diet, particularly
      milk and dairy products. This supports the need for alternatives to cow's milk to be
      available for children >1year of age to help meet their nutritional needs. Aminoacid based
      feeds are already widely used in clinical practice to meet this need. A new nutritionally
      complete amino acid based powdered feed for the dietary management of CMA, or other
      conditions where an amino acid based is recommended, in children aged 1-10yrs old, has been
      developed.

      This study is to support the use of this new amino acid based feed in clinical practice. The
      study will evaluate the tolerance and acceptability of the amino acid based powdered feed in
      20 children aged 1-10yrs of age receiving or requiring an amino acid based feed for the
      dietary management of CMA and food allergy associated conditions, over 4 weeks. The primary
      outcome will be gastrointestinal tolerance, with secondary outcomes of compliance,
      acceptability, nutrient intake and anthropometry.
