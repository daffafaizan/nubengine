      of smartphones has opened up new possibilities which surpass the normal audio-only telephony.
      High quality and real-time video-telephony is now feasible. However until now this technology
      hasn't been deployed in the emergency respond service.

      In the hope of helping the detection of the cardiac arrest, offer the possibility to evaluate
      and correct via a video-instructed CPR (V-CPR) and to facilitate a fast localization of the
      emergency site, a new software (EmergencyEye®/RAMSES®) was developed which enables the
      dispatcher a video-telephony with the callers mobile terminal (smartphone) if suitable, and
      automated localisation of the caller.

      This technology hasn't been tested in a randomized controlled trial in real environment
      conditions yet. This is to be done in this study.
