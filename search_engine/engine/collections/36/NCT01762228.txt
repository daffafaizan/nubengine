      physiology) the effect on the deglutition of two therapeutic treatments with the duration of
      2 weeks, based on the increase of the sensorial stimuli in older patients with oropharyngeal
      dysphagia:

        1. Stimulation of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) oropharynx chanels using
           a natural agonist administrated in the alimentary bolus.

        2. Stimulation of the sensorial neurons of the pharynx and larynx using transcutaneous
           electrical stimuli.

      The study will last 5 weeks per patient. At the beginning of the study, patients will receive
      a videofluoroscopic evaluation and an electroencephalography (evoked potentials) to asses
      dysphagia and cortical activity of deglutition. After that the first day of the third week
      they will begin the treatment (group a or b) during 2 weeks. Finally in the fifth week an
      evaluation of dysphagia will be performed the same way as in week 1 to asses the effects of
      the treatments.
