      clarified. If a radical prostatectomy is planned, the question occurs if the additional
      pelvic lymph node dissection (LND) is justified and to what extent it should be performed
      (limited LND, standard LND or extended LND). On the one hand, the detection of lymph node
      metastases is associated with a significantly worse course of the tumor disease and requires
      immediate or delayed hormone-ablative therapy. On the other hand, the lymph node dissection
      is associated with risks (lymphoceles, thromboses, lymphedema), so that the indication in
      negative lymph node findings appears questionable. It must be weighed between the diagnostic
      advantage and the possibility of increased morbidity due to the lymphadenectomy. For
      localized intermediate risk prostate cancer (PSA> 10 ng / ml - 20 ng / ml or Gleason score 7
      or cT category 2b ), there are currently no recommendations for performing a lymph node
      dissection during prostatectomy.
