      Participants, study staff and investigators will remain blinded until after the dataset has
      been cleaned. At the baseline visit participants will be instructed to consume the assigned
      supplement twice daily for 12 consecutive months. A calendar will be provided to record
      compliance, recurrent UTIs and any side effects. Participants will be phoned/texted each
      month to encourage participation. Additional study visits will be completed at 3 months, 6
      months and 9 months to collect information on recurrent UTIs and adherence. A urine sample
      will be collected from participants at each visit to test for pregnancy and the presence of
      an undetected UTI. Supplements will be distributed at each visit for the following 3-month
      study period and the last bottle of unused product returned. At the 12-month visit,
      participants will complete an end-line questionnaire and return their supplement bottle in
      addition to the calendar and side effect diary. If participants withdraw from the study, they
      will be encouraged to return at 12 months to complete a survey to allow for intent-to-treat
      analysis.
