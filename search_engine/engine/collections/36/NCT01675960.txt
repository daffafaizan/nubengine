    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design of the effects of
      gabapentin on chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children. The study will
      involve a 22 day medication titration, followed by a 7 day stable dosing period and a 6 day
      medication taper period. After an additional 3 day washout period, the subject will
      cross-over to the remaining arm of the study. Subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of
      chronic pain. Since the subjects are generally non-communicative, the subjects will be
      evaluated by two questionnaires and the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised,
      to be completed by their parent or primary caregiver.

      The primary aim is to determine if gabapentin provides symptom relief for chronic
      irritability in neurologically impaired children.
