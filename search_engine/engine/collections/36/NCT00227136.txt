      Internet. It is claimed to improve sleep problems, depression, anxiety, compulsive disorders,
      restless leg syndrome, migraines, fibromyalgia, and low pain threshold.Increased levels of
      5-HIAA in the urine can be a of a specific type of cancer, called carcinoid tumor. Urinary
      5-HIAA levels can also be increased by a number of food products and drugs. Oral 5-HTP is not
      known as a cause of elevation of 5-HIAA in urine. However, recent information suggests that
      5-HTP may cause an increase.

      In this study we examine the effect of oral 5-HTP intake (100 mg at bedtime for 10 days) on
      5-HIAA excretion in the urine, following a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study
      design.

      Understanding this effect may help to determine which tests should be done in a patient with
      increased 5-HIAA excretion who's also taking 5-HTP.
