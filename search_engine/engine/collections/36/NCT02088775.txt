      I. To determine the relationship between radiation dose to 70% of the tumor volume as
      determined by post-treatment positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) and
      local control at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of PET-CT to reproducibly determine dose to tumor, normal liver,
      and other surrounding organs.

      II. To determine the stability of microsphere location by examining the changes in dose in a
      subset of patients with PET-CT scans performed on day 0 and day 1.

      III. To determine the relationship of dose predicted by technetium-99m (Tc-99m) labeled
      Macro-aggregated albumin (MAA) imaged using single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) versus post-treatment dosimetry.

      IV. To determine the effect of dose delivered on local control and normal tissue
      complications.

      V. To measure the perfusion of the tumor for correlation with dose deposition, based on
      arterial phase CT measurements.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PET-CT scan before and after standard radioembolization on day 0. A subset
      of patients undergo PET-CT scan on day 1, 24 hours after the day 0 post-treatment PET-CT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week, 1 and 3 months,
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 3 years.
