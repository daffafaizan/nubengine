      using a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR-scanner. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. SENC is a
      technique that directly measures peak circumferential strain from long-axis views and peak
      longitudinal strain from short axis views. Measurements were obtained for each segment in a
      modified 17 segment model. Wall motion and infarcted tissue were evaluated
      semi-quantitatively from SSFP cine sequences and contrast-enhanced-MR-images and were then
      related to myocardial strain. Comparison of peak circumferential strain assessed by SENC and
      MR-tagging was performed.
