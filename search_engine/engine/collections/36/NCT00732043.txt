      extract versus placebo on the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time at the
      end of 12,24, 36 and 48 months in male subjects who rolled-over from the GUP-0205-1 study.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on the change
      in PSA doubling time from baseline to each 12-month visit, to determine the time to tumor
      recurrence, to assess the tolerability and toxicity of the pomegranate treatment and to
      determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on response rates for positive PSA doubling
      times and for declining post-treatment PSA levels (negative doubling times).
