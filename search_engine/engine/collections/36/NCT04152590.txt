      surgery, which may be due to post-operative pain, stiffness of shoulder girdle muscle, and
      etc. Due to this limited ROM, the patients may suffer difficulty in activities of daily life
      and quality of life may be reduced.

      Uincare Homeplus is software manufactured in Korea, which uses infrared, kinect camera and
      motion capture technology to track 3D motion of the patients' articulation. Using this
      technology, the patients can receive feedback of their motion immediately.

      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term
      rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare
      Homeplus) in post-operative patients with breast cancer.
