      divided into 3 groups (Low Risk, Intermediate Risk and High Risk Groups) according to their
      prognostic index, which is on basis of blood cell count indexes and TNM stage. The 3 groups
      of patients will undergo a radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and be followed until
      death or the end of the study. Comparison on survivals of the 3 groups will be made to
      validate the accuracy of the prognostic index. And comparison on prediction efficacy between
      prognostic index and TNM staging system will be made.
