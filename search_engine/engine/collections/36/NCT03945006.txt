      patients with and without incontinence.

      The study was conducted in 35 MS patients with an age range of 24-58 years. The patients were
      divided into two groups based on the occurrence of incontinence. A neurologic examination was
      performed using the EDSS by a neurologist.

      Incontinence was measured with the Incontinence Severity Index (ISI), balance was measured
      with a TechnobodyÂ® stabilometric platform, and fear of falling was measured with the Falls
      Efficacy Scale (FES).
