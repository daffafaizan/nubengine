    
      PHSTT-01 is a multi-center, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      of prostate HistoScanning (HS) analysis in men at risk of PCa that have been scheduled for a
      first prostate biopsy. The purpose of this study is to determine if prostate HS analysis can
      improve the detection of clinically significant PCa, and potentially reduce the burden and
      number of biopsies in routine clinical practice. Subjects are men with serum total
      prostate-specific antigen (PCA) <= 20ng/mL (<= 10ng/mL if taking the 5-alpha reductase
      inhibitor).

      In a single visit, subjects will first be imaged with TRUS for the purpose of generating data
      for prostate HS analysis. The results of HS analysis will be used later in the procedure.
      Subjects will then undergo two consecutive biopsy procedures. First, using TRUS, a systematic
      10- to 12-core biopsy procedure will be performed. In turn, prostate HS data taken at the
      beginning of the procedure will be used to determine suspicious areas (displayed as red on an
      imaging monitor) and used to guide the biopsy procedure. Areas that are identified as
      suspicious (zero to a maximum of 3 areas) will then be sampled with two biopsy cores.
      Depending on the number of suspicious areas identified by prostate HS, the number of cores
      will be zero to a maximum of 6 cores.
