      levels admitted to hospital or treated as outpatient for decompensated Heart Failure (HF) are
      at hight risk for recurrent decompensation and readmission. The objective of this study is to
      investigate if these patients may benefit from enhanced home monitoring of their HF status.

      In the 3 study arms (BNP, Health Management and control groups) home fingerstick BNP levels
      will be obtained so that frequent data points are available for analysis of trends and
      variability. These results will remain blinded to the subjects in all study arms and their
      care providers in the health management and control arms, the investigator and staff will
      have access to the BNP results only for subjects in the BNP arm and will use this information
      to aid in therapy decisions.

      Subjects are monitored for 180 days as this time period is likely sufficient to differentiate
      normal biological variation in BNP changes due to impending decompensation.

      Patients will be assessed at Day 30,90 and 180 after randomization HF status, patient
      clinical outcome and treatment adjustments are recorded.

      Follow-up telephone calls to subjects at 3 and 6 months after completion of home testing will
      be conducted in order to determine the possible long-term benefit of home health management
      with daily BNP testing.
