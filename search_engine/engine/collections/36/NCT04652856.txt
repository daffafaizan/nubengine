      component of everyday interactions with the environment. This process requires the
      recognition of different items, accessing stored semantic knowledge about those items and
      their relationships with other objects, and guiding vision based on that knowledge. Classical
      models of attention emphasize low-level visual salience maps for attentional guidance.
      However, behavioral studies increasingly support a role for object knowledge in guiding
      attention and eye movements. Despite strong behavioral evidence that conceptual information
      about objects and scenes is critical for real world guidance of attention, very little is
      known about the neural basis of the guidance of attention based on meaning.

      Previous human imaging studies have identified several brain regions that represent object
      and scene/context knowledge as it relates to visual recognition. In particular, regions of
      the temporal lobes (inferior temporal regions (ITC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and the
      hippocampus) are critical for perceiving and understanding objects, but little is known about
      the role of these individual regions in how they interact to guide attention and eye
      movements in real-world scenes.

      Electrical brain stimulation is routinely performed clinically in the surgical treatment of
      epilepsy patients, both intraoperatively and using implanted electrodes. It is used as
      standard of care both to map eloquent brain function prior to surgical treatment for epilepsy
      and to map the seizure network. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding
      of the information flow and neural dynamics of the brain, examining the impact of electrical
      brain stimulation on stimulus search time, accuracy, and eye movement trajectories.
