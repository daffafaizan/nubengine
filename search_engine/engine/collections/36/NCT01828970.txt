      University Hospital, Strasbourg Sainte Anne Hospital, Colmar, Mulhouse, Valenciennes)
      designed to evaluate the feasibility and effects of a 3 month treatment regimen with
      rapid-acting insulin and basal long-acting insulin analogues (i.e., aspart and detemir,
      respectively) along with CGM on glucose level control in diabetic hemodialyzed patients.

      All patients who were admitted to the nephrology departments and matched the inclusion
      criteria between January 1st, 2010, and June 30th, 2012, were consecutively included in the
      study. CGM was used to analyze blood glucose excursions at baseline and 1 and 3 months of
      treatment. It was started during the first dialysis session and then continued for the next
      two days at home under ambulatory conditions. The CGM was continued during the next dialysis
      session. Therefore, in total, CGM (NavigatorÂ®; Abbott, Rungis, France) was performed for 54
      hours, including two consecutive hemodialysis sessions and at 0, 1, and 3 months of
      treatment. The probe for the system was subcutaneously inserted at the beginning of the first
      dialysis session to analyze interstitial glucose, and it was removed at the end of the second
      dialysis session. Due to the time required for CGM calibration, plasma glucose levels were
      only partially recorded during the first dialysis session.
