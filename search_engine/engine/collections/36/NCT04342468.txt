      data on BP, treatment, biochemical changes, kidney function and CV events will be extracted
      from patient records.

      Eligible patients who have given written informed consent will be given a questionnaire
      capturing data of their socio-demographic status, weight, height and BP measured.

      Those agreeable to measure their own BP at home 3 times a day for a week will be loaned a BP
      device to measure their own BP at home. The home BP readings will be recorded onto a provided
      form and returned to the investigators.

      Data will be analysed to

        1. determine BPV of the clinic visit-to-visit BPV (long tem BPV)

        2. determine the day to day BPV (short term BPV)

        3. examine the BPV to CV events, kidney function, cognition

        4. determine the prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension

        5. determine the level of control of BP

        6. examine the relationship of ownership of home BP devices to control and satisfaction of
           treatment
