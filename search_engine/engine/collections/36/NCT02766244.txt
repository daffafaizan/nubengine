      difficult to establish by visual inspection alone, even for experienced burn practitioners.
      This case series explores the use of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence using portable
      bedside assessment as a potential tool for early determination of burn depth. Three subjects
      with indeterminate thickness burns had daily perfusion assessment using ICG fluorescence
      assessment using the SPY machine (SPYÂ®, Lifecell Corp., NJ, USA) in addition to standard burn
      care. The fluorescence was quantified as a percentage of the perfusion of intact skin, and
      areas of hypo and hyper-perfusion were indicated. The burn surgeon, blinded to the ICG
      results, made a clinical determination of the need for skin grafting or discharge. The
      perfusion in areas of differing depth of burn were compared over the entire study period to
      determine both the magnitude of difference, and the point in the time course of healing when
      these changes became evident.
