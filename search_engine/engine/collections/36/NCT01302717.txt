      complete atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome to receive left ventricular pacing (49
      patients) or right ventricular apical pacing (49 patients). Patients will be paced with
      temporary pacemaker lead, and only those with paced QRS duration â‰¥185 ms will be enrolled.

      The primary endpoint is left ventricular ejection fraction measured by modified Simpson
      method at 12 months. The secondary end points include left ventricular systolic end-systolic
      and diastolic volume, LV strain, NYHA functional class, exercise performance (using treadmill
      test), quality of life (using SF-36v2), NT-proBNP at 12 months.
