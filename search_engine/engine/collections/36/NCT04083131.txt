      absenteeism and lowers self-esteem and academic performance. Moreover, dysmenorrheal women
      suffer more depression and anxiety.

      Sense of coherence (SOC) is composed of three items:

        -  comprehensibility: what the person understands about his illness

        -  manageability: what the person does to cope

        -  meaningfulness: what the disease means to the person. A high SOC score is related to
           good mental and physical health. The aim of this study will be to determine if there is
           a relationship between primary dysmenorrhea and the sense of coherence.

      A self-questionnaire composed of the SOC-13 and a scale evaluating dysmenorrhea will be
      proposed in the voluntary high schools of Finist√®re (France) to the girls of the classes
      chosen at random.
