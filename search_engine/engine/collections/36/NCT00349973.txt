      pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia has focused mainly on drugs with antidopaminergic actions.
      These drugs have robust effects on reality distortion and disorganization symptom complexes,
      but minimal effect on cognitive impairment, negative symptoms, and functional outcome and
      quality of life measures. Newer generation antipsychotic drugs have a similar profile of
      effects, with some advantages on the course of depression, hostility, suicide, hospital
      readmission rates and motor side effect measures. Side effects such as weight gain, increase
      in cardiovascular stress and diabetes risk are associated with some new generation drugs. A
      new class of drugs is needed to address the inadequate effectiveness and the side-effect
      disadvantages of the currently available pharmacological agents for the treatment of
      schizophrenia. Recently, new treatment strategies using nicotinergic drugs or agonists at the
      glycine modulatory site of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor have been
      employed in clinical trials with mixed results. Our proposal focuses on a clinically
      available adenosine agonist, dipyridamole, in a 6-week clinical trial. Published data suggest
      effectiveness of dipyridamole in treating psychosis when added to haloperidol treatment. The
      effectiveness of dipyridamole alone in treating schizophrenia symptoms, although indirectly
      suggested by several lines of evidence, has not been tested.
