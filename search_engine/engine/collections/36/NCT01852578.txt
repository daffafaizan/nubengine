      women in the Western world. The availability of new active regimens in the first line setting
      has prompted several investigators to consider second line therapy for patients with advanced
      NSCLC, since a substantial percentage of patients maintain a good PS upon recurrence. On the
      basis of the results of phase III trials docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed are
      considered as "standard" choices for second-line therapy.

      However, despite the increased availability of different drugs, NSCLC remains a devastating
      disease with median OS which rarely exceeds 12 months.

      Preclinical data of cabazitaxel have demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to
      paclitaxel and docetaxel. In cell lines resistant to cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel induced
      further tumor regression.

      The recommended phase 2 doses for Cabazitaxle were 20 and 25 mg/m2. Cabazitaxel showed
      antitumor activity in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer.
