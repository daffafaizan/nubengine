      evolves the movement of the ribs and fascia, the diaphragmatic function, the respiratory
      muscles and the mechanical properties of the airways that includes a coordinated reflex
      neural activity. The phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) is responsable for the motor and sensory
      innervation of the diaphragm.

      The High Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) vertebral manipulation stimulates the corresponding
      spinal nerves. It is well known that when this manipulation is applied to cervical region
      induces vasomotor cutaneous and cardiorespiratory modifications in autonomic nervous system.

      The sample composed of healthy young adults (aged 18-40 years) will be assigned randomly in
      three groups: experimental group (bilateral C3/C4 HVLA manipulation), sham manipulation group
      (passive cervical mobilization) and control group (no intervention). The thoracoabdominal
      kinematics measures will be assessed at baseline, right after the intervention and five
      minutes after the second measure using the Qualisys Motion Capture System.
