      North American retrospective studies, suggest that surgeons and centers have not established
      a standard of care for the preoperative preparation of the bowel prior to colorectal surgery.
      Specifically, some centers are employing no preparation, others are administering a
      mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics and still others are using oral
      antibiotics alone. Recently, the Canadian Society of Colorectal Surgeons was unable to come
      to a consensus when attempting to update their preoperative guidelines because of the lack of
      agreement on best practice (personal communication). This is an important yet controversial
      topic in colorectal surgery and a clinical trial comparing two standard of care therapies
      will impact current practice in Canada. The REaCT-NSQIP study compares post-operative
      surgical infectious complications, length of stay, incidence of C. difficile rates, patient
      quality of life and cost-effectiveness in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery
      with either no preparation or oral antibiotics. Data will be collected from the National
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and from patient quality of life questionnaires
      preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively

      In this study, it is hypothesized that it is the oral antibiotics, and not the MBP, that is
      responsible for the reduction in postoperative infectious surgical complications (deep or
      superficial surgical site infection (SSI)) in patients undergoing elective colorectal
      resections. This improvement in postoperative infectious complications is not anticipated to
      result in a clinically significant increase in postoperative C. difficile infections or
      antibiotic resistant hospital-acquired infections.
