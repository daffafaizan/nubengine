      whether the birth control pill affects how the body handles insulin and sugar, or whether the
      pill changes heart disease risk. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether certain
      factors, such as how the body processes hormones, and demographic factors (e.g. body weight
      and race), influence how the pill affects the handling of insulin and sugar, and heart
      health.
