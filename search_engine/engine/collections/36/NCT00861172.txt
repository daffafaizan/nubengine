        -  study weakly development of the active MS plaque with multimodal MRI parameters using
           advanced MRI techniques: Veinography/3D FLAIR, Diffusion (CDA), Perfusion (CBV, CBF,
           MTT) MR Spectroscopy (NAA, myo-inositol, choline, lactateâ€¦) and enhanced 3DT1 sequences.

        -  define prognostic markers of MS aggressiveness ("black holes")

        -  Study development of MS plaque around venous structures.
