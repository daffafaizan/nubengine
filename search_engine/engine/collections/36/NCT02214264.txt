      practice, gratitude exercise) and will practice using this technique for 10-15 minutes.
      Following this, all participants will undergo the Cold Pressor Task (CPT) for up to 3
      minutes.

      Before and after these tasks, participant data related to attention, working memory, self
      regulation, affect, and prosociality will be collected.
