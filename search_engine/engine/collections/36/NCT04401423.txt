      multiorgan failure. Research shows that COVID-19 reduces levels of angiotensin-converting
      enzyme-2 (ACE-2), an enzyme that converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 (known as
      TXA127). COVID-19 reduces levels of ACE-2 and therefore angiotensin 1-7 and as a result,
      angiotensin II levels are going to be increased. Many clinical observations in COVID-19 have
      shown the high incidence of acute kidney injury that may be due to excessive levels of
      angiotensin II. The investigators hypothesize that administration of angiotensin (1-7)
      replaces levels of ACE-2 in COVID-19 and thereby ameliorates deterioration of multi-organ
      failure and specifically acute kidney injury.
