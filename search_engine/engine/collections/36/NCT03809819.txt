      included. A control group of 13 age-matched, childless, sexually active women were examined
      during the same period. All patients underwent the basic evaluation of anatomical outcomes.
      Sexual outcomes were established by polish validated FSFI questionnaire. Continence status
      was assessed by polish validated UDI-6 and IIQ-7 questionnaires. The UDI-6 is subdivided in
      three domains: stress incontinence, irritative and obstructive discomfort. The IIQ-7 measures
      the implications of urinary incontinence for normal daily functioning.
