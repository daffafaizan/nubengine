      modulators during week 2 and week 3 or 4. The participants will also receive 2-week course of
      MET and 4-week course of MBRP. Participants will meet with staff twice weekly, except for
      week 2 and potentially week 3 or 4 during which participants will present to the clinic three
      times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, MBRP sessions, psychiatric monitoring,
      assessments, and study procedures (e.g., medication administration).
