    
      This is a prospective open cohort study.

      The study will comprise the following periods:

      Screening

      â€¢ Complete screening checklist and informed consent form

      Procedures.

        -  Following the screening visit, subjects are required to return to undergo the following:

             -  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to assess glucose tolerance and beta cell
                function

             -  Frequently-Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance test (FSIVGTT) to assess acute
                insulin response to glucose

             -  Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EHC) to obtain the insulin sensitivity index and
                assess insulin action

        -  The Disposition index (DI) that quantifies the relationship between insulin sensitivity
           and insulin secretion, will be determined through the results obtained during FSIVGTT
           and EHC to determine subject's risk for Type 2 diabetes.

        -  OGTT will be repeated every 6 months to assess for conversion to Type 2 Diabetes. Plasma
           C-peptide, and glucose will be measured at 7 time points during the OGTT for minimal
           model assessment of beta cell function

        -  FSIVGTT and EHC will be repeated within 3 months of conversion to Type 2 Diabetes, or at
           3 years from recruitment, whichever comes sooner.

      Normoglycemic Subjects: 800 Pre-Diabetic Subjects: 1500
