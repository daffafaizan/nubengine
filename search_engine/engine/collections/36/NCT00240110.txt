      disorders than any other major severe psychiatric syndrome. This comorbidity represents a
      major treatment challenge and is associated with severe disability, morbidity, and heightened
      risk for suicide.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. Examine the efficacy of valproate plus treatment as usual compared to placebo plus
           treatment as usual in decreasing cocaine use in patients with cocaine dependence and
           comorbid bipolar disorder.

        2. Determine whether primary vs. secondary cocaine dependence, bipolar subtype (depressed
           vs. manic/mixed) and the presence of additional substance use disorders moderate the
           association between treatment and cocaine use outcome.

        3. Assess the effects of medication compliance and mood symptoms as mediators of cocaine
           use outcome.
