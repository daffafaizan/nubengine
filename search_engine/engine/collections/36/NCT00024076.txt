        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of radiofrequency ablation in patients with refractory
           or advanced pulmonary malignancies.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment, in terms of local control, in these patients.

        -  Determine whether CT scan is a reasonable imaging assessment tool for treatment delivery
           and follow-up in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the
      tumor over 2 hours.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
