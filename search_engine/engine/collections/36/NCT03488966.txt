      that can lead to weight gain after bariatric surgery. Participants will receive MB-EAT 6
      months or more following bariatric surgery. They will be randomly assigned to receive MB-EAT
      right away or 8 weeks later. Individuals in the group starting in 8 weeks will serve as a
      waitlist control group.The primary outcome measures will be changes in self-reported eating
      problems, depression, anxiety, and mindfulness. There will be a follow-up at 6 months and 12
      months to establish stability of symptoms post-intervention. Participants will receive one
      introductory information session about the MB-EAT program, as well as 8 MB-EAT scheduled
      consecutively over eight weeks. Each session is approximately two hours in length. During
      MB-EAT, participants will practice mindfulness to help improve their decision making
      abilities about when and how much to eat. Through MB-EAT, participants will learn to address
      mindless or out-of-control eating, which can lead to weight gain. Homework will include daily
      meditations and mindful eating exercises.
