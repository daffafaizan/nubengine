    
      Study OBT076-001 is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of
      OBT076, a CD205-directed ADC, in CD205+ve, and HER2-ve metastatic breast cancer and recurrent
      and/or metastatic CD205+ve solid tumors. Part A, the dose escalation phase of the study, will
      explore escalating IV doses to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OBT076.
      Approximately 20 subjects will be included in Part A of the study. Part B, the expansion
      phase of the study, will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of OBT076
      administered at or below the MTD in expansion cohorts. Approximately 50 subjects will be
      enrolled in Part B. Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and
      Follow-up.
