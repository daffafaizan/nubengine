      and challenging behavior. However, it is very difficult to titrate the dose of propofol for
      maintaining the adequate sedation depth because of the difficulty of verbal communication
      with them. Most of them have a epilepsy and take antiepileptic drugs. Antiepileptic drugs are
      thought to influence on the effect of anesthetics. Valproate is reported to inhibit the
      metabolism of propofol. Therefore, we divide the patients into two groups : patients
      receiving valproate (valproate group), patients receiving no antiepileptic drugs (control
      group), and compare the required dose of propofol and the recovery time.
