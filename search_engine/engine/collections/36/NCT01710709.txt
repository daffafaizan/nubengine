      31-08-250 and new subjects. The treatment history of subjects prior to enrollment in the
      open-label study will vary according to the design of the pivotal double-blind study (i.e
      31-08-250).

      This open-label study will be comprised of phases similar to the pivotal double-blind study
      (i.e. Study 250): a screening phase (if applicable), a conversion phase (Phase A, if
      applicable), an oral stabilization phase (Phase B, if applicable), and an IM depot open-label
      maintenance phase (Phase C). Phase C will be a minimum of 28 weeks up to a 52-week treatment
      period with a 4 week follow up period.

      During Phase C (the open-label maintenance phase) rescue medication will be allowed for
      subjects who do not meet stability criteria. This analysis focuses on Phase C due to
      ClinicalTrials.gov system limitations.
