      participate in the PET acquisition phase of the study. Drop-outs or unevaluable subjects will
      be replaced for a target sample size of 20 completed and evaluable subjects.

      During the screening period, a 3D T1-weighted MRI must be acquired and reviewed for exclusion
      criteria and acquisition quality.

      On the day of radioligand administration (Day 1), subjects will come to the study center for
      an ambulatory visit (Visit 1). After re-confirming eligibility, all subjects will receive an
      injection with [11C]-UCB-J followed by a PET scan.

      Using an arterial line and manual sampling, blood samples will be collected up to 90 minutes
      after radioligand injection in order to quantify radioactivity concentration in whole blood
      and plasma as well as parent fraction over time.

      Subjects will return to the clinic for one more ambulatory visit on Day 28 Â± 3 (Visit 2). The
      same procedures will be performed as on Day 1.

      PET scanning duration will be initially set to 90 minutes. After a minimum of 4 subjects have
      completed baseline and Day 28 scans, 90 minute and 60 minute scan data will be analyzed.
      Based on this analysis, and at the discretion of the investigator, it will be decided whether
      the remaining subjects will require 60 or 90 minute scans.

      Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.
