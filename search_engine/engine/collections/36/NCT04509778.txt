      present, due to the lack of effective techniques and standards for early risk identification,
      the intervention opportunity for prevention and optimal efficacy is often missed.

      In previous cohort studies , it has been found that this clinical high-risk(CHR) population
      can be effectively identified before its onset. Since 2011, the project team has been relying
      on the ShangHai At Risk for Psychosis Program, 300 CHRs were enrolled in the clinic through
      screening and diagnostic interview. The baseline clinical and event-related EEG indicators of
      this cohort were collected. The cohort was followed up for 2 years, with a follow-up
      completion rate of nearly 90%, it was found that the clinical outcome of high-risk groups was
      nearly one third, and the proportion of patients would be converted to schizophrenia within 2
      years. This conversion rate is very consistent with the results of cohort studies of other
      large high-risk groups in the world. In view of this conversion ratio, many countries, such
      as the United States, have begun to use the baseline information to build prediction models,
      so as to form a psychiatric prediction tool.

      After 5 years of accumulation, the project team has sufficient data to build a psychosis risk
      prediction model suitable for Chinese people, truly realize the goal of early diagnosis and
      treatment, and further support with the integration of key identification technologies and
      big data calculation.
