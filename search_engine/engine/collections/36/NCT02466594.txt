      following the operation. Tissue temperature is assessed by a temperature measurement probe
      that is placed 8 mm underneath the skin. The microcirculation parameters of free perforator
      flaps are assessed using combined laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectroscopy (O2C®).
      This allows non-invasive measurement of blood flow, capillary venous oxygen saturation and
      relative postcapillary filling pressure using a fiber optic probe that is placed on the flap
      surface. Controlled Thermoregulation (between 10 and 38°C) is enabled using a water
      circulation based system (Hilotherm Clinic®).
