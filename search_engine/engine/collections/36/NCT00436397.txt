        -  Determine the ability of the Radionics Body System™ to immobilize and re-localize
           patients receiving radiotherapy to extra-cranial sites of cancer.

        -  Determine the accuracy of radiation dose calculations for extra-cranial sites of cancer
           when using the XPLAN™-intensity modulated radiation therapy (XPLAN™/IMRT) integrated
           software in this system.

      OUTLINE: Patients receiving radiotherapy have a Body Localizer cast constructed and undergo a
      CT scan while immobilized in the Body Localizer. Patients undergo another CT scan in the
      treatment position using the standard alpha cradle. The XPLAN™-intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (XPLAN™/IMRT)-generated treatment plan is compared to the standard treatment plan to
      verify that the calculated dose is within 2-3 percent of the planned dose using standard
      technique. Patients undergo sets of CT scans 3 additional times over the next few weeks for a
      total of 8 CT scans Patients may undergo additional CT scans before and after radiotherapy
      treatments for a maximum of 5 CT scans per week performed over the course of radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
