      system. It is responsible for regulating a wide variety of physiological processes and higher
      CNS functions. 5-HT neurons project diffusely throughout the brain, innervating the cerebral
      cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain, brainstem and cerebellum, and play a prominent role
      in regulating physiological and behavioral responses such as arousal, thermoregulation,
      anxiety, and affect.

      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, and a baseline physical and neurological evaluation.
      healthy subjects will undergo a baseline 123-I MZINT injection and SPECT imaging described
      below. At baseline, healthy subjects will be started on either no treatment (n=4), or one of
      three different doses of sertraline (25 mg/day n=2, 50 mg/day n=2 or 150 mg/day n=2), which
      will be administered over a 14 day period. Fourteen days following imaging session 1, all
      subjects (treated with sertraline and untreated) will undergo a second 123-I MZINT and SPECT
      imaging study. Data from the baseline and follow-up SPECT images will be compared to evaluate
      for any effect of sertraline on regional brain uptake of 123-I MZINT. The subjects that are
      randomized to no treatment will serve as controls and provide preliminary test-retest
      reproducibility data on the imaging outcome measure.

      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of sertraline administration on the
      specific [123-I] mZINT. In vitro and in vivo data from early human studies and baboon studies
      strongly support further evaluation of [123I] mZINT in healthy subjects.
