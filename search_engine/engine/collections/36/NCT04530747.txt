      improvement of insulin sensitivity, and does not reduce CV events and mortality, even in
      patients with established CV disease. Hence, eliminating IH alone with standard PAP therapy
      may not be sufficient to restore metabolism. Additional adjunct strategies (such as
      metformin) known to improve metabolism may be required to reduce metabolic burden and CV risk
      in OSA patients. The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal changes in metabolism
      of OSA patients receiving both PAP and metformin treatment.

      The MET-OSA study will last about 4 months. After screening the participants to determine
      eligibility, baseline study measures will be obtained and the participants will be provided
      with standard PAP for OSA treatment. Participants will also be randomized to receive either
      placebo or metformin treatment for 3 months. Compliance to study drug will be determined
      during monthly follow-up visits. Final study visit will include assessment of all baseline
      study measures.
