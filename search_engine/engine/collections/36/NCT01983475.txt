    
      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a potent anti-resorptive
      agent, denosumab [receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) antibody; Amgen
      Inc.] to preserve bone mass at the hip and knee and trabecular connectivity at the knee after
      acute SCI. Setting: patient enrollment, study drug administration and DXA scanning will be
      completed at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR) and pQCT measurements will be
      performed at Columbia University. A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      group trial.

      Twenty-four subjects with acute, motor complete SCI (≤12 weeks) who have been admitted to the
      Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR) will be recruited for participation. The age of
      study participation will be males between the ages of 18 and 65 years old and females between
      the ages of 18 and 50 years old. Primary outcome measure will be BMD as measured by DXA and
      microarchitecture as measured by pQCT at the hip and knee.
