      southwest of the capital Sana'a, and takes about (113)kilometers from it. The study aimed to
      highlight the key role of the community based interventions in reducing child morbidity and
      mortality in rural Yemen.A community - randomized controlled field trail was implemented to
      evaluate the role of public health promotion on reducing child diarrhea, acute respiratory
      infection, nutrition, immunization in children under age of five at enrollment over a six
      month of study period. Due to the nature of the study, blinding is not possible so some
      measures would be done to reduce the non-blinding bias like, to keep the study staff blinded
      as much as possible, the observers and survey staff were not informed about the study design.
      The sample size required to measure the primary and secondary outcomes before and after the
      intervention in both groups was estimated using STATA 14.0.Based on data of a previous meta
      analysis, estimates of required sample size assumed a 20% reduction in the proportion of
      diarrhea. Intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was set low at 0.04 and the cluster
      sizes (number of subjects in a cluster, m) were expected to be 18. The sample size was
      multiplied by a design effect of 1.68, calculated using DE=1+ICC (m-1), to accommodate the
      clustering effect. The sample was further adjusted for a potential 20% loss to follow-up over
      one year, thus requiring a sample of 180 per group. Therefore, the present study estimated
      that a total of 20 clusters inhabited by 358 households with child aged 6 to 59 months would
      have 80% power to detect the 20% reduction in the proportion in diarrhea at 5% level of
      significance.
