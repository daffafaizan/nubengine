      with volar locking plates and cast immobilization in patient above 65 years with unstable
      distal radius fractures AO/OTA type A and C . Eligible patients that meets the radiological
      criteria (see inclusion criteria) will be randomized to cast immobilization or operation with
      volar locking plate.

      The investigators are planning a non-inferiority design.

      The current study will test the following null hypothesis:

      In patients over 65 years of age with unstable distal radius fractures AO/OTA type A and
      C,volar locking plates are superior to cast immobilization by more than 8 points, as
      evaluated by quick-DASH at 12 months follow-up.

      The investigators will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing QALYs
      (Quality-adjusted life years) and costs with the two interventions the first year of
      follow-up.
