      pregnancy. With the development of social economy and the improvement of life, the incidence
      of GDM increases to a level of 18-20% year by year. High blood glucose has a strong
      relationship with many adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but also influences their
      metabolism including the increase of susceptibility of maternal type 2 diabetes and risk of
      fetal type 2 diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease, etc. And therefore, it is significant
      to screening and managing maternal blood glucose to prevent maternal and fetal adverse
      outcomes and metabolic disorder.

      This multi-central prospective cohort study is supposed to study the pregnant women whose
      fasting blood glucose is slightly increased (between 5.1 mmol/L and 7.0 mmol/L) at the first
      gestational trimester. The aim of this study is to answer the scientific questions bellow:
      whether interventions to whom the blood glucose is slightly increased can

        1. decrease the incidence of GDM at the second gestational trimester;

        2. improve gestational outcomes;

        3. decrease the incidence of temporal and distant metabolic disorder of mother and her
           child.

      The result will provide scientific evidence for improving the gestational outcomes of GDM
      women and preventing metabolic disorder of their child during adolescence and adult period.
