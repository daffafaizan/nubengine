      multidimensional assessment protocol to objectively demonstrate the severity of olfactory
      dysfunction in patients diagnosed with SARS CoV-2. The University of Pennsylvania Smell
      Identification Test (UPSIT) will be used to assess olfactory function in newly diagnosed
      patients and also existing patients longitudinally over a 12-month period. This is to
      document onset (where possible) and rate of progress of olfactory dysfunction.

      In relevant cases, the investigators will correlate their findings with severity of the Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) arising as a result of the infection - characterised as
      mild, moderate and severe according to the Berlin classification. The investigators will
      therefore determine if the degree of olfactory dysfunction correlates in any manner to the
      severity of ARDS developed in a positive SARS CoV-2 patient and if it offers any
      prognosticative applications.

      The investigators will also examine the impact of the symptom of olfactory dysfunction on
      patient Quality of Life using two validated tools known as the Questionnaire of Olfactory
      Disorders for English speakers (eQOD) and the SNOT-22 questionnaire.

      Furthermore, outcomes will be explored and stratified in terms of age, gender and ethnicity
