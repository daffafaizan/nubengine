      lung cancer, or head and neck cancer, or other solid tumor who receive treatment. Blood and
      urine will also be collected from subjects without cancer to assess non cancer profiles. To
      conduct this study, a total of 30 study-eligible subjects of all races and ethnicities, aged
      18 years or older with a diagnosis of cancer of the lung or head and neck cancer or other
      solid tumor malignancy (Cohort A), will be enrolled and have their tumor collected once for
      molecular profiling and xenograft development and blood collected at prespecified time
      intervals until completion of treatment for liquid biopsy analysis (targeted sequencing,
      whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing). A total of 140 study-eligible subjects of
      all races and ethnicities ages 18 years or older will be enrolled in the non-lung cancer
      control subgroups for chronic inflammatory disorder (Cohort B), people at risk to develop
      lung cancer (Cohort C) and healthy people who complete vigorous exercise (Cohort D). A total
      of 180 subjects will be enrolled into the resection and radiation therapy cancer cohorts
      (Cohorts E and F).
