      Africa. According to a survey from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there
      were an estimated 129,079 new cases and 72,987 related deaths in 2018. Radiotherapy is the
      primary treatment option. Due to advances in disease management, diagnostic imaging,
      radiotherapy technology, and the broader application of systemic therapy, the prognosis of
      NPC has improved signifificantly.Nevertheless, localregional recurrence will occur in about
      10% patients. Because of radiation resistance, the prognosis of re-irradiation is poor for
      recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve survival and reduce
      treatment-related toxicity in recurrent NPC patients. Emerging evidence shows that PD-1
      antibody is effective for treating recurrent/metastastic NPC patients. This is a phase 3,
      multicentre, randomised controlled trial to study the effectiveness and toxicity of
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant PD-1 antibody Toripalimab combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (CCRT) versus CCRT alone in treating patients with locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.
