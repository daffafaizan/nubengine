      and function of total knee arthroplasty in women. The purpose of this prospective, randomized
      study was to compare functional outcome, radiographic results, range of motion, patients
      satisfaction, and fit of the femoral component in patients receiving either a standard
      posterior cruciate-retaining high-flexion (CR-flex) and gender-specific CR-flex total knee
      prostheses.
