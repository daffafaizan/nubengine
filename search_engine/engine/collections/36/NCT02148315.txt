      curriculum or to serve on the wait list control group that received gardens and curriculum at
      the end of the 2-year study. Baseline data were collected in Fall 2011. Garden interventions
      began in Spring 2012. Follow-up data were collected at 6, 12, 18 months following baseline
      data collection.
