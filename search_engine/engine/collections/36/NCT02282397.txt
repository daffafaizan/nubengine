    
      The study design includes two cohorts that will be treated separately. Phase 1 will include
      two diabetes cohorts (Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Type 2 diabetes mellitus) who will be
      randomized independently into two groups, Group 1-CGM and Group 2-SMBG.

      The Group-1 CGM cohort who have Type 1 diabetes mellitus will be eligible for Phase 2. Phase
      2 will include a separate independent randomization of either MDI therapy (Group 1a- CGM/MDI)
      or CSII therapy (Group 1b-CGM/CSII).

      Additional assessments will be made to evaluate the incremental benefits of changing the
      insulin delivery method from MDI to CSII in patients already using CGM.

      Cost effectiveness and quality of life will be measured between the two groups in each phase.
