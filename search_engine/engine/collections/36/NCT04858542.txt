      difficulty with voice and communication. Healthcare workers reported significant increases in
      vocal effort and dyspnea while wearing masks, and showed greater effort and poorer vocal
      quality at the end of the workday compared to the beginning of the day. Despite these
      negative changes, very few healthcare workers reported using any type of communication
      strategy (e.g., taking breaks, using gestures). Therefore, the investigators developed
      educational modules to address the voice and communication problems facing this population.
      This clinical trial plans to evaluate how these educational modules impact
      subjective/objective voice and communication measures in mask-wearing healthcare workers.
