      subjective manifestations both before and after the attack, a chronic type of headache with
      symptoms of recurrence, attacks at productive age and can cause a decrease in work
      productivity up to 80%, so that it will affect the quality of life, economic life and
      education globally which leads to losses for migraine sufferers and institutions where
      migraine sufferers attend school, work and in the lives of sufferers' families. With the high
      prevalence and disability rates for migraine sufferers, on the other hand, the right
      treatment for migraine has not yet been obtained to the maximum, it is necessary to deepen
      the treatment and prevention of migraine is needed, and until now there has been no
      definitive cure, both for prevention and treatment, so it is necessary to develop therapies
      that can provide more accurate relief for migraine sufferers. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the success in managing migraine in reducing the frequency of attacks, reducing the
      intensity of attacks and reducing the duration of attacks from weeks 0, 4 to 8
