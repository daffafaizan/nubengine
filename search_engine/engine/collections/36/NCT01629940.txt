      for use in testing a computer algorithm that recognizes males at high risk for XLHED. While
      3D facial profiling has been reported in HED, the technology does not meet the ease-of-use
      criteria for a universal screening tool. FDNA (www.fdna.com), a software company with
      expertise in the area of facial recognition, is collaborating with the Sponsor in algorithm
      development based on 2D photographs not requiring special photographic technologies. All
      males at risk for a diagnosis of XLHED and attending the 2012 NFED Family Conference will be
      eligible to participate. A short medical questionnaire will verify the clinical presentation,
      they will be requested to provide a baby photograph taken at up to 1 month of age (to be
      returned at study completion), and a frontal facial photograph will be taken at the time of
      study conduct. The anonymized photographs will be transmitted to FDNA for analysis. A limited
      number of unaffected controls will be recruited at the 2012 NFED Family Conference for the
      photography study, in addition to the control data already available in the FDNA database.

      As a second exploratory objective, a subset of affected males between ages 5 and 25 years
      will have the option of having a blood draw for a set of laboratory studies assessing
      nutritional status. HED-affected patients in general (including XLHED) are reported to have
      evidence of growth restriction (weight for height) in this age range without clear
      mechanistic evidence. A screening panel of nutritional laboratory tests has been designed in
      collaboration with experts in the field at the University of California, San Francisco
      (UCSF). Anonymized samples will be analyzed at UCSF.
