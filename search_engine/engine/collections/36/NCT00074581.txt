      dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection through sustained reduction
      in HIV viral replication. However, such therapy does not cure HIV infection or prevent the
      spread of the virus. ART may, however, make HIV infected people less contagious by lowering
      plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, compared with people not on ART. This study seeks to determine
      whether initiating ART in ART-naive, HIV infected people can prevent the sexual transmission
      of HIV among HIV-discordant couples, as well as to demonstrate whether quality of life
      changes with the initiation of ART. Both opposite and same sex couples will be recruited at
      study sites in Brazil, India, Malawi, Thailand, the United States, and Zimbabwe for this
      study.

      Participating couples will be enrolled for approximately 78 months (6.5 years). Couples will
      be randomly assigned to one of two arms. HIV infected partners in Arm 1 will begin ART in
      addition to receiving HIV primary care. HIV infected partners in Arm 2 will receive HIV
      primary care. When the CD4 count in these participants reaches 200 to 250 cells/mm3, drops
      below 200 cells/mm3, or develops an AIDS-defining illness, they will initiate ART. All
      couples will receive HIV counseling and have their urine and blood collected at screening and
      enrollment, and at selected monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. They will be asked to
      periodically report information about their adherence to the ART regimen.

      Note: Per LoA#5, on the Data and Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommendation, as of May
      10, 2011, all HIV-infected participants in Arm 2 who have not already initiated ART will be
      offered ART as soon as possible.
