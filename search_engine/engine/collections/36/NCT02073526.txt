      Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF) plays an important role. Anti-TNF agents are used in the
      treatment. However, some patients do not respond and response rates declines over time. The
      cause may be immunogenicity against the agent itself, the agent´s failure to neutralize TNF
      or another biological pathway leading to inflammation. Anti-TNF agents have been
      administrated as fixed doses at certain frequencies and this may not be optimal for all
      patients, but recent studies have indicated a correlation between efficacy and serum drug
      concentration levels (trough levels). Our preliminary data suggest that trough levels early
      in the treatment course may be predictive of later trough levels. By multiple measurements,
      this will be assessed. The study will also investigate biological markers in serum and blood
      cells which may be predictable for trough levels. Finally, we will compare different methods
      to measure serum drug concentrations.
