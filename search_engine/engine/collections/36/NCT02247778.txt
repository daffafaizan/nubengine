      to 8 centimeters in the literature. It is hypothesized, that depending on the invasiveness of
      this incision secondary problems like prolonged fracture healing, paresthesia of
      supraclavicular nerves and pain due to scar tissue increase. Therefore we developed a
      mini-incision technique using an average incision length of 4cm.

      The aim of this study is to analyzed whether secondary problems following plate
      osteosynthesis of the clavicle correlate mit the length of the surgical access. Therefore a
      prospective observational protocol was chosen.
