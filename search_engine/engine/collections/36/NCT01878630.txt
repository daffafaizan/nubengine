      All participants will continue to receive usual care from their general practitioner and
      specialist. All patients will be examined at the beginning of the study and will undergo a
      check-up every 3 months. 750 of the patients will be randomly allocated to receive devices
      for Remote Patient Management (RPM) which will measure various parameters on a daily basis
      (e.g. weight, blood pressure, heart rate). The devices are mobile and can be used at home or
      elsewhere.
