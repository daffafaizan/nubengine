    
      This is a randomized, triple-blinded (therapist, assessor and patient), placebo-controlled
      trial, with voluntary patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.

      Eighteen patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: Placebo or PBMT and one
      single session of treatment will be provided.

      The data will be collected by a blinded assessor and the outcomes of interest it will be
      levels of inflammatory markers and pain intensity and it will be collected at baseline and 15
      minutes after the single session of treatment.

      The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles. The findings will be
      tested for their normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Parametric data will be expressed as
      mean and standard deviation and non-parametric data as median and respective upper and lower
      limits. Parametric data will be analyzed by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
      (ANOVA; time versus experimental group) with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Non-parametric
      data will be analyzed using the Friedman test and, secondarily, the Wilcoxon signed-rank
      test.
