    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial. Participants for this study will be recruited
      from the Gynecological department of the University Hospitals of Geneva, scheduled for
      gynecological procedures in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. A total of 40
      patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups: Group SB (spontaneously
      breathing without PSV) and Group PSV (spontaneously breathing with PSV). Measurements of
      end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and ventilation inhomogeneity will be performed in all
      patients with a nitrogen multiple breath washout method, before and 1 hour after surgery.
      Similarly, airway resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) will be measured at the same time by
      using the Forced Oscillation Technique.

      The primary endpoint: Perioperative changes in ventilation inhomogeneity (LCI) and
      respiratory mechanics (Rrs and Xrs) of patients, positioned in lithotomy and undergoing
      general anesthesia while breathing spontaneously through LMA with or without PSV.

      The secondary endpoints: Presence of respiratory complications, oxygen need in the recovery
      room, length of stay in the recovery room and in the hospital. Correlation between duration
      of positioning and surgery with lung function and volume measurements.

      Relevance: There are no studies that addressed the value of pressure support ventilation to
      overcome the potential changes in lung function following spontaneous ventilation across a
      LMA in the lithotomy position.
