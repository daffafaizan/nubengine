      colon. Patients commonly experience abdominal pain, diarrheaï¼Œmalnutrition and malaise which
      result in decreased quality of life and an increased risk of chronic disability and
      unemployment.

      Tripterygium Glycosides(T2) is a chloroform/methanol extract Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F
      (TWHF), the traditional Chinese medicine, used in rheumatoid arthritis and nephritis. It has
      both immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Our previous animal studies have
      revealed that the major component of T2, triptolide, could prevent the development of chronic
      colitis in interleukin-10 deficient mice. The phase I clinical trial in our institute also
      demonstrated that T2 is efficient for induction of remission in patients with mild to
      moderate active crohn's disease. The common adverse effects of T2 are leucopenia, liver renal
      toxicity, oligospermia and amenorrhea.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect and safety of Tripterygium Glycosides in
      the treatment of Crohn's disease for induction remission and compare the therapeutic effect
      with patients who only received mesalazine.
