      cervical dilators could shorten the duration of labor but can generate more pain. The
      investigators will compare two procedures of induction of labor for second trimester
      termination of pregnancy: one with the use of oral prostaglandins (misoprostol) only and one
      with the exact same procedure preceded by cervical ripening with hygroscopic cervical
      dilators. Epidural analgesia will be effective previously to the placement of cervical
      dilators and the first tablet of misoprostol. Efficacy will be determined based on the
      proportion of women achieving vaginal delivery within 12 hours. The beginning of labor will
      be defined as the first administration of misoprostol tablets in both groups.

      The investigators will also evaluate safety by collecting hemorrhage endometritis, cervical
      tear. The investigators will compare psychological impact of these procedures, measured by
      the impact of event scale and acceptability 1 to 4 months later.
