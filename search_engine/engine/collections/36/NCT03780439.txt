      cancer in the Department of Gastroduodenal and Pancreatic Surgery, Hunan Cancer Hospital and
      the treatment group of Professor Kai-xiong Tao in the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical
      College were invited to participate in the study. After surgery, routine blood test were
      measured morning on post-operative day (POD) 1, 3, 5, and 7, and serum level of procalcitonin
      was measured morning on POD 3 and 5.

      The primary outcome of the present study was the accuracy of white blood cell (WBC) and
      neutrophil count, the neutrophil to WBC ratio (N%) and procalcitonin to detect post-operative
      infection (including intra-abdominal infection (IAI), surgical site infections (SSIs),
      pneumonia, urinary tract infection, catheter-related infection, and sepsis not specified)
      within 30 days after surgery. The main secondary outcome was their ability to detect any
      post-operative complications (such as intestinal obstruction, bleeding, ascites,
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events) within 30 days after surgery. Other secondary
      outcomes were the choice of the best timing to measure each inflammatory marker, the choice
      of a clinically meaningful cut-off value for the most accurate marker.
