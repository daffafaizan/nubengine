      need of coronary intervention will be randomly assigned in one of the treatment strategies -
      60 mg of prasugrel or 600 mg clopidogrel just prior to percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI). After PCI all patients will receive clopidogrel 75 mg/d as per standard. The patients
      will be monitored throughout a 30-day time frame and ischemic and bleeding events will be
      recorded. The study is powered to show the superiority of single-dose 60 mg prasugrel over
      single-dose 600 mg clopidogrel regarding the ischemic complications at 30-day follow-up.
