    
      JTX-2011 is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible
      CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase
      1/2, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of the ICOS
      agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 alone and in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab, or
      pembrolizumab in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors. The study will
      include a dose escalation phase for single agent and the combination therapies, followed by
      an expansion phase in specified tumor types for single agent and the combination therapies.
