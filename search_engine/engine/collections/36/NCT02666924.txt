      improved glycemic control in Chinese-Canadian people in the community of Richmond, British
      Columbia. By providing culturally appropriate cooking classes, tailored to Chinese foods,
      culture and population, we will be able to address specific challenges that affect ethnic
      Chinese patients with diabetes living in Canada. This innovative program would serve to meet
      a need that is currently unmet in the community, by providing a hands-on opportunity for
      participants to try different foods, learn various culturally appropriate recipes, prepare
      meals together and learn how the foods being eaten affects blood glucose. These classes would
      also serve as an avenue to reinforce various diabetes self-management activities - including
      self-monitoring of blood glucose and the effects of physical activity. Also, participants may
      benefit from peer support and the sharing of experiences and advice with each other. Through
      this research study, we hope to demonstrate improved diabetes knowledge, self-care management
      and glycemic control for patients who attend the cooking classes.
