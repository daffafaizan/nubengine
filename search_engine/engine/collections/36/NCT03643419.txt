      no effective treatment.

      Near-infrared light has been widely used in clinical medicine because of its bio-stimulating
      effect, convenient use, harmless to the body, easy to be accepted by patients, and convenient
      for clinical promotion. The near-infrared light biostimulation effect can enhance the
      activity of various enzymes, inhibit inflammatory cells, inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and
      promote nerve regeneration. It has been widely confirmed and widely used in the
      rehabilitation of central nervous system and peripheral nerve injury. However, the position
      of the spinal cord is deep, and the depth of illumination used by laser treatment equipment
      is generally difficult to reach.

      The implantable 360Â° scattering fiber the investigators developed was implanted in the
      surgical site together with the drainage tube for irradiation treatment without additional
      patient damage.
