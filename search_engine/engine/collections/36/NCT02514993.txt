      spine fractures and described the combined injury pattern of thoracic spine fracture and
      sternal fracture as "upper thoracic cage injury". But literature research is lacking data
      that in patients with a thoracic cage injury a highly unstable thoracic spine fracture can be
      expected.

      In a large cohort of 130 patients with a thoracic spine fracture and concomitant sternal
      fracture the investigators analyzed the injury pattern and evaluated associated injuries,
      trauma mechanism, and clinical outcome.

      The investigators could prove that in patients with a thoracic cage injury the concomitant
      sternal fracture may be regarded as an indicator for an unstable thoracic spine fracture,
      which requires surgical stabilization. Furthermore the analysis revealed that even a highly
      rotationally unstable type C fracture has to be expected, if sternal and thoracic spine
      fractures are located in the same segment.
