      immunity to CII and have an in vitro response to APL A12 at the screening visit. Patients
      will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms. Each of the 3 treatments will be given for
      16 weeks.

      In keeping with a sequential dose escalation strategy, the originally proposed randomization
      scheme will be modified so that subjects will be randomized to receive either the lowest dose
      (30 mg) or placebo (Block 1), followed by the next dose (50 mg) or placebo (Block 2). We will
      begin with the lowest dose (30 g/day) and enroll 6 to receive 30 g/day APL A12 and 2 to
      receive placebo for 16 weeks. Results will be reported to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
      for a decision to proceed to the next block based on indications of safety. If this dose does
      not cause adverse events or toxicity or worsens RA, we will proceed to enroll patients to
      receive 30 ug, or 50 g/day APL A12 or placebo for 16 weeks. A total of 32 subjects will be
      randomized to obtain 24 subjects who complete the study. Recruitment was difficult. Only 22
      patients were randomized. There were not enough 50mcg patients enrolled so 2 treatment groups
      was analyzed. Arm 1 included 30 and 50 mcg and Arm 2 represents the patients that received
      placebo.
