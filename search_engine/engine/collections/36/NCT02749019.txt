    
      Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor
      family of bombesin receptors, which is over-expressed in various types of cancer cells,
      including prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, lung
      cancer, ovarian cancers, endometrial cancers, renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal stromal
      tumors. BBN(7-14), with the amino acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has
      been extensively used for the development of molecular probes for the imaging of GRPR. On the
      other hand, the RGD moiety binds with integrin αvβ3 receptor, also plays an important role in
      the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis, local invasiveness, and metastatic potential in
      human breast cancer. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide BBN-RGD was
      synthesized from bombesin(7-14) and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with
      68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and
      dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in
      breast cancer patients.
