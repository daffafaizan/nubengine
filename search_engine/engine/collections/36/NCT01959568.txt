      The study takes place in the S.N. Fyodorov "Eye Microsurgery" Federal State Institution
      located in Moscow, Russian Federation.

      Patients are randomized in two groups with stratified block randomization. Strata were
      defined by combination of two binary prognostic factors: duration of retinal detachment (less
      than 3 months and â‰¥ 3 months) and PVR (present/absent).

      Early interim analysis will be performed in order to reveal possible adverse effect of
      long-term PFD tamponade. For interim report success will mean the rate of post-surgical BCVA
      >/= 20.200. Groups sizes for interim analysis will be 35 patients in each group. For interim
      analysis the investigators choose group sizes able to reveal 30% absolute difference in
      functional success rate with one-sided test (to detect possible toxicity of double tamponade
      for the retina) having power of 0.8 and significance level of p=0.05. In the final analysis
      success will mean retinal reattachment.

      For final analysis each group will include 145 participants, so that the investigators are
      able to detect 15% difference in reattachment rate with power of 0.8 and significance level
      of p=0.05. Group sizes were computed with exact Fisher's test function in G*Power 3.1.7
      software (Erdfelder, Faul, & Buchner).

      OCT is performed with Cirrus HD-OCT system (Zeiss Meditec Inc). Microperimetry is performed
      with MP-1 microperimeter (Nidek). All the examinations are assessed by one ophthalmologist.

      The allocation concealment is implemented with the help of a third party, who stores the
      randomization list and prepares envelopes containing directions what method of tamponade to
      employ in each particular patient. Patients are blind to the method of tamponade.
