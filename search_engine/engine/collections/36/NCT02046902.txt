      information that would be helpful in decision making as well as review several possible
      output formats. Several sets of focus groups will be convened, with particular attention to
      recruitment of a diverse population, including women and underserved minority groups.

      Study Procedure: We will gather input to create a clinically useful format for presenting the
      risk estimates for desired outcomes and support clinical decision-making.

      Subjects: We anticipate 2 or 3 patient focus groups of 6-8 individuals and 2 clinician focus
      groups of 3-5 individuals will be scheduled. Fliers will be posted to enlist potential
      patients. If necessary, patients will also be contacted by a Cardiovascular Research
      Coordinator and invited to attend a scheduled focus group. After receiving
      patient/family/caregiver input, selected clinicians from the Saint Lukes Hospital Staff,
      including cardiologists, cardiac nurses and other cardiology staff, will be invited to attend
      a scheduled focus group. The invitation will be sent via email and followed up with a phone
      call, if necessary. If a clinician focus group is unable to be scheduled, then individual
      interviews will be conducted.

      Setting: Patient and Clinician focus group sessions will be held at Saint Luke's Hospital.
