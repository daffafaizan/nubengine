    
      The Amblyopia Treatment Study (ATS) has been designed as a randomized, controlled
      single-masked multi-center clinical trial with the following objectives:

      To determine whether the success rate with atropine treatment of amblyopia due to strabismus
      or anisometropia in patients less than 7 years old is equivalent to the success rate with
      occlusion (patching) therapy.

      To develop more precise estimates of the success rates of amblyopia treatment.

      To identify factors that may be associated with successful treatment of amblyopia.

      To collect data on the clinical course of treated amblyopia to provide more precise estimates
      of treatment kinetics than now available.
