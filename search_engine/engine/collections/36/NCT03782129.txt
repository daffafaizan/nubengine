      induces a dramatic decrease in physical, emotional, and social functioning for patients.
      Oftenly associated with advanced micro and macrovascular complications, high morbidity and a
      greater risk of premature death (mainly by Ischemic Heart Disease) occure.

      Only few studies explored DFU patients' long term survival: the few datas coming from cohorts
      in the 2000's reported mortality rates around 45% at five years after DFU's diagnosis.

      But life expectancy in diabetics patients imporved during last decade. So the main objective
      of our study is to evaluate the diabetics patients' 5 years mortality rate, in whom DFU was
      diagnosed in 2010.

      Moreover, our secondary objective is to identify the mortality's predictive factors in 2010.
