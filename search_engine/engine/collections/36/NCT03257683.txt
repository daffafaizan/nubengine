      myocardium that cannot be revascularized (Non-R). The investigators propose to identify such
      patients via retrospective case review of CMRI data, as well as identify the exact regions
      which specify Non-R coronary anatomy. This selected study group will have a specific
      echocardiographic imaging protocol performed, which includes the known ischemic regions. All
      segments will be collected and analyzed as a pre-therapeutic baseline using specialized STE
      software to derive strain values. Following eight (8) weeks of ranolazine therapy, each
      subject will be re-interrogated with the same echocardiographic imaging protocol and have
      identical measurements of regional strain performed. Ranolazine will be added to the
      patients' usual medical therapy. Each patient will serve as their own control, from baseline
      to post therapeutic state.

      It is the hypothesis of the investigators, that additional therapeutic dosing of ranolazine
      will improve regional and perhaps global myocardial function. Improvement in LV mechanical
      function (regional and global) will be quantitated and objectively elucidated by STE derived
      myocardial strain as described further in this document.
