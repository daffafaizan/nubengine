        -  To learn the effects of selected agents (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) on the
           profile of estrogen metabolites, glutathione conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts in
           urine from women with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected urine samples are analyzed for 40 estrogen metabolites,
      conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with
      tandem mass spectrometric detection.

      Patient information (e.g., race, body mass index, age at menarche, menopausal status, age at
      menopause if applicable, smoking history, alcohol consumption) is collected through medical
      record review.
