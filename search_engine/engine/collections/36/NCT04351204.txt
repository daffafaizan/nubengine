      for MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy. For each proposed technique feasibility has to be
      determined individually. A secondary aim is to prospectively collect data from cohorts of
      patients treated at the MRL and report on acute toxicity.

      By including multiple parallel cohorts, the protocol will accelerate the technical
      development of MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy and the evidence-based introduction of the MRL
      into clinical practice.
