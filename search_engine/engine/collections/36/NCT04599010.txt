      standard feeding approach for 2 weeks. The essential component of the calorie-restricted
      feeding will be a permissive feeding volume restriction to 110 ± 10 mL/kg/day without
      increasing the milk calorie density, whereas the standard feeding approach will include an
      oral feeding volume goal of 150 ± 10 mL/kg/day. Infants will receive either breast milk or
      formula feedings per the standard feeding protocols. The body composition of enrolled infants
      will be assessed by the Pea Pod system at baseline and at the study end Subjects will be
      followed for clinical and growth outcomes until NICU discharge and over the telephone until 6
      months of age.
