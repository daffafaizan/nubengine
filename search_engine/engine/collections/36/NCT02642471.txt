      without pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with negative sentinel lymph node; PHENIX-II: To
      compare the outcomes of managements with and without pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with
      positive sentinel lymph node. Patients with newly diagnosed International Federation of
      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA1 (lymphovascular space involvement), IA2, IB1, and
      IB2 cervical cancer are eligible for our study. The tumor diameter should be less than 3cm.
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed at the beginning of operations. After
      pathological examination of frozen section, patients will be assigned to PHENIX-I or
      PHENIX-II study according to their status of sentinel nodes. In both parts of this trail,
      patients have equal chance to be randomly assigned to experimental arms (radical hysterectomy
      only) and reference arms (radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy).Adjuvant
      treatments will be planned according to postoperative pathological factors. The primary
      objective is disease-free survival at 3 years for PHENIX-I and 2 years for PHENIX-II. The
      secondary end points are overall survival, long-term outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsy
      and the quality of life.
