      the menthol popsicle and usual care in patients in the preoperative period. This is a
      randomized clinical trial, to be performed in a public tertiary hospital. The sample size
      calculation will be performed after the pilot test is conducted. Two groups will be formed
      through randomization. The tested intervention consists of the menthol popsicle (experimental
      group). The thirst intensity (primary outcome) will be measured by means of the Numerical
      Scale and the discomfort of thirst (secondary outcome) through the Perioperative Seat
      Discomfort Scale, in two moments: at the end of the first approach of the patient and 20
      minutes after the intervention. The results of this research may support the decision-making
      of health professionals in the implementation of effective and safe actions to manage the
      seat of the surgical patient in the preoperative period. Another relevant aspect is the
      production of knowledge about the problem, which is scarce both in the national and
      international scenario.
