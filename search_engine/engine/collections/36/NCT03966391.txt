      CARD System to provide a framework for delivering vaccinations at school that integrates
      evidence-based strategies to mitigate pain, fear and fainting and promotes a student-centred
      approach to vaccination. CARD addresses 2 components of the vaccination delivery program: 1)
      pre-vaccination day preparation and 2) vaccination day activities. In a small controlled
      clinical trial in a public health unit in Niagara, Ontario, the investigators demonstrated
      benefits of CARD on student symptoms during vaccination, including fear, and
      dizziness-precursor of fainting, and satisfaction with CARD by all stakeholder groups
      (students, public health staff, school staff and parents). This study will evaluate CARD in a
      large cluster trial in Calgary, Alberta. This trial is the final phase of a 3-phase project,
      whereby the first 2 phases involve developing an implementation plan for the local context
      and evaluating feasibility of implementation.

      Eight community health centres that provide vaccination services to schools in their regions
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to CARD or control (usual practices). Data will be
      collected for vaccination services carried out in grade 6 and grade 9 students in
      participating schools for the academic year 2019-2020.
