      environmental bacteria that can cause chronic, debilitating pulmonary disease, primarily
      affecting those over age 60. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms, stop disease
      progression, and clear the infection. We propose to address a longstanding controversy in the
      therapy of pulmonary MAC disease, whether patients must take three antibiotics concomitantly,
      or if two are sufficient. The study is a multicenter randomized pragmatic clinical trial to
      compare azithromycin + ethambutol (2-drug therapy) vs. azithromycin + ethambutol + rifampin
      (3-drug therapy) for non-cavitary pulmonary MAC disease. All clinical outcomes will be
      considered standard of care and abstracted from clinical records. Therapy changes and adverse
      events will be recorded at routine visits. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
      self-reported toxicity will be captured centrally in a web-based database, and CT scans will
      be read centrally. Co-primary outcomes are culture conversion and tolerability of treatment.
      The primary analysis for culture conversion will be conducted as a per-protocol
      non-inferiority analysis, and the primary analysis for tolerability will be conducted as an
      intention-to-treat superiority analysis.
