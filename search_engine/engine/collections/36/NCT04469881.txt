      spinal anesthesia. In this study, participants will receive usual care, and in addition, will
      be asked to wear VR goggles once they arrive in the operating room. Participants will choose
      from a selection of 10 shows and movies to watch for the duration of the surgery
      (approximately 2 hours).
