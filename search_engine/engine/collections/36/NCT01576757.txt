      States alone. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, or pump failure secondary to previous heart attack, is
      considered by many to be the leading cause of heart failure. Stem cell therapy, or
      regeneration of the lost myocardium, is an intervention that has the potential for reversing
      the detrimental effects of this disease. Recently published evidence has shown preliminary
      results indicating the safety and feasibility of utilizing cardiac stem cells for the
      treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The ability to use a commonly practiced method, such as
      endomyocardial biopsy, to isolate and expand stem cell cultures could, potentially, make this
      therapy widely available. The results of this study will be important for the design of
      future clinical trials.
