      is newly introduced for awake nasal intubation using a transillumination principle. For oral
      and maxillofacial surgery patients with anticipated difficult airways, the BID has a high
      rate of successful awake nasal intubation.Since the BID is more readily accessible,disposable
      and considerably less expensive,these advantages speak well for its use in China.However,to
      date,there is no study on its usage in anesthetized patients.The investigators hypothesized
      that a BID would be effective for nasal intubation in anesthetized patients with high
      Mallampati class and would result in fewer hemodynamic responses. To examine our hypothesis,
      the investigators would like to perform a prospective,randomized,controlled study to compare
      the effectiveness of the BID technique with a direct laryngoscope for nasal intubation in
      anesthetized patients with Mallampati class 3. The primary outcome measures are the
      hemodynamic changes during intubation. The investigators also would like to compare the
      intubation time required and associated airway complications in both groups as our second
      outcome.
