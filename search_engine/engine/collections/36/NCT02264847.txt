      a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. the
      investigators tried to determine the benefits and harms of administering an ovulation trigger
      to anovulatory women receiving treatment with ovulation-inducing agents in comparison with
      spontaneous ovulation following ovulation induction. so we will have comparison between 2
      groups, group 1 will receive clomiphene citrate and trigger ovulation by human chorionic
      gonadotrophin and group 2 will receive clomiphene citrate with no drug to trigger ovulation.
