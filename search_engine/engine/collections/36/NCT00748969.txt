      Transplantation (HCT) and/or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are living into adulthood with
      good cognitive development, their quality of life is significantly impacted by their skeletal
      abnormalities (i.e., kyphosis, scoliosis, and genu valgum), contractures, and severe short
      stature. Here at the University of Minnesota we have seen some promising clinical outcomes in
      children with MPS IH whom we have treated with human growth hormone (hGH). There are
      currently no reports in the literature of the impact of treating children with MPS and short
      stature, with hGH on their growth velocity or characteristic skeletal abnormalities. This
      study will advance the care of these children by providing data in this yet unexplored area
      of pediatric medicine with the goal of improving the quality of life for these children by
      improving height, mobility, and neuropsychological functioning.

      This is a Phase II/III randomized, single-center, 12 month clinical trial of growth hormone
      in male and female participants with MPS I, II, or VI, followed by 12 months open label.
      Participants with height â‰¤ -2 SDS for age and gender will be randomized for the first 12
      months 1:1 to treatment or no treatment. At the conclusion of the 12 months, all subjects
      will be offered an additional 12 months of treatment.
