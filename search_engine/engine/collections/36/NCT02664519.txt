      kidney disease (CKD) which can be very debilitating. Mechanisms underlying exercise
      intolerance in CKD is not completely understood. Previous studies have demonstrated impaired
      skeletal muscle vasodilation during exercise in CKD patients, which may contribute to
      exercise intolerance. Normally, there is blunting of sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction in
      exercising muscle to allow for steady blood supply to exercising muscles. This phenomenon is
      called functional sympatholysis. Functional sympatholysis is impaired by increases in
      reactive oxygen specie and may be impaired in CKD.

      Experiments will be performed on 2 groups of subjects 1) Normal kidney function (eGFR>90) 2)
      Stage 2-3 CKD (eGFR 30-89). VAsoactive medications will be held for 72 hours before study.
      All participants will attend a baseline study visit, which will include a physical
      examination, a medical history review, vital sign measurements, and blood collection. Muscle
      nerve activity and muscle oxygenation will be measured while the subjects perform hand grip
      exercise at 30% maximum voluntary contraction with and without lower body negative pressure
      (- 20 mmHg). Muscle blood flow will be measured before and after hand grip exercises. CKD
      subjects will then be randomized to exercise training (to squeeze a tennis ball repeatedly
      for at least 30 min/day) or no exercise training for 28 days. Procedures in baseline visit
      will be repeated followed by cross over to alternate group for 28 days followed by repeat of
      baseline procedures. Blood flow, muscle oxygenation and muscle nerve activity will be
      compared between CKD and normal subjects as well as before and after exercise training for
      CKD subjects.
