      abdominal wall for laparoscopic surgery.

      Rocuronium intubation dose can be enough for intubation but not last enough for excellent
      laparoscopic conditions. There is little variation in time from anesthesia induction to the
      end of the laparoscopy for cholecystectomy and avoiding excess rocuronium dose can help
      providing excellent conditions and fast track extubation.

      Dixon's up-and-down method will guide this dose-finding study for the ED50.
