      lipid-friendly antiretroviral regimen. Participants will be randomized to receive either
      boosted atazanavir or boosted darunavir given once daily, along with background NRTIs. This
      24-week study will require 4 visits after randomization for evaluation, monitoring, and lab
      studies.
