      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save
      lives, and the huge costs incurred for life-treatment of surviving victims. An
      externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to the
      principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver (the Device) is being developed by Q30 Sports Science,
      LLC (Q30). Preliminary research suggests that the Device has the potential to reduce the
      likelihood of TBI. The currently developed collar (Smith 2009; Smith 2011; Smith 2011; Smith
      2012) has been approved for studies in humans and the results indicate safety for use during
      high demand and maximal exertion activities, Study ID: 2013-2240, Institutional Review Board
      - Federalwide Assurance #00002988). Regarding safety, the externally worn collar is
      meticulously designed to mimic the body's own omohyoid muscle actions upon the jugular veins
      that will provide similar pressure and volume increases not to surpass that of a yawn or the
      mere act of just lying down. This study will investigate the tolerability of this device in
      athletes participating in the competitive sports of football and rugby at the high school,
      collegiate or professional levels.
