    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, masked, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      two different doses of CLS-TA in the treatment of subjects with macular edema following
      non-infectious uveitis. Each subject will receive a single suprachoroidal injection of
      CLS-TA.

      The subjects enrolled in this study will be chosen from subjects with macular edema following
      non-infectious uveitis. A single injection will be administered via the Clearside
      microinjector into the suprachoroidal space. The dose injected will either be 4 mg or 0.8 mg
      of CLS-TA in a total volume of 100 Î¼L. The dose they receive will depend on what their
      randomization code dictates.

      Subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy for approximately 8 weeks following
      treatment.
