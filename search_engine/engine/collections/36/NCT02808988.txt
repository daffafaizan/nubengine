      Endocrinology, School of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University. Bone mineral density (BMD)
      measurements were performed by dual energy-X-ray absorptiometry from L1-L4 site of lumbar
      vertebra and/or femur (g/cm2). Osteoporosis was defined as T scores less than -2.5 at L1-L4,
      femur neck or total femur. Women with T scores less than -2.5 (groups A and C) were started
      on bisphosphonate treatment after their initial periodontal examination.
