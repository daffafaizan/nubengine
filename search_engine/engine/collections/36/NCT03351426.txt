      into either Group 1) Active tDCS or Group 2) Sham (control) tDCS. The duration of the study
      will be 4 weeks. During the first two weeks participants will receive eight sessions of tDCS.
      At week 2 they will also start a hypocaloric diet. The stimulation sessions (duration: 20
      minutes, intensity: 2 mA) will be applied once daily (5 days in a row) during the first week
      and 3 alternate days (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) during the second week. At week 2 and
      until the end of the study subjects will also start a hypocaloric diet.

      The study aims are:

        1. To examine whether anodal tDCS applied over the left prefrontal cortex can improve
           executive functions/inhibitory control and reduce subjective ratings of food craving and
           appetite.

        2. To study whether anodal tDCS applied over the left prefrontal cortex, in combination
           with a hypocaloric diet, can facilitate weight reduction and maintenance over time.
