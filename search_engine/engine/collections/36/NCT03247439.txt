      a performance target defined by subtracting a non-inferiority margin of 0.05 from an expected

      for CMC.

      A total of 74 subjects will be enrolled into the pivotal study.

      Follow up visits will occur at the following time points after the surgical procedure: 2
      week, 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 4 year and 5 year.
