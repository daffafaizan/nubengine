    
      Women will be informed of the opportunity to participate in a study in which they will be
      required to use a home pregnancy test to test a urine sample provided to them. Interested
      applicants will be invited to join the study.

      Volunteers will be advised that the product they will be testing is under investigation and
      that the volunteer will not be testing their own urine and therefore volunteers will not
      learn their own pregnancy status.

      Volunteers will be required to consent to the study prior to participation. Each volunteer
      will test only one device, they will be provided with one investigational device and one
      urine sample. The order of testing will be randomised prior to execution of the protocol, and
      each urine sample will only be identifiable by a unique reference number.

      When ready the volunteer will be required to read the IFU prior to testing the urine sample
      provided with the investigational device according to the instructions. The volunteer will
      advise the study technician of the result, who will record this on the result sheet.
