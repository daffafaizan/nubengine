      along with mealtime insulins. Patients will continue to use their mealtime insulins
      throughout the study. The study will consist of 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of
      follow-up. The 16 weeks of treatment will consist of two 8-week periods (Periods 1 and 2)
      during which patients will receive insulin glargine for 8 weeks and LY2605541 for 8 weeks in
      a random sequence. During the 4-week follow-up period, patients will return to insulin
      glargine or another basal insulin recommended by the investigator.
