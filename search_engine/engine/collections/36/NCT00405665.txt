      the expression of NOS2 has been found to be decreased in CF airways. While the reasons for
      impaired airway NO formation remain incompletely understood, there is evidence that low NO
      formation contributes to lung pathophysiology in CF. Constitutive endogenous formation of
      Nitric oxide (NO) in airways is thought to play a role in neurotransmission, smooth muscle
      relaxation and bronchodilation. Previous animal experiments have shown that the addition of
      L-arginine, the precursor of enzymatic NO formation, resulted in a significantly greater
      relaxation of tracheas. There is also evidence that a single dose of inhaled L-arginine
      improves pulmonary function in CF. In this study we will assess the effect of L-arginine
      inhalation on lung function, nitric oxide formation, airway inflammation and bacterial
      infection in CF patients.
