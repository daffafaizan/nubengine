      trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period.
      A total number of 60 participants will be included. Participants consume, in randomized
      order, a gluten-poor diet (<5 g/d) in the active treatment period and a gluten-rich diet (>25
      g/d) during the control period.

      Measurements: Altered quantitative metagenomics at bacterial gene- and species levels is the
      primary outcome of this study. Secondary outcomes include metabolic and inflammatory markers,
      circulating appetite hormone levels,serum metabolomics, gastrointestinal transit time and
      intestinal permeability. Furthermore, selected control measures are included; 4-day food
      records and a study intervention dietary records.
