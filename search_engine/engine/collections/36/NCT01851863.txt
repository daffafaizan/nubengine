      dyspepsia (FD) patients. However, one of the factors that limit therapeutic benefit is the
      poor compliance with prescribed drugs. The possible reasons for lack of compliance include
      the patient's health beliefs (e.g., that people who took such agents is possibly considered
      insane in China), lack of knowledge about antidepressants (that they are addictive or can be
      stopped on recovery), and aversion to side effects. The investigators propose to examine
      whether different clinician-patient communication methods could affect adherence to
      antidepressant drugs in functional dyspepsia patients.
