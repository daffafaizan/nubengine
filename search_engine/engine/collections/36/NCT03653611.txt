    
      This is a prospective, multi-center qualitative study engaging clinical staff at all levels
      from primary care practices serving US patient populations of differing gender, racial,
      ethnic, urban/rural and socio-economic blends.

      The CAPTURE tool consists of a 5-item self-administered questionnaire and selected use of
      peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement, designed to identify clinically significant COPD.

      This study will assess, using the RE-AIM approach, how real-word primary care practices might
      potentially use CAPTURE to: a) identify target populations (Reach); b) appraise optimal
      targeted respiratory history and symptoms consistent with clinically significant COPD
      (Effectiveness); c) integrate into practice workflow (Adoption); d) deliver changes and
      improvements to COPD care within the scope of real-world clinical practice (Implementation);
      and e) persist in use and quality over time (Maintenance).

      Approximately 150 clinicians from 10 participating primary care practices will undergo
      detailed implementation investigation of the CAPTURE case finding model for clinically
      significant COPD. In addition, 200 enrolled participants will complete a 10-minute written
      CAPTURE opinion survey.

      Using the RE-AIM framework and consistent phased qualitative analyses, this aim ascertains
      reach, impact, adoption, implementation and maintenance primary care feasibility
      recommendation characteristics of CAPTURE via pooled assessment of prescriber clinical staff,
      non-prescriber clinical staff, CAPTURE-eligible patients and local PBRN clinical quality
      improvement expertise from 10 primary care practices across 5 US regions.
