      tolerability of denosumab in Multiple Myeloma participants, by studying drug interactions
      with different parts of the body.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Denosumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved denosumab for use in other cancers to treat cancer-related
      bone disease such as prostate and breast cancer.
