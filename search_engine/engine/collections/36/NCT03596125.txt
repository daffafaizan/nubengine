      recruitment of 120 pregnant women admitted to hospital care due to preterm labor (above 18
      yrs of age, gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks). According to the risk of preterm
      delivery, women will be treated following two different schedules :

        -  High risk of prematurity: NAC supplementation -9 g intravenously-6g/day per os until day
           7-1,8g/day per os until 37 weeks of gestational age.

        -  Moderate risk of prematurity: NAC supplementation -6g/day per os until day 7-1,8g/day
           per os until 37 weeks of gestational age.

      Biological samples collected: maternal blood at inclusion, maternal/cord blood and placenta
      at delivery, breast milk samples during the first week of lactation in case of exclusive
      breastfeeding.

      Levels of glutathione and related metabolites will be measured in plasma, red blood cells,
      placenta and breast milk.

      In ancillary studies, metabolome and lipidome profilings will be performed on maternal and
      cord blood and on breast milk samples.
