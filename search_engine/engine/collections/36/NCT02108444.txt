      after chemotherapy in previous sudy. We did not assign specific interventions to the subjects
      in this study. The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of hepatitis B virus
      reactivation after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy. The secondary endpoints
      include the incidence of hepatitis flare related to hepatitis B virus reactivation after
      withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy, the tumor response rate, and overall survival
      rate.
