      are improving, but the intensity of treatment is limited by toxicity. 2-5% of patients die of
      treatment related complications, mostly related to therapy-induced toxicity and immune
      suppression. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability a colostrum containing
      diet to limit gastrointestinal toxicity including chemotherapy induced inflammation. The
      study is based on patients treated according to the current NOPHO protocol.
