      2006;131:690-695. We have shown that tiotropium increases resting inspiratory capacity
      thereby providing lung volume protection against metronome paced hyperventilation induced
      dynamic hyperinflation. End point will be to correlate increase in tiotropium induced FEV
      1(L) and inspiratory capacity with extent of underlying emphysema as scored by lung CT ( Gelb
      AF et al:Chest 1996; 109: 353-359)in 29 patients with COPD. We will also correlate the
      decrease in inspiratory capacity following metronome paced hyperventilation induced dynamic
      hyperinflation with extent of lung CT scored emphysema.
