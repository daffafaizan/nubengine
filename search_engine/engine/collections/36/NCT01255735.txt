      school performance, dysfunctional social development, and higher participation in criminal
      activities. The lesions most commonly associated with pediatric vocal dysfunction are
      reported to be vocal fold nodules, which are present in up to 21% of the general pediatric
      population and are associated with behavioral problems and inferior quality of life. Voice
      therapy with a speech-language pathologist is recommended by 95% of otolaryngologists for
      management of vocal fold nodules. When implemented, this voice therapy requires significant
      time investment and typically results in regular absence from the classroom over a period of
      1-3 months or longer, depending on the protocol and the setting. Regular absence from school
      has been shown to place children at risk for poorer scholastic performance but the benefits
      of this voice therapy have yet to be demonstrated in any rigorous prospective, controlled
      trial. Thus, the most widely used treatment for the most common lesion associated with
      pediatric voice disorders has not been rigorously tested in a randomized controlled trial to
      determine whether it may have benefits.

      A randomized clinical trial addressing whether voice therapy improves voice-related quality
      of life for children with apparent vocal fold nodules is a logical step toward developing an
      evidence-based treatment plan to optimize outcomes for this sizable population of at-risk
      children. There are currently no well-powered, prospective, controlled studies which compare
      voice therapy versus control in children who present with apparent nodules. Our goal is to
      remedy this deficiency through testing of the following primary null hypothesis: There is no
      difference in the change in PVRQOL scores after 3 months of treatment with voice therapy
      versus office instructions.
