      indicated for therapeutic use to promote corneal healing and relieve corneal pain by
      protecting the cornea during the treatment of acute or chronic pathologies, such as corneal
      edema, corneal erosions, entropion, bullous keratopathy, and corneal dystrophies as well as
      post-surgical conditions resulting from cataract extraction and corneal surgery.
