    
      AIM 1: We will categorize children ages 7-12 yrs. of age with FGIDs (n=250) as to whether
      they have/do not have one or more of the following abnormal physiologic changes: a) Autonomic
      Nervous System imbalance as indicated by low heart rate variability; and/or (b) Abnormalities
      in gut physiology: Impaired gut barrier function (increased permeability); and/or increased
      abundance of species of Gammaproteobacteria and/or Clostridia; and/or Gut neuroimmune
      dysfunction (increased fecal chromogranin A and secretogranin 2 concentrations).

      AIM 2: Children will be randomized to the two treatments most commonly used in clinical
      practice: CBT or a low FODMAP diet for a 3-week treatment period. We will compare the
      response to the treatments in those with/without abnormal physiologic biomarkers at 3 weeks,
      3 months, and 6 months.
