      abnormalities and their relation to disruption within the corticostriatal valuation circuit
      in MDD; (2) stress-induced DA signaling disruptions in MDD; and (3) the predictive validity
      of these two pathophysiological mechanisms. This will be achieved through an innovative
      integration of (1) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based assessments of
      glutamatergic metabolites in the mPFC; (2) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      probes of the corticostriatal valuation circuit with well-established stress manipulations
      (MAST) and assessments (cortisol and inflammatory markers); (3) positron emission tomography
      (PET)-based measurement of striatal DA release with well-established stress manipulations and
      assessments (cortisol and inflammatory markers); and (4) a naturalistic follow-up design.
