        -  To determine the feasibility of applying established MRI techniques to map functional
           anatomic regions at potential risk in irradiated normal brain tissue of patients
           undergoing radiotherapy to the base of the skull and brain for head and neck neoplasms.

        -  To determine changes in cerebral blood flow and blood volume with perfusion MRI
           techniques in irradiated regions of the brain as a function of the radiation dose.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo MRI perfusion imaging and functional (fMRI) (standard structural
      imaging sequences, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeled perfusion imaging at rest,
      blood oxygen level dependent, and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted MRI) at
      baseline and 3 and 6 months after completion of radiotherapy. Patients may perform tasks for
      fMRI studies, including finger tapping, photic stimulation with a flashing light, solving
      math problems, comparing shapes, giving a speech, or listening to and reciting lists of words
      during fMRI image acquisition. Patients also undergo daily fractionated intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy.
