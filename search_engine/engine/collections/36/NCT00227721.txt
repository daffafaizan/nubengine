      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with platinum-sensitive or -resistant relapsed
           or refractory ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cavity cancer treated with gemcitabine
           and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and progression-free survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      treatment with a platinum-containing regimen (platinum-resistant disease vs
      platinum-sensitive disease).

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional courses beyond CR
      (â‰¥ 6 total courses of treatment).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36-62 patients (19-29 for stratum I [platinum-resistant
      disease] and 17-33 for stratum II [platinum-sensitive disease]) will be accrued for this
      study.
