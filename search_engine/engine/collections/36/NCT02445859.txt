      prophylaxis. But this measure is not achieved by standard prophylaxis regimens. Neither do
      clinical data suggest this target achieves optimal prophylaxis. Therefore there is an
      opportunity to optimise antibiotic prophylaxis dosing. As the exposure response-relationship
      (pharmacodynamic target) is unknown we could either complete a number of studies exploring
      different relationships, or compare standard treatment to a single regimen which included a
      number of exposure-response relationships. The two most common exposure-response
      relationships are the CMAX/MIC ratio and the fT>MIC. And it has been reported that killing,
      as opposed to inhibition used in MIC values, is optimised by achieving 4 times an MIC value.
      An antibiotic prophylaxis regimen which achieved drug concentrations of 4xMIC for the
      duration of surgery would therefore achieves a high CMAX/MIC ratio, high T>MIC, and optimise
      bacterial killing. Therefore, standard dose antibiotic prophylaxis will be compared against a
      PD target dosed antibiotic prophylaxis regimen. The PD target will be a free serum antibiotic
      concentration of 4xMIC90 for Enterobacteriaceae against cefuroxime. Continuous infusion of
      antibiotic prophylaxis will ensure there is continuous targeting of this drug level
      throughout the operation.
