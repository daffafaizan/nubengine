      20 million people in the United States being affected with mild to moderate dry eye, to as
      many as one out of every five Americans.

      EyeGate completed a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2
      efficacy study in 105 subjects with mild to moderate dry eye disease, utilizing the
      Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE), a clinical model which allows for standardized
      measurement of dry eye signs and symptoms in the investigation of therapeutic agents. In this
      Phase 2 study, the improvements documented in dry eye signs and symptoms relative to the
      placebo group indicated that the ocular iontophoresis treatments with EGP-437 (dexamethasone
      phosphate formulated for ocular iontophoresis) had both a rapid onset of action and a
      long-term effectiveness.

      The Phase 3 study is intended to confirm and extend the results from the Phase 2 study,
      utilizing the CAE model. The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of EGP-437
      at two different dose levels: Ocular Iontophoresis with EGP-437 4.0 mA-min at 1.5 mA and
      Ocular Iontophoresis with EGP-437 6.5 mA-min at 2.5 mA compared to Ocular Iontophoresis with
      placebo (sodium citrate buffer solution) for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry
      eye.
