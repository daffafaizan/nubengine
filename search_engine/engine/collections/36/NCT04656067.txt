      is defined as the delivery of a foetus(es) through surgical incisions made through the
      anterior abdominal wall (technically referred to as laparotomy) and the anterior uterine wall
      (technically denoted to as hysterotomy).

      Obstetric Hemorrhage (Intra operative OR post operative bleeding)is still the major cause of
      maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide contributing to nearly 25% of direct maternal
      deaths. And accounts for 50% of maternal mortality in low-income countries.

      So many Strategies reducing the intraoperative blood loss or post operative blood loss could
      be helpful in decreasing the risks of blood transfusion and the postoperative maternal
      morbidity.

      So these Medications are such as Oxytocin, Carbetocin, Misoprostol, Prostaglandin F2 alpha,
      methylergonovine, Tranexamic acid and Etamsylate . have been tried before to control bleeding
      during and after Cesarean Section.
