      All subjects completed two diet studies in which two meals were served 195 minutes apart. On
      one study day, two high GI (> 75) meals were given, and on the other study day, two low GI (<
      30) meals were given. The low GI and high GI meals were matched for amount of carbohydrates,
      protein, and fat based on a weight-maintaining diet for each subject. The order of the study
      treatment (high or low GI) was randomized. Subjects were not informed as the GI of any meal.
