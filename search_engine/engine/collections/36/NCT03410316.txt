        1. Overweight and obesity affect major systemic responses, such as inflammation and
           coagulation that lead to the occurrence of major common diseases.

        2. The occurrence of these diseases is related to individual make-up, including genetics
           and fat type and location, and environment, and the interaction between the various
           systemic responses, and the (subclinical) disease outcomes.

      Primary general objectives of the NEO study

        1. To study the pathways that lead to common diseases in overweight and obese individuals.

        2. To identify novel determinants of various diseases and conditions in overweight and
           obese individuals.

        3. To study interrelationships between diseases, newly identified determinants with each
           other and with classical, established risk factors.

      Secondary general objectives of the NEO Study

        1. To identify novel determinants of various subclinical conditions in overweight and obese
           individuals.

        2. To develop novel methods for determining the risk of various diseases and conditions in
           asymptomatic overweight and obese individuals, in addition to established prognostic
           markers.

        3. To assess the burden of disease in a population-based cohort of overweight and obese
           individuals.

        4. To investigate the optimal diagnostic method to define overweight and obesity in terms
           of predicting various diseases.
