      of obesity. Bright light therapy has the potential to enhancing serotonin levels, impact on
      carbohydrate metabolism and reducing soreness and hyperthermia associated with physical
      activity. The aim of this study is to conduct a controlled investigation of the effects of
      bright light therapy and exercise on weight loss and body composition in overweight
      individuals.

      Research Methods and Procedures: Twenty-five overweight male and female subjects will be
      assigned to 6 weeks of moderate exercise with or without bright light treatment. Outcome
      measure included changes in body mass and body composition and ratings of mood, seasonality
      and sleep.
