      extracapsular cataract extraction and phacoemulsification intervention. The importance of
      intraoperative maintenance of mydriasis arises from the necessity for the surgeon to insert
      intra-ocular lens in the posterior chamber of the eye. It is now well established that
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce intraoperative miosis during cataract
      surgery. Topical Flurbiprofen, Indomethacin and Diclofenac with and without intraoperative
      epinephrine are the commonest topical non-steroidal eye drops with which nearly all
      publications in the literature studied the prevention of intraoperative surgery-induced
      miosis. In addition, Diclofenac was found to be the most effective NSAIDs agent in
      maintaining intraoperative mydriasis.

      More recently, evidence that some NSAIDs, namely ketorolac and Flurbiprofen, may have a role
      in preventing pseudophakic cystoid macular oedema.

      Patients whom eyes are pre-treated with some NSAIDs, especially diclofenac, shows a
      statistically significant reduction in the degree of postoperative inflammation (e.g.,
      redness, pain and itching) on the first post-operative day. On the contrary, Thaller et al
      found, in his study at 2000, that no statistically significant difference in the
      postoperative redness, pain and cells in the anterior chamber.

      Administration of Adrenalin in the anterior chamber fluid is found by several studies to be
      more effective in maintaining intraoperative mydriasis than preoperative treatment with
      NSAIDs.
