      collected neuropsychological task data on cognition (executive functioning and general
      cognitive abilities) from a computerized test battery, as well as BMI data, on a sample of
      869 twins. Investigators will use information from the known extent of genetic and
      environmental sharing between members of MZ (monozygotic; identical) and DZ (dizygotic;
      fraternal) twin pairs to quantify the genetic correlation between measures of cognition and
      BMI using biometric genetic modeling under the assumptions of the classical twin model. The
      specific aims are:

        -  To examine the association between BMI and executive functioning (EF) in a sample of 869
           twin children, ages 7 to 15 years old, who participated in the Texas Twin Project (TTP)

        -  To gauge the specificity of EF-BMI relations relative to academic achievement and
           general cognitive abilities.

        -  To examine the relative contribution of genetic and environment influences to the
           inverse association between BMI and EF
