    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the optimal dose and timing of panitumumab IRDye800 infusion for identifying
      lung cancer compared to surrounding normal tissue in the ex vivo setting as measured by tumor
      to background ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the panitumumab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in
      subjects undergoing resection of lung cancer.

      II. Determine whether the primary lung tumor or positive lymph nodes can be detected by
      near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with panitumumab IRDye800 but not by white light
      imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Participants receive panitumumab- IRDye800 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 0, and
      then undergo NIR and surgery within 1-5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 30 days.
