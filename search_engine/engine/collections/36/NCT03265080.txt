      new source of targets for cancer immunotherapy. These mutations, which arise during
      tumorigenesis, are expressed only by the tumor and, as such, may be recognized as newly
      formed antigens, or neoantigens, by the patient's T cells. The lack of expression of
      patient-specific tumor mutations in nonmalignant cells suggests that vaccines targeting these
      tumor mutations have a low risk of autoimmunity and may represent a safer therapeutic
      approach than many of those currently available. The development of a Listeria monocytogenes
      (Lm)-based vaccine that expresses these patient-specific tumor antigens and that activates
      tumor-killing T cells has the potential to be a highly effective form of immunotherapy. In
      addition, the Lm platform, because it mediates tumor control through multiple mechanisms, may
      exhibit more robust anti-tumor activity than other vaccine platforms. Thus, the targeting of
      patient-specific mutation-derived tumor antigens and the concurrent stimulation of host
      immunity provides a rational approach for boosting anti-tumor immunity, as monotherapy and in
      combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.
