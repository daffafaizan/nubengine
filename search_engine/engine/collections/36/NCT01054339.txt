    
      The study is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, sequential, three-arm, Phase 2
      clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of administration of a rAAV1-CB-hAAT vector
      administered by IM injection. Each participant will receive rAAV1-CB-hAAT on a single
      occasion. Three groups of three subjects each will receive rAAV1-CB-hAAT at dosage levels of
      6 x 10e11 vg/kg, 1.9 x 10e12 vg/kg or 6 x 10e12 vg/kg by IM injection. Subjects in group 1
      will receive a total of 10 IM injections distributed across a single muscle site, subjects in
      group 2 will receive a total of 32 IM injections distributed across three muscle sites, and
      subjects in group 3 will receive 100 IM injections distributed across 10 muscle sites. Each
      injection will be given in a volume of 1.35 mL, at the appropriate vector concentration to
      achieve the desired total vector dose.

      The three groups were enrolled sequentially, with review of safety data by a Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board before enrollment of each higher dosage level group.

      Safety was monitored by evaluation of adverse events, hematology and clinical chemistry
      parameters, histological examination of muscle biopsies, and measurement of serum antibodies
      to AAT. Efficacy was measured by evaluation of serum concentrations of M-specific AAT and
      total AAT, and serum AAT phenotype determined on isoelectric focusing gels. Additional
      information collected included presence of the vector in blood or semen, changes in serum
      anti-AAV antibody titers, and changes in T cell responses to AAV and AAT.
