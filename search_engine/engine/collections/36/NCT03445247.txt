      Extracorporeal shock wave treatments (ESWT) with low-intensity was reported to be beneficial
      in inducing cell regeneration and reducing inflammation and have been successfully used for
      bone fracture, cardiac ischemia, and erectile disorders. In this study, sixty patients with
      stage III & IV (15<=estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 ml/min/1.73m2) will be
      recruited and allocated to control and experimental groups in a 1:1 ratio. In experiment
      group, a total of 1200 shockwaves, with low energy density 0.1mj/mm2 and a frequency of 120
      shocks/min, will be applied per kidney per treatment session. The treatment will be given
      twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 3 weeks of recess and an additional series
      of 6 sessions (totally 12 times). Patients in each group will be evaluated with eGFR, urine
      protein-creatinine ration, blood pressure, and biochemistry data at the beginning (index day)
      and 12 months after starting of the therapy. (Outcome time point: 12 months)
