      age Â±years). All participants will be subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical and
      neurological examination. Complete neurological examination where the following clinical and
      demographical data will be taken; age sex, stroke etiology, presence of stroke risk factors
      (as smoking history , hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus , history of hypertension, history of
      transient ischemic attacks, history of myocardial infarction or any cardiac problems). Stroke
      subtype will be classified according to the criteria of Trial of Org 10172 in acute Stroke

      assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be measured
      at the time of admission. Brain imaging (either CT scan and /or MRI) will be performed after
      admission. Electrocardiography (ECG), Echocardiography (ECHO), Carotid and vertibrobasilar
      Duplex will be done for all patients. Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of complete
      blood picture (CBC), Random blood glucose levels, renal function tests (RFT), liver function
      tests (LFT), thyroid function tests (TFT), Lipid profile, Soluble CD40 Ligand and Neopetrin
      by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission.
