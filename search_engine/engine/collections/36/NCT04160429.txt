      I. To compare novel, home-based methods of quantitating medication concentrations in either
      saliva or sweat to the 'gold standard' of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry of
      plasma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare novel home-based methods of quantitating substances in either saliva or sweat
      to the 'gold standard' in plasma.

      II. Assess the ease of obtaining home-based samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of sweat samples via Macroduct Sweat Collection System 3710S and
      saliva and blood samples within 24 hours after medication administrations. Patients also
      complete questionnaires over 5-10 minutes and have medical charts reviewed.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
