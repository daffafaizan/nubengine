      Electroencephalogram-based neurofeedback is now considered as a potentially intervention and
      may positively affect cognitive function for patients with AD. However, there are few
      existing studies involving the role of neurofeedback on cognition for subjective cognitive
      decline (SCD).

      Fifty participants with SCD will be recruited in this clinical trial. At baseline,
      neuropsychological tests are conducted. Participants will receive electroencephalogram-based
      neurofeedback therapy once a day for successive five days. After that, the investigators will
      evaluate the changes of memory measures, which is the primary outcome.
