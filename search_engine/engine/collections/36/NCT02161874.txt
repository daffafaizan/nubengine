    
      This prospective, randomized-controlled study will enroll qualified patients with partial
      edentulism who will be treated with at least two dental implants. Implant sites will be
      randomly assigned to receive either a test (T3 implant) or control (Nanotite Certain Tapered
      implant) with an 80:20 (test:control) randomization ratio.

      All implants will be allowed to integrate without occlusal forces and final restorations will
      be cemented thereafter.

      Cumulative success rate and crestal bone regression of both treatment groups will be the
      primary and secondary study endpoints, respectively.
