      may have life threatening consequences in survival situations where maintenance of muscle
      control is necessary. Much of the effects cooling has on muscle performance is directly due
      to its effects on muscle tissue itself, whereas less is known about the effects on the
      central nervous system. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to characterize corticospinal
      excitability that accompanies basic cold stress via progressive skin cooling, resulting in
      reductions in skin (Tsk) or core (Tco) temperature and shivering.
