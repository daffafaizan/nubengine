      subjects will be screened and 342 randomized. Prior to the screening, subjects of Stratum A
      should have a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day or a maximal tolerated dose) for at
      least 8 weeks. And subjects of Stratum B should have a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day
      or a maximal tolerated dose) AND a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor at maximum approved dose
      for at least 8 weeks prior to the screening. Eligible subjects who complete the screening
      visit will enter the lead-in period, which includes open-label saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin
      treatment for 16 weeks in Stratum A or 8 weeks in Stratum B. At randomization visit, eligible
      subjects will be randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, receiving blinded
      dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg or placebo plus metformin and saxagliptin 5 mg treatment for 24
      weeks.
