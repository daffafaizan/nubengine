      circumference, adipometer); chest inspection and palpation, vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate, respiratory frequence, oxymetry), dyspnea index and capillar blood glucose; and
      later with pulmonary tests (thoracoabdominal perimetry, respiratory muscle strength and
      pulmonary volume and capacity). This will be a quasi-experimental study. Patients will be
      divided into four groups according to waist circumference (increased or not, with respect to
      cardiovascular risk) and respiratory disorders (obstructive and restrictive). After this
      assessment, chest physical therapy will begin according to the protocol for obstructive and
      restrictive respiratory disorders. The treatment will have an average duration of 30 minutes.
      At the end of treatment (single session) the patient will be assessed again after five and
      thirty minutes.
