      diseases. This natural history protocol will collect plasma from subjects that were
      vaccinated to or recovered from an emerging infectious disease of interest, in a manner that
      the plasma can be given to other subjects as a therapeutic. Any administration of plasma to
      subjects will be under a separate protocol.
