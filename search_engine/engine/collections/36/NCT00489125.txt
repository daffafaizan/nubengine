        -  Collect data regarding diagnosis, type of surgery, receipt of adjuvant therapy, age,
           height, weight, waist circumference, arm strength, grip strength, shoulder range of
           motion, and physical activity participation from women undergoing surgery for breast
           cancer.

        -  Examine changes in physical activity participation, measures of body composition,
           shoulder range of motion, grip strength, and arm strength over time in these patients.

        -  Determine differences in changes in physical activity and indices of fitness according
           to type of surgery and adjuvant therapy.

        -  Examine relationships between exercise participation, fitness, and body composition over
           time.

        -  Correlate data with an ongoing randomized exercise trial that includes strength and
           flexibility assessments with no pre-surgery measures.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, cohort study.

      Patients submit data comprising demographic/medical information, anthropometrics (weight,
      height, waist circumference), grip strength, bicep strength, shoulder range of motion, and
      physical activity participation prior to surgery, at each surgical follow-up visit, and at 2
      years after surgery.
