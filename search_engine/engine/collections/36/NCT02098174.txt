      participants in this Phase 1, open-label study following the administration of a single,
      intravenous 1 Âµmol/kg dose over 2 minutes followed by 10 mL saline under fasting conditions.
      Iohexol (Omnipaque-300, 5 mL of a 300 mg I/mL solution) was also administered over 2 minutes
      followed by 10 mL of saline. The pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol was assessed by
      statistical comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time
      curves and urine recovery data.
