      leukocytes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colon cancer in comparison to
      healthy individuals by polymerase chain reaction, Western Blots and flow cytometry. Colonic
      endoscopic biopsies and blood are collected from adult patients with confirmed active
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), adult UC and CD patients in remission,
      colon cancer patients and from healthy individuals (controls). Biopsies from healthy
      individuals (control group) will have undergone colonoscopy during standard screening for
      colorectal cancer or for the diagnostic workup of gastrointestinal symptoms without
      endoscopic or histologic evidence of colonic disease. For UC patients, duration and location
      of disease (Montreal classification), endoscopic (Mayo score) and clinical activity score,
      histological features and current and previous treatments (5-aminosalicylic acid,
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators) will be recorded. For CD patients, duration and location
      of disease is assessed, a HarveyBradshaw Index and activity will be scored, histological
      features and current and previous treatments will be recorded. Blood is collected and
      immediately processed for flow cytometric experiments. Phospholipids are measured in serum
      and in colonic mucosal biopsy samples of all cohorts by mass spectrometry.
