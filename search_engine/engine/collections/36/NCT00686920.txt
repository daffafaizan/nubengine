    
      Eligible participants had a history of HE, a Conn score of 0 to 2 at enrollment, and either
      had successfully participated in a previous HE study with rifaximin (that is, RFHE3001
      [NCT00298038]), or were new participants enrolled with ≥1 verifiable episode of HE
      (equivalent to a Conn score of ≥2) associated with cirrhosis or portal hypertension within 12
      months of screening.

      Successful participation in a previous rifaximin study was defined as having received ≥80%
      and ≤120% of the expected tablets, having been reasonably compliant with study procedures,
      and having not been discontinued from the previous study due to study drug-related Adverse
      Events. Participants who experienced HE or associated symptoms during or after the RFHE3001
      study were considered eligible for entry into this open-label study if the participant and
      Investigator did not perceive study medication as a possible cause of the HE episode or
      associated symptoms. Participants who did not participate in a previous HE study with
      rifaximin were eligible if this open-label study was the only rifaximin HE study available at
      an individual site.
