      treatment and prevention for children has been challenging. Mobile applications (apps) are an
      engaging way to involve children in health behavior changes, capitalizing on the portability
      and affordability of delivering health information via mobile devices and the opportunity to
      use gaming to make health information entertaining. Previous research by our team, including
      a systematic review of commercially available mobile apps for family weight loss, physical
      activity, and healthy eating as well as a pilot test of commercially available apps and
      physical activity monitoring devices with parent-child dyads, revealed significant gaps in
      the available mobile tools. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of using
      commercially available apps and a physical activity monitoring device (Tech) compared to the
      apps and physical activity device plus a mobile website and theory-based family intervention
      that encourages increased parent-child communication about physical activity and healthy
      eating and family behavior change (Tech+). The two programs will be administered remotely via
      email, mobile apps, and a mobile website to parent-child dyads (child 9-12 years old), using
      over a 3-month intervention period. Parent-child dyads will be randomized to the two
      behavioral interventions: Tech (50 dyads) or Tech+ (50 dyads). Our proposed research has two
      aims:

      Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of an evidence-based mobile intervention with enhanced
      parent/child communication (Tech+) versus commercially available products (physical activity
      and healthy eating apps, physical activity device) alone (Tech) for improvements in physical
      activity and healthy eating in parents and children.

      Aim 2: Examine the impacts of evidence-based family intervention on parent-child relationship
      quality and communication about physical activity and healthy eating.
