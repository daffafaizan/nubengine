      enrolment as well as the usage of patient blood samples for research purpose will be obtained
      from the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent will be obtained from
      all patients.The primary analysis upon which the sample size consideration was based involved
      the comparison of the SVR subgroup and the subgroup of patients without SVR. For the sample
      size calculation, we a two-factorial design (time course Ã— SVR) with the use of a two-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis, a significance level of 5% and a statistical power of
      at least 80% to detect a medium effect size (d = 0.5) and thus to show a significant group
      difference. Based on this background, the optimal sample size is calculated to be a total of
      102 subjects. To consider asymmetric subgroups and to allow for a moderate dropout rate and
      additional calculations (secondary study objectives), we aim to include a total of at least
      150 study participants in each group with 25 healthy volunteers as controls.
