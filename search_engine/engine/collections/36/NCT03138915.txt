    
      This is a prospective, multi-center diagnostic trial conducted at 5 high-volume liver centers
      (302 Hospital of PLA; Beijing Shijitan Hospital; The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South
      University; Beijing Youan Hospital; Xingtai People's Hospital) in China designed to determine
      the diagnostic performance of radiomics-based hepatic venous pressure gradient (rHVPG)
      (investigational technology) by CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of the
      clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with cirrhosis. Direct hepatic
      venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement by means of catheterization of a hepatic vein
      with a balloon catheter is the gold-standard method to assess the presence of CSPH, which is
      defined as HVPGâ‰¥10 mmHg.
