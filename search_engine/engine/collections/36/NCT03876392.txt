      site metastasis (anterior iliac spine or posterior iliac spine). After functional magnetic
      resonance examination, bone marrow biopsy was performed. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging includes conventional SE sequence, T2W SPAIR, e-THRIVE,DWI,IVIM. With bone marrow
      biopsy as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and coincidence rate of functional
      MRI in the diagnosis of bone marrow metastasis were evaluated.
