      third-generation compstatin analogue Cp40. AMY-101 is a selective inhibitor of complement
      activation in humans and in NHP. It binds to the complement component C3, the central
      "functional hub" that controls the upstream activation/amplification and downstream effector
      functions of complement. By binding to C3, AMY-101 inhibits the cleavage of native C3 to its
      active fragments C3a and C3b. As a consequence, the deposition of C3b, amplification via the
      alternative pathway and all downstream complement responses are prevented. AMY-101 is being
      developed to treat complement-mediated diseases, which are largely driven by aberrant C3
      activation.

      This first-in-human study of the C3-targeting complement inhibitor AMY-101 investigates the
      safety and PK/PD profile of AMY-101 in healthy male volunteers after Single Ascending Dose
      (SAD) and Multiple Doses (MD) using subcutaneous (SQ) or intravenous (IV) administration. The
      study is a prospective, single-center, open-label evaluation in healthy male volunteers.
