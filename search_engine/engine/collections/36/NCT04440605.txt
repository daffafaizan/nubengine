      I. Confirm the inclusion of pathological stage I (pI) among clinical stage III(T3-4aNx)
      (cIII) diagnosis patients less than 5% II. Figure out the suitable criterion of NAC and avoid
      overtreatment, by examining the rate of pI rate in different diagnostic criterion groups,
      including cIII, TxNy(x+y>4), cN1-3, cT3-4.

      III. Evaluate the current state of diagnostic accuracy of preoperative CT staging in china.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a prospective, multi-centers, cohort study of clinical TNM staging diagnostic
      accuracy.

      Patients are divided into 3 preoperative stage groups according to AJCC 8th edition (cI, cII,
      cIII) preoperatively. All patients receive the D2 gastrectomy after cTNM diagnosis and the
      pathological stages is given following surgery.

      The concordance of preoperative staging is evaluated in each cohorts as well as the subgroups
      to obtain the accuracy rate. The pI proportion will calculate in each latent criterion groups
      to assess the suitable NAC criteria.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 968 patients will be accrued for this study within two years.
