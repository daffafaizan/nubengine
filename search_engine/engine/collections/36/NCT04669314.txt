      retrospectively analyzed. Patient and disease characteristics including demographics,
      laboratory tests, imaging studies, type of surgical approach and outcomes including
      postoperative laboratory tests, record of complications, duration of hospital stay will be
      reviewed. Complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. The
      patients were informed about the surgeries in advance and their informed consents about
      surgeries and data collection for scientific purposes were obtained. Datafile will be
      anonymized before analysis and original file will be destroyed. Outcomes such as
      complications, hospital stay, blood transfusion and mortality will be compared between groups
      created according to type of surgery, lesion size, preoperative laboratory values and
      demographic features. Variables for prediction of better outcomes are expected to be
      discovered.
