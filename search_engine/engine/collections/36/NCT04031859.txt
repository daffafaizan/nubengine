      centers; Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC) and King Abd Allah University Hospital
      (KAAUH) in Princess Noura University, will be randomly separated into 2 groups; in the first
      group (A): Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk stratification tool (which is prepared by a
      clinical pharmacist) will be applied to choose the tailored extended VTE prophylactic agent.
      While in the second group (B), the risk stratification tool will not be used, rather it will
      follow the routine hospital protocol for choosing the VTE prophylactic agent, which is
      Caprini: a standard validated model. Then each group of patients will be followed till 35
      days post-operation, during which all VTE or bleeding events should be recorded.
