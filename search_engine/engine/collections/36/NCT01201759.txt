      compared at baseline for fasting and postprandial responses. For Study Objective 2, all
      persons tested for Study Objective 1 will undergo randomization to either 1 month of
      Salsalate (4.0 g/day) or placebo. An untreated wash-in (1 month) will precede treatment (1
      month), and a washout cross-over period (1 month) will follow. The last month will test
      effects of drug-placebo not examined in month 2. Fasting and postprandial responses will be
      tested at each time point. Intention-to-treat clinical standards ("…as randomized, so
      analyzed…") and 'last observation carried forward' clinical methods will be adopted.

      Participants with tetraplegia are sought, as they have fewer exercise options than those with
      paraplegia and are at greater risk for sedentary lifestyle resulting in CVD, CVD risks, and
      obesity.
