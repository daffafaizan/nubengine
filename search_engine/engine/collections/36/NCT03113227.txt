      of their cervices will be done before actual induction of labor. First, transvaginal
      ultrasound will be done to assess the posterior angle and the length of the cervix. Then
      vaginal examination will be done to measure the Bishop score. Analysis will be done to
      identify the best predictor of successful induction of labour.
