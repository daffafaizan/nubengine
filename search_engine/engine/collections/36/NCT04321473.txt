      antithrombotic management.

      No limitation will be applied for the technique of PCI. As regards data collection and
      endpoints, Case Report Form (CRF) will be entered on a web-based platform, where study
      participants will be able to access and retrieve data at any time during study progress.

      In-hospital outcomes will be recorded; all patients discharged alive will be followed up with
      a 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year telephone interview.

      On a center-to-center voluntary basis, pre-PCI and post-PCI angiographic images (made blind
      regarding patients' identity) will be sent to a study angiographic core-lab for Quantitative
      Angiography Substudy. The images will be processed using a validated quantitative coronary
      angiography (QCA) Bifurcation software to assess quantitative data describing bifurcation
      geometry before and after LMCA PCI. In the Quantitative Angiography Substudy, on exploratory
      bases, FFRangio data reconstructed by angiographic software will be tested against stenosis
      LMCA lesion severity and LMCA PCI result.
