      and exercise therapy for scoliosis on the progression of spinal curvature, spinal sagittal
      balance and pelvic obliquity in children aged 6 to 15 years with cerebral palsy (Gross Motor
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) level IV-V) and scoliosis.

      Materials and methods: A prospective, randomized and controlled, single-blind study was
      performed on 29 patients with cerebral palsy(CP). Patients were randomized into two groups.
      Both groups were given scoliosis home exercise program at least three days a week and 10
      repetitions for each exercise in a day. In the first group, a modular adaptive seating system
      used for at least four hours in a day with exercise program for scoliosis. This seating
      system includes a sitting elevation that corrects the pelvic obliquity, the hip block that
      prevents the sliding from the sitting floor and a body support unit that provides the
      alignment of the spine and controls of the body. Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity, sagittal
      spino-pelvic parameters (thoracic kyphosis angle (TK), lumbar lordosis angle (LL), sagittal
      vertical axis (SVA), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slop (SS)) and Reimer's
      migration index (RMI) measurements were evaluated by SurgimapÂ® software at the before and 3
      months after treatment.
