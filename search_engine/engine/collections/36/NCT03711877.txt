      system (DigniCap) and chemical cold cap on preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in a
      group of breast cancer patients receiving standard anthracycline followed paclitaxel
      regimens. To obtain the exact data on the role of different methods of preventing alopecia in
      Chinese women with breast cancer.

      PASS 11 software was used to calculate the sample size. According to the results of previous
      studies, the hair retention rate of the cold cap group was 67.7%, the hair retention rate of
      the scalp cooling system group was 50.5%, α=0.05，Power=0.8. The sample size was calculated to
      be at least 128 cases in each group, 256 cases in total.
