      I. To determine the immunogenicity of recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine
      (GARDASIL 9) administered after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in patients with
      hematologic malignancy by comparing HPV 9-plex competitive Luminex immunoassay (9-plex cLIA)
      titers before and after GARDASIL 9 administration.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GARDASIL 9 administered after allogeneic SCT
      in patients with hematologic malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care allogeneic stem cell transplant. 6-12 months following
      transplant, patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 0 and at 2 and 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up within 3 days.
