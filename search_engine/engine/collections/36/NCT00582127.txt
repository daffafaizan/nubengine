    
      Patients who have a current diagnosis of mild-moderate dementia and suspected of having
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) along with cognitively normal age-matched controls will be recruited
      for this study. The Alzheimer's subjects either will have had a complete clinical and
      neuropsychiatric workup or will have those tests performed during the study.

      Both groups, AD and controls will be asked to listen to a series of sounds and press a button
      on a handheld control box when a target sound is heard. The COGNISION(TM) headset on each
      subject's head will then record the electrical signals during this task.

      Four important features of the COGNISION(TM) will be investigated:

        1. Patient tolerance

        2. Ease of use

        3. Data quality

        4. Network architecture
