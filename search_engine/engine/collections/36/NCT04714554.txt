    
      Each study part consists of two sequential treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and
      Treatment Period 2) in which study participants will receive study treatments in a fixed
      (single)-sequence, crossover manner. In Part 1 of the study, a single
      relugolix/E2/norethindrone acetate (NETA) (40 milligrams [mg]/1 mg/0.5 mg) fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) tablet will be administered alone on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1; in
      Treatment Period 2, erythromycin will be administered on Day 1 to Day 12 (500 mg, four times
      daily [QID]) with co-administration of a single FDC tablet with the morning dose of
      erythromycin on Day 8. In Part 2 of the study, a single 120-mg dose of relugolix will be
      administered alone on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1; in Treatment Period 2, erythromycin will
      be administered on Day 1 to Day 12 (500 mg QID) with co-administration of a single 120-mg
      dose of relugolix with the morning dose of erythromycin on Day 8. There will be a nine-day
      washout interval between administration of study drug (the FDC tablet [Part 1] or relugolix
      120 mg [Part 2]) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2.
