      to maintain target INR between 1.8 and 2.5.

      Six wash out consecutive sessions were carried out before starting the study with Fresenius
      FX8 Helyxone® , for patients who underwent HD, or with FX 80 Helyxone®, for patients who
      underwent hemodiafiltration (HDF). After the wash out period, fresh whole blood and serum
      samples were drawn on starting dialysis, during the midweek HD session for 4 consecutive
      weeks. For each patient the mean value of the 4 blood samples was considered. All patients
      continued HD or HDF with FX8 or FX 80 Helyxone® during the whole study period.In order to
      estimate the normal ranges of the parameters that we evaluated, 60 anonymous healthy
      volunteers were also submitted to the same assays.
