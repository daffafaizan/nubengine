    
      Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody with a covalently attached toxin. The antibody portion
      targets the protein CD30 on the surface of cells, and the toxin acts against those cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to SGN-35 (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (CD30+) advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM)
      (ASM or mast cell leukemia [MCL] with or without an associated hematological clonal non-mast
      cell lineage disease [AHNMD]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of SGN-35 in patients with SM.

      II. To evaluate expression of CD30 on neoplastic mast cells before and during therapy with
      SGN-35.

      III. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality of life (QOL)
      using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF).

      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). V. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 1 year and
      then every 12 weeks thereafter.
