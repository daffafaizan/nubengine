      Centre, registered under Malaysia local authority. Convenient stratified blocked random
      sampling method will be used. Subjects included are those who will undergo endodontic
      treatment due to SIP between April 2020 to April 2022. 20 subjects are randomly allocated
      into real and sham acupuncture group. Electroacupuncture on LI4 HeGu, PC6 NeiGuan, ST6 JiaChe
      and ST7 XiaGuan will be applied on patients for 30 minutes before endodontic treatment. Pain
      levels are measured with Heft-Parker visual analog scale (HP-VAS) at the time point before
      and after EA, before and after endodontic treatment, 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after
      the treatment. For sham acupuncture group, blunted needles which do not penetrate the skin
      but will only be placed on the skin and stabilised by cotton ball and surgical tape at
      respective acupuncture points. No manipulation will be conducted for the sham acupuncture
      group. Patients, endodontist and data analyst are blinded in this study. Data collected will
      be analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 25.0. Paired
      T-test will be used to compare the pre-EA and post-EA pain score. T-test will be used to
      compare the pain scores of real and sham EA groups at each time interval including post-EA,
      during treatment and post-treatment ; and for induction time of IANBs in real and sham EA
      groups.

      This study will identify the effect of EA on the success rate of IANB and post-operative pain
      relief for SIP among Malaysian.
