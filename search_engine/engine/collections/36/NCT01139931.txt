        -  Map key histone modifications and cytosine methylation in leukemia cell lines with
           defined oncogenic mutations.

        -  Acquire genome-wide maps of key histone modifications and cytosine methylation for
           primary leukemia in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  Investigate functional relationships between genetic and epigenetic landscapes in AML.

      OUTLINE: Archived samples are analyzed in vivo and in vitro (cell line) for histone
      modification and cytosine methylation. Genome-wide locations of 5 histone modifications are
      analyzed using chip-Seq, as well as DNA methylation analysis at nucleotide-resolution by
      high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. These epigenetic data are correlated with genomic data
      (sequence analysis, expression array, SNP array).
