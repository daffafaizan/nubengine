      might help children who have feeding problems with pain and megestrol is known to increase
      appetite. Amitriptyline and megestrol are liquid syrups that are given by feeding tube daily.

      Amitriptyline has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of child with feeding problems. Amitriptyline is an investigational drug
      that is being studied to find out what the side effects are, and whether or not the product
      works for child with feeding problems. Amitriptyline is approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of depression.

      Megestrol has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of children with feeding problems. Megestrol is an investigational drug that is
      being studied to find out what the side effects are, and whether or not the product works for
      children with feeding problems. Megestrol has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      adults. Though megestrol is not FDA approved to treat children with feeding problems, it is
      often used for this purpose.

      Megestrol and Amitriptyline both affect the nerve cells that carry pain sensations to and
      from the brain. Both drugs reduce the intensity of the pain signals going to the part of the
      brain that feels pain. Each drug attaches to the nerve cell but at separate spots on the
      nerve cell so pain can be better managed.
