      of inhibition was demonstrated in patients with writer's cramp. The passage of weak DC
      currents across the head, or transcranial electrical polarization (TEP) has been done for
      many years with numerous effects described in healthy subjects and mentally diseased
      patients. Recently, it has been shown by objective means, in controlled experiments, that
      this type of treatment has robust and lasting effects on the excitability of the motor cortex
      in healthy humans.

      Study population: 40 subjects with focal hand dystonia.

      Design: We hypothesize that TEP will have a beneficial effect on hand writing in patients
      with FHD because it will decrease the excitability of the motor cortex compensating the
      deficiency of inhibition. Specifically, we propose to look at the effect of 2 mA TEP with
      cathode position over the hand projection in the contralateral to the affected hand primary
      motor cortex. Anodes will be placed over the orbit and mastoid process ipsilateral to the
      affected hand (contralateral to the cathode). Over a two-year period, we will enroll 40
      patients with FHD and evaluate the acute TEP effects over a period of 1 week (3 TEP
      sessions).

      Outcome measures: Symptoms will be evaluated by kinematic analysis of the handwriting and
      with dystonia scales.
