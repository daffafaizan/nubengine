      and in the post-surgery period, patients undergoing abdominal operations will usually have a
      urinary catheter placed in the bladder before the surgery. Traditionally these catheters are
      retained for 7 days, because a higher incidence of urinary retention is related to early
      removal of the urinary catheter. However, recently Enhanced Recovery After Surgery presents
      that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal
      surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief.

      Longer retaining time of urethral catheter would induce the urinary tract infection while
      early removal of urethral catheter is considered to develop acute retention of urine due to
      lack of sensation when the bladder is full. Taking the comfort and mobility for faster
      rehabilitation of patients into account, the investigators aim at obtain the optimal removal
      time of urinary catheter after after laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum

      .
