      same as that of the human brain. Of late, these >1000 species and >7000 strains have been
      described as the "brain in our belly" because of the essential role they play in
      physiological and psychological health and disease. The gut-brain axis describes the
      bidirectional communication that exists between the brain and the gut and the
      microbiota-gut-brain axis supports the role of the gut microbiome in this communication
      system. Emotional and routine daily life stress can disrupt digestive function, but
      increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota exert a profound influence on brain
      physiology, psychological responses and ultimately behavior.

      A plethora of literature to date, albeit predominantly preclinical, have demonstrated
      evidence to support the role of the gut microbiome in regulating stress-related changes in
      physiology, behavior and brain function.

      Stress is an individual process to deal with external and internal challenges that ranges
      from behavioral to molecular adaptations. The HPA axis and its release of stress hormones
      plays a major role in stress adaptation.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether a single strain of bacteria
      derived from the species Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37 (Lpc-37), formerly Lactobacillus
      paracasei Lpc-37, can modulate stress experienced by healthy subjects exposed to the TSST
      measured by HPA axis activation markers and self-report questionnaires.
