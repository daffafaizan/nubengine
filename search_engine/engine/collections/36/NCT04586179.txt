      concussion. Despite the growing empirical evidence to suggest that early activity following
      an initial rest period after injury is beneficial to recovery, the effects of modifiable
      exercise prescription factors (e.g., exercise mode, duration, and intensity) is unknown.
      Given that dynamic exertion, which incorporates synchronized head-body movements, may
      contribute greater information processing demands for the functional pathways responsible for
      balance and equilibrium than treadmill running, may be more likely to provoke symptoms during
      exertion. Thus, physically active (>150 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity)
      participants prior to a diagnosed sport-related concussion will be randomly assigned to
      complete either an aerobic or dynamic exercise task at 1 study visit following injury.
