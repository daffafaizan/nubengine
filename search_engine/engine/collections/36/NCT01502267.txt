      allocation. Therefore, the investigators need to develop better strategies for managing
      pre-sensitized patients using desensitization protocol. In this study the investigators will
      used two kinds of medication for the reduction of circulating antibodies (high dose IVIg, B
      cell depleting agents) to highly-sensitized patients who are on the waiting list for a
      deceased donor kidney transplantation. After desensitization, the investigators will check
      that this treatment can increase their chances of receiving a kidney transplant.
