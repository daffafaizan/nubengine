    
      50 patients with anticipated high ovarian response, who are being planned to be
      conventionally treated with low-dose step-up ovulation induction and intrauterine
      insemination will be analysed in this study. At every control day including the start day,
      blood samples taken for blood estradiol (and if required progesterone) measurements will be
      used to measure blood androstenedione and total testosterone levels, as well. Hence, we will
      have defined an early parameter for defining follicular response in the first 5-7 days of
      low-dose step-up ovulation induction. Low-dose step-up ovulation induction will be started at
      50-75Units/day of rhFSH and the dose will be increased at not earlier than the 7th day at an
      increment of +37,5Units/day unless a response is observed ( which is at least a 10mm
      follicle, selected for growth). If more than 3 dominant follicles are selected, the cycle
      will be cancelled. Otherwise, when at least one follicle >16mm is obtained, a 150Microgram
      sc. injection will be administered for ovulation trigger and intrauterine insemination made
      at the 34th-36th hours.
