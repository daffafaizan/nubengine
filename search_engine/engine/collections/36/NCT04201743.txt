    
      It is a prospective, double blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial study. Data will be
      prospectively collected of all injectable acellular amniotic membrane derived allograft knee
      performed at our institute (1 vs 2 mL).

      60 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 in treatment
      arms.

      Each of the patient will be treated with one time injection to the knee. Methods for
      collecting data will be through validated patient-reported outcome tools (KOOS, VAS and WOMAC
      questionnaire) that the patient will complete pre-injection and at specified time intervals
      after injection: 90 days, 180 days and 365 days.
