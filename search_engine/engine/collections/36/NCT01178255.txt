      treatment consists of two main elements: the taking of the case history and the prescription
      of an individually selected homeopathic remedy. Homeopathic medicines are produced through
      sequential, agitated dilutions. A Q-Potency is prepared by grinding the raw material,
      followed by a process of consecutive 1:50.000 agitated dilutions.

      Previous data suggest that individualized homeopathic Q-potencies were non inferior to the
      antidepressant fluoxetine in a sample of patients with moderate to severe major depression.
      The question remains whether individualized homeopathic Q-potencies have a specific
      therapeutical effect in acute depression as this has not yet been investigated.
