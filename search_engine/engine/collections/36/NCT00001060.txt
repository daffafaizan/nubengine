    
      HIV-1 C4-V3 polyvalent peptide vaccine contains amino acid sequences for selected epitopes
      from four of the most common HIV isolates in the United States and Europe, predicted to
      represent about 50-90 percent of the HIV isolates in the United States. It includes epitopes
      that generate potentially salutary immune responses and deletes epitopes that generate immune
      responses which might contribute to further immunopathogenesis.

      Patients are randomized to receive low-dose or high-dose HIV-1 C4-V3 polyvalent peptide
      vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), or IFA alone as control. Injections are
      administered on day 0 and at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. When patients entered at the lower
      vaccine dose (Cohort A) reach week 6, the data is reviewed and the higher dose cohort (Cohort
      B) will begin. When both cohorts reach week 14, data is evaluated and Cohort C begins vaccine
      administrations at a chosen vaccine dose. Within each cohort, eight patients receive vaccine
      plus IFA and two patients receive IFA alone. Patients are followed to week 52; 18 clinic
      visits and four telephone calls are required.
