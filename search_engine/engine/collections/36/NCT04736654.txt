      studies and practice, parameters such as headache frequency, duration and severity are
      frequently used. Physiotherapists treat musculoskeletal dysfunction in various types of
      headache, including migraine, tension headache, and cervicogenic headache. The Headache
      Disability Questionnaire (HDQ), which was developed to measure the quality of life of a
      general population receiving physiotherapy and experiencing headache, evaluates the pain
      intensity, daily life activities, disruptions in work or school life, and the influence of
      the recreational activities of individuals. HDQ consists of 9 items and each item is rated
      between 0 and 10. Increasing the score indicates the seriousness of the impact. The study is
      planned with 45 individuals with gluteal tendinopathy. After questioning the sociodemographic
      characteristics of the individuals, the patients will be asked to fill in HDQ, Migraine
      Disability Assessment Questionnaire, Headache Impact Test-6 and Short Form-36.Test-retest
      will be re-applied to those of the same individuals who can be reached after 1 week. The
      results will be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer package program.
