      supplementation in 130 Caucasian and vitamin D-deficient [serum 25(OH)D ≤55 nM] men and women
      aged 25 years and over with a BMI ≤40 kg/m2. Participants will have abdominal obesity
      (increased waist circumference of at least 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women) and at least
      one factor associated with insulin resistance, namely: (1) serum triglyceride levels of at
      least 1.7 mmol/L or treated dyslipidemia; (2) prediabetes or untreated type 2 diabetes (HbA1c
      >=5.6% or fasting glucose >=5.6 mmol/L or glucose 2h post OGTT >=7.8 mmol/L); (3) first
      degree relative with type 2 diabetes; (4) history of gestational diabetes. Participants will
      be randomized according to sex, BMI (<30 kg/m2 vs. 30 kg/m2 and over) and age (< or >=50
      years old). The primary aim is to compare the effect of daily vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol,
      5000 IU) vs. placebo for 6 mo on insulin sensitivity (M-value by the gold standard method,
      the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp). Secondary aims are to evaluate the effects of vitamin
      D3 vs. placebo on other indices of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, 2-h plasma glucose
      post OGTT, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-IS using fasting glucose and insulin),
      insulin secretion index (HOMA-B using fasting glucose and C-peptide), insulinogenic index
      [(C-peptide at 30 min post OGTT - C-peptide at 0 min)/(glucose at 30 min post OGTT - glucose
      at 0 min)] and disposition index (insulinogenic index x M-value)), the lipid profile, blood
      pressure and anthropometric measurements (weight, waist and hip circumference, bioimpedance
      analysis). Questionnaires on physical activity and sunlight exposure, and a food frequency
      questionnaire will be administered at 0 and 6 mo to adjust for confounding factors. At 0 and
      6 mo, biochemical markers associated with insulin sensitivity will be measured (point 2).

      Part 2: Mechanistic studies comparing, before and after vitamin D3 supplementation, changes
      in serum 25(OH)D with changes in blood markers associated with insulin sensitivity [hs-CRP,
      inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), adiponectin, leptin, total and undercarboxylated
      osteocalcin].
