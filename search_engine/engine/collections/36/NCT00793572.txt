      I. Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after the autograft (=< 50% in historic
      controls).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS) at 2 years after the autograft.

      II. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 200 days and 1 year after allograft.

      III. Incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and chronic extensive
      GVHD.

      IV. Safety of bortezomib maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) MOBILIZATION: Patients undergo PBSC mobilization and
      collection using the preferred regimens at the participating institution.

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS OR SYNGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
      (HSCT): Patients receive high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV) on day -2 followed by an
      autologous or syngeneic HSCT on day 0.

      NON-MYELOABLATIVE ALLOGENEIC HSCT: Beginning 40-180 days after autologous HSCT, patients
      receive 1 of the following regimens:

        1. HLA-IDENTICAL RELATED DONOR: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (PO) twice daily
           (BID) starting on days -3 to 56, and taper until day 180. Patients then undergo
           total-body irradiation (TBI) and non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT on day 0. Four to six
           hours after completion of allogeneic HSCT, patients receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
           PO BID on days 0-27.

        2. HLA-UNRELATED DONOR: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2.
           Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or PO BID starting on days -3 to 100 and taper
           until day 180. Patients then undergo TBI and non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT on day 0.
           Four to six hours after completion of allogeneic HSCT, patients receive MMF PO thrice
           daily (TID) on days 0-27 and then BID on days 27-40 with taper of MMF on days 40-96.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 60-120 days after allogeneic HSCT, patients receive bortezomib
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 4 of 14-day cycles for 9 months or for up to 18 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then annually for up to 5 years.
