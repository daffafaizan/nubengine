      associated with PI3K inhibitors, leading to potentiation of the anti-tumor effects of PI3K
      inhibitors. Copanlisib potently inhibits PI3Kα and PI3Kδ. It has been approved for the
      treatment of relapsed follicular lymphoma, based on ORR of 59% (84 of 142 patients). The CR
      rate in FL was 14%, and the median progression-free survival was 11.2 months. Copanlisib
      demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in marginal zone lymphoma (ORR 70% including 9%
      CR). While these results are clinically meaningful, FL and MZL inevitably develop resistance
      to copanlisib with time, even in those patients who initially respond to the therapy. Novel
      strategies to improve the efficacy of copanlisib in FL and MZL, by improving CR and PFS, may
      transform how to manage these incurable malignancies.
