      formulation of risperidone (risperidone LAI) injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for
      at least 12 months in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. It is an extension of an open
      label study of patients with schizophrenia (RIS-USA-259) switching from treatment with an
      oral antipsychotic medication to long-acting injectable risperidone. Safety evaluations
      include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests
      (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale for assessing muscle tone, gait, and abnormal movements.
      Efficacy assessments include measurements using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for
      Schizophrenia (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S).
      Risperidone (25-50milligrams [mg]) injections, long-acting formulation, every 2 weeks for at
      least 1 year. Dosages may be increased (50 mgs maximum) or decreased at discretion of the
      investigator. Supplementary risperidone tablets (1mg) may be administered.
