      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after receiving an allogeneic bone marrow
      transplant from an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. All participants will receive a
      standard backbone GVHD prophylaxis regimen (tacrolimus and sirolimus) and conditioning
      (cyclophosphamide/TBI). A risk-adapted approach will be used during conditioning to further
      minimize the risk of leukemia relapse based on two factors:

        1. Lymphoid versus myeloid primary disease.

        2. KIR compatibility between donor and host.
