      training and resistance training for 30 sessions. We will examine changes in body
      composition, blood panel (fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides), strength (bench press
      and back squat), aerobic capacity and psychological parameters (hardiness, affect, enjoyment,
      perception and self-regulation). The effects will be measured acutely after the program and
      6-months after the cessation of the program.
