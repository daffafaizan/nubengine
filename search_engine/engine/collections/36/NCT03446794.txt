      general population an risk increase to as much as 10 times in patients on hemodialysis (HD).
      Stroke is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and suffering for patients with
      end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESCKD) on hemodialysis.The risk of bleeding in these
      patients can be roughly 5-fold higher that without it. Current guidelines recommend the use
      of oral anticoagulants (AO) to prevent stroke or systemic thromboembolism in high-risk
      patients with AF. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) reduces the risk of bleeding while
      allows thromboembolic stroke prevention.
