           stopped at the time they enter the study. We plan on monitoring a marker in the
           participants blood called CA 15-3 (or CA 27.29) every 4 weeks to help us make a decision
           of when to re-start treatment with letrozole (femara). This marker is known to rise when
           disease is progressing and drop when the disease is responding to treatment. We will be
           stopping and re-starting therapy based on the changes of CA 15-3 in the participants
           blood.

        -  In addition to bloodwork, the following tests and procedures will be performed on a
           monthly basis: medical history; physical examination and performance status.

        -  Every 8 weeks the following will be performed: Tumor assessment by physical exam (if
           possible); Chest x-ray or CT scan or chest; CT scans of abdomen and pelvis; and bone
           scan.
