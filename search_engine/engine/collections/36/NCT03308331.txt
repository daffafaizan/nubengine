      States. The alarmingly high smoking rates and unsatisfactory performance of standard smoking
      cessation efforts in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) interfere with the overall progress
      in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Our understanding of nicotine addiction mechanisms in
      PLWH, and how they are related to and interact with HIV-1 neuropathology, is limited and thus
      hindering the development of more effective, targeted treatments. The study will directly
      address neurological complication of this HIV-associated comorbidity at the brain circuitry
      level using state-of-the-art imaging tools and methods.
