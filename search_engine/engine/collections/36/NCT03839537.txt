      Paris, members of three Trade Unions. It will be conducted over a period of two years in warm
      and cold season. The research will begin with an inclusion clinical examination. It consists
      on determining the overall health status of the participants by administering a standardized
      questionnaire and performing spirometry test, prick test and FENO measurement. The exposure
      assessment will be based on continuous measurement of UFP, BC, carbon monoxide (CO) and NO2,
      by portable devices during a working day (Â± 11 hours). On the same day, two spirometry tests
      and two measurements of exhaled carbon monoxide will be performed at the beginning and at the
      end of the shift, using handheld devices. Multivariate analysis will provide spatio-temporal
      distributions of individual exposures and their determinants. Generalized Estimating
      Equations (GEE) multivariate models will be used to determine the relation between exposure
      (UFP, BC) and respiratory symptoms, ventilation performances, adjusting for potential
      confounding/modifying factors.
