      The inflammatory secretory profile of nasal airway epithelial cells (NEC) cultured from
      asthmatics with concomitant allergic rhinitis (AR) will differ from that of NEC from patients
      with asthma alone. Treatment (in vitro and in vivo) with montelukast may have differential
      modulating effects in these two patient groups.

      For the primary objective of this proposal we will use nasal AEC from asthmatics with or
      without concomitant AR as to ascertain differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
      production between these two groups and determine whether in vitro treatment with montelukast
      has a differential modulating effect on NEC secretion. In the secondary pilot study any
      modulating effects by montelukast on AEC secretion in vitro will be correlated with any in
      vivo response to montelukast withdrawal. This sub study will provide pilot data indicating
      whether in vivo response to montelukast can be predicted from in vitro effects on NEC.
