        -  Describe the physical and functional well-being of head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors
           undergoing physical therapy during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Describe clinical measure of range of motion for the cervical spine and shoulder of HNC
           survivors undergoing physical therapy during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine the feasibility of an early physical therapy intervention (prior to and during
           adjuvant treatment) targeting the physical needs of HNC survivors.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo physical therapy weekly for 10 weeks beginning 1 week prior to
      initiating adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and continuing until 2 weeks after the completion of
      adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients undergo range of motion assessment and complete a Cancer Survivorship Survey (CSS)
      at baseline and in weeks 4, 8, 9, and 10 of physical therapy.
