      included in the study is three successive nights. Visual analysis of polysomnographic
      recordings taken from the second and third nights will be performed independently by two
      independent, blinded experts. According to the sleep architecture description derived from
      the Nightly application, polysomnographic and actigraphy studies will be assessed using the
      intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, version "Two-Way Random". Parameters of the sleep
      architecture will be the average total length of the individual sleep phases (provided with
      standard deviations and coefficients of variability defined as the quotient of standard
      deviation and mean).
