      TEDS group received muscle electrical stimulation for 30 min/session/day throughout the
      intervention. Weaning parameters and respiratory muscle strength (Pimax, Pemax) were
      assessed. The hospitalization outcome, including weaning rate and length of stay, was
      followed up until discharge.
