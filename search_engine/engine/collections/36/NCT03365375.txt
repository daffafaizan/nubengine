      associated with anxiety on mental health (longitudinal GAD-7 scores, quality of life (PROMIS
      Global Short Form), and ED resource utilization (return ED visits). The working hypothesis is
      that early referral to MBSR will help patients better regulate their thoughts, feelings, and
      bodily sensations related to their anxiety symptoms and have a significant positive effect on
      patient-centered outcomes such as mental health, quality of life as well as decreased ED
      resource utilization. To this end the investigators will randomize patients identified via a
      two step process (HEART Score <4 and GAD-7 score > 9 to usual care referrals versus MBSR. The
      investigators will then follow these participants for outcomes including change in GAD-7
      scores, PROMIS Global Short Form, ED utilization among other outcomes at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, and 1 year.
