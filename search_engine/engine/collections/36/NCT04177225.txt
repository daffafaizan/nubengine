    
      This investigator initiated, prospective, observational, single-center study is designed to
      assess whether dynamic monitors of cardiac function, such as stroke volume variation (SVV),
      that have been shown to predict volume responsiveness differ in clinical utility between
      patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Determine the threshold for the predictive response of SVV with respect to increasing
           cardiac output for patients with and without diastolic dysfunction.

        -  Compare the trans thoracic ultrasound assessment of left ventricular diastolic function
           before and after the induction of general anesthesia.
