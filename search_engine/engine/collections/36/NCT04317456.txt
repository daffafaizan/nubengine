        -  to collect population based data on children born in Upper Austria with a significant
           hearing impairment and to describe this population in detail regarding audiological,
           etiological (including geno- and phenotypical correlations), neurodevelopmentally,
           psychological, psychiatrically and linguistically with a special interest is in children
           with additional needs

        -  collecting child development outcomes (language, communication, psychosocial) and family
           outcomes (quality of life, stress)

        -  to investigate possible effects of the Newborn Hearing Screening, early intervention and
           specific parent behaviors targeted in early intervention

        -  collecting developmental trajectories of the total sample and subgroups of the sample
           (particularly audiological, etiological and cognitive). This data should help identify
           red flags

        -  investigating predictors of developmental trajectories regarding the child and the
           intervention (e.g. time and

      Hypothesis:

        -  It is expected that .2% of the total population of preschool children have a
           sensorineural hearing loss (bilateral and unilateral)

        -  a significantly higher prevalence of intellectual disabilities (up to 20%), visual
           impairment, autism spectrum disorder and motor impairment

        -  it is expected that for at least 50% of the children, there is a genetic explanation for
           the hearing impairment and 30% out of them are expected to be syndromal

        -  it is expected that there is a higher proportion of children with psycho-social problems
           (especially peer problems and behavioral-/emotional problems)

        -  Due to a change in the environmental conditions over the past two decades, better child
           outcomes, compared to previous ones are expected. Nevertheless around 30-50% of the
           children are expected to not be reaching their nonverbal cognitive potential.

        -  expected intervention effects, particularly for provision with and use of hearing
           technology family-child interaction self-efficacy and wellbeing of the family regulated
