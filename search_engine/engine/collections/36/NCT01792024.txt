      I. To evaluate the oncologic efficacy of laster interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with
      primary endpoint of undetectable cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy of
      treatment zone at 3 months following treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate oncologic efficacy at 12 months following treatment based on biopsy of the
      treatment zone.

      II. To determine treatment-related safety and toxicity. III. To longitudinally assess urinary
      and sexual function in the year following treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MR-guided LITT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 12 months.
