    
      This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. At least 13, but no more than
      16, subjects who met all eligibility criteria were to receive a prime vaccination with BCG
      (1-8 x 105 colony forming units [CFU] intradermally [ID]) at Study Day -84. Thirteen of the
      BCG-vaccinated subjects who completed all protocol-specified procedures and continued to meet
      eligibility criteria were to be enrolled and randomized on Study Day 0 in a 10:3 ratio to
      receive study vaccine (either AERAS-402 3 x 1010 virus particles [vp] intramuscularly [IM] or
      placebo IM) at Study Days 0 and 28, based on time of completion of screening. Eleven subjects
      were randomized (N=9 AERAS-402; N=2 placebo) and analyzed. Enrollment was stopped when 11 of
      the planned 13 subjects had been randomized, as it was felt that this number of subjects was
      sufficient to address the objectives of the study.
