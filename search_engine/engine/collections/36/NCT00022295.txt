        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of phenoxodiol in patients with refractory solid
           tumors.

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive phenoxodiol IV continuously over days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of phenoxodiol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
