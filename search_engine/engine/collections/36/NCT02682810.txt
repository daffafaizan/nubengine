      and 12 weeks of life will be randomized in this trial of point-of-care virologic testing to
      improve outcomes of HIV-infected children in Zambia. There is a standard of care (SOC) or
      control arm and an intervention arm known as the Alere arm. In both study arms, early infant
      diagnosis (EID) will be provided at 6 weeks of life. Infants randomized to the SOC arm will
      receive EID through the existing prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) program,
      with samples sent to an off-site laboratory for DNA PCR testing. Infants randomized to the
      intervention arm will receive POC diagnostic Alere Q qualitative test (along with a dried
      blood spot (DBS) drawn for confirmatory DNA PCR).

      HIV-infected infants will be followed for 12 months. The acceptability of point-of-care
      testing for EID will also be determined through the use of cross-sectional surveys of
      clinicians, laboratory personnel, and parents/guardians.

      The feasibility will be assessed by a time-in-motion (TIM) and value stream mapping (VSM)
      analyses will also be conducted to compare the Alere Q to two additional testing
      technologies.
