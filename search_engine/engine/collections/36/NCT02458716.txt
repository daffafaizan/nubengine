    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of cytoreductive prostatectomy (to remove as much
      of the primary cancer as possible) in men with newly diagnosed clinical T1-3N1M0 or
      T1-3N0M1a-b prostate cancer (herein, collectively referred to as metastatic prostate cancer).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir and castration resistance following
      cytoreductive prostatectomy and subsequent standard systemic therapy, androgen deprivation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo RARP or conventional open RRP. Immediately following surgery, patients
      receive standard systemic androgen deprivation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for 3 years.
