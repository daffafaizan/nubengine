      has been improvement in median survival among women with metastatic disease over the last two
      decades, mainly due to availability of more effective agents. Women are now living longer
      with metastatic disease and are on therapy for longer periods of time. Therefore, it is
      increasingly important for effective therapies to be associated with less toxicity so that
      women can enjoy a better overall quality of life. Similar to breast cancer, goals of
      treatment of various GI malignancies (including metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic
      gastric and esophageal cancers, and unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer and
      cholangiocarcinoma) are largely comfort care and it is important to minimize toxicity from
      therapy during the treatment for metastatic disease.

      Capecitabine is a unique chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons. It is the only oral
      chemotherapy drug available to treat breast and GI malignancies, making it convenient for
      patients. In addition, whereas all other cytotoxic chemotherapy agents can be administered
      for only a few months at a time because of development of cumulative toxicities, capecitabine
      can be continued for many months to years if toxicities can be managed. However the optimal
      dosing schedule of capecitabine is not known.

      This is the basis for the proposed randomized phase II trial, to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of capecitabine 1500 milligrams (mg) twice a day (BID), 7 days on and 7 days off
      schedule to capecitabine 1250 milligrams/meters squared (mg/m2) BID, 14 days on and 7 days
      off) or 1000 mg/m2 BID, 14 days on and 7 days off, in women with metastatic breast cancer or
      patients with advanced/metastatic GI cancer.
