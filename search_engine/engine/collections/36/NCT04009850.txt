      and smoking behavior after switching from menthol cigarettes and investigating whether
      outcomes differ between subjects based on use of menthol vs. tobacco flavored e-cigarettes.
      Within-person changes in cigarette satisfaction and smoking behavior will be assessed during
      the last week of the non-menthol cigarette smoking period compared to the menthol cigarette
      smoking period. Preference and use of both the cigarette and e-cigarette products during the
      switching period will be compared and the extent to which menthol flavored (vs. tobacco)
      e-cigarettes are preferred among menthol smokers will be evaluated.
