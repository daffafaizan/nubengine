    
      The Myocardial Infarction Register Saarland (MIR-SL), is intended to collect data about the
      treatment of patients suffering from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It aims to
      provide current data on the implementation of guidelines for both, the interventional and
      adjuvant drug therapy of STEMI in daily clinical practice in the Saarland.

      In order to obtain representative data for the Saarland, preferably all consecutive patients
      should be documented comprehensively in the University Hospital of the Saarland, the
      non-university hospitals with cardiac catheterization laboratory as well as in hospitals
      without cardiac catheterization laboratory .

      MIR-SL is attended by all 22 hospitals in Saarland, that treat patients with acute STEMI. A
      follow-up will be carried out after three months, 12 months and five years.
