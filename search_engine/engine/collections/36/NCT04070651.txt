    
      A total of 240 cancer patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, referred to treatment with ICI
      will be enrolled in this prospective observational study. Patients will be assessed prior to
      initiation of treatment (baseline) and every third subsequent week, corresponding to each
      treatment cycle over a period of 18 weeks. Assessments will include questionnaires, sleep
      diaries, actigraphy, and blood and saliva samples to examine sleep, fatigue, psychological
      and physical symptoms, the sleep-wake-cycle, inflammation, and cortisol. Additionally, the
      patients will be asked to complete a reduced questionnaire every week within the 18 weeks
      period, to address weekly fluctuations in sleep quality, fatigue, and mood. Treatment
      response is assessed after 9 and 18 weeks.

      Aims:

        1. To explore possible associations between sleep and the clinical response to treatment
           with ICI.

        2. To investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbance in patients with NSCLC during
           treatment with ICI.

        3. To prospectively assess changes in sleep parameters over the course of treatment.

        4. To examine associations between sleep parameters and fatigue, depression, anxiety, and
           inflammation.

        5. To explore possible associations between sleep, fatigue, depression, inflammatory
           responses and the clinical response to treatment with ICIs.

      Hypotheses:

      Patients with high levels of sleep disturbance (insomnia severity) will experience 1) poorer
      clinical response to ICI, 2) more depressive symptoms, 3) higher levels of fatigue, 4) poorer
      overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 5) higher levels of inflammation.
