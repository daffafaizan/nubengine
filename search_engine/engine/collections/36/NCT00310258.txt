    
      The study has two primary and seven secondary aims.

      Primary Aims:

        -  1. Develop a family-based girl-specific intervention (GSI) to prevent substance use.

        -  2. Test the efficacy of GSI.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  3. Test GSI to improve mediating factors of girls' mother-daughter affective quality,
           coping, refusal skills, mood management, conflict resolution, problem solving,
           self-efficacy, body esteem, normative beliefs, social supports, and mother-daughter
           communication.

        -  4. Examine the effects of mediating factors on girls' substance use behavior.

        -  5. Test GSI to improve mothers' use of family rituals, rules against substance use,
           child management, mother-daughter affective quality, and communication with their
           daughters.

        -  6. Examine the effects of mother' outcomes on their daughters' substance use behavior.

        -  7. Test the effects of dose on participants' outcomes.

        -  8. Determine if GSI has differential outcomes related to ethnic-racial group profile.

           9. Quantify the costs of intervention development and delivery.
