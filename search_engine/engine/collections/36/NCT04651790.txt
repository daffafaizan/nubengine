      schedules of an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. This study will
      be performed in 8 centers. Two schedules will be compared: 0,14 and 0,28-day, at a 1:1 rate.
      40% of participants will be 60 or more years-old. Follow-up of safety and efficacy will be
      assessed for 12 months after administering the first dose. The collection of the data will be
      through an electronic Case Report Form. Immunogenicity will be studied in a subgroup of
      participants. Initially, 2,300 volunteers will be recruited.
