    
      Balance Exercise Circuit (BEC) program, includes exercise that specifically challenge sensory
      inputs from mechanoreceptors as well as from the visual and vestibular systems. It is
      composed of 13 stations, involving static and dynamic balance exercises, including tandem
      walking, forward-backward stepping, wide-stance gait, functional reach, heel lift, toe press,
      balance on unstable surfaces, and standing on one leg. The BEC lasts 50 min, two times per
      week for a total of 12 weeks. Progression of exercises occurred every 3 weeks and was closely
      supervised to ensure safety. Each BEC session comprised of warm-up and stretching (10 min),
      exercise circuit (30 min), and cool-down (10 min).
