    
      This is a prospective, interventional, observer-blinded, block-randomised, phase II trial,
      comparing different dose levels of MV-CHIK in three different formulations (lyophilised,
      liquid frozen and liquid SPS) to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of this
      novel Chikungunya vaccine. Placebo (physiological saline solution) will be applied to blind
      two different treatment schedules, evaluating single shot versus double shot treatment.

      After the screening procedures, 60 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-55 years will
      be randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups (A, B, C, D or E). Subjects will be
      observed for safety and immunogenicity for 56 days during the treatment period, starting with
      the first MV-CHIK vaccination at Visit 1 (day 0) up to Visit 5 (day 56). After this treatment
      period subjects will return to site at Visit 6 (after 6 months) and at Visit 7 (after 1 year)
      for collection of serum to follow up the durability of specific antibodies against
      Chikungunya.

      The investigator and site personnel assessing AEs, all subjects, as well as the sponsor's
      representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be blinded to which
      vaccine was administered. Only the site personnel performing randomisation, preparation and
      administration of IMP will be unblinded.
