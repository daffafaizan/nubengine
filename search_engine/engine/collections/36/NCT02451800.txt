      program on increasing compliance and improving weight loss while participating in the Sanford
      Profile program. The 6-month study includes a 3-month randomized, controlled trial using
      in-person yoga, a yoga DVD, and a stretching DVD (control group) followed by a 3-month
      post-intervention follow-up. The study will be conducted to test the hypotheses that both
      in-person yoga classes and DVD yoga participation will result in 1) greater compliance with
      the Profile program, 2) greater weight loss during the yoga intervention, and 3) greater
      weight loss 3 months following completion of the intervention compared to the stretching
      intervention. Compliance will be investigated using percent of days that dietary intake was
      entered online and percent of days that online records indicate that the program was
      followed. Changes in weight will be measured using data transmitted from electronic scales
      that are provided as part of the Profile program. In order to assess weight change after
      participation in the intervention we will ask participants to continue weighing themselves
      daily for 3 months following completion of the intervention regardless of whether they
      completed the Profile program or not. Participants will complete online questionnaires on
      behavioral and appetite perceptions related to eating, food intake, stress levels, compliance
      with diet recommendations given to them by Sanford Profile, and perceived benefits of their
      intervention. We will use these measures to determine the effect of yoga participation on
      eating behaviors and stress levels.
