      their doctors. Vaginal dryness can dramatically affect women's lifestyle, in particular their
      sexual activity and relationship with their partner. Since we believe that living with
      uncomfortable vaginal dryness does not have to be part of aging, we intend to conduct this
      study to evaluate a lubricating vaginal ring developed to ease symptoms caused by vaginal
      dryness.

      The objectives of this study are to obtain preliminary data on the ability of the VR101
      intravaginal ring to relieve the symptoms of vaginal dryness in peri- and post-menopausal
      women. Effectiveness will be measured in two ways:

        1. Vaginal health index scoring assessed by a member of the research team

        2. Participant answers to questionnaires

      Study objectives will assess the following:

        1. Successful placement of VR101 intravaginal ring into the vagina

        2. Ease of insertion and removal

        3. Comfort and fit

        4. Lubrication/ moisturization of the vagina
