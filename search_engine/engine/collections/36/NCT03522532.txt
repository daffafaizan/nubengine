      phosphate cement (ZnPhC), zinc polycarboxylate cement (ZnPoC), glass ionomer cement (GIC) and
      composites, Tetric EvoCeram (TEC) and Beautifil (BF).

      The study included 88 dental outpatients. Oxidative stress parameters, including
      malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and total superoxide dismutase (tSOD) activity were
      measured in GCF, before (day 0) and after treatment (7th and 30th day).

      Antagonistically positioned healthy teeth were used as a control.
