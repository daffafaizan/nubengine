      (grade 10 and 11) in Shanghai Pu Dong district were recruited in our study. All students were
      randomly assigned into universal study group or universal control group by class level. In
      those two groups, high risk of suicidal students were identified by screening. A universal
      suicide intervention was conducted in the universal study group; an indicated suicide
      intervention was conducted in the indicated study group. All students in universal study
      group and universal control group completed the self-administered questionnaire before and 6
      months after the end of universal intervention. High risk of suicidal students in the
      indicated study group and indicated control group completed another self-administered
      questionnaire before, 6 months and 18 months after the end of the indicated intervention.
