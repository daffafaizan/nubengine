    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax that can be safely combined with
      carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) prior to autologous stem cell
      transplant which will the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

      II. Determine the safety and efficacy of venetoclax as measured by overall response rate
      (ORR) at day 100, 12-month survival and freedom from relapse (FFR-12).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Long term effects (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) of addition
      of venetoclax to BEAM.

      II. Correlation of response and survival with expression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 as
      measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.

      Participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -10 to -1, carmustine
      intravenously (IV) on day -6, etoposide IV twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2, cytarabine IV
      BID on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Participants then undergo hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 2 years.
