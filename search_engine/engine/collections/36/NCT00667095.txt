      instillation of a solution of Botox/DMSO as a novel method for treating women with overactive
      bladder (OAB) and secondary urinary incontinence who have failed oral pharmacologic therapy.
      This study will test the broad hypothesis that administration of Botox/DMSO instillations
      into the bladder with a urethral catheter can significantly improve symptoms and quality of
      life in patients with OAB when compared to DMSO installations alone. Explicitly, we
      hypothesize that scores on the validated Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire
      of women with OAB who receive Botox/DMSO instillation will be much improved at three-month
      follow-up compared to similar women receiving DMSO instillation alone. Our long-term goal is
      to offer women with detrusor hyperreflexia or OAB a less invasive alternative to surgery and
      an alternative to anticholinergic by mouth medications. In support of this effort, we are
      proposing a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to be conducted in
      the Department of Urology at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.

      Note: The study was terminated early in July of 2011 due to an extended medical absence of
      the Principal Investigator.
