      Arm B: IV PCIA + ultrasound guided Erector spinae block (ESPB, Single shot of 30ml of 0.5%
      solution of Naropin [Ropivacaine]) Arm C: IV PCIA + multilevel intra-thoracic intercostal
      nerve block (ICB, Single shot of 30ml of 0.5% solution of Naropin [Ropivacaine]) PCIA pumps
      for all study cohorts will be programmed according to our institution's standard protocol
      (Dipidolor [Piritramide] bolus: 2mg, interval: 7 min, max 4h dose: 30mg). The erector spinae
      block will be placed preoperatively, the intercostal block will be placed at the beginning of
      the procedure. All patients will receive standard postoperative care. The patients will be
      blinded for the study arm.

      The primary endpoint of this study is postoperative pain and will be recorded by using the
      numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score. Pain scores will be measured by the investigator at
      rest and during coughing. Opioid consumption will be monitored and registered for.
