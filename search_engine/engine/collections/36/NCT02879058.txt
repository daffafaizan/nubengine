      relief, the investigators hypothesize that use of contact ultrasonography at the time of
      laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy will enable improved identification and extraction of
      uterine fibroids which will, in turn, lead to a greater improvement in quality of life among
      those women who receive intraoperative ultrasound compared to those who do not. In this
      blinded randomized controlled trial, the investigators will augment traditional laparoscopic
      and robotic myomectomy with intraoperative ultrasound in half the symptomatic patients
      enrolled in the study. The other half will be randomized to undergo laparoscopic or robotic
      myomectomy without use of intra-operative ultrasound. Both groups will complete Uterine
      Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS- QOL) questionnaires before and after surgery (6
      months post procedure) to determine whether use of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography has a
      positive impact on patients' quality of life.
