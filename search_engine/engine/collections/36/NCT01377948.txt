      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Aggressive children and adolescents who merit
      admission to inpatient psychiatric hospitals for treatment typically display dramatic
      problems with self-regulation that interfere with global adaptive functioning. The goal of
      this study is to teach self-regulation techniques by combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      with a biofeedback video game in effort to motivate patients to learn and practice these
      coping skills, which will translate to decreased feelings of anger and aggression while
      hospitalized.
