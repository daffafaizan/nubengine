    
      A sample size of 100 patients (50 per group) was calculated based on 20% reduction in
      morphine consumption with 0.05% significance and a power of 0.8.

      After ethical committee approval, eligible patients scheduled to have a fast-track total hip
      arthroplasty are screened during preoperative evaluation clinic. Informed written consent
      will be obtained from all patients during pre-anesthesia visit the day before surgery (J-1).
      Consenting patients will be randomized the day of surgery (J0) to undergo QLB with
      ropivacaine ("ropivacaine group") or normal saline ("saline group").

      Before general anesthesia, all patients will have a needle-insertion posterior to the
      quadratus lumborum muscle avec injection of either ropivacaine in the "ropivacaine group" or
      normal saline in the "saline group".

      After general anesthesia induction, dexamethasone and ketamine will be given to all patients.
