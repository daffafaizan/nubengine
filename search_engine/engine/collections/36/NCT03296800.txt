      took bexagliflozin; on Days 3 and 4 subjects took probenecid, bid; on Day 5 subjects took one

      bid.

      Study 2: Bexagliflozin/rifampin Sixteen healthy subjects were dosed with bexagliflozin, qd
      and/or 600 mg of rifampin daily in sequential order as follows: on Day 1 subjects took one
      bexagliflozin tablet; on Days 3 to 5, subjects took rifampin once daily; on Day 6 subjects
      took one bexagliflozin tablet and rifampin; and on Day 7 subjects took rifampin.

      Study 3: Bexagliflozin/verapamil Sixteen healthy subjects were dosed with bexagliflozin,
      and/or verapamil tablets, 120 mg in sequential order as follows: on Day 1 subjects took one
