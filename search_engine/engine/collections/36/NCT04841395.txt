      questioned and diagnosed as lifelong PE according to the definition of International Society
      of sexual medicine (ISSM) by an experienced urologist. Since erctile dysfunction (ED) may
      accompany PE, the presence of ED symptoms was evaluated by the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and those with IIEF-5 score <22 were excluded from the study.
      Age- and sex-matched control cases without lifelong PE were selected randomly among cases
      attending the hospital for a checkup procedure. A total of 114 patients with PE and 103
      control subjects with similar sociodemographic characteristics were included in the study. A
      detailed medical and sexual history was taken, which included self-estimated intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT), by an experienced sexual therapist. Moreover, Arabic Index
      of Premature Ejaculation (AIPE), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) were administered to all participants.
