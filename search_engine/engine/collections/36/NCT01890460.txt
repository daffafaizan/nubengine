      obtained at two time points on each qualified patient. The first time point will be in the
      operating room before the initial incision is made. The second time point involves placement
      of a small, hand-held modified ultrasound probe directly on the patient's diseased liver
      during the liver transplant surgery. The probe used in this study is the SuperCurvedâ„¢SC6-1,
      capable of a band width of 1-6MHz with 192 elements.
