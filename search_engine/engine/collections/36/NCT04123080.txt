      mm) with long stalk length (>10 mm) in the distal colon. After finding target lesions by
      standard colonoscopy, conventional upper endoscopy with rubber band (endoscopic band
      ligation, EBL) was applied to squeeze the mid-portion of the stalk to form an omega shape,
      which had the dual effect of ligation and compression of feeding blood vessels. After
      strangulation of the stalk, snare polypectomy was performed at the stalk site just above the
      ligation. The investigators evaluated several parameters, including completeness of
      resection, procedure time, and complications, including immediate postpolypectomy bleeding,
      delayed postpolypectomy bleeding, and perforation.
