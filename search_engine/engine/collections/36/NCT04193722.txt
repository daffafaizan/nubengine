      physical functioning and QoL in breast cancer patients with late radiation toxicity.

      Study design: Randomized controlled trial, nested within the prospective UMBRELLA breast
      cancer cohort according to the TWiC's design. UMBRELLA is a prospective cohort study
      including all breast cancer patients visiting the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht
      department of Radiotherapy. In total 120 patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1.

      Study population: Breast cancer patients participating in the UMBRELLA cohort who have given
      informed consent to be invited for future research (e.g. cmRCT's), and who have reported
      symptoms of late radiation toxicity.

      Intervention: Eligible patients will be referred to the HBO center for a standard HBO
      treatment. HBOT consists of 30-40 treatment sessions (1 session per day during 5 days per
      week). During the hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) sessions patients breath in 100% oxygen during 4
      times 20 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is patient reported
      breast/chest wall pain. Secondary endpoints are: physical functioning, QoL cosmetic outcome,
      physician reported pain and radiation toxicity (according to CTCAE criteria version 4.03,
      tissue oxygenation previous to HBOT and after HBOT and side-effects of HBOT.
