      infection, emerging data show that morbidity and mortality are driven by disseminated
      intravascular coagulopathy. Data from Wuhan showed that COVID-19-associated coagulopathy
      (CAC) was present in 71% of deaths vs. 0.4% of survivors. Untreated CAC leads to
      microangiopathic thromboses, causing multiple systems organ failure and consuming enormous
      healthcare resources. Identifying strategies to prevent CAC are therefore crucial to reducing
      COVID-19 hospitalization rates.

      The high prevalence of CAC in severely ill COVID-19 patients led the American Society of
      Hematology to recommend that all hospitalized COVID-19 patients be prophylactically
      anticoagulated. However, there are no data and no recommendations regarding outpatient
      prevention of CAC.

      The pathogenesis of CAC is unknown. Given the demographic, geographic, pathologic, and
      treatment overlap between severe COVID-19 and vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), we hypothesize
      that VDI is a major underlying contributor to CAC. Preliminary data from critically ill
      COVID-19 patients in New Orleans support this hypothesis. Furthermore, mouse models of VDI
      developed aggravated multiorgan thrombus formation after lipopolysaccharide injection; this
      phenotype parallels CAC.

      Given these lines of evidence, the purpose of the proposed multi-center, prospective,
      randomized controlled trial is to test the hypothesis that low-risk, early treatment with
      aspirin and vitamin D in COVID-19 (The LEAD COVID-19 Trial) can mitigate the prothrombotic
      state and reduce hospitalization rates.
