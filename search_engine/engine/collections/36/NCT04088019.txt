      happens because it is still can't be explained if the uveitis from the patients was caused by
      mycobacterium tuberculosis or not which leads to doubtfulness for Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment
      (ATT). This study aims to help to provide evidence on whether ATT usage for Idiopathic
      Uveitis IGRA Positive would bring beneficial impact for the patients. This study will try to
      analyze the data from clinical improvements, Type 1 Interferon changes, and transcriptomics
      analysis from the patients.
