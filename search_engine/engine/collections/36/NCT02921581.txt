      University Hospital is 1.5 Gy twice daily during 4 weeks with a total dose of 60 Gy.

      In this study the radiotherapy is planned using 18F-FDG PET/CT making one experimental
      "dose-painting by contours" SIB (simultaneous integrated boost) plan with a maximum point
      dose of 75 Gy. The participants will be given 65 Gy and 70 Gy minimum doses to two GTVs
      inside the conventional GTV (60 Gy). GTV_65Gy and GTV_70Gy are determined from the SUV values
      from the 18F-FDG PET/CT according to the formula proposed by the Ghent group (Van der
      Straeten et al, R&O -06). It is expected to keep the level of normal tissue side-effects
      within or slightly above the level of conventional radiotherapy (i.e. maximum dose of 60 Gy).
      In addition to the routine follow-up, the participants will be examined with 18F-FDG PET/CT 6
      months after inclusion (4 1/2 months after end of radiotherapy) and HRQL measurements.
