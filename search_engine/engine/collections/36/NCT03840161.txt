      calibration period for the non-invasive device component by means of multiple parallel
      measurements with the invasive and the noninvasive device component. This will be done by the
      participants at home. Thereafter, the participants will come to the study site and will
      ingest a standardized meal (V2). Blood will be drawn for assessment of HbA1c and biochemical
      safety parameters. During the next 3 hours, 11 fingersticks will be made to obtain capillary
      blood samples for comparator readings with the two CoG components and with a laboratory
      reference method (YSI gucose analyzer). The patients will now continue to use the devices at
      home for three months, but are not allowed to use any CoG result for treatment decisions. In
      an interim visit after 6 weeks (V3), blood will be drawrn for HbA1c and biochemical safety
      parameters and three comparison measurements will be made with the CoG device components and
      the laboratory reference method. At the final visit after 12 weeks (V4), the procedures of
      the first meal test visit (V2) will be repeated, which conludes that study. In addition, the
      participants will be asked to complete a device satisfaction questionnaire at V2, V3, and V4.
