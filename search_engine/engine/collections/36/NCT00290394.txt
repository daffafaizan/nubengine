      published recently, which demonstrated a 5/4 mm Hg reduction in ambulatory blood pressure in
      18 nondiabetic obese subjects after 12 weeks' treatment. Another study in 18 hypertensive
      subjects with diabetes mellitus showed an 18/12 mm Hg decline in office blood pressure after
      8 weeks of treatment.
