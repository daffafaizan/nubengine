      paclitaxel designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal
      or fallopian tube cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a
      post-treatment follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for
      approximately 12 months. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and
      an expansion phase.

      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 5 study centers in
      the United States (U.S)..
