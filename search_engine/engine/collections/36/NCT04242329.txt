    
      A Phase II Randomized Controlled Open-Label Parallel Group Interventional Multicenter Trial.
      Patients with metastatic melanoma, stratified for stage M1a or M1b/M1c, that have received
      first-line treatment with PD-1 inhibitors for a minimum of 9 months resulting in either
      partial response or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1 will be eligible. Patients will be
      screened for operability based on CT-scans examined by a multidisciplinary team, with the
      criteria that complete (R0) resection of all metastases should be possible. If the
      multidisciplinary team find that this would be possible, patients will be included and
      randomized 1:1 to either surgery with continued PD1-inhibition or current standard of care
      with continued PD1-inhibition only. At progression, treatment will be according to the
      treating medical oncologist. Active follow-up will be performed for 12 months.
