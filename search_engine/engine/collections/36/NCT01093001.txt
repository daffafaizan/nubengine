      similar leads higher on the septum where there will be less redundancy or pressure on the
      septal leaflet will change the extent and severity of tricuspid regurgitation following
      pacemaker/ICD implantation. Data has shown that right ventricular pacing can give rise to
      right ventricular dysfunction, which in turn may give rise to enlargement of the right
      ventricle and cause tricuspid regurgitation.

      The study will answer the clinically relevant questions on device lead-related tricuspid
      regurgitation.

      This study is a single center prospective study at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester. The study will
      enroll 200 eligible subjects and follow for 12 months. 50 pacemaker subjects will be
      randomized to right ventricular apex pacing 50 pacemaker subjects will be randomized to right
      ventricular septum pacing 50 pacemaker subjects will be randomized to left ventricular pacing
      via coronary sinus 50 ICD subjects will be enrolled with right ventricular apex pacing.

      A baseline heart failure assessment and Two Dimensional echocardiography will be performed
      before device implant.

      A Two Dimensional echo will be performed 24 hours after device implant. If significance TR is
      present a Three Dimensional echo will be performed. At 12 months post implant heart failure
      assessment and Two Dimensional echo will be performed.
