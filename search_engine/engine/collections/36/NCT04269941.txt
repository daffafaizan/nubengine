      the mitotic index and tumor necrosis. Imatinib therapy has revolutionized the treatment of
      advanced GIST.

      They have been the subject of much controversy in terms of their histogenesis,
      classification, treatment and prognosis. GISTs are histologically similar to smooth muscle
      and nerve tumors such as leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas or schwannomas. Currently they are well
      characterized with the recent discovery of the C-KIT gene mutation and the expression by
      tumor cells of the C-KIT protein.

      Moreover, the discovery of this receptor is at the origin of the introduction of a "targeted
      therapy": an anti-tyrosine kinase molecule having revolutionized the therapeutic management
      of these tumors. However, the standard curative treatment of GIST remains complete surgical
      resection with negative margin from the tumor.
