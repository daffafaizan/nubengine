    
      Open-label, non-randomized, multicentre phase 2 study with a safety run-in evaluating
      efficacy and safety of bimiralisib (PQR309) in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bimiralisib in patients with advanced solid tumors was
      defined as 80 mg once daily given continuously (q.d. schedule) in a previous phase 1 study.
      The safety run-in of this study will follow a modified 3 + 3 design to evaluate the safety of
      60 and 80 mg bimiralisib in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma administered p.o.
      once daily during a DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) period of 28 days.

      In the safety run-in, three patients will be treated at 60 mg bimiralisib for 28 days.
      Enrollment and treatment of all three patients may occur simultaneously as 80 mg bimiralisib
      p.o. qd was established as the MTD in solid tumors. Unless a DLT is observed in any of the
      three patients during the first 28 days of treatment, the investigators and the sponsor will
      decide to escalate the dose to 80 mg. Intermittent dosing schedules may be evaluated if,
      based on the overall evaluation of all the clinical and PK (pharmacokinetic) data from this
      and other studies with bimiralisib, data emerge during step 1 of the phase 2 expansion in
      this study, indicating that daily dosing of bimiralisib is not adequately tolerated or
      inefficacious.
