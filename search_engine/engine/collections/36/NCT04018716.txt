    
      Aim of this clinical study is to compare the clinical outcomes of mineral trioxide aggregate
      (MTA) cavity lining with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) regarding the maintenance of pulp
      vitality in the treatment of deep caries lesions over 4- years.

      Materials and Methods: A hundred permanent premolar and molars with deep caries lesions
      without pulp involvement (aged between 18 and 30 years) in 73 patients were randomly divided
      into the following groups: calcium hydroxide cement (Ca(OH)2) (Dycal, Dentsply/Caulk,
      Dentsply International Inc, Milford, DE, USA) group and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)
      (Dentsplay, Tulsa Dental, Johnson city, USA) group. Final restoration with a resin-based
      composite (Gradia Direct Posterior, GC, Tokyo, Japan) in a single session was performed. The
      following-up period was 6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 48-months. Two calibrated examiners performed
      the clinical examination of the pulpal symptoms. The data will be analyzed with Pearson
      chi-square, Fisher exact and logrank statistics tests (p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis will be conducted to reveal the survival rate.
