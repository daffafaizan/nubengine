    
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational
      drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid
      malignancies. The Phase 1b will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 is a
      dose-finding evaluation of the sequential administration of cirmtuzumab monotherapy followed
      by cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) or previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) subjects who
      have not received prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy. Up to 48 subjects
      will be enrolled in Part 1 to determine the recommended dosing regimen (RDR). In Part 2, up
      to 18 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and pharmacology of the
      cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination given at the RDR determined in Part 1 of the study. In
      the Phase 2 (Part 3) portion of the study, approximately 90 subjects with CLL/SLL who may
      have received minimal prior BTK inhibitor therapy will be randomized to either Arm 1
      (cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib) at the RDR or Arm 2 (ibrutinib alone) to evaluate the clinical
      activity and safety of the two arms.
