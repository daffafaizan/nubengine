      students' attitudes, perceived barriers, subjective norms, perceived skills, self-efficacy,
      intentions to provide cessation treatment, and tobacco cessation knowledge between those
      students receiving a lecture along with practice sessions using standardized patients and
      those students receiving only a lecture. Dental students will be invited to complete two
      questionnaires. The control group of dental students will complete the first questionnaire
      before the lecture and the second questionnaire after the lecture. The experimental group of
      dental students will complete the first questionnaire before the lecture and the second
      questionnaire after the lecture and the practice and debriefing sessions. Subjects will
      include 120 first year dental students in an introductory course to clinical dentistry. The
      cessation training is a required activity in the course. Students are divided into small
      groups according to their bench or lab numbers. These numbers are assigned to the student
      based on the alphabetical order of their name. The eligibility criteria is: 1) Must be a
      first year dental student in Introduction to Clinical Dentistry 1 at the University of
      Louisville, and 2) Must be willing to volunteer to complete pre- and post-questionnaires
      about the cessation treatment educational program. The exclusion criteria is: Subject is not
