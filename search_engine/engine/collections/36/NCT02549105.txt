      lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream with local anesthetic (lidocaine) infiltration on
      post-cesarean section pain.

      Research Question:

      Is lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream application effective as compared to local anesthetic
      (lidocaine) infiltration on post-caesarean section pain?

      Research Hypothesis:

      Lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream application is effective in post_caesarean section pain as
      compared to local anesthetic (lidocaine) infiltration.

      Clinical Application :

      Topical Lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream could be applied frequent times postoperatively,
      unlike infiltration with local anesthetic.
