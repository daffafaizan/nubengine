      areas of gait and freezing. A promising technique is repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) that, so far, has produced small effects on bradykinesia in drug free
      patients in limited trials. The relevant rTMS parameters for the therapeutic effect are
      unknown. Use of very high rTMS frequency (50 Hz, maximum output of the modern TMS machines,
      super rapid TMS [srTMS] with circular coil design [vs. a figure eight shape]) may further
      improve the therapeutic effect in people who have PD. The 50 Hz srTMS frequency proposed here
      is in a range that exceeds the currently established guidelines since such high frequencies
      have not been investigated. We will look for acute srTMS effects of the primary motor cortex
      (M1) stimulation (60% to 100% motor threshold [MT] intensity, 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds train
      duration). A multi-channel electromyography (EMG) record will be visually controlled for
      signs of increasing time-locked EMG activity, EMG correlates of the spread of excitation
      through M1, or an increase of M1 excitability to establish the safe superrapid transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (srTMS) limit. The electroencephalogram (EEG) Record, Folstein
      Mini-Mental Exam, CFL and FAS Letter Production Test (words beginning with letters 'C', 'F'
      etc), Serial Reaction Time, Grooved Pegboard Test, and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) will
      be done before and after the srTMS session to control possible srTMS side effects.
