      readmissions. Peak blood pressure usually occurs 3-6 days postpartum, and is typically
      unaccompanied by warning symptoms. Although there is a clear need for effective and reliable
      blood pressure surveillance after delivery, there are significant obstacles to in-person
      visits in the immediate postpartum period, including sleep deprivation, newborn care, and
      transportation needs. These barriers have proven real as we observed only 30-50% attendance
      to office blood pressure visits following delivery. This proposal will investigate whether
      text-based communication between patients and providers is an effective alternative method
      for monitoring postpartum hypertension in at risk women.

      Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with access to a cell phone with unlimited
      text message capabilities will be randomized to either office visit blood pressure checks
      after discharge or receive a blood pressure cuff and text in blood pressures for two weeks
      postpartum using a standardized, HIPAA compliant, physician derived automated platform.
