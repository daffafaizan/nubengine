      this study. Pathological specimens will be stained with an immunohistochemical marker named
      as PDL-1. "programmed cell death (PD-1)" is a protein containing 288 aminoacids and expressed
      on T cells. It was shown on apoptotic cells in earlier times, but then it has been understood
      that its physiologic role is not cell death. The upregulation of PD-1 is a result of the
      activation of T cells and it is necessary for the termination of immune response. PD-L1 is a
      ligand for PD-1. The immunotherapies in which antibodies against these PD-1 and its ligands
      (especially PDL-1) provides significant improvements in many cancers such as melanoma.
      Evidence about the role of these ligands in endometriosis will be an important step in its
      management.
