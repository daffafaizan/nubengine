      epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), in reducing the frequency of postoperative blood
      transfusion following primary total hip arthroplasty. In our institution, up to 40% of
      patients with a preoperative of 13.5 g/dl or less undergoing total hip arthroplasty will
      require a blood transfusion. Fibrinolytic drugs such as EACA and tranexamic acid (TA) have
      been shown to decrease blood loss during surgery and decrease the likelihood of blood
      transfusion during postoperative hospitalization.. Both drugs decrease the body's ability to
      break down a blood clot, thus pushing the balance of blood clot formation and breakdown
      towards clot formation. This mechanism can decrease the amount of blood loss during and after
      a surgical procedure. The haemostatic effect of EACA has been investigated in multiple
      studies with the majority showing a positive effect on postoperative hemoglobin levels and
      decreased blood transfusion rates. Though several studies exist revealing the effective and
      safe use of perioperative TA, a similar drug to EACA, there is a paucity of information on
      the use of EACA in total joint arthroplasty.
