      inguinal hernia repair since March 2020. Under-18 hernias, complicated hernias, recurrent
      hernias, and those with laparoscopic hernia repair will be excluded. Initially, the distance
      between the pubic tubercle and the medial edge of the deep inguinal ring will be measured.
      Next, the distance between the inner edge of the inguinal ligament and the upper level of the
      internal oblique aponeurosis will be measured at the Hesselbach triangle. Hesselbach triangle
      area will be calculated. The diameter of the superficial and deep inguinal ring and their
      spina iliaca anterior superior (SIAS) distance will be measured. The contribution of these
      measures to the determination of the ideal mesh size will be analyzed.
