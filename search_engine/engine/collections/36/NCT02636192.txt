      large administrative claims databases in the US. Participants diagnosed with T2DM and
      initiated on SGLT2i or other AHAs (metformin, sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinediones (TZDs),
      DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), GLP-1 agonists, insulin, and other AHAs) between April 1, 2013 and
      the end of claims data availability will be included in the study and will be estimated for
      incidence rates of DKA in the different AHA new-user groups.
