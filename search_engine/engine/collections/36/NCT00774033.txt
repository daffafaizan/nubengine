    
      Comparing the impact in terms of cicatrisation duration and costs between 2 treatments of
      deep 2nd and 3rd degree burns.

      Determine if the costs of the innovating treatment RECELL®, a priori more expensive, are
      counterbalanced by a shorter cicatrisation duration and an improved evolution versus a
      conventional strategy.

      Give an information about efficiency improvement of RECELL® with additional costs
