      I. To test, in a group randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of this program versus
      education only in reducing the incidence of lymphedema.

      II. To compare the severity of lymphedema, in terms of changes in arm circumference at the
      site of greatest difference as a continuous variable between the two interventions.

      III. To assess the agreement between patients' self-report of swelling (mild, moderate, and
      severe) and the extent of circumferential measurement difference between the treated side and
      the contralateral arm at the site of greatest difference.

      IV. To compare the health-related quality of life (Factional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Breast [FACT-B]+4 score) between the two interventions.

      V. To characterize adherence to lymphedema prevention exercises, lymphedema knowledge, and
      range of motion.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Six weeks after surgery, patients receive a brief initial post-operative care session
      describing lymphedema risk and prevention through oral instruction and written materials.
      Patients complete physical assessments and questionnaires at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 18
      months. Patients are also contacted by telephone at 9 and 15 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive lymphedema education and complete physical assessments and
      questionnaires as in Arm I. Patients also complete a personalized physical therapy
      intervention, receive a refrigerator magnet, and a 15-minute video that reinforces
      information and exercises.
