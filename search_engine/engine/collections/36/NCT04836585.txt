      patients with depression and/or anxiety will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the eMBC
      condition or a control condition. The study will be stratified by diagnosis (major depressive
      disorder vs generalized anxiety disorder).

      80 patient participants will be recruited from the Reproductive Life Stages (RLS) Program at
      Women's College Hospital. The active treatment phase of the study is 12 weeks.

      Outcomes will be measured online and by phone at 4-, 8-, and 12- weeks post-randomization.
      Following the completion of the study, some participants will be asked to participate in
      follow-up interviews. RLS psychiatrists whose patients participated in the study will
      participate in a focus group.
