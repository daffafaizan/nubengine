      no later than [5] days of the occurrence or receipt of notification from an outside source;
      the IRB can make changes to the consent form as a result of adverse events. Any such event
      will be reported to the IRB on the "Adverse Event Report." [See attachment.] 9. "Debriefing"
      Debriefing is not required because there is no deception of subjects involved or there are no
      alternative treatments or procedures used in a "blind" fashion.

      10. "Intervention" Participants in this study are children who present with a diagnosis of
      upper extremity weakness or involvement secondary to various reasons. These children receive
      occupational, physical, and/or speech services at St Mary's Hospital for Children. The
      children participating in this program will be receiving their occupational therapy session
      with the use of the ArmeoÂ®Spring Pediatric. They will also continue to receive their regular
      physical and speech therapy session. Once the program is completed, they will continue to
      receive their regular occupation therapy sessions.

      11. "Confidentiality" Data sheets will be coded with a number to represent each child. The
      numeric data obtained regarding timed trials will be entered into a computer which is
      password-protected at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, NY. Consent forms with the
      child's name and parental signatures and video tape or photographic images recorded during
      data collection will be stored in accordance with St. Mary's Hospital for Children patient
      privacy policy.
