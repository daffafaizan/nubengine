    
      This study is designed in two parts: one part for dose escalation, one part for dose
      expansion.The dose escalation part will be followed by expansion part at the MTD(s)/RP2D(s)

      This study will utilize an adaptative Bayesian Logistic Regression model to guide dose
      escalation and estimate the MTD(s) based on the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) relationship(s)
      for S65487 in the indications.
