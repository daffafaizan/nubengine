      is not pain free and control of post-laparoscopy pain remains a major concern. The exact
      cause of such pain remains uncertain, and yet, diaphragmatic irritation and peritoneal
      stretching associated with gas insufflation may be responsible for shoulder and diffuse
      abdominal pain.

      additionally poor pain control could limit the activity of children following laparoscopic
      surgery.
