      of oral antihyperglycemic medication [OAM]) may have been initiated during the planned
      treatment period if the participant discontinued study drug or met prespecified thresholds
      for severe, persistent hyperglycemia. Efficacy data, as well as data for hypoglycemic
      episodes from participants who permanently discontinued study treatment but switched to
      another diabetes medication and remained in the study, were censored from the point of
      initiating new treatment onwards.
