    
      Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant form of human activated protein C, is the first
      therapeutic intervention shown to reduce all-cause mortality in severe sepsis. In the Phase 3
      study (F1K-MC-EVAD; PROWESS), 1690 patients were randomly assigned to receive a 96-hour
      intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated) 24 micrograms/kg/h or placebo (850
      patients and 840 patients, respectively). Overall, administration of drotrecogin alfa
      (activated) yielded a clinically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality: 24.7%
      of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients died versus 30.8% of placebo patients (19.4%
      relative risk reduction; p=0.005; Bernard et al. 2001). The only safety concern noted in the
      Phase 3 trial was an increased risk of serious bleeding among drotrecogin alfa (activated)
      patients (3.5% versus 2.0% of placebo patients). The difference between the two treatment
      groups in the number of patients who experienced a serious bleeding event was due to the
      greater number of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients who experienced a serious bleeding
      event that was related to a procedure (for example, bleeding that resulted from the placement
      of a catheter or nephrostomy tube). The number of patients who experienced spontaneous
      serious bleeding events was similar between the two treatment groups.

      The Regulatory authorities have approved the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in severe
      sepsis patients with a high level of disease severity and risk of death. Thus, the regulatory
      authorities have requested a study evaluating drotrecogin alfa (activated) in a specific
      subpopulation of patients with severe sepsis and at lower risk of death.
