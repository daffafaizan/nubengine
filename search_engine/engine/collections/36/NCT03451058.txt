      controls, individuals with mild TBI, and individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI.

      In general, participants will provide demographic information, medical history, and details
      of their head injury. Participants will also complete a brief neuropsychological assessment
      to obtain an index of cognitive ability, along with the Fusion Test with eye tracking and
      linked EEG. MRI data may also be obtained.
