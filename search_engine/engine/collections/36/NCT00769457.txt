    
      The objective of the study is to establish whether the use of event-triggered HF-disease
      management through Medtronic's OptiVol® fluid status monitoring with an automatically
      generated wireless CareAlert® notification of the clinician via the Medtronic CareLink®
      Network can reduce cardiovascular related hospitalizations and the number of deaths in a
      subject population with HF and ICD / CRT-D treatment as compared to standard clinical
      assessment. As a measure for the reduction of hospitalizations and deaths the rate of all
      cause deaths or cardiovascular related hospitalizations will be determined.
