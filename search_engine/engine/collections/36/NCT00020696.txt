        -  Determine the antitumor activity of tirapazamine and cisplatin in patients with
           persistent or recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal
           carcinoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by cisplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-65 patients will be accrued for this study.
