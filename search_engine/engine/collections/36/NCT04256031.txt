      scores they got from the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, all students will be
      divided into two groups as Excessive Smartphone Use Group and Non-excessive Smartphone Use
      Group, both consisting of 53 participants. Participants whose scores are higher than 30 will
      be included to the Excessive Smartphone Use Group, and whose scores are 30 or less will be
      included to the Non-excessive Smartphone Use Group. In the assessment of pain level, the
      Visual Analogue Scale will be used. Functional levels of the neck and shoulders will be
      evaluated with the Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale and the Shoulder Disability
      Questionnaire. World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Short Form will be
      utilized to assess the quality of life. Postural analyzes of the participants will be
      fulfilled with the New York Posture Rating Chart. All scores will be evaluated by comparing
      between the two groups.
