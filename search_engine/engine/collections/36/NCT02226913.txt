      the onset of anesthesia, and improved success rate of anesthesia. Others reported buffering
      of local anesthetics cannot reduce pain of injection, hasten the onset of anesthesia, and
      improve success rate of anesthesia. There are no studies evaluating a sodium
      bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine formulation for IAN block for teeth with irreversible
      pulpitis.
