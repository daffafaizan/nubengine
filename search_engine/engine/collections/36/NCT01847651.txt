      with cirrhosis will be studied with psychometric tests, clinical brain magnetic resonance
      imaging(MRI),including functional MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and muscle
      MRI of leg muscle before (time 0)during (4weeks)and after LOLA or placebo treatment at 12
      weeks. Samples will also be taken for ex vivo MRS of blood and urine to identify potential
      biomarkers. Histological analysis and MRS would also be performed on the muscle tissue at the
      same time points.

      Hypotheses Primary objective

      1) Improvement in mental state by paper and pencil based Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy
      Score (PHES) and Cogstate Research test (computer based cognitive research assessment tool)

      Secondary objectives

        1. Brain volume reduction due to reduction in brain swelling measured by MRI and
           improvement in the chemical structure of the brain due to (cerebral osmolytes)measured
           by in vivo MR Spectroscopy (MRS)scanning of the brain.

        2. Improvement in brain function

        3. Improvement in muscle function (muscle metabolome normalisation) and increased muscle
           size (fat free mass), measured in vivo by MRI scanning and by in vitro mass spectroscopy
           and NMR spectroscopy and histological analysis of muscle samples.

        4. Improvement in the chemical profile of key chemicals in the blood and urine, measured
           with in vitro NMR spectroscopy
