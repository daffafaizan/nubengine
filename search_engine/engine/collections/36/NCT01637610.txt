      term pregnancies.10-12 No study to date has specifically addressed and been powered to detect
      the efficacy of AmniSure in pregnancies between 16+0 and 36+6 weeks. The objective of the
      proposed research is to evaluate the usefulness of AmniSure PAMG-1 rapid immunoassay in the
      evaluation of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) compared to standard detection
      of PPROM with a speculum examination for combination of pooling, nitrazine and ferning.
