    
      The R-DHAP (Rituximab, Dexamethasone, Cytarabine, and Cisplatin) schedule includes high-dose
      cytarabine every 12 hours and requires careful monitoring of renal toxicity because of
      cisplatin. These conditions limit the use of this protocol in an outpatient setting.

      The S phase of lymphoma cells is longer than 12 hours, then cytarabine can be used daily
      without reduction of the antineoplastic effect. Carboplatin does not have remarkable renal
      toxicity so is not necessary to monitor blood chemistry or IV fluids during its
      administration.

      The study hypothesis is that modifications to the original R-DHAP protocol, using cytarabine
      on a daily basis and the substitution of cisplatin by carboplatin can preserve the efficacy,
      reducing the incidence of renal events. The investigators hypothesize that those
      modifications can make the schedule more suitable for an outpatient administration in
      relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.

      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, the overall response and the incidence of adverse events will
      be evaluated.

      In order to achieve the purpose of this trial, 130 participants will be included.
