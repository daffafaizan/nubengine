      have infiltration by mononuclear cells and lymphocytes. Irrespective of the entity of tumor
      infiltration by mononuclear cells, expression of immune regulatory checkpoints such as PD-1
      and its ligand B7-H1 (or PD-L1) negatively affect the results of treatments. These data
      suggest that a subset of patients have an ongoing immune response within the tumor
      micro-environment, and that PD-L1 expression is an adaptive method of tumor resistance to
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which in turn are needed for response to chemotherapy.
      Overall, the data suggests a role for immune regulation of response to chemotherapy, and
      support the concept that blockade of immune check-points may favor the achievement of durable
      response by immune mechanisms themselves, and in combination with classical chemotherapy.

      MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) is a human monoclonal antibody containing an engineered Fc-domain to
      optimize efficacy and safety that targets PD-L1 and blocks binding of its receptors,
      including PD-1 and B7.1. Based on these considerations, we plan to conduct a study of the
      combination of abraxane and carboplatin with or without PDL1-directed antibody in women with
      locally advanced breast cancer suitable for neoadjuvant therapy with the aim to improve
      event-free survival
