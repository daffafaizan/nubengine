      adult women classified as overweight were considered for the study. After assessing the
      eligibility criteria, women were instructed to have stable weight, eating habits and levels
      of physical activity constant to those found during the baseline, as well as receiving an
      individual diet plan one week before starting the dietary intervention. Before the start of
      the intervention, the 40 women were allocated to four groups of 10 each, and three groups
      started the individual diet plan for weight maintenance with a focus on vegetables and
      legumes with antioxidant and folate-rich action, and were also invited to consume foods
      fortified with folic acid and foods naturally rich in folate to achieve a usual folate intake
      close to the RAS (≥400 µg), this amount was for intervention group 1 and 2, group 3 received
      a lower amount (approximately half of the consumption of groups 1 and 2) and group 4 was the
      control group.

      Still referring to the intervention, the participants of the three groups received advice
      from a nutritionist, responsible for this research and all the printed material free of
      charge, including pre-packaged foods, and also delivered hazelnut oil capsules, used as a
      source of monounsaturated fat. Counseling sessions with the nutritionist were offered daily
      at the homes during the entire period of the intervention, except for group 4, where the
      monitoring was weekly, to maintain eating habits.

      After the end of the 8 weeks of the intervention, the third stage of the study began, which
      consisted of anthropometric assessment, analysis of the dietary intake of the 24-hour food
      record and blood collection for biochemical tests and DNA methylation.
