      improve postoperative pain scores and reduce opioid requirements. In addition, IV
      acetaminophen has several pharmacokinetic properties that may be beneficial when compared to
      acetaminophen. IV acetaminophen has been shown to achieve a more rapid and higher maximum
      plasma concentration as well as higher cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Comparative
      effectiveness trials of IV vs PO administration have not conclusively demonstrated improved
      clinical outcomes despite the proposed pharmacokinetic benefits. More research needs to be
      conducted to determine possible clinical advantages.
