      inhibition (E-I) in the healthy brain and in neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions, such
      as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - where this balance is disrupted. A study by Ajram et al.
      (2017) has shown an E-I shifted towards more GABA in individuals with ASD, and not in
      controls, after a single dose of the anti-glutamatergic and pro-GABAergic drug Riluzole.
      Moreover, brain connectivity patterns in ASD patients where shifted towards the ones observed
      in the control group. However, it was unclear whether this changes could be driven by GABA
      receptors, thus more specific probes may help to clarify the mechanism underlying the E-I
      coordination in ASD. Therefore, this study will use neuroimaging and electrophysiology to
      investigate the brain E-I coordination in ASD compared to control participants when the
      system is responding to a single dose of the specific GABA-A (AZD7325) receptor agonist. 50
      adult individuals with ASD and 50 neurotypical adults (25 males and 25 females per group)
      will be invited to participate. Each participant will receive a single dose of the drug (10mg
      or 20mg AZD7325) or matched placebo. Brain activity and neurochemistry will be investigated
      using magnetic resonance imaging. Further data will be collected through questionnaires,
      behavioural tasks, blood samples, and sensory tasks using electroencephalography and retinal
      imaging.
