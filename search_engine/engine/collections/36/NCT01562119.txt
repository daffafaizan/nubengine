      functional outcomes, nevertheless, there had been few reports about the long term results of
      the morphological, histological and functional changes after placement. The present study was
      to retrospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of the cograft acellular dermal matrix
      (ADM) with autologous thin split-thickness skin for coverage of functional regional wounds in
      burned patients.
