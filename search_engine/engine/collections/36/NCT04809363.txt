    
      The tool being tested in this study is called CDPATH™. CDPATH™ is being used to provide a
      graphical representation of an individual participant's risk of developing a CD-related
      complication within three years, leveraging known participant risk factors based on clinical,
      serologic and genetic variables to help people categorize risk who have CD. This study will
      gather data on the use of the tool in real-world settings to inform practical use of CDPATH™.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 patients. Participants and health care providers
      (HCPs) will be surveyed to understand their satisfaction with the CDPATH™ process and with
      their treatment choice.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the HCP's
      clinic, and data will be collected approximately every six months up to 3 years, based on the
      timing of routine follow-up appointments for assessment.
