      undergoing two different reconstructions technique (with simple and double bundle) in terms
      of tendon graft osteointegration, functionality and return to sports.

      This is a single-center prospective randomized clinical trial with 112 patients diagnosed
      with anterior cruciate ligament rupture randomly allocated in four groups: single bundle with
      autologous bioabsorbable implant; single bundle with intrafix implant; double bundle with
      autologous bioabsorbable implant; double bundle with intrafix implant.

      Primary outcome is graft ligamentization assessed in MRI images at 4-6 months
