      tolerability of PTK787/ZK222584 in patients with metastatic or advanced pancreatic cancer who
      failed first line gemcitabine-based therapy. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the 6-month survival rate, time to progression, and tolerability of the regimen in
      pancreatic cancer patients treated with PTK787/ZK222584 as second-line therapy.
