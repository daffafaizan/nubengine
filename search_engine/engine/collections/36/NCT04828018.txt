        1. To gain an understanding of the current Royal Hospital Chelsea (RHC) model of care by:

             1. Evidencing the influence the model of care has on In-Pensioner health outcomes

             2. Understanding the influence the model of care has on wider social care provision

             3. Reflecting on the contribution the environment has on the In-Pensioner experience,
                their health outcomes, and quality of life

        2. To inform future RHC care provision by:

             1. Mapping current services, future need and sustainability of the model

             2. Projecting findings to inform the growth of existing services for future
                generations of ageing veterans

      The findings will inform RHC strategic direction as it continues to deliver care provision to
      current and future generations of veteran, identify the value of RHC interventions, and
      explore any development of service provision in the form of potential outreach care. Further,
      the findings will look to inform wider social care provision which may contribute to national
      health and social care policy.

      The findings of the study may be applicable to the wider care provision within similar
      residential care establishments as they will seek to present service delivery findings from
      both a staff (care provider) and resident (care recipient) perspective and evidence best
      practice.

      The findings may contribute to national health and social care policy (UK).

      Key staff and Royal Hospital Chelsea 'In-Pensioner' residents will be interviewed for this
      study. New In-Pensioner residents will be invited to complete two Quality of Life
      Questionnaires (one on arrival and one six months later).
