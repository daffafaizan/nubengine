      osteoarthritis. There is evidence that exercise is responsible for muscular strengthening and
      better flexibility, improved global function as well as better performance in activities of
      daily living (ADL).

      There are two modes of US, continuous and pulsed. Continuous US (CUS) generates thermal
      effects by stimulating the process of tissue regeneration, changing cell membrane
      permeability and increasing intracellular calcium, while pulsed US (PUS) mainly produces
      non-thermal effects to increase tissue metabolism, enhance fibrous tissue extensibility and
      elevate pain threshold
