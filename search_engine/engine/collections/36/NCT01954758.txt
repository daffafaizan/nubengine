      pregnancy (OP) rates, miscarriages, deliveries (LB) and obstetrical, delivery and neonatal
      outcomes among women undergoing IVF treatment with own oocytes, at first site appointment (up
      to 3 previous implantation failures in other sites) and blastocyst stage (day 5 or 6).
      Patients are allocated through computer-generated randomization into one of the three groups:
      Fresh embryo transfer (ET), Frozen embryo transfer (FET) or personalized embryo transfer
      (pET) after identification of the personalized window of implantation using the endometrial
      receptivity analysis (ERA) test, all of them following the usual clinical practice in a
      same-cycle embryo transfer.

      A total of 546 infertile women under 38 years old undergoing her first IVF/ICSI cycle with
      elective blastocyst transfer are randomized in this prospective, multicenter, open label and
      controlled trial.
