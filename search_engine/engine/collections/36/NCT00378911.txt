      I. Assess the activity of sunitinib malate, in terms of rate of progression-free survival for
      â‰¥ 6 months and objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent
      leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who have received 1 or 2 prior cytotoxic therapies.

      II. Determine the frequency and severity of adverse events.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
