      stress, anxiety and burnout in mental health professionals. It is a 2-sequence, 2-period,
      2-treatment crossover design with sequences AB and BA. Treatment A consists of a block of
      five sessions of bodyfulness exercises, whereas experimental treatment B consists of a block
      of five sessions of sitting mindfulness meditation exercises. In the sixth session, the
      exercise blocks will be exchanged. Each group will be composed of half the sample, with a
      initial sample of 130. The principal hypothesis is that both interventions will decrease
      stress and anxiety levels and professional burnout, with body-centered exercises being at
      least as effective as mindfulness sitting meditations. Secondarily, the personality type will
      be analyzed as a moderating variable in those variables in which the interventions will be
      effective. Third, a qualitative study will be conducted in order to analyze the perceptions
      of change and experiences in Cuban mental health professionals who are beginner meditators.
      This study will allow to understand the differential effectiveness of bodyfulness and
      midfulness and what types of personality may benefit most from different types of meditation
      interventions. Also, it will hell to get a deeper understanding of mindfulness practice in a
      new cultural context (i.e., Cuba). A previous pilot study will be conduct to investigate the
      acceptability and effectiveness of a culturally-adapted mindfulness-based intervention in
      Cuba.
