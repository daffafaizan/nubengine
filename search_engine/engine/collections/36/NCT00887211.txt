      stents with Firebird drug-eluting stents from MicroPort Medical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of ProStent drug-eluting stent in treating coronary artery
      lesions. Appropriate patients judged by inclusion and exclusion standards will be preformed
      stent implantation, and after that all patients will be clinically followed up at 30, 90,
      180, 270 and 365 days. Especially, standard quantity coronary angiography (QCA) will be
      conducted at 270 days(Â±30days) through which the main therapeutic indicator of late luminal
      loss (LLL) is obtained so as to evaluate the efficacy of tested stents. Major adverse cardiac
      events (MACEs) found in following-up period as key indicators to evaluate the safety of
      stents. The arrangement, conclusion and statistical analysis of trial data including
      clinography and angiography will be fulfilled by independent Data Management Center(DMC) and
      radiography core laboratory.
