      I. To determine whether patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and
      fallopian tube cancers when treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel can
      tolerate at least 4 cycles of therapy regardless of delay or dose modification.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel in
      patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers, as
      measured by progression-free survival.

      II. To evaluate the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers when treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly
      paclitaxel.

      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the predictive value of a set of angiogenic genes whose expression correlates
      with progression-free survival of patients with epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or
      fallopian tube cancer treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel.

      II. To assess the relationship among cytokines/chemokines, angiogenesis factors, novel
      targets of interest and clinical outcome including tumor response and progression-free
      survival in patients treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 and
      carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Beginning course 2, participants also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 1.5 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
