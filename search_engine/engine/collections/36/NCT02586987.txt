    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple
      combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral
      selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours
      refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. The safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of Selumetinib (AZD6244
      Hyd-sulfate) in Combination with MEDI4736 and Selumetinib in Combination with MEDI4736 and
      Tremelimumab will be investigated. Once safety and tolerability have been established for the
      relevant dose, expansion cohorts will commence in order to further evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and provide a preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of action and anti-tumour
      activity of the drug combination. Mandatory paired biopsy expansion cohorts will be
      tumour-type specific. Expansion cohorts will open independently for double and triple
      combination treatments.
