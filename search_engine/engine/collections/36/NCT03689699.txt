      with surgery or radiation, a significant number of men recur either with a rising PSA only
      (biochemical recurrence (BCR)) or clear metastatic disease on imaging. Although androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is a frequently used and effective treatment for prostate cancer,
      it is associated with significant side effects including fatigue, hot flashes, decreased
      libido and bone loss. Therefore, new approaches to decrease the time on ADT are crucial to
      improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer.

      Once initiated, ADT can be given either continuously or intermittently. However, even with an
      intermittent approach the ADT-free interval typically decreases with each cycle and most men
      eventually develop castration resistance. Therefore new treatment strategies are needed to
      improve disease control while minimizing ADT exposure for men with early prostate cancer.
