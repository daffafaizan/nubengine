      with cataract surgery and MIOL Implantation at least 3 months ago. They will be invited for
      only one follow up visit to measure the postoperative refraction with different
      Autorefractor-Keratometers, a Manual Refractometer, the test device "iTrace" and with
      determination of the subjective refraction for distance and near with the appropriate
      corrections at the Department of Ophthalmology in Neubrandenburg, Germany.
