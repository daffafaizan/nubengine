      injectable anesthetic around the incision and systemic medications (i.e. non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen and break-through doses of opiates). As the amount of
      opiates used can be significant, we have to be aware of their inherent risks. Opiates have an
      excellent pain control profile, working peripherally by decreasing the amount of
      neurotransmitters released from neurons involving noxious stimuli, and also in their central
      processing. Some of the more common adverse reactions are reparatory depression, sedation,
      confusion, delirium, nausea, pruritis, constipation, hypotension and bradycardia. Often it is
      these resulting side effects that extend the length of in hospital rehabilitation, and
      decrease a patient's overall satisfaction.

      Thus we propose the use of a relatively new regional anesthetic technique be employed to
      further decrease the need for opiates in our prostatectomy patients' post-op course, while
      adequately controlling their pain.
