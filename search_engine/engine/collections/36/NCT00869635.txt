      stent has been known for palliation of jaundice and improving survival. But most of
      therapeutic effects were expected to delay bile duct obstruction rather than to decrease the
      tumor. Recently orally available chemotherapeutic agent, S-1 was reported as effective in
      patients with bile duct adenocarcinoma. The investigators' aims of study evaluate the
      combined effect of photodynamic therapy and S-1.
