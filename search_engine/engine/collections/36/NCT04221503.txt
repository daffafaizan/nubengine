      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand break repair capacity. Tumors that are deficient in
      the homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathway are highly sensitive to blockade of
      the repair of single strand DNA breaks via poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. This
      is a study of niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, in combination with tumor-treating fields for
      recurrent glioblastoma. We hypothesize that tumor-treating fields will induce a state of
      "BRCAness" in the glioma tumor cells, thus sensitizing them to PARP inhibition and resulting
      in tumor cell death.
