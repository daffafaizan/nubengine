      (PID), which affect T cells development, function or both. These inherited conditions can
      only be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These procedures
      have a high risk of morbidity and mortality such a graft versus host disease (GVHD),
      rejection of the graft and serious infections, especially in this population of children with
      PID. GVHD is more frequent and severe if the donor is not an identical sibling and/or
      presents an HLA-mismatch. GVHD requires high immunosuppression as prevention and treatment,
      and therefore impedes immunity against infections.

      In vitro and animal models suggest that GVHD is mediated by naïve T cells. The aim of this
      study is to decrease the rate and severity of GVHD after selective depletion of naïve CD45RA+
      T cells from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell grafts in patients with CIDs with high risk
      of severe GVHD, and to preserve immunity against pathogens in a population with high
      vulnerability to infections.

      The project aims is, first, to show improvement of rejection-free and GVH-free survival 12
      months post-transplant, and secondly, to show the decrease of viral infection, and assess
      immune reconstitution kinetic and quality and specific antiviral responses, after a
      engraftment with naïve cell depleted allograft.
