    
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity,
      immunogenicity and efficacy of a 10^6 cfu dose of an oral live-attenuated S. sonnei vaccine
      candidate, WRSs2, in up to 120 healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18-49, inclusive.
      This is a two-phase study, an outpatient WRSs2 vaccination phase and an inpatient S. sonnei
      53G challenge phase. There are three groups in each phase. Outpatient WRSs2 phase: Group 1
      will receive two doses of WRSs2 vaccine; Group 2 will receive one dose of the placebo and one
      dose of WRSs2 vaccine; Group 3 will receive two doses of the placebo. All three groups in an
      inpatient S. sonnei 53G challenge phase will receive one dose of S. sonnei 53G challenge. The
      study will be conducted in up to 3 Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU) sites. The study
      duration is approximately 24 months with subject participation duration approximately 8
      months. The Primary Objective of this study is to estimate vaccine efficacy of 1 and 2 doses
      of WRSs2 in preventing shigellosis, following challenge with S. sonnei strain 53G. The
      Secondary Objectives are to:1) Evaluate the safety of 1 and 2 doses of WRSs2; 2) Evaluate
      immune responses following vaccination (immunogenicity) with 1 and 2 doses of WRSs2 and after
      challenge with S. sonnei strain 53G by serum anti-LPS and anti-Invaplex IgG and IgA by ELISA;
      3) Determine fecal shedding of S. sonnei after WRSs2 vaccination and 53G challenge by
      qualitative stool culture.
