      This study aims at evaluating the ease of use of the new calorimeter for the measurement of
      energy expenditure (EE) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. EE in ICU patients is highly
      variable depending on the severity of the disease and treatments. Clinicians need to measure
      EE by indirect calorimetry (IC) to optimize nutritional support for the better clinical
      outcome. However, indirect calorimeters available on the market have insufficient accuracy
      for clinical and research use. Difficulties of handling and interpretation of results often
      limit IC in ICU patients. An accurate, easy-to-use calorimeter has been developed to meet
      these needs.

      The Study Device:

      The new calorimeter (Q-NRG, COSMED) is capable of IC measurements in mechanically ventilated
      patients without warm-up and limited calibration. The disposable in-line pneumotach flow
      meter and direct sampling of respiratory gas from the ventilator circuit enables the accurate
      measurement of oxygen consumption volume (VO2) and CO2 production volume (VCO2) to derive the
      energy expenditure. The software interface to manage the device and the collected data
      provides easy-to-use, user-friendly interface. Q-NRG does not bear the European Commission
      Conformity Mark (CE Mark), but has been approved by the Swiss authority for medical devices
      (Swissmedic) for use in this study. Q-NRG will be used in the way it is intended to be used
      as described in the instruction manual.

      Currently used indirect calorimeters at each study center will be used as the comparator.
