      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of glutamine supplementation vs placebo, in terms of prevention of
           paclitaxel-induced myalgia and/or arthralgia, in patients with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the attenuation of myalgia and/or arthralgia in patients who experience myalgia
           and/or arthralgia treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, crossover, pilot study. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on day 2 of course 1 of paclitaxel administration, patients receive
           oral glutamine three times daily for 4 days.

        -  Arm II: Beginning on day 2 of course 1 of paclitaxel administration, patients receive
           oral placebo three times daily for 4 days.

      Both arms crossover during course 2. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 7-10 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
