      with standard paper-pencil approach in within-subject design.

      Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or major depressive
      disorder will undergo a baseline assessment of cognition.

      The participants will be at the baseline randomly assigned to each condition: virtual
      environment rehabilitation or paper-pencil rehabilitation. Then they will participate in
      10-15 sessions (30-45 minutes) once or twice a week.

      All participants will undergo retest assessment of cognition.

      After completion of the first program the participants will be assigned to the different
      condition: to paper-pencil or virtual environment rehabilitation. After 10-15 sessions in the
      second condition the participants will once more undergo retest assessment of cognition.

      Within-subject design is an effective tool in the development of scientifically proven
      treatment tools. This approach allows to obtain reliable information about the effectiveness
      of the method and to examine the influences of other variables (Steingrimsdottir and Arntzen
      2015). This study will allow to get credible information on the importance of using the
      virtual environment in the context of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with schizophrenia
      and depression.
