      in our participants and their families. Our research lab has a long history of identifying
      novel genes responsible for various forms of neuromuscular disease including; DMD gene, the
      sarcoglycans, obscurin, and filamin. Each discovery has resulted in advances in our ability
      to develop diagnostic tests which benefit patients and their families by providing accurate
      diagnosis, presymptomatic and/or prenatal testing. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies
      have increased our understanding of the natural history of these rare disorders benefiting
      patients through better prognostic determinations by clinicians. Biochemical and pathological
      analysis of muscle biopsy samples in patients with known and unknown types of neuromuscular
      disease has led to new insights into disease pathophysiology, which we hope will aid in
      finding new treatments.
