      whose principle is: 2 symbols (for example, a circle and a square) appear in random order on
      the screen computer. The patient will not press the response button (key on the keyboard)
      that upon the occurrence of one of the two symbols, in dependence upon the command that it
      has been given by the psychiatrist, and this as quickly as possible. The patient will
      successively perform 3 versions of this exercise (with a neutral wallpaper, with
      neutral/games images or with neutral/games tones).Order of the 3 versions will be determined
      by randomization.
