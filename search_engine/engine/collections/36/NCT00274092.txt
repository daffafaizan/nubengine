    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study to compare the
      bronchodilator efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation capsules and Atrovent MDI in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Following an initial screening visit, patients will enter a 2-week baseline period. Patients
      who successfully complete this phase will be randomized into the double-blind portion of the
      study in which they will receive tiotropium once daily (morning) or Atrovent four times
      daily. Pulmonary function testing will be conducted just prior to the start of therapy at
      Visit 2 (i.e. randomization visit after completion of the 2-week run-in period) and at 120
      minutes post-dosing. Pulmonary function testing will be repeated at the same time intervals
      at the end of therapy.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Null and alternative hypotheses The primary objective of this study was addressed by a
      two-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance of the null hypothesis that, in patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the bronchodilator efficacy after one
      month is no greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18mcg once daily) than on ATROVENT MDI
      (2 puffs of 20 mcg q.i.d.), against the alternative hypothesis that the bronchodilator
      efficacy is greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 mcg once daily).

      Comparison(s):

      Trough FEV1 response will be analyzed. Peak FEV1, FVC trough and peak response, number of
      Rescue Medication and change from baseline in total score of Patient Evaluation Questionnaire
      will be analyzed. Change from baseline in each category score of Patient Evaluation
      Questionnaire will be also analyzed.
