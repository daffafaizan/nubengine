      containing 2.0 mL of sodium hyaluronate (15 mg/mL) dissolved in physiological saline. The
      Orthovisc-T device is intended to relieve pain and restore function in tendons affected by
      chronic lateral epicondylosis. The hyaluronic acid solution provides extracellular
      supplementation of the elbow with lateral epicondylosis, lubricating and hydrating the
      affected site, thereby providing the ideal environment for healing of the damaged tissue.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the residual risk of two peri-osteotendinous
      injections of Orthovisc-T spaced one week apart for the relief of elbow pain and to restore
      function in patients with lateral epicondylosis.
