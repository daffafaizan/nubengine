      implementation of a system-integrated and technology-enabled model of care to improve the
      secondary prevention of stroke in Nanhe County, a rural area of Hebei province, China. Fifty
      villages from five townships are stratified randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the
      intervention arm (implementing SINEMA model) or the control arm (usual care).

      After a baseline survey, intervention will be implemented in 25 intervention villages,
      lasting for 12 months. Follow-up survey will be conducted in the same way in all villages at
      12-month after the initial of the study. Process evaluation will be conducted every three
      month, and economic evaluation will also be conducted.
