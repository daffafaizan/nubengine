      enrolled in Preliminary Part (I) were treated with FS Grifols. Subjects in Primary Part (II)
      were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with FS Grifols or manual compression.
      The objectives of the study were to evaluate the hemostasis effectiveness of FS Grifols in
      peripheral vascular surgery and to assess clinical safety, viral safety, and immunogenicity.
