      up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit around 30 days following
      the last administration of SAR428926, and at least one follow-up visit around 30 days after
      the EOT visit. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity, or investigator, Sponsor, or patient decision to discontinue therapy. Patients who
      discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression of disease will be followed every 3
      months until progression, initiation of subsequent therapy, or until the primary analysis
      cutoff date, whichever comes first.
