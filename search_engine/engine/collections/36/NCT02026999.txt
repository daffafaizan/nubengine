      operation room all the patients will have standard monitorisation and induction. After
      intubation they will have inhalational anesthesia as maintenance. According to the TOF (train
      of four) measurement all patient will have neuromuscular relaxant if needed. After the
      operation they will be extubated according to TOF or clinical parameters. And time for
      extubation, mask assistance need, any complication, mask difficulty, and time spent in
      postoperative care unit will be recorded. Then the results will be compared, whether
      sugammadex or neostigmine is better for these patients in means of extubation and
      postoperative status.
