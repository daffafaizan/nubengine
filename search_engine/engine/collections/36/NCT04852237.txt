      in particular, they analyzed the correlation between the vaginal exposure to male partner's
      semen and the incidence of preeclampsia, observing both a reduced risk of preeclampsia after
      prolonged exposure to the paternal seminal fluid and a higher incidence of preeclampsia in
      pregnancies conceived with a new father or with sperm donor. This leads to the hypothesis of
      an immunological role for sperm in inducing a mucosal immune tolerance-like status at the
      level of the uterus that could be critical in the subsequent implantation.

      Previous studies also examined the neonatal outcomes from pregnancies obtained from
      surgically retrieved sperm, either epididymal or testicular sperm, and underlined that there
      is not overall increased risk in neonatal outcomes.

      Our study aims at having a complete view on paternal, maternal and neonatal information and a
      follow up, that allows to correct possible confounders and to analyze a wider group of
      outcomes.
