      multi-center, single-arm format. Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively. Adult
      patients with diagnosis of AS who were assigned for treatment with adalimumab (HumiraÂ®) were
      eligible for participation. Each patient included in this study was to be observed during
      his/her adalimumab treatment for a maximum of 12 month period. During this period four
      follow-up visits were planned for observation of the patient and documentation of data.
      Ideally, these visits should have been performed approximately 3 (V1), 6 (V2), 9 (V3) and 12
      (V4) months after the baseline visit (V0).
