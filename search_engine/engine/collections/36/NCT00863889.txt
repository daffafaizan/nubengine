      of the femur. The etiology of this disease is unknown, but it is clinically characterized by
      chronic aching pain over the lateral aspect of the hip, which can be exacerbated by certain
      movements such as external rotation and abduction (2). In order to objectively determine the
      level of pain and mobility associated with trochanteric bursitis, some orthopaedic surgeons
      use scoring systems (a qualitative and quantitative scoring test) to assess patients (4).

      In our practice, trochanteric bursitis has been treated by injection of glucocorticosteroids
      (steroids) combined with local anesthetic at the site of the greater trochanter (1).
      Additionally, it has been found that increasing steroid dosage provides a greater level of
      relief (3). Although steroids are usually an effective treatment, no studies to date have
      compared steroid injections for relief of trochanteric bursitis pain and mobility versus a
      placebo injection or local anesthetic injection alone.
