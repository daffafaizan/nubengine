    
      Subjects will come in for up to 2 sessions, each lasting between 1 - 4 hours. Subjects will
      complete reading and cognitive tasks associated with reading, and receive TMS as well as 2
      MRI brain scans, in order to assess brain regions important to reading.

      Initial, basic screening including MRI and TMS safety screening will be conducted over the
      phone during the recruitment phone call and/or screening forms will be emailed to prospective
      subjects for their review. Those individuals that qualify will be scheduled for session 1.
      Session 1 will take between 1 and 3 hours. Subjects who pass health/MRI/TMS screening will
      complete cognitive/reading screening measures as well as the demographic information survey.
      They will also be trained on the MRI and TMS procedures. If all screening criteria is met,
      subjects will be asked to return for a second session which will include the MRI and TMS
      portions of the study.

      Session 2 will take place on a separate day and consist of renewal of the health/MRI/TMS
      screening forms prior to the MRI scan or TMS administration. The baseline MRI portion of the
      session will last approximately 1.5 hours including screening, training, and scan time. The
      MRI scan will be followed by the TMS portion which will last approximately 45 minutes. The
      post-TMS MRI will take place immediately following the TMS session and will last
      approximately 45 minutes. Reading assessments will be administered before the baseline MRI
      and again after TMS stimulation/before post-TMS MRI, each lasting approximately 10 minutes.
