      resection for pancreatic cancer.

      The rate of omission to adjuvant therapy and rate of failure of completion of adjuvant
      therapy will be evaluated as primary outcomes. As secondary outcomes, survival analyses will
      be performed to investigate whether these factors influence prognosis, that will be evaluated
      through a disease free survival analysis at 18-months. Epidemiological and perioperative data
      will be analyzed to identify conditions associated with the primary outcomes.
