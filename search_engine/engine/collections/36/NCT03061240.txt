    
      The aim of this "smart pain assessment tool based on internet of things" SPA-research project
      is to develop an automatic and versatile pain assessment tool algorithm for detection and
      assessment of pain in a reliable and objective way in non-communicative patients. The final
      objective of the research project is to develop a smart pain assessment tool to detect and
      assess pain employing behavioural and physiologic indicators for a wide range of
      users/patients from infants to elderly people who are unable to communicate normally. The
      research project consists of three clinical phases (European Commision. Meddev 2.7/4/2010).
      The clinical phase I of the research project focused on developing pain assessment techniques
      involuntary working-age healthy study subjects. This current Clinical phase II includes the
      further development and research of the smart pain assessment tool in elective (non
      emergency) postoperative surgical patients during their stay after surgery in a recovery
      room.
