      psychological status, physical activity,sleep and diet were collected by a multi-components
      questionnaire survey.The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire(SDQ) and Behavior Rating
      Inventory of Executive Function(BRIEF) were conducted at the same time. Anthropometric
      measurement including height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure and fat
      mass were conducted.Besides,blood samples were collected to measure total cholesterol,
      triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C).

      At second stage,participants were classified for 4 subgroups as follows: Low active-high
      sedentary;low active-low sedentary; high active-high sedentary;high active-low sedentary by
      different sedentary status and physical activity levels according to the international
      standard. Later cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by the 20-m shuttle run test.
      Accelerometer GT3X+ Actigraph with physical activity log,Combined Raven's test, a series of
      psychometric paradigms were measured for further studies.

      At third stage,we will explore the related neuropsychological mechanism using the technology
      of event-related potentials (ERPs).

      About 1000 participants (7-12 years old) will be prospectively followed up. The associations
      between sedentary lifestyle and risks for cognition and cardiovascular-related disease will
      be evaluated.
