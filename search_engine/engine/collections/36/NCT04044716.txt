      opioid epidemic and concerns related to their use as the primary pain management strategy.
      Joint Commission requires that hospitals have additional pain non-pharmacologic pain
      management tools at their disposal to an effort decrease the reliance on opioids. Acupuncture
      and acupressure have been used for centuries in the management of a variety of disorders
      including pain. Unlike acupuncture, acupressure can be easily applied with limited training
      and is within the scope of practice for nurses, according to the North Carolina Board of
      Nursing. Thus evidence based non-pharmacologic strategies that can be deployed by nursing are
      of benefit to hospital organizations.
