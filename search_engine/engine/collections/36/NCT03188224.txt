      families, and comes with adverse outcomes in experience of care, population health, and
      costs. Parents of children with chronic conditions report a greater need for support around
      the time of healthcare transition. Providers report neither having the tools nor appropriate
      resources to foster smooth transitions for patients and their families. We hypothesize that
      an app-based transition toolkit (named MyTransition) designed to support youth moving from
      child to adult care can improve their experiences and lead to better health. The main
      objective of this study is to collect information to design a large multi-centre randomized
      control trial to assess implementation of the MyTransition app including recruitment,
      completion of follow-up, and scale-ability of the intervention. The secondary objective is to
      assess the feasibility and potential effect of the MyTransition app-based transition toolkit
      for improving health of youth (quality of life), healthcare transition experience, and
      achievement of health and life goals.
