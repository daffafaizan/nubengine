      cognitive behavioral stress management intervention (T-PP-CBSM) intervention (relaxation,
      stress awareness, cognitive restructuring, coping skills training, interpersonal skills
      training) versus a time-attention-matched 10-week patient-partner based videophone-delivered
      health information (T-PP-HI) (health behavior education on nutrition, sleep and other
      factors) in men and women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and their partners. The study
      evaluates the effects of T-PP-CBSM vs T-PP-HI on patient CFS symptoms, neuroimmune
      processes--diurnal cortisol regulation and immune regulation
      (pro-inflammatory:anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio ([IL-1β + IL-6 + TNF-α]:[IL-13 +
      IL-10])-and psychosocial functioning at 5 months and 9 months after intervention.
