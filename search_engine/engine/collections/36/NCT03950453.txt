      (PMH) + nutrition and physical activity counseling (N) versus contact control intervention
      (C) + nutrition and physical activity counseling (N), to examine short-term and long term
      enduring effects of PMH+N to promote healthy eating and physical activity in parent and
      child, and prevent childhood obesity risk in 2-5 year olds, via changes in parent stress and
      parenting.
