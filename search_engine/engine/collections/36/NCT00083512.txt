        -  Preliminary data generated from our pilot protocol 02-C-0064 suggests that the urinary
           VEGF and MMP level at the one month follow-up time point compared to the last
           on-treatment time point collection may be predictive of tumor recurrence at one year
           (l).

        -  Note that this preliminary study included patients with all histologies.

        -  In an on ongoing effort to validate our results with a larger more homogeneous patient
           cohort we propose to prospectively study patients undergoing radiotherapy for GBM.

      OBJECTIVES

      -We will determine whether VEGF and MMP level measurements aide in predicting tumor
      recurrence at 1 year.

      ELIGIBILITY

      -Patients seen in the radiation oncology clinic will be asked to provide samples of blood and
      urine before, during and after their radiation treatment.

      DESIGN

        -  This protocol-provides a means of acquiring blood and urine samples from patients
           receiving radiation therapy for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

        -  Patients will be analyzed according to their Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
           recursive partitioning prognostic subgroups, which includes patient age, KPS, extent of
           resection and neurological function.
