      to categorise the biological behaviour of such lesions and correlate this against
      non-invasive biological and radiological parameters. From these data, the plan is to explore
      strategies to characterise LDCT-detected cancers through non-invasive means, which the
      researchers believe may prove key in mitigating potential screening-associated harms.
