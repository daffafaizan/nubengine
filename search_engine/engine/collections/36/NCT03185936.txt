    
      As it is well known, optic disc pit (ODP) is a rare congenital disease which is usually
      associated with maculopathy (ODP-M) in the form of intraretinal and subretinal fluid
      accumulation at the macular area leading to visual impairment.

      With no definite treatment and absence of guidelines for its management, the invistigators
      considered their prospective, interventional case series to evaluate the anatomical and
      functional results of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with internal limiting membrane
      (ILM) peeling, endolaser photocoagulation and gas tamponade in management of optic disc pit
      (ODP) maculopathy.
