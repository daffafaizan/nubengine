      Group. Randomization will be based on an intent-to-treat basis. In order to ensure that the
      two groups have comparable injury severity at baseline, randomization will be block-
      stratified based on age (18-50 and > 50 years), burn size (25-50% and > 50% TBSA), and
      presence of inhalation injury confirmed by bronchoscopy (present or absent). In the Colloid
      Group resuscitation starts with LR and then 5% albumin will be introduced between 8 and 12
      hours post burn in a ratio of 1/3 albumin to 2/3 LR. In the Crystalloid Group resuscitation
      is with LR only. Each group will have their study fluid maintained for the 1st 48 hours post
      burn and study fluids in each group will be identically titrated to the urinary output.
