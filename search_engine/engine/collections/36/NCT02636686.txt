      have previously been treated with drisapersen.

      This study aims to enroll up to approximately 220 subjects. The primary dosing arm is
      drisapersen 6 mg/kg as subcutaneous (SC) injection(s) once a week. All subjects starting with
      subcutaneous injections will receive a loading dose of twice weekly 6mg/kg drisapersen for
      the first three weeks of treatment. This study does not have a minimum duration of
      participation. Subjects will have varying times of study participation depending on when they
      enter from one of the eligible studies and will be permitted to continue the study until such
      a time that they withdraw based on protocol-defined criteria, or BioMarin stops the study.
      Subjects na√Øve to treatment are not eligible for participation in this study

      For subjects who have previously experienced significant safety or tolerability issues in one
      of the eligible studies, or who experience these during this study, there is the potential of
      an alternate intermittent dosing arm. This will be agreed in advance with the Medical
      Monitor.

      For subjects who have previously experienced significant injection site reactions in an
      earlier drisapersen study, or who experience similar reaction(s) during this study, there is
      the potential to be dosed intravenously.
