      be tolerated safely by direct injection into the leg muscles where the blood flow is not
      sufficient to meet the oxygen demands of the leg muscles. The study will also assess whether
      patients who receive the investigational drug product are able to increase their maximal
      walking time using a standardized treadmill walking test.

      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multi-center, Phase 2 dose-selection study. Seventy-five patients will be enrolled into each
      of 4 study drug groups (3 groups of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 gene transfer and 1 placebo group) for a
      total of 300 patients overall. Three different doses of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 gene transfer will be
      studied. The dose range was previously tested in animals and in the Phase 1 human studies. A
      placebo group is included in the study to compare safety and efficacy of different doses of
      Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 with placebo. Each patient will receive a single set of 20 injections (100 μL
      each) of gene transfer or placebo in one administration to each leg for a total of 40
      injections.
