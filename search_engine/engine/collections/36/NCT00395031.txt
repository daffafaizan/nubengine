      be enrolled after giving informed consent. Participants may stay on their original ward at
      MPC, if their clinical care would be better served on their home ward because of patient
      programs and/or continuity of care reasons. Patients recruited from other participating sites
      will be transferred to MPC research ward.

      There will be a screening phase (two weeks) on the prior antipsychotic regimen, a
      cross-titration phase (three week) and a ziprasidone phase (eight weeks; four time points).

      All medications, except for the antipsychotic agents, will be kept stable throughout the
      protocol. These medications may include anticholinergics, mood stabilizers and
      antidepressants. After the screening phase lasting two weeks, patients will enter the
      cross-titration phase lasting three week. The cross titration schedule will be changed in
      accordance with Deutschman & Deutschman's 2005 recommendations. The current antipsychotic
      will be gradually decreased to zero and ziprasidone will be started at 40 mg bid po and
      raised up to 160 mg po bid during the cross-titration phase, according to clinical response
      and tolerance. After the cross-titration phase has concluded, the ziprasidone dose will range
      from 80 mg bid p.o. to 160 mg bid p.o. daily according to clinical response during the eight
      week treatment phase.
