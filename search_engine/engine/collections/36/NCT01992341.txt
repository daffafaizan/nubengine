      one week off schedule at study day 1 and weekly AMG 386 beginning at study day 8. The
      pharmacokinetic portion of the study occurs during the first two study cycles with intensive
      PK collections on study weeks 1, 6 and 8. Once the pharmacokinetic assessment period is
      completed, continued combination therapy with AMG 386 and paclitaxel or single-agent AMG 386
      will be administered at the investigator's discretion until progression, unacceptable
      toxicity develops, or study withdrawal.
