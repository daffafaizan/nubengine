      treatment of primary pediatric headache disorders. Every pediatric headache patient needs to
      have a personalized and tailored program of education, psychological strategies,
      pharmacotherapy and complementary medicine choices. This particular study may prove desirable
      for parents of children and adolescents with chronic headache. As documented by Termine, C.,
      Ferrari, Ginevra, O., D'Arrigo, S., Rossi, M., & Lanzi, G. (2005), parents are often
      uncertain and fearful of submitting their children to treatment with traditional drugs,
      adolescents can use alternative therapies as a way of affirming their independence, and there
      are fewer drugs available to treat headache in children. Moreover, there is a 30-40% placebo
      response in headache sufferers (Mauskop, 2001). Children and adolescents should not be
      prevented from using alternative treatments, specifically essential oils, provided that the
      intervention is not harmful or costly. It is hoped this study will contribute to the scant
      research that exists and help define the indications, effects and limitations of aromatherapy
      use.
