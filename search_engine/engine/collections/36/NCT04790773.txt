      Federal Drug and Food Administration (FDA) MedWatch reporting system found that
      anticoagulants had the most adverse drug event (ADE) reports in 2011. Anticoagulants have
      also been reported as one of the leading drug classes contributing to emergency department
      visits3. Given the potential for serious adverse events, providing effective education to
      increase patient knowledge and awareness of those risks are essential. Incorporating
      technology into health care is becoming increasingly popular and has been shown to be
      effective for patient education. One reason is that technology can consistently provide
      complete patient education and is not subject to educator variability in providing this
      education.
