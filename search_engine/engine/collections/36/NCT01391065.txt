      Stage I

      Aim 1: To spatially characterize biologically heterogenous subvolumes within the gross tumor
      through multimodality (18 F-Miso/FLT/Functional MR) image fusion.

      Aim 2: To evaluate post external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) response in spatial reference to
      biological heterogeneous sub-volumes on imaging.

      Stage II:

      Aim 3: To evaluate technical feasibility of delivering dose modulated biologically optimized
      interstitial brachytherapy.

      Aim 4: To evaluate acute and late toxicity and quality of life associated with biologically
      optimized brachytherapy
