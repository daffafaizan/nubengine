      not comprehensively addressed the application of a strategy combining both sodium restriction
      and a progressive, but gradual challenge of post dialysis target weight for BP and
      fluid-weight management in hemodialysis (HD). The investigators postulate that a
      protocolized, stepwise and gradual challenge of post-hemodialysis target weight when combined
      with diligent dietary sodium restriction <2000mg sodium/day, will lead to better
      hydration/volume status and BP control in HD patients. A randomized, two parallel arm trial
      (n=40) among HD patients is proposed, that compares this comprehensive strategy in one group
      versus 'usual' HD volume/hydration and BP management in the control group. The two primary
      outcomes are change in volume/hydration status (assessed by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis-BIA) and change in BP (pre-dialysis in-center readings, home self-monitored readings
      as well as 44-hour interdialytic BP). Secondary outcomes include change in target
      post-dialysis weight, slope of on-line relative plasma volume monitoring (using Crit-line
      monitors), utilization and change, if any, in antihypertensive regimen, change in
      interdialytic weight gain, objectively assessed salt-appetite, thirst score, frequency of
      intradialytic hypotension, cramps and duration of post-dialysis fatigue and recovery, time to
      achievement of dry weight and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, albumin, brain natriuretic
      peptide-BNP, aldosterone and hsCRP). The trial will be 14-weeks in duration and will involve
      comprehensive assessment of study parameters at baseline, middle and end of the trial. It is
      anticipated that the trial will lead to the the development of a simple and practical
      approach for volume and BP control in HD patients that will subsequently need to be studied
      on a larger scale, i.e., a larger, multicenter study with hard endpoints of death and
      hospitalization.
