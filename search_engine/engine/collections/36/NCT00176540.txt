      Primary

        -  Assess the effects of dextromethorphan hydrobromide in patients with cancer-related
           fatigue.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the changes in cancer-related fatigue with the levels of plasma homocysteine
           versus red blood cell folate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral dextromethorphan hydrobromide 3 times a day on days 1-7. Treatment
      repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
