      successful recanalization residual handicap including post-stroke cognitive and mood
      disorders impact the quality of life of patients. These symptoms correlate only moderately
      with the final stroke volume suggesting more widespread dysfunction than what is apparent on
      standard follow-up MRI. One hypothesis is that the rescued penumbra (i.e.; the tissue showing
      significant hypoperfusion at the acute stage but that appears normal on conventional imaging
      at follow up) could exhibit incomplete ischemic injury also known under the term of selective
      neuronal loss. The concept of selective neuronal loss in the rescued penumbra is admitted
      based on histological, animal and PET studies but the identification of such a graduation
      between pan-necrosis and normal tissue is very challenging to capture in vivo with MRI and is
      typically missed.

      This study will prospectively include 100 stroke patients. Patients admitted with significant
      penumbra at the acute stage and successfully recanalized thanks to thrombectomy thrombolysis
      or spontaneously will be explored at 24h-to-72h and then at 3 months with the multi-b
      diffusion sequence. The investigators expect to be able to measure significant modifications
      within the rescued penumbra as compared to contralateral normal brain by using the advanced
      but also the simplified diffusion metrics. Investigators will test the impact of
      duration/severity of the initial hypoperfusion and they will explore the clinical relevance
      especially in terms of cognitive and mood disorders as measured at 3 months.
