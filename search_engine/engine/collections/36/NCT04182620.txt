      (RDN) in the prevention of AF recurrence in patients scheduled for an AF ablation procedure.
      Patients will be randomized to either i) AF ablation (Control) or ii) AF ablation + renal
      sympathetic denervation (Intervention). This is a prospective, controlled, single-blind,
      randomized trial. The pilot study will be conducted in up to 11 clinical sites in the United
      States and Europe.
