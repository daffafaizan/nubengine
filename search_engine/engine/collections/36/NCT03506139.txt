      without causing a decrease in quality of life or an increase in radiation side effects.

      Standard radiation dose for glioblastoma (GBM) is 60 Gray in 30 fractions, with patients
      receiving 1 fraction per day, Monday through Friday.

      This trial will use a total of 75 Gray in 30 fractions, with participants receiving 1
      fraction per day, Monday through Friday. Participants will still receive the standard
      chemotherapy (temozolomide) at the standard dose (75 mg/m2, once daily, 7 days a week).

      This study also uses a different imaging technique to identify the tumor target and the
      tissues at risk. Normal imaging techniques will be used to define the standard target volume
      and will receive the standard radiation dose (60 Gray). A special MRI sequence will identify
      at risk areas based on diffusion and perfusion abnormalities. This area will receive the
      higher radiation dose (75 Gray).

      Participants will also be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires and neurocognitive
      evaluations at specific time points. This is to identify any side effects from the higher
      radiation dose. Preliminary work done at University of Michigan suggests a lack of side
      effects from the higher dose of radiation.
