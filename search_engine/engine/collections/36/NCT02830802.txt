      extracts from Althaea Officinalis, Aesculus Hippocatanum Bark and essential oils might
      comprise an alternative to conventional antimicrobial mouthrinses, which might exhibit
      important side effects. Thus the aim of the current study is to test the null-hypothesis H0:

      A sage-based mouthrinse (Dr. Hauschka Med, Mundspülung Salbei, WALA Heilmittel GmbH,
      Dorfstraße 1, 73087 Bad Boll/Eckwälden, Germany) is less or equal effective in alleviating
      inflammatory signs of intra-oral mucosa and gingiva than an water/alcohol-based taste
      adjusted placebo.

      The placebo and the sage-based mouthrinse will be manufactured according to
      EU-Kosmetik-Verordnung 1223/2009 and provided by WALA Heilmittel GmbH, Dorfstraße 1, 73087
      Bad Boll/Eckwälden, Germany together with the necessary safety documentation. The placebo
      will be an alcohol/ water based solution with a similar taste to the tested mouthrinse.

      The main outcome parameter will be Sulcus Bleeding Index SBI. Among others, the main
      secondary outcome parameters will be Oral Health Related Quality of Life as assessed with the
      OHIP-14 G questionnaire, the Xerostomia inventory and a Tooth staining index.
