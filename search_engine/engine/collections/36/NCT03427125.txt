    
      The study consists of a screening visit, a phosphate binder-free washout period of up to 4
      weeks, a 26-week treatment period, an up to 12-week placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal
      period, during which patients are randomized 1:1 to either remain on their tenapanor
      treatment or placebo, followed by an open label safety extension period for a total treatment
      period of up to 52 weeks. An active control group, for safety analysis only, will receive
      sevelamer carbonate, open label, for the entire 52-week study period

      Depending on increase in serum phosphate (s-P) levels, subjects can be randomized 2 or 3
      weeks after being taken off their phosphate lowering medication.

      Subjects who qualify to enroll in the study will be randomized 3:1 to either receive
      tenapanor at a dose of 30 mg bid or sevelamer carbonate.
