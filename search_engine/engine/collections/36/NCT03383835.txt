      age less than 30. The influence of pregnancy on breast cancer risk is not fully understood,
      and little is known about modulation of the breast microenvironment during pregnancy and its
      influence on risk. Hormones, including rising estrogen levels, play a role in fatty acid
      synthesis. In pre-clinical models, a rise in omega-3:omega-6 ratio occurs naturally in the
      breast of pregnant mice. This may be able to be accentuated in human breast tissue with
      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to
      favorably modulate breast cancer risk and risk biomarkers in pre-menopausal women at high
      risk for breast. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy has also been found to
      have positive outcomes for the offspring, making it an ideal intervention to study in this
      population.

      This pilot study of omega-3 supplementation in pre-menopausal women at high risk for breast
      cancer who are still considering pregnancy is addressing a potential prevention strategy in a
      population otherwise excluded from breast cancer prevention trials and not eligible for
      standard of care chemoprevention. With this pilot, the intent is to establish feasibility,
      document tolerability, determine number of women needed to enroll based on pregnancy rate and
      identify biomarkers for future investigation. This information will provide necessary data to
      apply for future extramural funding for a larger randomized trial. In a larger randomized
      trial with longer follow up, we will be able to assess post-pregnancy breast tissue and
      biomarkers to examine efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in breast cancer risk
      reduction.
