      sham intervention on major depression, in an eight-week, double-blind, randomized-controlled
      trial in 40 MDD patients who still have significant depressive symptoms without changing at
      their treatment modality for the last 4 weeks. During the visits at weeks 0 (baseline), 1, 2,
      4, 6, 8 (intervention), and 12 (4 weeks after intervention), subjects will be assessed
      depressive symptoms with the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Before and
      after the intervention (Weeks 0 and 8),Computerized TCM constitution diagnosis will be
      measured and the blood samples will be collected for biomarker analyses, including
      neurotransmitter, inflammatory molecules and immunologic function. All parts of this research
      will start after being approved by the Institution Review Board in study sites.

      The outcomes of this study could provide the evidence of applying acupuncture as an
      alternative effective treatment for depression and to improve the understanding of biological
      mechanisms for its antidepressant effects.
