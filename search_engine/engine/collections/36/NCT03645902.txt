      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) will be prospectively included in this study.eSWAN and TOF
      images will be analyzed under double-blind conditions by a junior radiologist and a senior
      neuroradiologist for the detection of arterial occlusion. eSWAN images will be assessed in
      order to estimate the inter-observer agreement. After a consensus, eSWAN and TOF data will be
      compared to calculate inter-modality agreement.
