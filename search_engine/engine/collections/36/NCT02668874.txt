    
      100 regular patients at the College of Dentistry Department of Pediatric Dentistry Clinics,
      ages 6-16 years, will be invited to participate in this study. Matched contralateral pairs of
      first and second molars and premolars will be randomized to receive sealants with the use of
      the deice (Isolite) for isolation or with the use of cotton roll isolation. All sealants will
      be placed by pediatric dentistry residents. Sealants will be placed on first and second
      permanent molars that have a matched contralateral molar requiring a sealant as well.
      Photographs may be taken of the sealants on the day of placement and at a 6-month and 12
      month recalls. Retention of the sealants will be evaluated and scored by calibrated pediatric
      dentists.
