      anxiolytic and analgesic effects without causing clinically significant respiratory
      depression. Dexmedetomidine also reduces the propofol requirement for sedation and
      anaesthesia induction. Therefore, dexmedetomidine may be a useful co-induction agent to
      facilitate LMA insertion with minimal effects on respiratory function. A recent study showed
      that dexmedetomidine administration prior to propofol induction provided similar conditions
      for successful LMA insertion, as does fentanyl without respiratory depression. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the median effective dose (ED50) of dexmedetomidine required for
      successful LMA insertion during induction with propofol of 2 mg/kg .
