      disease (AD). Slowing down effect of dementia by enhancing brain plasticity represents on of
      the most prominent challenges. Neurofeedback is one of the promising techniques that showed
      therapeutic efficacy and cognitive improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      epilepsy, stroke. The investigators aim to study the effects of a sensorimotor neurofeedback
      training protocol (SMR) on cognitive performances in elderly and to assess whether MCI
      patients change in brain electrical activity after training.
