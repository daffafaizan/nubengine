      treatment planning can be improved by using an MRI scan to help doctors more accurately
      target the prostate with radiation and decrease radiation dose to the rectum, which is just
      behind the prostate.

      To do this, the investigators will create a treatment plan based on the MRI scan and compare
      it to the standard treatment, which currently uses a CT scan rather than an MRI. The results
      of this study will help inform doctors whether it is beneficial to routinely use an MRI scan
      for prostate radiotherapy treatment planning.
