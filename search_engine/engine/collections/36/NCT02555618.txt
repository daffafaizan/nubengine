      subcutaneously in healthy Japanese adults, designed as a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety compared to an
      egg-derived TIV.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-850. TAK-850 was tested in healthy
      volunteers. This study looked at immunogenicity and safety of TAK-850 (cell-derived) compared
      to an egg-derived influenza vaccine.

      The study enrolled 400 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-850

        -  Influenza HA vaccine All participants received one injection. This single center trial
           was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study was 22 days.
           Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 21 days after
           the vaccination for a follow-up assessment.
