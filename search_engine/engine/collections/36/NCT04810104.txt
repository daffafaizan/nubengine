      has important clinical consequences, and there is currently no available treatment. Moreover,
      the underlying pathology of cognitive impairment in PD indicates that nicotinic agonists may
      be particularly relevant for this condition. This is a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2a study of AZD0328, a selective α7 nicotinic
      receptor agonist, in PD-MCI. The study is an international, multi-centre study, which will
      take place across sites in Europe.

      PD-MIND will for the first time test the potential of a nicotinic agonist on cognition in
      PD-MCI. The primary outcome is attention, as it is a key cognitive domain in the PD-MCI
      profile and most likely to be affected by a α7 nicotinic agonist. Exploratory outcome
      measures will guide decisions on the design and conduct of future larger Phase 3 trials.
      Qualifying participants will be randomly assigned at baseline to either receive 0.5mg twice a
      day (bis in die, BID) of AZD0328 or placebo for 12 weeks. A total of 160 participants with
      PD-MCI will be enrolled to the study: 80 in the active (AZD0328) group and 80 in the control
      (placebo) group. Participants will undertake face-to-face assessments at screening, baseline,
      and then 3- 6- and 12- weeks after beginning study treatment (see Figure 2 for trial design
      overview). A subset of 90 participants will also undergo an MRI biomarker component prior to
      study drug administration and at study end.
