      clinically-validated tools for preoperative workup of patients with small pituitary tumors.
      CRH stimulation and 18F-FDG uptake in PET imaging will be used to detect MRI-negative
      pituitary adenomas in patients with Cushing s disease. Patients who have MRI-negative
      pituitary microadenomas will undergo 18F-FDG PET-imaging with CRH stimulation. Intravenous
      18F-FDG will be given approximately four hours following CRH administration. Within 12 weeks
      after completion of the last 18F-FDG high-resolution PET-imaging scan, patients will undergo
      surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma. Surgical and histological confirmation of
      adenoma location will be noted. All images will be read independently by neuroradiologists
      blinded to clinical and histopathological outcomes. The diagnostic and localization accuracy
      of PET-imaging will be assessed by comparing the PET findings with histopathology.
