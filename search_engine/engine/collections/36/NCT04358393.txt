    
      This is a two-part study that will initially evaluate the safety and tolerability of APG-115
      as a single agent in Part 1, followed by a combination of APG-115 plus 5-AZA in part 2.

      Part 1: Dose escalation of APG-115 will use standard 3+3 design. APG-115 is administered
      orally once daily (QD) on Day 1-5 every 28-day cycle. The starting target dose is 100 mg
      (dose level; DL1) and will be increased in subsequent cohorts to 150 mg (DL2), 200 mg (DL3),
      and 250 mg (DL4), accordingly.

      Part 2: 5-AZA is administered at 75 mg/mË„2/d subcutaneously daily on Day 1-7 every 28 days.
