      gastrointestinal consequences dominating the clinical picture. The life-expectancy of CF
      patients has increased through several therapeutic advances. Although respiratory failure
      remains the major cause of mortality in CF, musculoskeletal impairments contribute to major
      morbidity. In the general population, musculoskeletal conditions are among the most common
      reasons for seeking medical care, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture increases with age.
      As the CF population ages, the morbidity related to musculoskeletal effects may increase.

      The etiology of CF related bone disease is multifactorial and includes effects of pancreatic
      insufficiency, poor nutritional status, vitamin D deficiency, glucocorticoid treatment,
      inflammation, hypogonadism, and sarcopenia, collectively resulting in attenuated bone mineral
      accrual and low bone density The effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
      regulator (CFTR) modulating drugs on bone disease in CF has not been evaluated. Effects of
      CFTR modulators may help counter the bone and muscle consequences of CF either directly by
      effects on bone or muscle cells, or indirectly by improved lung disease, improved nutritional
      status, decreased systemic inflammation or glucocorticoid use, or subsequent increases in
      physical activity.

      The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that better understanding of the bone
      and muscle effects of CFTR modulator therapies will help guide strategies to optimize bone
      accrual, prevent osteoporosis and fractures, and improve functional outcomes in the aging CF
      population. Set on the backbone of a longitudinal observational cohort study, the study will
      systematically and comprehensively evaluate changes in bone and muscle mass and strength from
      baseline to 12 month and 24 month time points among patients receiving CFTR modulator
      therapies and also among controls not receiving CFTR modulator therapies.
