      practice in Sudan, an under-developed country with lower social economic group. Children
      between 5-8 years were invited and selected if they met the inclusion criteria. Only those
      who had 1-2 carious primary molars needing PMCs were randomised. The PMCs were placed by a
      dentist in the CT arm and by a therapist in the HT arm. The children were follow up every 6
      months up to 2 years. The demographic details, periodontal health, occlusion, children
      anxieties, and procedure time were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier survival rates for each arm
      were calculated. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using the
      results and the local salaries
