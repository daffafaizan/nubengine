      major decline among patients with HIV. However, several antiretroviral medications, in
      particular protease inhibitors (PI), have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk
      in large cohort studies. The role of inflammation in cardiovascular risk is currently being
      elucidated. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been identified as a strong
      independent predictor of cardiovascular disease among healthy individuals in several large
      cohort studies. Other inflammatory biomarkers such as serum amyloid A (SAA) and interleukin-6
      (IL-6) have also been correlated with cardiovascular risk. Among patients with HIV, studies
      have revealed inappropriate immune activation with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such
      as IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ (IFN- γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The effects of
      this immune dysregulation and the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the cytokines and
      biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk remain to be delineated.

      Objective: Our aims are to characterize the levels of inflammatory biomarkers at the time of
      antiretroviral initiation, to define the time period over which the biomarkers change and
      stabilize, and to determine if the type of antiretroviral drug class used has an impact on
      the rate of alteration of these biomarkers. Given the disparate cardiovascular risk between
      women and men of similar age groups, we will study the additional impact of gender on these
      biomarkers. We will also explore whether there is a correlation between change of CD4
      T-lymphocyte counts and the response of the biomarkers.
