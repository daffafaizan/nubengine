      close to what is reported in the general population in northern countries. However, PLHIV
      experience an increased risk of morbidities that the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort has largely
      contributed to describe in the last years. Among contributing factors to this excess of
      morbidity, immune suppression, immune activation, and exposition to cardiovascular and cancer
      risk factors as well as ageing represent possible intervention targets. Long-term follow-up
      is required to describe and understand the evolution of morbidities and complications as well
      as ART side effects.

      Moreover, the global evaluation of health in PLHIV, including psychiatric, neurologic and
      social determinants and not only biomedical determinants represents one of the public health
      challenges of the next decade in the field of HIV infection.

      The aim of the present study is to study the emerging morbidity occurring during the course
      of HIV infection in people treated with ART as well as to describe the tolerance and efficacy
      of new available ART regimens.

      The follow-up of patients will be performed according to national guidelines. Demographic,
      clinical, biological and therapeutic data will be captured at each patient's hospital contact
      according to a standardized questionnaire.

      All events occurring during the course of clinical management will be prospectively
      registered in the database according to the ICD 10th revision. A biobank will be collected
      from every consenting PLHIV at inclusion in the cohort and then every two years.
