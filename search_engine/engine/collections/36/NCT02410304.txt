      versus no erosion with the Sharp modified by van der Heijde) of patients affected by
      rheumatoid arthritis (ACR/EULAR 2010). The first approach is the assessment of remission
      defined by modified SDAI in order to evaluate in all cases the same number of joints
      [Simplified Disease Activity Index algebric sum of 5 parametres : number of painful joints
      (28 joints) , number of synovitis (38 joints), global evaluation of patient and and
      practitioner with VAS, and PCR â‰¤ 3.3mg/l] (mode C). The second one is a combined approach:
      clinical-ultrasound (same criteria but with MTPs and shoulders in B mode so a 26 joints
      evaluation with clinical examination and 12 joints evaluation in B mode) (mode B). The last
      one is an ultrasound approach (remission defined as the absence of power Doppler on 38 joints
      (28 of SDAI plus 10 MTPs joints) (mode D) in a pragmatical context (study assessed by private
      rheumatologists and hospital rheumatologists).

      This trial is a National randomized multicentre trial that compares three modes of follow to
      adjust the therapeutic adaptation in Rheumatoid Artritis.
