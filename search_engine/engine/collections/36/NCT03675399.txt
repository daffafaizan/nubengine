    
      The aim of this study is to compare the immediate effects of an acute bout of isometric
      exercise of the shoulder external rotator muscles above and below pain threshold on pain
      intensity, pain threshold, conditioned pain modulation and pain free force in external
      rotation.

      It will consist of a randomized three-treatment parallel-design study. The sample will
      consist of subjects with rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP). Once the sample is
      selected, subjects will participate in three experimental sessions, which will occur in a
      randomized order: two exercise sessions (supra-threshold and infra-threshold isometric
      exercise) and one control session. In the first session, information regarding clinical and
      demographical aspects will be collected. A washout period of approximately 48 hours will
      separate each of the experimental sessions.

      To evaluate the results of the exercise, the subjects will be assessed at pre-intervention,
      immediately post-intervention and 45 minutes after each experimental condition. Pain
      intensity, Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPT), Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), maximal
      voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and pain free isometric strength (PFIS) will be
      measured.
