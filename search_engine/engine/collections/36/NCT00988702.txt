      association with either a relaxing (i.e., enhanced alpha asymmetry) or an attentive state
      (i.e., enhanced intra- and inter-hemispheric theta coherence). The present study aimed to
      utilize these well-known neuroelectrophysiological techniques to investigate the relatively
      less studied Shaolin Dan Tian Breathing (DTB) technique. This technique consists of two
      components -- Passive DTB and Active DTB, and is considered not only as a relaxation exercise
      but also a form of Qigong. Based upon some pilot neuroimaging data and clinical observation,
      it was hypothesized that after familiarizing with the method, practicing DTB can induce both
      relaxing and attentive states. Twenty-two adults received training on the DTB (experimental
      group) for one month. They were instructed to practice the technique daily, and at each
      practice, until they felt warm and/or relaxed. Twenty age-, gender- and education-matched
      adults receiving conventional progressive muscle relaxation training were recruited as
      control. All participation was voluntary. Quantitative EEG and bio-physiological data were
      collected at baseline and post training. Eyes-closed resting EEG data before and immediately
      after each type of breathing were obtained individually at two time points.
