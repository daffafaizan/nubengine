      scanners have recently been introduced for clinical use. This technology combines the
      anatomic and perfusion data obtained with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI with functional
      imaging data obtained from PET. For breast imaging, the combination of MRI and PET has
      important potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide molecular characterization of
      breast cancer. The overall purpose of this research is to test the accuracy of PET/MRI
      imaging with 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) for measuring progesterone receptor (PR)
      expression in patients with invasive breast cancer.

      This is a prospective, one-arm, observational study which will enroll patients with newly
      diagnosed breast cancer scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI for preoperative staging/extent
      of disease evaluation as part of standard of care. Participation in this research study
      includes a directed breast PET/MRI with the investigational radiopharmaceutical, FFNP. FFNP
      uptake of the known, biopsy-proven malignancy will be measured on the PET/MRI examinations
      using standardized uptake values (SUV) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios.
