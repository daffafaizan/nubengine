    
      PSOBIOTEQ is a national multicentric prospective cohort, including patients receiving
      systemic treatment (biotherapy or DMARDs) for moderate to severe cutaneous psoriasis.

      The exposure of interest is the exposure to a biological therapy: infliximab, adalimumab,
      etanercept, ustekinumab and other biotherapy entering the market.

      The nature of the systemic treatment as well as its administration modalities are defined by
      the investigator according to usual practice.

      All dermatology departments located in the French metropolitan area and using biotherapies as
      treatment of cutaneous psoriasis will be solicited for participation to the cohort.

      The inclusion will last at least 3 years with a follow-up of at least 5 years for each
      patient (8 years maximum), with a 6 month periodicity for the data collection (complying with
      good clinical practice for these patients). Follow-up duration may be extended in the case of
      the identification of safety signals in the early years.

      Each study within the cohort has its specific endpoints according to its specific objectives
      but the whole data required will be collected at the same time for both studies then
      registered in a single database (eCRF). The statistical analyses will be performed by the
      clinical investigation and epidemiology center (INSERM CIE 801) of BICHAT hospital's
      department of epidemiology and clinical research

      2 636 patients will be included with the following distribution:.

        -  Non-exposed group: 1200 patients

        -  Exposed group: 1436 patients (naive or not) with at least 1200 patients naive for
           biotherapy.
