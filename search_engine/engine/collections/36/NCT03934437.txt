      US, and disparities are profound. African Americans have an HIV prevalence that is 5 times
      higher than among whites, and account for 78% of all HIV cases. Latinxs also have a higher
      prevalence of HIV than whites and are at the highest risk for late HIV diagnosis among all
      racial/ethnic groups. In addition, HIV viral load suppression, which is the best predictor of
      long-term survival among HIV-infected patients, is substantially lower among minority
      populations in Baltimore.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether mHealth-enhanced Linkage to Care and
      Retention (mLTCR) can improve HIV outcomes among HIV-infected African Americans and Latinos
      compared to standard Linkage to Care and Retention (LTCR) programs. The mHealth-enhancement
      consists of two smartphone applications (app), one for patients and one for patient
      supporters (e.g. linkage officers, patient navigators, nurses, etc.), to help facilitate
      communication. Communication will focus on issues related to HIV care (e.g. appointment
      scheduling, transportation), as well as patient-directed requests. Using HIV surveillance
      data (e.g. unsuppressed HIV viral load), patient supporters will be automatically alerted if
      a patient has a high viral load and prompted to contact the patient. In addition to
      appointment reminders, patients will receive positive reinforcement behavioral text messages.
