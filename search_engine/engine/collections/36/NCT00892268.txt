      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing pain, defined by improvements in
           overall WOMAC score at 6 weeks, in post-menopausal women with breast cancer and
           aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated arthralgia.

      Secondary

        -  To identify biologic correlates to acupuncture efficacy in this specific syndrome of
           AI-associated pain.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo acupuncture for 20-30 minutes, on the appropriate pain points on
           the anterior portion of the body alternating with posterior portion of the body, thrice
           weekly for 2 weeks and then twice weekly for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard-of-care analgesics (i.e., NSAIDs, narcotics,
           acetaminophen, or other) for 5 weeks. Patients not responding to analgesia may cross
           over to arm I.

      Patients are assessed periodically for improvement in pain, menopausal symptoms, and overall
      quality of life by the WOMAC, Brief Pain Inventory, and FACT-ES questionnaires.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months for biomarker
      studies of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and serotonin-transporter gene polymorphisms
      levels by ELISA.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6
      months.
