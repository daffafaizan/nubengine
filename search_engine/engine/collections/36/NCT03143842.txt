      and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language. It is not only
      important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is
      impacted by aging and by Alzheimer׳s disease. For decades, neuroscientists have investigated
      associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and
      memory.

      Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been delivered to patient populations (e.g. depression,
      epilepsy, …) for more than 25 years and there has been some indications that this technique
      has effects on cognition, more specifically memory. Studies have investigated VNS as a way to
      improve memory performance and it has been shown in some studies to enhance memory in rats
      and humans. It has also demonstrated to produce changes in the electrophysiological and
      metabolic profile of forebrain and brainstem structures involved in learning and memory.

      To investigate whether VNS can accelerate learning and improve associative memory when
      learning word pairs, we will investigate the performance of VNS implanted participants on a
      Verbal Paired-Associate memory task and compare their performance on the words that were
      learned while paired with VNS in contrast to their performance on the words that were learned
      while unpaired with VNS and in contrast to their performance on the words that were learned
      without VNS (i.e. 3 types/groups of words: paired with VNS, unpaired with VNS and without
      VNS) during the first visit and 1 day,1 week and 1 month after their first visit.
