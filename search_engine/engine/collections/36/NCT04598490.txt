      University of Science and Technology(JUST) Postgraduate Dental Teaching Clinics and labs.

      Participants and interventions: Twenty-eight subjects with bimaxillary proclination requiring
      extraction of all first premolar teeth participated in this study. In the lower arch, two
      groups were also identified; group 1 having the first premolar extracted before the
      commencement of orthodontic treatment and group 2 having the first premolar extracted just
      before space closure when 0.019 x 0.025 inch SS archwire was reached. Patients were
      followed-up monthly for three months. At every follow-up visit lower alginate impressions
      were taken. Extraction spaces in the lower arch follow-up models were measured using digital
      caliper.

      The rate of extraction space closure in the lower arch was assessed monthly.
