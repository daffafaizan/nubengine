    
      This is designed as an open label study of the effect of 600 mg and 1200mg gamma tocopherol
      (gt), orally administered daily for 8 days, on serum antioxidant levels in asthmatics and
      healthy volunteers. Each course of gamma tocopherol will be followed by a 7-8 day wash out
      period and serum testing to ensure that blood levels are back to baseline prior to starting
      the next course. The gamma tocopherol will be obtained from Yasoo Health Inc and contains
      623mg gt per 830 mg gelatin capsule.

      Allergy skin testing to a battery of allergens common to the region will be performed to
      determine the state of atopy both prior to drug administration and after the 8 day course.
      Allergic volunteers will be asked to abstain from taking any antihistamines during the 3 days
      prior to the skin testing. Repeat allergy testing will not be performed on subjects unable to
      hold antihistamines for health reasons, or on non-allergic volunteers who demonstrate no
      response to baseline testing. Spirometry will be performed to determine the current level of
      lung function. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking vitamin supplements,
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and other dietary supplements.
