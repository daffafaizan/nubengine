      or combination oral contraceptive pills), or the copper intrauterine device (IUD). Recent
      data will also allow women presenting for EC to be offered the LNG IUD. These recommendations
      leave out the only other long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), the ENG implant.
      Current guidelines allow for same-day ENG implant initiation at the time of an EC encounter,
      as long as oral LNG EC is co-administered. We lack data on pregnancy risk for the EC-eligible
      population desiring same-day ENG implant placement and oral EC.

      Women presenting for EC often need ongoing contraception, but clinical practice is not
      standardized in same-day counseling and initiation due to system, provider, and client-level
      barriers. Interest in LARC use continues to increase as well as same-day contraception
      initiation at the time of an EC encounter. Women presenting for EC may not have considered
      LARC options before. Generating estimates and continuation rates for same-day initiation with
      an EC encounter will improve contraceptive options for women seeking EC.
