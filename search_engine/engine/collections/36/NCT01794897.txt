    
      Design: We propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of patients with early
      course Schizophrenia (SZ) / schizoaffective disorder (SZA) patients exposed to HSV-1, who are
      receiving antipsychotic drugs. The effects of VAV augmentation or PLA as adjuncts to
      conventional antipsychotic drug treatment will be evaluated. As outcomes, we will evaluate
      clinical symptoms, cognitive variables, overall function (including social function) and side
      effects. The participants will be under the direct care of the Indian investigators during
      the study. Ratings will be performed blind by research staff. We will pre-screen for HSV-1
      exposure. There will be a 2 week placebo run in phase, 16 week augmentation and 4 week follow
      up to identify post-treatment side effects.
