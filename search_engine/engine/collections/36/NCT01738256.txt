      cost-effective intervention methods. The intervention methods are based on the principles of
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and further acceptance-commitment therapy (ACT). The
      interventions are delivered either face-to-face, via mobile application, or via Internet. The
      purpose of each intervention is to improve the subjects lifestyles and activate them towards
      beneficial changes in their everyday life. The psychological and physiological effects of
      interventions are measured with various invasive and non-invasive methods. The study gives
      new insight into effectiveness and acceptability of up-to-date psychological intervention
      methods, and new knowledge of different ways to deliver interventions for improving wellbeing
      of an individual.
