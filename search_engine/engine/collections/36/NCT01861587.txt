      (tDCS) in the management of postoperative pain. Specifically, this study will determine
      whether patients undergoing any type of inpatient surgical procedure that routinely requires
      at least a 1-day inpatient stay post-operatively will report less pain and use less opioid
      analgesics following a series of 20-minute sessions of tDCS (compared to sham tDCS) delivered
      up to twice per day post-operatively. In addition to comparing the effects of real tDCS to
      sham tDCS, the present study will evaluate the interaction of dose (number and frequency of
      tDCS sessions) and surgery type.
