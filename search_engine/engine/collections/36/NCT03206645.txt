      (paclitaxel and carboplatin), twice a week of each 21-day cycle. Chemotherapy will be
      administered on day 1 of each cycle by vein. Dose escalation levels for PTC-596 will occur
      per protocol and doses may be de-escalated for management of toxicity. Patients will receive
      a total of 3 cycles of PTC-596 and chemotherapy. Surgery will be performed within 6 weeks
      after the last dose of Cycle 3. An additional 3-7 cycles of PTC-596 and chemotherapy
      (carboplatin and paclitaxel) may be given as maintenance therapy for up to two years at the
      discretion of the treating physician.
