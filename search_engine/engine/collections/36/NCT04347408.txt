      The majority of coronaviruses cause disease in a specific host species but some have infected
      humans by cross-species transmission. This process has led to a number of severe outbreaks of
      human disease including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East
      respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.

      From December 2019 a novel infection "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"
      (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Wuhan region of China. The infection was identified as the
      causal factor in a growing number of severe cases of pneumonia. This disease was subsequently
      named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organisation (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 has
      been shown to cause severe disease similar to the previous SARS coronavirus from 2003. Severe
      disease is associated with pneumonia and damage to vital organs including lung, heart, liver,
      and kidney.

      Fortunately SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause only mild, or no, symptoms in children.

      The social distancing measures in the United Kingdom include the closure of schools and the
      cancelling of routine paediatric clinics. These drastic, but necessary, steps are likely to
      have a profound effect on the well-being of children.

      This study is required to determine what proportion of children have been exposed to
      SARS-Cov-2 and how many, if any, have neutralizing antibodies. The findings from this study
      could be used to inform public health decisions regarding the re-opening of schools and other
      services vital to the well-being of children.
