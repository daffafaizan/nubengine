      thromboembolism (VTE). How standard LMWH regimen should be adapted to provide both sufficient
      efficacy and safety in this setting is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare the
      influence of four BSD on peak anti-Xa levels in BS obese patients receiving high LMWH fixed
      doses to identify which one had the greatest impact and could further be proposed in
      LMWH-based thromboprophylaxis dosing algorithms.
