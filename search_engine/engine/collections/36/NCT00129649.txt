      investigators have found a non-attendance rate of 25% in their asthma clinics and would like
      to investigate whether a reminder phone call will improve attendance rates. Patients will be
      randomised into two groups; one group will receive a reminder phone call one week prior to
      their hospital consultation and the other group will be managed in the standard manner (i.e.
      no reminder of any sort). The phone calls will be carried out on a Friday afternoon by a
      respiratory nurse specialist and a research officer for two asthma clinics based on a
      Wednesday morning and a Thursday afternoon.

      To have an 80% chance of detecting a 10% reduction in non-attendance rates (at 5%) 500
      patients are required for this study. The rate of non-attendance will be monitored for all
      the patients in both groups and some demographic information will be recorded for each
      patient(age, sex, diagnosis and home postcode).
