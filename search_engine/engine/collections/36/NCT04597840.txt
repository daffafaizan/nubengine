      mesh. However, permanent synthetic mesh is contraindicated in contaminated surgical field due
      to higher risk of postoperative infection. In order to resist to infection, absorbable
      meshes, such as biological and biosynthetic meshes, have been developped. However, some
      controversies exist about the clinical benefit of biological meshes in the long term. Reasons
      for theses controversies are their overall risk of complication and recurrence and the lack
      of consensus in which surgical technique to apply. Moreover, the financial cost of biological
      meshes is very high. Recently developed, biosynthetic meshes appear to be a promising option
      ; Compared to biological meshes, they seem to have several advantages. However, such data
      demonstrating the beneficial use of biosynthetic mesh in contaminated incisional hernia
      repair is not available. In this regard, the COMpACT-BIO study aims to investigate the
      clinical and economic benefit of the use of biosynthetic mesh in contaminated incisional
      hernia repair in comparison to the standard of repair. This is a multicenter, prospective,
      longitudinal and randomized study, which also offers a standardized technique of repair.
