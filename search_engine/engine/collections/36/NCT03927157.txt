      group, phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 210 mg Q4W (SC) of
      tezepelumab in adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at
      least one additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 396
      subjects will be randomized regionally (China/non-China). Subjects will receive tezepelumab,
      or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the study site, over a 52-week
      treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.
