    
      In the initial phase of the study, up to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in 3 dose
      cohorts to determine the best dose of DNX-2401, as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e8 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by
           intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)

        -  Cohort 2: Single dose DNX-2401(5e9 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by
           intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)

        -  Cohort 3: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e10 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed
           by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)

      Following the initial phase, up to 36 additional subjects diagnosed with recurrent
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be enrolled to receive a single of DNX-2401 determined in
      the initial phase administered intratumorally followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3
      weeks.

      All subjects will return to the clinic for study follow-up visits at regular intervals for
      safety monitoring, MRI scans and other assessments, for up to 2 years or until disease
      progression. All subjects will be followed closely for safety and survival.
