      with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma (UC, bladder, ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis), renal
      cell carcinoma (RCC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
      (CSCC), or anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). Patients will be enrolled into one of 2
      cohorts. One cohort will receive a multiple low dose (MLD) regimen of GEN-011 to be given
      without lymphodepletion, and a second cohort will receive a single high dose (SHD) regimen of
      GEN-011 after lymphodepletion. Regardless of cohort, each dose of GEN-011 will be followed by
      a course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as costimulatory therapy.

      GEN-011 is an investigational, personalized neoantigen adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that is
      being developed by Genocea for the treatment of adult patients with advanced solid tumors. A
      proprietary tool developed by Genocea called ATLASâ„¢ (Antigen Lead Acquisition System) will be
      used to identify true immunogenic neoantigens from each patient's tumor that are recognized
      by their own CD4 and/or CD8 T cells. ATLAS-identified neoantigens will be used to stimulate
      and select autologous T cells collected by apheresis to generate an adoptive cell product ex
      vivo.
