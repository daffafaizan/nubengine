      make over 90% of the decisions on food purchases for family. Skin health is a major concern
      for women because skin ageing becomes visibly noticeable after age 30 due to UV exposure,
      oxidative stress, and collagen glycation. The investigators hypothesize that micronutrients
      in OJ, including vitamin C, flavanones, and carotenoids, protect skin against photoaging and
      wrinkling by alleviating oxidative stress, inflammation, and collagen glycation. The
      investigators further propose that daily OJ consumption (16 oz) will improve skin elasticity,
      barrier function, overall skin appearance and health. The study hypotheses will be tested in
      a 12-week clinical trial in 24 women aged 45-65 using a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design. Placebo will be formulated using decarbonated FantaÂ®
      orange soda to match the color, taste, and calorie content of OJ, but will contain no
      micronutrients. This research will measure UV-induced skin erythema, wrinkles, smoothness,
      roughness, elasticity, hydration, pH, melanin, and transepidermal water loss (a skin barrier
      index) of skin on both face and forearm. Skin strips and swabs will be collected and
      preserved for future assessments of skin lipids and colonized microorganisms (skin
      microbiome) because they are key factors affecting skin health. Positive results from this
      pilot trial will provide clinical evidence on the effectiveness of OJ to maintain skin health
      and reduce ageing. This research will be carried out by a research team with the experience
      and facilities for skin research.
