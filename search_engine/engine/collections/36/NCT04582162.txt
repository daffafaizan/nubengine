      University participated in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The test group
      received 4 short implants with ball abutments for the construction of a mandibular assisted
      overdenture, while the control group received 4 short implants splinted using a bar with a
      ball attachment for retaining a mandibular overdenture.
