      approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. As the population ages, the prevalence of
      hypertension is expected to increase even further unless broad and effective preventive
      measures are implemented. Recent data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that
      individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing
      hypertension. The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and risk of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors. The higher the
      BP, the greater is the chance of myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), stroke, and
      kidney disease.

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also a major health problem and has been described as one of two
      emerging cardiovascular epidemics at the turn of the century. It is the most frequent cardiac
      arrhythmia, affecting 5% of individuals aged > 65 years, and it is associated with an
      increased risk of stroke and a doubling of all-cause mortality. The loss of effective atrial
      contraction may result in impaired cardiac performance, reduced exercise tolerance and
      congestive heart failure. In addition, patients with atrial fibrillation often have disabling
      palpitations.

      Perindopril (Coversyl) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with demonstrated
      efficacy in controlling hypertension. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that ACE
      inhibition may reduce the incidence of new-onset AF as well as AF recurrences.
