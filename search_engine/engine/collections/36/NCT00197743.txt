      vitamin A, multivitamins including vitamin A, or vitamin A alone would reduce the risk of
      perinatal transmission of HIV and slow the rate of disease progression in a group of pregnant
      HIV infected women. We also examined the efficacy of the supplements on pregnancy outcomes,
      and risks of maternal and child morbidity and wasting.
