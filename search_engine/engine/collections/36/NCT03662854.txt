      to be conducted in La Jolla, CA and is primarily designed to evaluate safety in the clinical
      application of injected HSC by assessing the tolerability of HSC, as well as the volume that
      can be delivered safely in the intradermal region of the scalp using a syringe with 31-gauge
      1.75 mm length needle. The main study (18 weeks) involves the two treatment time points,
      collection of lab samples (blood/urine) for screening, and before and after the two treatment
      time points. Six of the seven total visits (including screening) in the study are conducted
      in the first 18 weeks. The final visit is for investigator monitoring, global photographs and
      final lab collection 30 days after the 18-week evaluation point. A 2 year follow up
      questionnaire will be sent to the patient to collect additional safety information.
      Additional dermatological exam of the scalp, as well as Subject and Investigator Assessments
      will also be assessed. The secondary goal of the study will be to explore whether an efficacy
      signal of the change in hair growth can be detected using an independent panel of physician's
      comparing global photographs taken at baseline to week 18 (and baseline to week 22), for
      changes.
