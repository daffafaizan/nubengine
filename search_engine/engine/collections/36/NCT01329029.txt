    
      The drug tested in this study is called Roflumilast. Roflumilast is being developed to treat
      people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the
      effect of roflumilast 500 μg tablets once daily versus placebo on exacerbation rate,
      pulmonary function, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in COPD patients who were
      concomitantly treated with a fixed combination of long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and
      inhaled glucocorticosteroids.

      The study was targeted to enroll approximately 1934 patients. Participants were randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Roflumilast 500 μg once daily

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a tablet that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient

      Trial treatment was taken in the morning by mouth after breakfast with some water.

      The trial consisted of the following periods:

        -  Single-blind baseline period (4 weeks) during which all patients received placebo.

        -  Double-blind treatment period (52 weeks) during which patients received either
           roflumilast or matching placebo.

        -  Safety follow-up (30 days after end of treatment (Vend) or premature discontinuation
           date) in case of ongoing Adverse Events at Vend, if necessary.

        -  Follow-up visit 12 weeks after end of treatment, at Week 64 (VFU), only for patients who
           completed the trial as scheduled.

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 64 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic which included a
      follow-up visit at week 64.
