      central nervous system. The reconstitution of gut microbiota might be a potential option to
      treat Tourette's syndrome (TS). This study aims to evaluate the role of selective microbiota
      transplantation on Tourette's syndrome (TS). Patients aged 7 to 60 years old with TS and a
      Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) -total tic score â‰¥20 will be enrolled in this
      open-label clinical trial. Participants will receive 200ml selective microbiota suspension
      (namely mini-FMT, mixed species of cultured bacteria) daily through the nasojejunal
      transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) tube for 3 days. Clinical evaluations before, 1, 4 and 8
      weeks after mini-FMT will be assessed with the YGTSS, the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome
      Quality-of-Life Scale (GTS-QOL), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity, the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the
      Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). 16S rRNA stool analysis will be performed to assess associated
      microbial changes. The urinary metabolic profiles of those patients will be generated using
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Safety will be assessed in all patients after
      treatment.
