      However, liver biopsy is invasive and involves a risk of bleeding and pain. Biopsy may also
      miss significant pathology if the small biopsy specimen is taken from an uninvolved part of
      the liver. Non-invasive techniques such as MRI are now used to evaluate the liver iron
      content. MRI can visualize the whole liver and measure liver iron content. MRI, however, will
      not detect liver scarring.

      Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) is a non-invasive ultrasound tool for assessing
      liver fibrosis or scarring by measuring liver stiffness (LSM). Compared with liver biopsy,
      FibroScan provides immediate results and is a painless, short (3 mins), simple procedure to
      perform. In some studies FibroScan reports have correlated well with liver biopsy results of
      fibrosis and cirrhosis, and with Ferriscan, ferritin and liver function tests.

      This purpose of this study is to investigate the role of FibroScan in individuals with sickle
      cell anemia and iron overload or who have a diagnosis of liver disease, and to compare
      FibroScan readings with magnetic resonance imaging.

      We will also compare the results of the Fibroscan with liver biopsy.

      This study will also compare the results of FibroScan to patients with Sickle cell without
      any known liver disease, who have never been on chronic transfusions (defined as no more than
      4 transfusions in lifetime) and who have normal liver function profiles.
