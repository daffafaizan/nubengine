      cross-over, double-blind, placebo-based study to examine the impact of an evening of alcohol
      vs. placebo/fluid-control on autonomic and cardiovascular control at night and the subsequent
      morning. The study will utilize established techniques for assessing sleep (polysomnography)
      and autonomic/cardiovascular control (microneurography, beat-to-beat finger plethysmography,
      electrocardiogram, etc.). All subjects will undergo a familiarization night in the sleep
      laboratory prior to their first randomized test session with either alcohol or
      placebo/fluid-control. Both men and women will be tested to address a secondary aim of
      determining the impact of sex (male vs. female) and ovarian cycle (early follicular vs.
      midluteal phase) on sympathetic neural responsiveness to evening alcohol in binge drinkers.
      Finally, as a tertiary/exploratory aim, participants that have a respiratory disturbance
      index of â‰¥5 episodes per hour during the alcohol treatment will be asked to consider one
      additional overnight session where they will be randomly assigned to either continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) or sham-CPAP for one additional night of evening alcohol
      consumption.
