      sick leaves in Denmark; among these are patients with facet joint pain syndrome. A proposed
      treatment option is cryoneurolysis. This study aims to investigate the effect of
      cryoneurolysis in lumbar facet joint pain syndrome

      Methods: A single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) is performed including 120
      participants with chronic facet joint pain syndrome, referred to the Department of
      Neurosurgery, Aarhus University Hospital. Eligible patients receive a diagnostic anesthetic
      block, where a reduction of pain intensity >50 % on a numerical rating scale (NRS) is
      required to be enrolled. Participants are randomized into three groups to undergo either one
      treatment of cryoneurolysis, radiofrequency ablation or placebo. Fluoroscopy and sensory
      stimulation is used to identify the intended target nerve prior to administrating the
      above-mentioned treatments. All groups receive physiotherapy for 6 weeks, starting 4 weeks
      after treatment. The primary outcome is a reduction in low-back pain intensity and an
      impression of change in pain after intervention (Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC))
      at 4 weeks follow-up, prior to physiotherapy. Secondary outcomes are quality of life (EQ-5D,
      SF-36) and level of function (Oswestry Disability Index), psychological perception of pain
      (Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and depression status (Major Depression Inventory). Data will be
      assessed at baseline (T0), randomization (T1), day one (T2), 4 weeks (T3), 3 (T4), 6 (T5) and
      12 months
