    
      -  Prove the effectiveness of 20 Gy (and non-inferiority to actually recommended 30 Gy)
           with respect to response rate 6 months after radiotherapy.

        -  Correlation of blood serum biomarker levels with lymphoma response to radiation
           treatment

        -  Recording of survival rates, quality of life (QoL), radiogenic toxicities and
           inflammation relevant molecules in blood serum.

      Primary Objective:

      Response rate 6 months after end of treatment, 4 categories according to GELA-criteria: CR
      (complete remission) = CR or pMRD (probable minimal residual disease), PR (partial remission)
      = rRD (responding residual disease), NC (no change), PD (progressive disease)

      Secondary Objectives:

      QoL according to EORTC (QLQ C30 and STO22). EFS=Event-free survival (time to any failure or
      death from any cause, patients in CR or PR), LSS=lymphoma-specific survival (time to death
      related to lymphoma or associated with the treatment, all patients), PFS=Progression-free
      survival (time to progression of lymphoma or death from any cause, all patients), OS=overall
      survival (time to death from any cause, all patients). Level of cytokines IL-1Î², IL-4, IL-8,
      TNFalpha and other inflammation relevant molecules Syndecan1, MMP-2 and S100 proteins. Acute
      toxicities during treatment according to NCI-CTC, chronic toxicities according to NCI-CTC/
      LENT-SOMA.
