      bacteria is transplanted to mid-gut (at least below the second part of duodenum ) through
      regular gastroscope. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive fecal
      microbiota transplantation only once or traditional therapy, and accept follow-up for at
      least one year. Blood tests,OGTT and magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to assess
      participants at study start and at study completion.
