      Statistical Analyses:

      We used a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences among the four
      assessments in each of the variables, using paired t-test with Bonferroni correction when a
      significant effect was detected. We performed all the analysis by The Statistical Package for
      Social Sciences (SPSS 19.0 Version).The statistical analysis was conducted at a 95%
      confidence level. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
