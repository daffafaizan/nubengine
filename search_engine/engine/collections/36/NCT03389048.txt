      (NoL) Index in identify and discriminate between painful event and non-painful period
      following pain stimulus of Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test in patients with degenerative
      lumbar spine disease. This feasibility study may provide first indication for a validation
      method that will be able to evaluate the outcome of a surgical procedure within the
      degenerative lumbar spine patient. Currently, there is lack of understanding of long-term
      outcomes after such surgeries.

      In this study, the investigators plan to demonstrate that the NoL Index may serve as an
      indicator to the surgical procedure outcome. It will compare the objective measurement of the
      NoL to the patient Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and disability questionnaire that will
      characterize the subject pain perception prior and following the surgical procedure.
