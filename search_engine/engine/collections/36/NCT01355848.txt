      patients following a suicide attempt provided during hospitalization in an acute medical
      setting, and will be addressed with a sample of cases (N = 40) from Harborview. The
      participants will be randomized into one of two groups: those that receive the intervention
      and those that do not. All participants will complete a battery of assessments The
      intervention is based on the theory of teachable moments, wherein timing in proximity to
      injury and appropriate treatment setting provide a unique opportunity to create patient
      behavioral change. The brief intervention consists of engaging the patient in conversation
      regarding suicidal ambivalence (desire to live vs. desire to die), collaborative discovery of
      primary and secondary drivers of suicidality, and safety planning. A guide to delivering the
      intervention has been completed and may undergo changes throughout the study. Adherence
      measures will be developed in order to assess the degree to which the clinician accurately
      provided the brief intervention without including additional therapeutic elements or leaving
      out elements required in the intervention guide. Best methods for integrating the brief
      intervention into services provided on medical and surgical units will be determined, as
      well.
