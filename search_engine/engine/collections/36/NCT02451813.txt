      femoral nerve block will be recruited. Femoral nerve will be identified using a linear
      ultrasound transducer. A 22 GA 5 cm nerve block needle will be inserted with bevel downward
      and advanced to the following conditions:

        1. Needle tip slightly indenting the fascia iliaca lateral to the femoral nerve

        2. Needle tip advanced through fascia iliaca

        3. Needle tip slightly indenting the anterior surface of the femoral nerve

        4. Needle tip withdrawn 1 mm from nerve.

      At each of these conditions, 1 ml of dextrose solution will be injected via an automated pump
      at 10 ml/min and the spread of injectate observed sonographically. Simultaneously, a blinded
      observer will measure opening injection pressure using both an electronic and a mechanical
      transducer. If opening pressure reaches 15 psi, this investigator will halt the injection. In
      addition, minimum threshold current required to elicit a motor response will be recorded for
      conditions 3 and 4. Patients will be contacted at 7 days and asked about any adverse effects.
