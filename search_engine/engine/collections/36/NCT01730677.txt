    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase II study. Patients will be
      randomized to either lapatinib plus vinorelbine (LV) arm or vinorelbine alone (V) arm, if
      they are satisfied by inclusion and exclusion criteria. The stratification factors are
      followings: 1) visceral metastasis vs. others, 2) previous response to lapatinib treatment,
      complete response(CR)+partial response(PR) vs. stable disease(SD)≥ 12wks.

      Patients in LV arm will receive daily lapatinib 1,000mg with vinorelbine 20mg/m2 day1 and day
      8. Patients in V arm will receive vinorelbine 30mg/m2 day 1 and day 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days unless there is any evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or
      noncompliance by patient with protocol requirements. Response will be documented by physical
      examination, chest or abdomen CT prior to treatment as a baseline, and every 2 cycles (window
      period ± 1 week) after a start of treatment and at 18 weeks.
