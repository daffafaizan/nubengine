    
      Parkinson's disease is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease.At present,
      researchers focus not only on the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but also on the
      non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (including mood disorders, sleep disorders,
      cognitive decline, and autonomic nervous kinetic disorder, etc.).The principle of
      transcranial magnetic stimulation is based on the electromagnetic principle proposed by
      Faraday. When an electrifying coil is suspended over the scalp at a certain distance, the
      magnetic field generated by the coil current and the electric field generated by the magnetic
      field can reach the skull and directly or indirectly affect the synapses and neurons in the
      brain.The study by giving a sleep disorder Parkinson's disease patients with different
      patterns of ultra-low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham stimulation, scale
      for assessment of the patients were observed, hematology and imaging changes before and after
      therapy, clear ultra-low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation for sleep disorder
      Parkinson's disease treatment, to explore the mechanism of action, compare the difference
      between different modes.
