      dependent quality of life measured by questionnaires. HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life)
      is measured at baseline, after 3 months, 6 months and 9 months follow up. Patients are
      recruited from the out-patient clinic at the Department of Dermatology of the University
      Hospital Zurich. Patients are randomized in an intervention and control group. Intervention
      group receives the education program additionally to follow-up visits whereas the control
      group receives follow-up visits. Several runs are planned.
