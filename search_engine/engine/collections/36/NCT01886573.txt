      I. To measure reversal of aberrant genome-wide promoter methylation and gene re-expression in
      paired, pre- and post- treatment lung tumor tissue pairs from patients with newly diagnosed,
      surgically resectable non-small cell lung cancer before and after exposure to a single
      neoadjuvant cycle of 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and entinostat.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the 3-year disease-free survival of operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      patients who receive 1 cycle of preoperative epigenetic treatment.

      II. To determine any potential toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities, of a single
      pre-operative cycle of 5-azacytidine and entinostat.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally
      (PO) on days 3 and 10. Patients undergo surgery between days 11-20 (this period can be
      extended 10 more days if adverse events from therapy impose a surgical risk).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
