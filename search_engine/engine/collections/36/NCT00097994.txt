      seeking to enroll 720 women from the University of Pittsburgh's Division of General Internal
      Medicine Outpatient practice (GIMO) at all stages of menopause (pre-, peri-, and
      post-menopausal), between 40 and 65 years old. They will be followed for 5 years as they
      progress through menopause.

      Women will complete yearly questionnaires during their usual doctor's visit (or by phone or
      online if necessary) regarding general health, menopause and menopausal symptoms, health
      related quality of life, traditional and alternative therapy use, social support, and
      attitudes towards menopause and aging.

      We will combine this information with information from women's medical charts to look at how
      menopause and health related quality of life impact the use of health care resources.
      Additionally, some women may be asked about the use of health care resources, such as
      doctor's visits, hospitalizations and lab tests.
