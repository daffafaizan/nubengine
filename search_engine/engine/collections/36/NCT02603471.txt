      therapy (CBT) intervention using text messaging via mobile phone technology (ALC-TXT-CBT) to
      reduce alcohol use, reduce HIV-risk behaviors and facilitate medication adherence in a
      population of alcohol dependent adults with HIV-infection and 2) examine potential mechanisms
      of action of ALC-TXT-CBT. The investigators hypothesize that ALC-TXT-CBT will produce greater
      reductions in alcohol use and HIV-risk behaviors, and will improve HIV treatment regimen and
      naltrexone (Vivitrol) adherence, relative to the control condition (informational pamphlet).

      Further, the investigators expect that ALC-TXT-CBT will facilitate greater changes in
      negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support, and these changes will be associated with
      substance use outcomes.
