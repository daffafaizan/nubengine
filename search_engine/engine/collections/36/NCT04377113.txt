    
      Cellular immunity will be investigated in the two group of patients: operated patients with
      RCC and healthy volunteers.

      In the study investigators will determine patterns of aggregation of tumor infiltrating
      immune cells in the blood (RCC patients and volunteers), healthy kidney and carcinomatous
      tissue as their cytotoxicity (only RCC patients).

      Investigators will determine:

        1. presence of different immune cells in the blood and kidney tissue (T lymphocytes, NK
           cells, NKT cells, T regulatory cells),

        2. presence and distribution of cytolytic molecule perforin and granulysin in immune cells
           (T lymphocytes, NK cells, NKT cells) in the blood, kidney tissue and urine

        3. NK cytotoxicity

        4. possible correlation between presence of immune cells and clinical prognostic factors
