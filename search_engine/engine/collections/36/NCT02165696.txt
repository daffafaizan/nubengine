      research will be carried out by a multicenter way

      Quantitative approach consist in carried out a single-blind randomized controlled trial of 44
      women with arm lymphedema. Patients will be distributed in two intervention groups by a
      randomized way. Participants will be given his assignment by closed envelope. Both treatments
      will be administered five days a week for six weeks. The experimental group (n=22) will
      receive multimodal treatment: combination of manual lymphatic drainage and compression
      bandaging. The control group (n=22) only will receive manual lymphatic drainage. We want to
      determinate the effect on volume arm decrease, quality of life, level of hand strength,
      degree of pain, fatigue level, and state of anxiety and depression. The influence on the
      lymphedema will be analyzed with lower limbs strength, physical activity, lung function,
      respiratory muscle strength by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurements (MIP
      and MEP) and cardiorespiratory functional capacity. Patients adherence will be analyzed by a
      smartphone.

      Qualitative apprach: to know the perceptions and experiences of the participants in both
      interventions groups through a qualitative descriptive study. Data will be obtained with
      semi-structured depth interview.
