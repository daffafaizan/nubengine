      group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg 1 month before planned percutaneous coronary
      interventions and for 12 months thereafter in addition to previously taken hypoglycemic
      therapy. Patients of the second group will continue to take previously prescribed
      hypoglycemic therapy.

      Thus, the safety and effectiveness of empagliflozin for preoperative preparation of patients
      with type 2 diabetes before planned percutaneous coronary interventions will be evaluated, as
      well as the impact on the immediate and long-term outcomes of percutaneous coronary
      interventions in comparison with patients on standard hypoglycemic therapy
