      active-controlled trial. ADHD-children and adolescents of both sexes, 6-17 of age,
      effectively treated with stimulants are recruited in two centres. Over a naturalistic run-in
      phase of four weeks adherence to medication taken before randomisation is measured. In the
      subsequent controlled clinical trial 50% of the participants are randomized to extended
      release (ER) methylphenidate (Medikinet retard®) applied with breakfast, 50% are randomized
      to immediate release (IR) methylphenidate (Medikinet®) in the morning and 3-4 h later
      (clinical trial). To optimize ecological validity, no double-dummy technique is applied; the
      allocation to either study arm is non-blinded.

      According to the power calculation 106 patients will be randomized. The total duration of the
      study is 18 months. Starting with a run-in visit, each eligible patient is observed in the
      naturalistic run-in phase for four weeks. Subsequently, patients participate 100 days in the
      clinical trial starting with a baseline visit, an in between-visit and a final visit. Medical
      care is provided in the routine program of both study centres. To record the adherence,
      medication events are counted by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS).
