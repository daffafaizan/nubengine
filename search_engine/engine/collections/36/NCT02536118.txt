    
      The Micra Registry is a global, prospective, observational, multi-site registry. Patients
      enrolled in the Micra Registry will be prospectively followed for a minimum of 9 years
      post-implant or until registry closure, patient death, patient exit from the registry (i.e.,
      withdrawal of consent), or unless patient is participating in an acute performance sub-study
      of the Micra Registry*.

      Enrolled patients will have scheduled follow-up visits at least annually or as prompted by
      reportable adverse events; however, all Micra system follow-up patient visits are to be
      reported. Therefore, if more frequent scheduled visits occur per a provider's standard care
      practice, those visits are reported. The total estimated registry duration is 11 years.

      *Patients contributing to an acute performance sub-study of the Micra Registry do not
      contribute to the FDA-regulated Post-Approval Study which includes a long-term (minimum
      9-year) patient follow-up period.
