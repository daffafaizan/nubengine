      aggregated data should be avoided whenever possible; only in case of limitations due to
      national laws or ethical requirements should a participating registry transmit aggregated
      data. Every single case requires a data sheet (DS). Data will be collected within the
      national, regional or local participating registries (either as a computer-based export from
      the national, regional or local registry or as a paper-based DS. After validation and
      anonymisation of data by participating registries the data will then be transferred only via
      the national coordinator (computer-based) to the study centre. National coordinators are
      responsible for quality control i.e. the completeness reliability and accuracy of the of
      data, including timely submission of data to the study management group. Every DS will be
      identified by a unique number, including the country and region of origin. Registries that
      cannot transfer unprocessed original data due to the reasons mentioned above will collect
      data themselves. These registries will then send aggregated data to the study centre.
      Participating registries must collect basic EMS data on the region and population served.
      This registry-specific information must only be transmitted once during the study period.
      Data (computer and paper-based) will be handled according to national laws concerning data
      security; the national coordinator is responsible for maintaining the necessary standards.
      Access to the data will be protected by username and password.
