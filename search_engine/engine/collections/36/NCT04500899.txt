      sometimes underestimates the severity of mitral regurgitation, due to hemodynamic variations
      that occurs with normal physical activity and under the effect of sedation which is used to
      perform transesophageal echocardiography. By using phenylephrine during transesophageal
      echocardiography, the study intends to offset the hemodynamic variation that occurs with
      sedation and better assess the severity of mitral regurgitation, which would further assist
      in clinical decision-making regarding treatment. The goal of this study is to compare the
      severity of mitral regurgitation grade before and after the administration of phenylephrine
      during transesophageal echocardiography and to demonstrate a 25% increase in severity of
      mitral regurgitation grade compared to the baseline conditions, following the administration
      of phenylephrine.
