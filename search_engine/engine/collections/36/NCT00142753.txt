      in ATN 024 are HIV-infected youths aged 12-24 years while participants in ATN 025 are
      HIV-uninfected youths aged 12-17 years. These youths must also be negative for HBV core
      antibody, HBV surface antigen, and HBV surface antibody to be eligible.

      Blood will be drawn from study participants prior to immunization, 1 month after completion
      of primary immunization and at study exit (week 72 for ATN 024 and week 76 for ATN 025) for
      cytokine assays and enumeration of antibody-secreting cells. In addition, the antibody to HBV
      surface antigen will be determined 2 and 4 weeks after supplemental immunization in
      nonresponders to the primary series and at study exit.

      This laboratory substudy is designed to evaluate some aspects of cellular immune response to
      hepatitis B vaccination that are directly related to the generation and durability of
      antibody response to HBV surface antigen in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adolescents.
      Cytokine production by peripheral mononuclear cells will be determined following in-vitro
      stimulation, and antibody-secreting cells will be enumerated.
