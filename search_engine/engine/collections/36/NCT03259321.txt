      heavily debated but evidence from large populations in China is still lacking. We aim to
      utilize data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011). We will calculate
      cumulative means of fish and PUFA intake based on 3-day food records in each wave.
      Sex-specific Cox regression models will be used to estimate relative risk of T2D. Results
      from this work will provide epidemiological evidence for improving recommendations on fish
      and PUFA intake for Chinese in dietary guidelines.
