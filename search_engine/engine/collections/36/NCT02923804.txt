      randomized to a treatment arm of high concentrate capsules or placebo for a 6 month treatment
      period.Omega-3 content of red blood cells (omega-3 index) will be measured for primary
      endpoint assessment. Quantitative MRI will be performed to determine the effect on liver fat
      content.
