      Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that impairs ion transport at
      epithelial surfaces. This results in the accumulation of dehydrated secretions in the airways
      and chronic infection and inflammation in the lungs, leading to significant morbidity and
      mortality. The investigators understanding of CF pathogenesis has increased substantially and
      many new targeted therapies are being developed to treat this disease, however, the
      measurements of clinical efficacy used to evaluate these therapies require long trials to
      demonstrate an effect. New translational techniques are needed to assess changes in the most
      basic aspects of the disease and allow for the rapid screening of disease-altering therapies.
      The investigators have recently developed a novel aerosol-based imaging technique to measure
      liquid absorption in the airways - a central pathophysiological process related to CFTR
      dysfunction. The investigators propose that airway liquid hyper-absorption is a key link
      between cellular defects in ion and fluid transport and progressive airway dysfunction in CF.
      Thus The investigators technique may provide a measure of disease severity and rapid
      indication of therapeutic correction in advance of currently available outcome measures.
