      because of the widespread use of alcohol, cigarettes, and certain psychotropic drugs in this
      population. Consequently, they are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors. To our knowledge,
      no studies have been conducted to determine the effects of proton pump inhibitors on plasma
      levels of psychotropic drugs. The present clinical study will assess the effects of
      pantoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid, lithium, and second-generation
      antipsychotics.
