      to review their social participation profile and given a brief psycho-education about memory.

      They are then randomly allocated to one of the two following conditions. Participants are
      primed either with age stereotypes or non-age stereotypes words by implicit priming
      intervention in the context of a reaction task prior to the episodic memory tasks. Other
      measures such as demographic variables and social participation rate are collected by
      questionnaire during the delayed recall interval.
