    
      Multi-center, phase 2, single arm, open-label study of oral selinexor monotherapy in patients
      with Richter's Transformation, arising in the setting of prior CLL, documented by
      histologically confirmed lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and immunoblastic
      variants. Eligible patients must have had at least one prior regimen for CLL. Approximately
      50 patients are anticipated to be treated in this study. Eligible patients following
      screening will receive selinexor orally twice weekly at a dose of 60 mg. The selinexor dose
      may be increased to 80 mg after Cycle 1 unless clinically contraindicated. Patients may
      continue in multiple treatment cycles at a given dose; there is no maximum treatment
      duration. Each cycle is 28 days. Dose adjustments will be made as appropriate by the
      investigator.

      Patients who were treated twice weekly for weeks 1-3 under a previous version of the protocol
      may, at the discretion of the investigator, have had the frequency of selinexor dosing
      increased to twice weekly for weeks 1-4. If there was no contraindicated toxicity, the
      selinexor dose may have been increased to 80 mg at Cycle 3.
