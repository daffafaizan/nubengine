      resectable, stage II or stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Characterize the acute
      toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the antitumor activity of this drug in
      these patients. IV. Monitor and quantitate the plasma levels of perillyl alcohol after oral
      administration in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol 4 times daily on days 1-14. Patients undergo
      surgical resection on day 15. There is no continuation of perillyl alcohol postoperatively.
      Patients are followed at a minimum of 2 and 4 months following surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
