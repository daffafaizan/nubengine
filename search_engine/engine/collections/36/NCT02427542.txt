      detachment and unreality about oneself (DP) or the external world (DR). Cognitive Behavioural
      Therapy (CBT) has been found to be beneficial in treating patients with chronic DP/DR. CBT
      for DP/DR includes educating patients about these experiences so they have a better
      understanding and less fear; teaching ways of coping to help them manage the symptoms better;
      helping reduce the impact on their day to day functioning; and working together to find less
      distressing ways of interpreting these experiences. Recent research has highlighted that
      DP/DR symptoms are common in people diagnosed with psychotic disorders, and when present are
      linked with more severe psychotic symptoms. However, there has been no previous study to
      ascertain if CBT to target DP/DR in psychosis would be effective. This study therefore aims
      to establish the feasibility of a brief CBT intervention for DP/DR in people diagnosed with a
      psychotic disorder. It is hoped that the CBT will reduce the distress associated with DP/DR
      experiences, with a possibility of reducing psychotic phenomena in addition. The
      investigators will seek to recruit adults aged 18-70 with a current psychotic symptoms as
      well as meeting threshold for DP/DR disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive six sessions of CBT or to a treatment as usual control. Outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline and follow-up interview at 10 weeks.
