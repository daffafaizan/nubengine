      (ADHD) may be clinically useful. Rhodiola rosea is an herbal medicine used for centuries in
      various medical conditions. Many randomized controlled trials have evaluated its usefulness
      in stress and fatigue. There were benefits in attention in some of these studies. Mild side
      effects and beneficial antioxidant properties make reasonable an assessment of its potential
      benefits in adults with ADHD. To our knowledge, Rhodiola rosea has never been studied in
      adults with ADHD.
