      vaccinated against meningococcal infections were divided into two subgroups according to the
      eculizumab treatment status (Soliris速 na誰ve patients / patients who had received Soliris速 at
      a maintenance dose prior to the trial inclusion). Each subgroup included an even number of
      patients to maintain recruitment balance. Then, patients of each subgroup were distributed
      into one of two treatment groups by the method of stratified block randomization at a 1:1
      ratio into groups A and B, respectively. In the first group (Group A), patients received
      infusions of Elizaria (eculizumab, GENERIUM JSC), in the second one (Group B) - infusions of
      Soliris速.

      The duration of participation of each patient in the study, including the screening period,
      was about 30 weeks.
