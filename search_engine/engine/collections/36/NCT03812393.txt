    
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, interventional study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a pan-HER inhibitor in patients with
      ER-/PR-/HER2-(triple-negative) invasive breast cancer who have abnormal HER2-driven signaling
      activity determined by the Celcuity CELx HER2 signal function (HSF) test. Patients will be
      required to have a prescreening research core needle biopsy to procure a fresh tumor specimen
      that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess the status of their
      HER2-driven signaling activity (abnormally or normally active). While waiting for results of
      the CELx HSF test, patients may receive the first dose of weekly paclitaxel at the
      investigator's discretion. Patients whose CELx HSF test indicate they have abnormal
      HER2-driven signaling activity will then receive neratinib as a single agent daily for 21
      days and then neratinib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether patients with triple-negative breast
      cancers (estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors < 10%; HER2-negative per standard
      ASCO/CAP testing criteria), but with abnormal HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by
      the Celcuity CELx HSF assay, and who receive HER2-targeted therapy with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy will have a higher rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast
      and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found historically in patients
      with triple-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary
      endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast), clinical complete response (cCR),
      residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship between quantitative CELx score and
      pCR rate.

      It is expected that approximately 135 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll
      27 patients who have abnormal HER2-driven signaling activity.
