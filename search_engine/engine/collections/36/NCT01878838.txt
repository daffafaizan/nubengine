    
      The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the performance of two commercially
      available and FDA cleared femtosecond laser systems in patients undergoing femtosecond
      laser-assisted cataract surgery. Objective data on the repeatability and accuracy of the
      studied parameters will be gathered and reported as endpoints of the study.

      The two systems studied are the Catalys™ Precision Laser System (OptiMedica, CA, USA) and the
      LenSx® Laser System (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX).

      Published data have suggested that the femtosecond laser is a useful tool for cataract
      surgery.

      This study is to determine whether differences or similarities exist in specific treatment
      parameters achieved with two FDA cleared and commercially available femtosecond laser
      cataract surgery platforms
