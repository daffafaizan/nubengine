      of their highly proliferative character. This differential tumor / healthy tissue property is
      an opportunity to be able to propose a treatment whose therapeutic gain can be major
      (targeted treatment). Preclinical studies are multiple and showed that the targeting of
      overexpressed proteins (carbonic anhydrases) and involved in glycolytic metabolism can lead
      to a significant anti-tumor effect. This has never been tested in humans.

      Acetazolamide is a molecule commonly used for non carcinologic purposes but has demonstrated
      anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies; there is also synergy radiotherapy / targeting of
      carbonic anhydrases. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the combination of
      acetazolamide / radiotherapy / chemotherapy with platinum and etoposide in localized Small
      Cell Lung cancer.

      This would be the first study:

        -  targeting glucose metabolism,

        -  testing the effectiveness of acetazolamide in oncology,

        -  testing the synergy radiotherapy / targeting glycolytic metabolism,

        -  trying to manipulate the anti-tumor immune system indirectly, by decreasing
           extracellular acidosis.
