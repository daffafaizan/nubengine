    
      The Primary Endpoint of this study is Tumour resectability at surgery. Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Safety assessed by SAE and AE monitoring (NCI CTCAE v3.0)

        2. Tumour response assessed by imaging (RECIST and necrosis)

        3. Viable residual tumour assessed by pathological evaluation of resected liver tissue.

        4. Recurrence (time and site) following resection

        5. Correlation of tumour response by imaging and pathology
