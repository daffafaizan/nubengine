      of doxazosin (1-10mg) for PTSD nightmares, sleep disturbance and overall PTSD symptoms. The
      target sample will consist of 60 male and female subjects with chronic PTSD symptoms and
      prominent nightmares randomly assigned to receive doxazosin (n=30) or placebo (n=30).
      Participants will be enrolled at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Following baseline
      consent procedures, eligibility assessments, and 1-week of baseline assessments including
      self-report surveys, actigraphy, and at-home EEG (Sleep Profiler), all subjects will initiate
      doxazosin or equivalently marked placebo at 1mg at bedtime. Subjects will undergo a 4-week
      titration phase during which doxazosin or placebo may be increased to a maximum dose of 10mg
      (or equivalently marked placebo) at bedtime based on symptoms and tolerability. After the
      4-week titration phase, subjects will continue at stable dose of study medication for a
      4-week stable dose phase. Subjects will be asked to complete sleep diaries daily during their
      participation in the study. In the last week of the stable dose phase, participants will
      undergo an additional week of at-home sleep monitoring using actigraphy, complete end of
      treatment surveys, and undergo end-of-treatment clinical assessments and discontinuation of
      study medication. After discontinuation of study medication, participants will complete three
      additional days of sleep diaries.
