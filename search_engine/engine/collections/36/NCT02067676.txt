    
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating study in which a total of 48 healthy volunteers will
      receive 2 vaccinations (one on Day 0 and one on Day 28 ± 2 days).

      There are 3 cohorts (dose levels) with 2 groups of 8 volunteers in each cohort. A cohort will
      be administered one of 3 intramuscular (IM) doses at 2 μg, 5 μg, or 10 μg of
      Capsule-Conjugate Campylobacter Vaccine (CJCV1) with or without Alhydrogel®, aluminum
      hydroxide adjuvant (alum) at 125 μg.

      An interval no less than 1 week will separate the last dose of a volunteer group from the
      first dose of the next volunteer group (receiving different CJCV1 doses). Blood specimens
      will be collected at intervals to examine systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune
      responses. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days (± 2
      days) following the second vaccination and complete the study with a telephone follow-up
      approximately 6 months (± 1 month) after the first vaccination. The total duration of
      participation in this study is up to 270 days (including screening).
