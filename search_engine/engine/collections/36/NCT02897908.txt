      another application on the machine called controlled attenuation parameter or Controlled
      Attenuation Parameters (CAP). The liver stiffness measurements are then translated into a
      score that tells how much liver fibrosis or fat is present. Patients identified with
      potential for fatty liver or specific liver-related diseases causing fibrosis would be
      approached for a voluntary FibroScan measurement. From these patients, the investigators will
      collect information related to demographics, disease history, medical comorbidities, social
      history, laboratory and radiologic parameters. This information, along with clinical data
      associated with the patient will be placed in a database for use in identifying potential
      subjects for future trials.
