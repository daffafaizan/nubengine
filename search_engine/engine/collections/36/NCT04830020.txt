      clinician (Remdesivir, systemic corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma,
      biologic cytokine inhibitors and other interventions as per the latest guidelines). Patients
      randomized to the active intervention group will also receive HMW-HA (YabroÂ®, 5 ml of saline
      containing 0.3% hyaluronic acid sodium salt) via nebulizer, while patients randomized in the
      control group will receive a matching placebo two times daily.

      Due to increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the usual mask nebulization procedure,
      patients will receive the nebulized treatment via high-flow oxygen tubing as described in the
      literature 36-38. Patients will be treated until there is a qualitative change in oxygen
      requirement, i.e. either progression to assisted ventilation (non-invasive or invasive), or
      weaning from oxygen supplementation. Because COVID19 may result in long-term O2 dependency,
      the study and treatment period will be limited to a maximum of 10 days.

      Moreover, a blood sample (20 ml) will be taken at baseline and after 10 days of treatment.
