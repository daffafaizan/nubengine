    
      This study is a non-randomized, prospective, interventional, multicentric study.

      Patients implanted with an Abbott Â® CRT pacemaker or defibrillator since less than 3 months
      are eligible for the study.

      Recruited patients will be submitted to a non-invasive evaluation of different pacing modes.
      This will be performed using the Finapress NOVA device, which records blood pressure with a
      digital cuff. The peak of blood pressure will correspond to the optimal device settings

      Three modes of stimulation of ABBOTT CRT devices will be compared:

        -  Classical bi-ventricular pacing mode at nominal value and with AV delay optimization

        -  SyncAV mode at nominal value or with left ventricular preexcitation optimization

        -  Multipoint Pacing (MPP) mode, alone or in combination with SyncAV mode This is an acute
           evaluation study without scheduled follow-up.
