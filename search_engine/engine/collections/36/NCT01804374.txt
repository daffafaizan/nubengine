      further line treatments still have a poor outcome. Standard chemotherapy has limited activity
      in these patients.

      In a previous study in patient affected by relapsed unresectable osteosarcoma, sorafenib
      alone demonstrated promising activity. In the preclinical setting, everolimus was able to
      improve the activity of sorafenib. Sorafenib and everolimus, by hitting crucial pathways
      which are essential for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival, with an entirely
      different approach aimed to overcome the resistance to standard chemotherapy showed by
      relapsed osteosarcoma. In this trial, all patients will be treated with sorafenib and
      everolimus at the dosage of 800 mg and 5 mg per day, respectively. Both drugs have to be
      taken orally. The treatment will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicities.
      The objective of the present trial is to obtain a 50% rate of patients alive and free from
      progression of their disease 6 months after trial enrolment. The disease will be evaluated
      every 2 months with a CT scan.
