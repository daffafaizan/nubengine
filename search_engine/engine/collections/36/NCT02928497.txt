    
      The ASAP-TOO study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, global investigation to
      establish the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN Device for subjects with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation who are deemed not suitable for anti-coagulation therapy to reduce the
      risk of stroke.

      Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2 Device to 1 Control to receive the WATCHMAN LAA
      closure device (Device) or the control treatment of single antiplatelet medication or no
      medication at the discretion of the study physician (Control). All randomized subjects will
      follow the protocol required tests and assessments at each scheduled follow-up visit.
