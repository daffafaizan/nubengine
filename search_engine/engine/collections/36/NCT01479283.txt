      osteosarcoma management, amputations are generally avoided by complex surgeries in which the
      malignancy is removed and the limb is reconstructed with advanced surgical techniques. This
      process of limb salvage is possible with improvements in chemotherapeutic regimens, advanced
      imaging techniques and surgical innovations such as modular metallic implants. However, the
      risk for surgical complications is high due to the complexity of the surgeries themselves.
      The most common and devastating complication is a surgical site infection. Background work
      and data from our pilot study indicates that infection rates approach 15%. Multiple surgical
      attempts at eradication of the infection fail in 50% of these cases, resulting in amputation.
      Published guidelines for post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis following many standard and
      less complex elective surgical procedures dictate that prophylactic antibiotics be
      discontinued after 24 hours. However, the most effective duration of treatment in sarcoma
      surgery has not previously been examined. Given the limitations of the evidence, it has not
      been possible for orthopaedic oncologists to draw firm conclusions and, therefore, clinical
      practice is highly varied, particularly with respect to antibiotic duration. Our
      international, multi-center randomized controlled trial will determine whether a 5-day
      regimen of post-operative prophylactic antibiotics in comparison to a standard 24-hour
      regimen decreases the rate of surgical site infections after limb salvage surgery within
      1-year follow-up.
