        1. To study the epidemiology of pancreas cancer, related cancers and related pre-cancerous
           conditions, including the risk factors and patient outcomes.

        2. To characterize the contribution of known hereditary cancer syndromes to pancreas
           cancer, related cancers, and related pre-cancerous conditions.

        3. To identify new genetic and epigenetic changes associated with hereditary pancreas
           cancer, related cancers, and related pre-cancerous conditions. DNA contains the
           instructions used in the development and functioning of living organisms, including
           humans. Epigenetic changes are changes other than changes in the underlying DNA
           sequence.

        4. To study the tumour biology of pancreas cancer and related pre-cancerous conditions.
           This may include studying the tumour and the environment surrounding the tumour, as well
           as blood and/or saliva samples. The studies may include characterization of genetic,
           genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic changes.

        5. To identify and characterize biomarkers associated with pancreas cancer, related cancers
           and related pre-cancerous conditions.

        6. To determine if there are any epidemiological, clinical and outcome (for example,
           overall survival) associations with the genetic, genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic,
           proteomic, metabolomic or other biologic changes that occur in pancreas cancer, related
           cancers and related pre-cancerous conditions.
