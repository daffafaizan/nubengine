      intensive care unit (ICU).Occasionally the first dilation may be challenging when using
      Ciaglia and colleagues' method, and a second dilation may be needed to insert the
      tracheostomy tube. In these circumstances, potentially life-threatening complications, such
      as hemorrhage and hypoxia, may arise. The investigators found the reasons for difficulty in
      achieving smooth dilation of the stoma.The investigators compared the traditional method with
      the improved method.
