           random assignment of 20 patients to a control group vs 20 patients to a treatment group
           for patients with the diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee admitted for primary
           total knee arthroplasty. For specifics of patient assignment, please see below under
           Recruitment Procedures.

        2. Unpaired t-Tests will be used to determine differences between mean scores for the
           dependent variables (pain, range of motion, functional mobility). Analysis of Covariance
           will be run to quantify the effect of the co-variates of age, gender, body mass index
           (BMI), and contralateral previous TKA. Confidence Intervals will be set at 95%.
