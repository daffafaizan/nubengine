        1. To assess the change from baseline to 20 weeks on biomarkers of oxidative stress (8OHdG
           and 8OHrG) and DNA repair mechanisms (OGG1) in pre-manifest participants treated with
           600, 1200 or 2400 mg per day of CoQ10.

        2. To assess the dose-response relationship between CoQ10 at dosages of 600, 1200 or 2400
           mg per day and 8OHdG/8OHrG and OGG1.

        3. To assess the serum levels of CoQ10 at 600, 1200 or 2400 mg in pre-manifest participants
           and their relationship to 8OHdG/8OHrG and OGG1.

        4. To assess the feasibility of implementing a preventive therapeutic trial in a
           pre-manifest population.

        5. To assess the utility and stability of clinical measures of HD, social relations,
           behavior and employment in a pre-manifest sample enrolled in a treatment trial.
