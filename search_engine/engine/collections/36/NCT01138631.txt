      terms of baby take-home rate per cycle. One way to improve this rather low succes rate is to
      develop new measures for selection of the best embryo among peers as presently evaluated by
      embryo morphology. One of these promising methods is contineous imaging of embryo development
      by time-lapse. A new and unique equipment for this purpose - an Embryoscope - har been
      developed by Unisense Fertilitech. The present study evaluates embryo 4-cell rate during
      cultivation to blastocyst stage in a conventional incubator with 4-cell rate in the
      Embryoscope to ensure non-inferiority of the latter.
