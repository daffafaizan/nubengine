      remote monitoring to track health-related measures in men following prostate cancer
      treatment. All participants will complete a health-related quality of life survey each month
      for 3 months. The digital survey will be administered on a programmed tablet. The
      participants in the intervention group will also receive an activity sensor and weight scale.
      Health state data from this group will be generated over a 3-6 month period and remotely
      monitored. These data will be used to provide personalized feedback regarding the
      participant's progress towards established goals. Health-related quality of life will be
      compared between participants in the intervention group, who receive (1) tools to monitor
      their activity and weight and (2) personalized feedback, versus participants in the control
      group, who receive standard of care. The potential improved adherence to healthy behaviors of
      the participants receiving personalized feedback may translate to to improved health-related
      quality of life.
