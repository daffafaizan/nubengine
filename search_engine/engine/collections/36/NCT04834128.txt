    
      The aim of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ex-vivo expanded
      gamma delta T-cells (TCB008) manufactured from a single allogeneic unmatched or partially,
      randomly matched, unrelated donor, in patients with COVID-19.

      The trial is designed to identify an optimal, safe dose of allogeneic γδ T cells in a
      population of patients with COVID-19. There will be 4 patient Cohorts. Cohorts 1 - 3 will
      receive a pre-defined dosing schedule, with Cohort 4 being treated with a dose selected upon
      completion of the first 3 Cohorts. In order to investigate immunogenicity
      assessment/sensitisation effects, patients in the expansion cohort who do not experience
      adverse reactions meeting dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria after the first
      administration will receive re-infusion with the same dose on Day 10 after the first
      infusion.
