      surgery (RIRS) has been considered as the first-line choice for the management of <20mm
      kidney stones. Insertion of a ureteral access sheath (UAS) before RIRS surgery is currently
      accepted as an effective method to improve the effectiveness of surgery, for UAS can drain
      irrigation to reduce renal pelvic pressure and maintain vision clear. But incorrect way to
      insert UAS can be accompanied by serious complications. For instance, If the ureter was not
      dilated by DJ stent before RIRS surgery, or ureter was relatively narrow, the insertion of
      UAS would encounter great resistance. Sometimes the ureter was violently pushed into UAS, it
      might cause ureteral perforation or avulsion. As for how to insert UAS correctly, there is no
      unified international standard at present. Different surgeons have different experience. In
      long-term clinical practice, the investigators has found that different Bladder Filling
      Degree was accompanied by different Resistance During UAS Insertion Procedure in RIRS, which
      leads to the difference in success rate of UAS insertion. In addition, there seems to be some
      relationship between the resistance of UAS insertion and the ureter injury in surgery.
      Therefore, the investigator aims to perform a prospective and randomized controlled trial
      comparing the success rate of UAS insertion procedure under different bladder filling degree,
      and discuss the relationship between insertion resistance and ureter injury.
