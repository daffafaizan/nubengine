      measured twice, at baseline, and after 2 months. The other 2 control groups will be assessed
      just once without exercise intervention. Our primary objective is to clarify physiological
      evidence of how muscular and cerebral oxygenation changes in sedentary older adults with
      diabetes after low-to-moderate intensity exercise. The secondary objective is to determine
      fatigue, physical, cognitive performance changes, blood glucose level among sedentary older
      adults with diabetes after low-to-moderate intensity exercise.
