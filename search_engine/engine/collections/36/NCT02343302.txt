      from the remaining pancreas gland, which results in significant morbidity. Most surgeons
      leave dains at the time of surgery to prevent complications from pancreatic leakage. However,
      we hypothesize that drains which create continous negative pressure may contribute to the
      development of a pancreatic fistula. This study randomizes patients to suctioning versus
      non-suctioning drains. The primary endpoint is the development of pancreatic fistuale, as
      defined by the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery.
