      applied like a large contact lens. AM is mounted between the two rings with a special
      designed, accessory mounting device. The safety of the ring system AmnioClip was tested in an
      interventional including 7 patients with ocular surface disorders and need for AM
      transplantation (1, 2, 3). About similar systems was reported (3, 4).
