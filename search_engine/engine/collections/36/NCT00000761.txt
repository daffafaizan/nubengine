      respond to immunomodulators that augment different portions of the host defense system.
      Interferon-gamma has been shown to benefit children with severely compromised nonspecific
      immunity and may thus be of benefit to those with HIV infection.

      Patients are treated with subcutaneous rIFN-gamma 3 times a week for 24 weeks and are then
      followed for an additional 12 weeks.
