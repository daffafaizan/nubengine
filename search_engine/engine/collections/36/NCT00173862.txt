      However, only less than 10% of the patients can achieve long-term remission. Until now, there
      is no standard chemotherapy for cisplatin-failed TCC patients. Both gemcitabine and
      ifosfamide have been identified to have response rates of 20% or more in pretreated TCC
      patients. It is thus reasonable to combine these two active drugs as a second-line treatment
      for TCC.

      Patients enrolled must have a pathologically proven urothelial transitional cell carcinoma
      (TCC) and must have exposed to one cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for the advanced
      disease. GI regimen will be continued until maximal response.
