      phenomenon.Prolonged chest tube placement can lead to empyema or infection, and extended
      hospitalization or even death. In 2010 many researchers reported that The incidence of lung
      resection produce air leak about 8-26% (Singhal et al., 2010), and even up to 50% (Mueller &
      Marzluf, 2014).How to effectively treatment is still not clear.The chemical pleurodesis is an
      effective option in management of air leak.There are several chemical agents for pleurodesis,
      such as tetracycline and minocycline, talc, Taurolidine, bleomycin, iodopovidone, picibanil
      (OK-432), silver nitrate, quinacrine. What kind of chemical agent effective remain
      controversial. A study evaluated after thoracoscopic operation for primary spontaneous
      pneumothorax the safety and efficacy of chemical pleurodesis with a comparison between
      minocycline and OK-432. The OK-432 pleurodesis (19 patients) as the primary treatment and the
      primary success rate was 95%.(How et al., 2014).Another retrospective case-control study
      examining post-isolated lobectomies and bilobectomies by thoracotomy of Persistent air
      leakï¼Œsclerosis (talc, bleomycin, minocycline, doxycycline)for the treatment of prolonged air
      leak was successful in 40 of 41 patients (the success rate of 97.6%) (Liberman et al., 2010).
      The prolonged air leaks after major pulmonary resection still no empirical treatment of
      clinical research.

      Hypothesis: patients were persistent air leak after 48 hours chest surgery will perform
      OK-432 pleurodesis .The chest tube time can reduce and length of hospital stay. Extended
      applications can significantly reduce medical costs and manpower, and to explore OK -432
      pleurodesis side effects and treatment.
