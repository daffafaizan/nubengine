      two multi-dose regimens of UB-421 monotherapy in replacement of HAART in HIV-1 infected
      adults with virological suppression. In this study, approximately 29 subjects will be
      enrolled to receive one of the two UB-421 regimens as the monotherapy in replacement of HARRT
      treatment. Subjects assigned to Cohort 1 will receive UB-421 infusion at 10 mg/kg weekly for
      8 weeks; subjects assigned to Cohort 2 will receive UB-421 infusion at 25 mg/kg bi-weekly for
      16 weeks.
