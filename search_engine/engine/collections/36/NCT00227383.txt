      dyspeptic symptoms. An upper GI endocopy will be obtained to rule out possibility of organic
      obstruction. Cardiac arrhythmia and pregnancy will be excluded. None of them ever received
      abdominal surgery. Patients are then randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: 15
      patients received EA stimulation on acupoints St-36 (Zusanli) and Li-4 (Hegu). Arm II: 15
      subjected to EA stimulation on non-acupoints around St-36 and Li-4 with the same electrical
      pulse and amplitude. Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and solid-phase gastric
      emptying time will be measured on baseline and after EA. In addition, serum gastrin, motilin,
      human pancreatic polypeptide, fasting blood sugar, and postprandial glucose levels will be
      also monitored.
