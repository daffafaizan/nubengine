      0.625 mg (1/2 amp) IV droperidol given at the initiation of general anesthesia reduces the
      incidence of immediate and delayed post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy population. One hundred patients receiving general anesthesia for
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy received droperidol 0.625 mg (1/2 amp) mg or placebo prior
      operation.
