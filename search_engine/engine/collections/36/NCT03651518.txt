    
      This is a phase IIb study. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      targeted treatments in patients displaying a non-classified, severe and resistant
      inflammatory disease. Targeted treatments for each patient will have been selected through an
      algorithm based on molecular analysis of specific altered inflammatory signaling pathway.

      Treatments consist in targeted therapies approved in other indications (Kineret®, Humira®,
      Stelara®, Cosentyx®, Roactemra® and Rituximab®) that will be given once selected using
      molecular analysis and decision making procedure by the Scientific committee.

      For each patient, one targeted treatment will be administered according to the SmPC procedure
      for a treatment period of 6 months.

      Primary efficacy endpoint:

      Response will be assessed at month 6 with a composite endpoint defined as improvement of at
      least 2 of the 3 following parameters:

        -  50% improvement of the systemic activity assessed by the clinician following a visual
           analog scale (0-10 mm),

        -  and/or 50% improvement of cutaneous activity assessed by the involved skin surface area,

        -  and/or 50% decrease or normalisation of biological markers of inflammation (either CRP,
           ESR or fibrin).

      An independent adjudication committee blinded to the treatment received, will review primary
      endpoint for all patients based on clinical files and standardized photographs, to validate
      the response.

      Other secondary criteria will be assessed. Overall, this study will require a molecular
      analysis done on patient's tissue, the final aim being to evaluate efficiency and tolerance
      of targeted treatments chosen in a personalized analysis when classification is impossible.
