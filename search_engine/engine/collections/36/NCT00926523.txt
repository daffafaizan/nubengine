      migration inhibitory factor (MIF), that remodeling is in fact the reflection of a chronic
      inflammatory process, and that MIF may be a useful biomarker of the severity and progression
      of both ILD and PH.

      To study this hypothesis, we have two specific aims:

        1. To evaluate plasma MIF concentration as a marker of severity in ILD and PH and

        2. To determine the utility of breathe condensate analysis in the evaluation of ILD and PH.
           If we are successful in identifying MIF as a biomarker, it may identify MIF as a useful
           therapeutic target, as we have shown in other inflammatory disorders.
