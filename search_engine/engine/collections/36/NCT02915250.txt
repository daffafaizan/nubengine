    
      This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period
      cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to
      investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone速 Combo compared with Humalog速 Mix25
      and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog速 and Lantus速 during three separate
      dosing visits.

      Furthermore, this study aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the three
      different study treatments.

      During each dosing visit, subjects will be given 3 doses of IMP on three consecutive days
      (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3). Dosing on Day 2 and Day 3 will be followed by a standardised solid
      meal test.
