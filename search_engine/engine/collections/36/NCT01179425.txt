      maintaining drug use or triggering relapse. However, although 'craving' is believed to drive
      continued drug use, it is not well understood how cognitive processes influence craving and
      relapse, nor how they may differ between the sexes. Therefore, the goal of this study
      protocol is to provide insight into sex differences in the cognitive aspects of drug craving
      and to assess the impact of stress on attentional bias for drug-related cues as well as on
      the availability of cognitive resources.
