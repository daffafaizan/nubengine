      its fields of action. Regarding internal medicine, the influence of the psyche on the immune
      system makes the use of hypnosis particularly relevant for autoimmune diseases. Medically
      unexplained symptoms (another important field of internal medicine) are also strongly
      psychosomatic and thus susceptible to hypnosis. The hypothesis is thus made that hypnosis can
      bring multiple benefits to internal medicine patients.

      The main objective of this study is to describe the short and long-term impact of hypnosis
      sessions for patient having benefited from at least one hypnosis session in internal medicine
      at the french hospital "Groupe Hospitalier Mutualiste de Grenoble", with the help of a
      qualitative survey made by phone.

      Moreover retrospective medical data concerning these patients will be collected to determine
      their medical history, their main symptoms et reasons to use hypnosis.
