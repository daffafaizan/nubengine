      patient-centered quality of life, health care utilization, and health behaviors that will
      reduce COVID-19 risk by following a diverse sample of 800 PEH who are placed in PB-PSH (n =
      400) or SS-PSH (n = 400) for 6 months. Barriers and facilitators will also be identified that
      may affect PSH implementation during the pandemic and its aftermath. The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To test the comparative effectiveness of PB-PSH and SS-PSH on COVID-19-related health
      behaviors (COVID-19-related personal health practices including social distancing) for PEH
      over time.

      Aim 2: To test the comparative effectiveness of PB-PSH and SS-PSH on patient-centered quality
      of life (i.e., general life satisfaction; physical, mental, social, and environmental health)
      for PEH over time.

      Aim 3: To test the comparative effectiveness of PB-PSH and SS-PSH on health care utilization
      health behaviors and unmet need for care for physical health, mental health, substance use
      disorders, for PEH over time.

      Aim 4: To contextualize quantitative findings through longitudinal qualitative inquiry with
      40 participants, purposively sampled from PB-PSH and SS-PSH, based on whether they are
      following social distancing guidelines.

      Aim 5: To understand service providers, policy makers, and other stakeholders perspectives on
      challenges of implementing and sustaining COVID-19-related prevention practices and
      continuity of care in PSH.
