      are the basis of the treatment of patients admitted with non-ST-segment elevation acute
      coronary syndrome. However, the desired reduction of the recurrence of ischemic events has as
      complication an increased incidence of bleeding. Since arterial puncture followed by the
      insertion of an introducer has become the standard method to perform invasive cardiovascular
      procedures, complications related to vascular access have become an important bleeding site.

      Among the strategies to decrease vascular complications, the transradial approach is a well
      stablished alternative to the transfemoral approach. For its part, vascular closure devices
      were introduced to decrease vascular complications, homeostasis time and ambulation time of
      patients submitted to invasive procedures by the transfemoral access. Rapidly incorporated to
      the clinical practice, such devices to date have shown conflicting results with regard to
      their safety and efficacy. The inconsistency of data proving its safety limits its routine
      adoption as strategy to prevent vascular complications, requiring evidences through
      adequately designed randomized studies for this end.
