        1. To determine the most effective oral iron supplementation regimen for repletion of iron
           deficiency in patients who have had gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. In iron
           deficient patients, two supplement regimens will be compared:

             1. Ferrous sulfate 65 mg t.i.d. (standard of care / control), which is elemental iron

             2. AspironTM, which is an organic formulation of iron

           Primary outcomes will be reference indices of iron status:

             -  Ferritin, TIBC, sTfR, and sTfR:ferritin ratio

             -  Secondary outcomes will be:

             -  measures of anemia, determined by blood hemoglobin concentrations

             -  measures of cognitive function via several computerized tests on working memory,
                sustained attention, and spatial memory

             -  fatigue by Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory questionnaire

             -  Quality of life by SF-36 Survey

           Safety outcomes will be:

           â€¢ adverse events, compliance, measures of iron toxicity, and liver enzymes

        2. In the same subjects undergoing iron supplementation described in Aim 1, to determine
           the contribution of dietary factors (including heme and non-heme iron intake, and intake
           of enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption) to changes in iron status.
