      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan when combined with vinorelbine
           ditartrate in patients with recurrent lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the response and stable disease rates and the time to disease progression among
           treated patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patents receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 8-10 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which â‰¥ 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
