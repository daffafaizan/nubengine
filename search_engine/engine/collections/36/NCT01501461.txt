      Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ASC) implantation after liposuction using an IV delivery system.
      ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local
      anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered
      intravenously.
