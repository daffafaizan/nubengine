    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose finding study in
      men with advanced androgen-sensitive prostate cancer. Patients who give informed consent will
      have screening evaluations, and if fulfilling the entry criteria, will be randomized to one
      of 4 treatment groups: 1mL, 2mL or 3mL of 0.36% BHR-200 (transdermal estradiol gel) or
      Placebo. Study drug will be initiated on the day they were scheduled to receive next depot
      GnRH agonist injection. Patients will be offered low-dose radiation to aid in the prevention
      of gynecomastia. Patients will apply the study drug once per day. The first dose of study gel
      will be applied under the supervision of the PI/designee. Subsequent doses will be
      self-administered daily by the patient until he is no longer chemically castrated
      (testosterone levels increase above 50 ng/dL), a rise over baseline PSA of > 0.5 ng/mL is
      observed, or he has completed 52 weeks of study drug administration. At the conclusion of
      study participation, patients will be advised to resume standard of care treatment under the
      supervision of their healthcare provider. While on treatment, patients will be evaluated at
      Day 1 and every 2 weeks, for the first 24 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter with a final
      post-treatment follow-up visit 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) post last dose administration.
