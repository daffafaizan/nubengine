      patients' quality of life and thus threaten patients' compliance to therapy. There is an
      urgent need for evidence-based treatment recommendations for the prevention and management of
      panitumumab -associated skin toxicities.

      The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of a manageable preemptive treatment with
      oral doxycycline in combination with a supportive topical regimen containing erythromycin
      cream (2 %) over duration of 12 weeks on the occurrence and grade of panitumumab induced skin
      toxicities in a double-blind, controlled randomized setting. Basic skin treatment with or
      without doxycycline will be discontinued at the end of study treatment after 12 weeks or
      until a value of 6-10 is observed on the visual analogue scale (VAS), whichever is sooner.
