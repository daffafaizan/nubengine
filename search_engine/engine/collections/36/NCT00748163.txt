      Primary

        -  To determine the tumor response rate in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and sunitinib
           malate as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to objective tumor response and duration of response in responding
           patients.

        -  To determine the time to treatment failure and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To characterize the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
