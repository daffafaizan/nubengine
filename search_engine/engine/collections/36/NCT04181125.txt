      plane) and a plane passing through the center of the neck and femoral head. Toe-in-gait
      pattern may be due to foot deformity (metatarsus adductus) and / or abnormal transverse
      alignment of long bones (tibial torsion and / or increased femoral anteversion). Transverse
      plane deviations are frequently seen in infants and usually improve with typical
      physiological growth mechanisms. Persistent transverse plan disorder may lead to gait
      dysfunction. The most important function of the posture is to maintain the balance during the
      initiation and continuation of the movement. Postural control regulates maintaining the
      balance and keeping the center of gravity within the body's stability limits. It includes
      resistance to gravity forces and mechanical support during movement. Postural control is an
      integral part of achieving targeted action. To our knowledge the relationship between
      increased femoral anteversion and postural control in healthy children has not been studied
      in the current literature. Postural control in children with increased femoral anteversion
      was evaluated by computerized posturography. In this study, we aimed to evaluate postural
      control in children with increased femoral anteversion using computerized dynamic
      posturography (Biodex Balance System).
