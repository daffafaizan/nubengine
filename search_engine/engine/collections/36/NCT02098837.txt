    
      Study Design: Randomised, non-inferiority strategic trial over 96 weeks with early or delayed
      switch from an ARV regimen containing a boosted PI plus 2 NRTIs to dolutegravir (DTG) plus 2
      NRTIs in patients having achieved complete virological suppression for more than 24 weeks
      (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/ml). Patients will be randomised to switch at baseline or at 48 weeks.

      Study visits will take place at screening, baseline, weeks 4 (immediate switch group only),
      12, 24, 36, 48, 52 (deferred switch group only), 60, 72, 84 and 96, plus a follow up visit 28
      days after the last dose of study medication.

      Routine investigations will include viral load, CD4, haematology (including haemoglobin,
      white cell count and differential, platelets), biochemistry (including sodium, potassium,
      creatinine, albumin, glucose, ALT, ALP, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL,
      triglycerides), quality of life questionnaires (EuroQL), urine sample (for haematuria,
      proteinuria, glycosuria, leukocytes, nitrate & pregnancy test in WOCBP)
