      actionable driver mutations result in the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). Osimertinib and Lazertinib are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Amivantamab is
      a novel bispecific antibody that targets the extracellular domain of both EGFR and MET and
      can inhibit tumor growth driven by EGFR and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)
      receptors. Lazertinib inhibits primary activating Exon 19dell and Exon 21 L858R substitution
      EGFR mutations, and the EGFR T790M+ resistance mutation. The hypothesis is that the
      amivantamab and lazertinib combination (Arm A) will demonstrate superior PFS compared with
      single-agent osimertinib (Arm B). The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase, Treatment
      Phase and Follow-up Phase. Participants will undergo response evaluation criteria in solid
      tumors (RECIST 1.1), pharmacokinetics, and safety evaluations (adverse events, laboratory
      tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations).
