      criteria and randomly allocated to the thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) group and sham
      thread-embedding acupuncture (STEA) group. Both groups will receive treatment on predefined
      23 acupoints once a week for 8 weeks, and needle with thread removed will be used in STEA
      group instead of normal TEA. 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain will be
      assessed as a primary outcome. Also, 100mm VAS for radiating pain, Oswestry disability index
      (ODI), Rolland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), EQ-5D-5L and global perceived effect
      (GPE) will be measured as secondary outcomes. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
      4 weeks after screening, treatment end (8 weeks, primary end point) and follow-up sessions
      (12 and 16 weeks).
