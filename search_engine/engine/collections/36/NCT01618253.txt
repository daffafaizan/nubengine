      (TACE) is first line therapy. Non-responders to TACE (i.e. stable or progressive disease)
      represent a poor prognosis population with limited options. Sorafenib is indicated for first
      line salvage therapy, however it only improves survival 2-3 months and just has a 2-3%
      response rate. Thus, sorafenib is merely a cytostatic agent that delays progression and does
      not cytoreduce disease.

      Radiation therapy (RT) is a non-invasive treatment that can cytoreduce HCC with minimal
      morbidity using modern techniques. A meta-analysis and multiple retrospective series suggest
      TACE + RT improve survival when compared to TACE alone. Higher RT doses are similarly
      associated with increased survival due to improved local control. Paradoxically, some series
      suggest that RT can induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression which may
      stimulate HCC.

      Pre-clinical data suggest that combining RT with concurrent sorafenib (a VEGF inhibitor)
      improves tumor control. However, clinical data is limited to case reports and safety has not
      been well characterized. Prior to determining if this combination can improve control of HCC
      in this poor prognosis population, the optimal radiation dose with concurrent sorafenib must
      be determined by a phase I dose escalation trial.
