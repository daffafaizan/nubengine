      Training and Research Hospital- Date: 06/05/2018; No: 18/148) and written informed consents
      obtained from patients, 122 ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status I-II
      patients, aged between 18-65 years, undergoing elective lumbar discectomy under general
      anesthesia were included into the study . After anesthesia application applied to all groups
      with the same procedure, patients were extubated after surgery. After extubation, patients
      were evaluated using mASS, WFTSS and SPEEDS criteria during 15 minutes with 3 min intervals.
      Patients who fulfilled criteria of all scoring systems were defined as eligible for PACU
      by-pass (fast-tracking) and transferred into phase II recovery area in the ward without
      observation in PACU (Group FT = Fast Track;). Ineligible patients were taken into PACU where
      their treatments were continued until discharge criteria were achieved (Group PACU). All
      patients were followed in the ward until hospital discharge. IV tramadol PCA (Patient
      -Controlled Analgesia; infusion rate: 4 mgh-1, bolus dose: 4mg, lock-out time: 30 min., 4
      hours-limit: 30 mg), paracetamol (10 mgkg-1 IV with 6 hrs. intervals) and oral diclofenac
      sodium (75 mg with 8 hrs. intervals) were given in a multimodal analgesic regimen. Pain was
      evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with 2 hours intervals and IV pethidine 0.5
      mgkg-1 was given as rescue analgesic throughout the study period when VAS was >3. PONV was
      treated using IV 4 mg ondansetron. Discharge from hospital was evaluated using Post
      Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS), . Patients with a PADSS score ≥ 9 were
      discharged from the hospital by the escort of their relatives.
