    
      DESIGN Comparative study to analyse differences in the characteristics of lung macrophages
      and blood monocytes between non-severe and severe asthmatics.

      AIMS

        1. To determine whether there are differences in terms of cell expression and activation
           between lung macrophages and blood monocytes from non-severe and severe asthma

        2. To determine the mechanisms of the lung macrophage and blood monocyte relative
           resistance to the effect of corticosteroids in severe asthma, and particularly focus on
           the role of p38 MAPK

        3. To determine the differences in airway smooth muscle cells between non-severe and severe
           asthma

      OUTCOME MEASURES

        1. Clinically the differences in inflammatory and remodelling markers between non-severe
           and severe asthma

        2. Differences in histone phosphorylation, NF-kB activity and glucocorticoid receptor
           activation and actions in macrophages and monocytes between non- severe and severe
           asthma

        3. Differences in behaviour of airway smooth muscle cells cultured from biopsies obtained
           from non-severe and severe asthma

      Severe and non-severe asthmatic subjects will be classified following ATS criteria. They
      undergo spirometry with reversibility testing, PC20, skin prick tests, exhaled nitric oxide
      measurements and induced sputum. They will have blood taken for PBMCs and undergo fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy for obtention of alveolar macrophages and bronchial biopsies
