      macular thickening related to pan-retinal photocoagulation in diabetic patients. Material and
      methods: This is a prospective, longitudinal, and controlled study in patients with diabetic
      retinopathy (severe non-proliferative and proliferative retinopathy), with a symmetric
      severity in both eyes and without a clinical significant macular edema. The best corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA) in all patients was 20/80 or better. All patients will undergo
      pan-retinal photocoagulation in three different sessions (with 2 weeks in apart between
      them). Each patient will receive topical nepafenac 0.1% (qid) on one eye, and placebo (qid)
      at the fellow eye, starting 1 week before the first retinal photocoagulation session and
      continued for 9 weeks ( ending 4 weeks after pan-retinal photocoagulation is completed).
      Spectral domain OCT and BCVA in ETDRS scale will be performed before and at 2 weeks after
      each laser session, and at 1, 2 and 3 months after treatment completed. BCVA and OCT outcomes
      of each studied period will be compared on both eyes, and side effects will be recorded.
