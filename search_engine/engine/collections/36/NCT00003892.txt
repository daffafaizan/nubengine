      duration of response in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Determine the
      tolerability and quantitative toxicity of ISIS 5132 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ISIS 5132 IV continuously for 21 days.
      Courses are repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with documented complete
      response receive an additional 2 courses. Patients with documented partial response receive
      an additional 4 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks, then every 3 months until disease
      relapse or progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-15
      months.
