      study to determine the comparative efficacy of intermittent docetaxel/erlotinib chemotherapy,
      with erlotinib given for twelve consecutive days either before (group A) or after (group B)
      docetaxel, in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel
      chemotherapy was considered one of the valid non-platinum containing therapeutic options at
      that time and today represents one of the approved second-line treatment options after
      failure of first-line platinum based chemotherapy. The trial was terminated early due to slow
      accrual after enrollment of 51 patients and was published in 2014, showing no clinically
      meaningful difference between the two treatment arms.

      Based on the aforementioned trial population,a parallel radiological study was conducted,
      evaluating sequential tumor metrics on computed tomography performed at baseline and after
      each cycle of treatment in patients receiving either bevacizumab or docetaxel/erlotinib.
      Given the differential mechanism of action of these agents, it was hypothesized that the
      different parameters of radiological tumor response evaluation, namely the maximum diameter,
      tumor volume and tumor density, would respond differently for each therapeutic category (a
      chemotherapeutic agent, a molecular agent and and an anti-angiogenic agent). For bevacizumab,
      in particular, it was hypothesized that its unique mechanism of action, inducing central
      tumor necrosis and subsequent shrinkage, would lead to completely different tumor metrics as
      compared to the other two agents. Herein the final results of this analysis are presented,
      showing the comparison of the three agents in terms of tumor response metrics, as evaluated
      in CT scans performed at baseline and after each cycle of treatment
