      life. However, the importance of pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding during the special
      stages in which the woman is experienced in her life process increases slightly (Ho et al.,
      2016; Erick, 2018; Tekiner and Ungan, 2014). Healthy nutrition is a key concern for the
      health of the baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding periods as well as the
      health of the mother (Taşkın, 2016; Samur, 2008). Intrauterine life is transmitted by
      placental way and in the postpartum period, breast milk is fed to the baby. Therefore, in
      order to ensure optimal growth and development of the baby, the mother needs adequate,
      regular and quality nutrition (Ho et al., 2016; Erick, 2018; Tekiner and Ungan, 2014).
