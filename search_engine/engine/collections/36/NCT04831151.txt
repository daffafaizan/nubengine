      the reproductive aged women. In addition to causing problems such as menstrual irregularity,
      hirsutism, acne, it is also an important health problem that can cause infertility, insulin
      resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease,
      dyslipidemia in advanced ages. Diagnostic criteria also vary widely in these patients. These
      patients are often overweight or obese, and abdominal adiposity is common in these patients.
      The patients also suffer from insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in this syndrome. All
      of this is probably the result of a vicious cycle that starts in the antenatal period.
      Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), are the first-choice treatment option for many patients
      by improving both menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance through
      sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). They reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and
      endometrial cancer by providing regular menstruation.

      Nowadays, the use of metabolomics is increasing in understanding the pathophysiology of
      diseases. Metabolomics technology examines low molecular weight substrates used in
      intracellular enzymatic reactions, intermediates and end products resulting from these
      reactions. Metabolomic examinations are gaining momentum in terms of understanding the
      pathophysiology of diseases, especially endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, in the field
      of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Metabolomics continue to be investigated in understanding the
      pathophysiology of PCOS, but there are not enough studies yet on the effects of treatment on
      the disease in terms of metabolomics.
