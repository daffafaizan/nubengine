      August 2009, Genzyme assumed responsibility for the close out of the study. NOTE: This study
      was originally posted by sponsor Berlex, Inc. Berlex, Inc. was renamed to Bayer HealthCare,
      Inc.

      The study was terminated early due to low enrollment; significant changes to the protocol
      would have been required to keep pace with the changing therapeutic landscape of indolent
      lymphoma.
