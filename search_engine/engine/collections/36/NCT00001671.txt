      constitute the second largest group of genetic white matter diseases. The purpose of this
      study is to: (a) define novel homogeneous groups of patients with LDs and (b) work toward
      finding the cause of these disorders. In order to achieve these goals, patients with LDs of
      unknown cause will be analyzed clinically, neurophysiologically, biochemically and
      genetically. Patients would have been diagnosed as having no known leukodystrophies at
      outside centers. At the Clinical Center, such patients will undergo a series of
      neuropsychological, blood, urine, spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue
      pathological tests. Some of these tests will be part of a standard battery while others will
      be tailored to individual patients. Patients will be followed for 3 years. Patients will be
      screened for mutations in genes coding for structural myelin proteins. In some patients in
      whom all tests yielded no information regarding the etiology of their disease, open brain
      biopsy will be considered. Brain biopsy tissue will be evaluated using a novel combination of
      approaches including detailed pathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of
      myelin proteins and lipids. Oligodendroglial biology and expression of myelin genes in the
      brain will also be investigated in situ. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify
      the nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of these diseases.
