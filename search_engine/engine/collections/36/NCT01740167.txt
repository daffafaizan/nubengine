      promotion. In literature, before specific psychotic symptoms appear, individuals may
      experience a period of nonspecific symptoms and growing functional impairment. Early
      interventions may alter the natural course of mental diseases and improve treatment outcomes.
      So that, the purpose of this study is to develop a screen and prevention mode for identifying
      young adults with high risk status of mental health disability. The psychosocial intervention
      strategies for emotional and cognitive support in prevention model based on health promotion
      theory will be used for this study. Participants in this experimental design study will be
      randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. Four scales and objective physical
      assessments are used for evaluating study outcomes. The pre- and post-test will be held
      before and one week after prevention interventions. In addition, follow-ups will be included
      for understanding long-term outcomes of the effectiveness of the screen prevention model.
