      Comfortable Cafeteria program designed to build capacity of cafeteria supervisors to create a
      positive mealtime environment so that all students can successfully participate in and enjoy
      their meal and socialization with peers. Statistically significant improvements in pretest
      posttest visual analogue scale ratings of participation in and enjoyment for students with
      low and mid-range scores at the outset was found. Cafeteria supervisors demonstrated
      statistically significant improvements in perceptions of having the knowledge and skills to
      supervise and to encourage healthy eating based on pretest posttest ratings. Qualitative
      findings add further insight about the program suggesting that students learned prosocial
      values (e.g. being kind, helping others), supervisors actively encouraged positive social
      interaction, and occupational therapy practitioners enjoyed implementing the Comfortable
      Cafeteria program and recognized positive supervisor and student changes as a result of
      integrating services in the cafeteria.
