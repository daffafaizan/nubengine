    
      This is a 22 week parallel group, randomized crossover trial to determine the effect of blood
      volume monitoring, BVM, guided ultrafiltration (UF) biofeedback on symptomatic intradialytic
      hypotension (IDH) episodes amongst IDH prone patients. The first part of the study (Part 1 -
      Run-In/Dialysis Optimization Phase), eligible patients will undergo a four-week run-in phase.
      During this period all patients will undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment including,
      clinical weight assessment, anti-hypertensive medication review, and dialysis prescription
      standardization. At the end of the run-in phase, patients that still meet eligibility
      criteria will enter the randomized cross-over phase. In part 2 (Randomized Cross-Over Phase),
      patients are randomized to regular best clinical practice hemodialysis, HD (without
      BVM-guided UF biofeedback; control arm) or to BVM-guided UF biofeedback (intervention arm)
      for an 8 week period. This will be followed by a two-week washout phase and then patients
      will be crossed over for a second 8-week phase. The study will be conducted and reported
      following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines.
