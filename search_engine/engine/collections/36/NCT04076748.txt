      Analgesia is a therapeutic emergency based on intravenous (IV) morphine titration. However,
      for technical reasons (patient flow in ED, difficult venous access) this treatment is often
      delayed. The Equimolar Mixture of Oxygen-Nitrous Oxide (EMONO), an inhaled analgesic
      administered, makes it possible to temporarily and very partially compensate for the major
      analgesic defect. Its efficacy in this indication has never been demonstrated; it is less
      effective than opiates during labour and is associated with a risk of addiction. The
      intranasal (IN) route is used to administer strong opiates such as sufentanil. Sufentanil IN
      has been shown to be rapidly effective in traumatology. Its duration of action is similar to
      that of morphine IV but its duration of action is far too short to completely replace it. Its
      ideal place would therefore be the initial phase of the management while waiting for a venous
      approach.

      The strategy is to propose an intranasal administration of an opioid (Sufentanil) at the
      initial management of vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle-cell patients in the ED waiting to a
      venous route for morphine.

      Follow-up of the study will be carried out in the ED with numeric rating scale (NRS)
      measurement every 5 minutes until patient relief (defined by NRS â‰¤ 3/10). Once relieved, NRS
      will be measured every 15 minutes for at least 2 hours. Treatment-related side effects will
      be systematically investigated up to 4 hours after starting treatment. In particular, the
      respiratory rate and level of consciousness will be measured, and all side effects will be
      recorded: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, behavioural disorders, pruritus.
