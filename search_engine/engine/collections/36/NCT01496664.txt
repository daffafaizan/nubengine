      coronary artery narrowing located to the LAD, which can be treated with a mammary graft, and
      a stenosis located to other coronary arteries (RCA and CX), which can be treated by balloon
      or stent.

      The patients included in the study will be recruited from patients who are referred to the
      Department of Cardiology/Department of Thoracic Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby
      for treatment of significant coronary artery disease. We will not announce for patients, and
      the patients will not receive a honorarium for participation.

      The first 100 patients will be treated i two seances; operation and stent treatment with few
      days interval. The last 50 patients will be treated in a hybrid operation room with operation
      and stent treatment in the same seance.
