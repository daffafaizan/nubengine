      constituent in the spice turmeric, which is used as a food worldwide.

      The pharmacologic rationale for studying curcumin for the treatment of cystic fibrosis is the
      potential for curcumin to help correct a deficiency of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      regulator (CFTR) protein. Cystic fibrosis results from a mutation of the CFTR gene, which
      produces abnormal CFTR protein that does properly transport chloride ion and water in the
      lung leading to abnormal mucus production. Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of the endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump, and lowers ER calcium concentration. This may allow abnormal CFTR
      protein to function properly as a chloride channel and correct the cystic fibrosis defect. If
      this is successful, this effect could be measured as a decrease in the nasal potential
      difference (NPD) and sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of advancing doses of
      curcuminoids administered orally for fourteen consecutive days in adult subjects with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for Î”F508 CFTR. The secondary objectives are to obtain
      pharmacokinetic data for oral curcumoniods in CF subjects and to assess the effectiveness of
      curcuminoids to alter nasal potential difference (NPD) and seat chloride concentrations.
