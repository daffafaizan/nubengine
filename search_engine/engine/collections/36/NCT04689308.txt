    
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 study of MH048 in patients with selected
      Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies.

      This study includes 2 parts: Part A is the dose escalation part of the study, and Part B is
      the dose expansion part of the study. In Part A, patients were enrolled using accelerated
      titration design for the first three single patient cohorts and 3+3 dose escalation design
      for the rest cohorts. The starting dose of MH048 in soft gel capsule form was 5 mg/day QD.
      Cycle length will be 28 days. In Part B, the dose and lymphoma subtypes for expansion phase
      will depend on the results from Part A.
