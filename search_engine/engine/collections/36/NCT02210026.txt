      from pressure-rate products, which are assessed with 6 Fr (2 mm) catheters placed in the
      distal esophagus for monitoring esophageal pressures (Pes), thereby estimating changes in
      pleural pressures during breath cycles. The following endpoints would also be assessed:
      Oxygen saturations and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) needed to keep saturations in
      acceptable ranges, Heart Rates (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcPCO2), and respiratory
      rates throughout the 6 hour study period.

      Objective determination of when an infant requires more or less respiratory support is
      difficult, but measurements of pressure-rate products as estimates of work of breathing,
      using esophageal catheters, can estimate an infant's respiratory effort. However, objective,
      simple-to-use, low cost, and non-invasive methods and tools to determine an infant's
      respiratory effort do not exist currently.

      This study also is designed to test the hypothesis that infants' chest and abdominal
      movements can be assessed quantitatively from video images in ways that can be correlated
      with intrathoracic pressures, as measured with esophageal catheters.
