      oxaliplatine therapy and were diagnosed with CIPN will be recruited to the study.

      After providing their written informed consent, the study physician obtained a medical
      history, demographic details and conducted a physical examination. During the current study,

      questionnaires. Baseline CIPN will be evaluating by DN4 and BPI questionnaires. EQ-5D and
      PSQI will be filled for baseline Quality of life (QOL) and sleepiness status, accordingly.
