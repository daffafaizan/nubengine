        -  Determine the percentage of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who
           live more than 12 months after treatment with carboplatin, etoposide, and exisulind.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes
      on days 1-3. Patients also receive oral exisulind twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 2 years.
