        1. Refine the intervention model to address the child's adaptation to school and
           development of self-regulatory skills and underlying multiple dimensions of school
           success.

        2. Examine and test the consistency of developmental models of problem behavior, emotional
           adjustment, and normative self-regulation in childhood.

        3. Evaluate the long-term impact of intervention on risk pathways to later drug abuse and
           health-risking behaviors by examining early risk markers, including children's problem
           behavior, poor emotional adjustment, and lack of school readiness.
