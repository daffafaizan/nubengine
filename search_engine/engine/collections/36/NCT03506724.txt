      condition is responsible for about 12% of the maternal deaths in the United States.

      Currently, if pregnant patients present with severe hypertension they are either given IV
      labetalol, IV hydralazine of nifedipine based on individual provider preference. There are
      few studies in the literature comparing oral nifedipine and IV labetalol with mixed data
      showing either they are equally effective or a faster time to achieving target blood pressure
      for patients who received nifedipine.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate if there is a difference in time to achieve
      goal blood pressure in pregnant and postpartum patients who are treated with nifedipine and
      labetalol for severe range blood pressures defined as greater than 160/110. These
      anti-hypertensives are first line therapy for management of severe range blood pressures in
      pregnancy and postpartum by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG).
