      clinically significant symptoms of insomnia. In turn, insomnia symptoms have been associated
      with increased risk of alcohol-related problems, perhaps due to insomnia-related impairments
      in executive functioning, negative emotionality, and craving. The proposed project aims to
      examine improvements in insomnia as a mechanism for improvement in alcohol use among
      heavy-drinking Veterans with insomnia. Forty-four returning Veterans who report heavy
      drinking (â‰¥4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men) and have insomnia based on DSM-5 and
      research diagnostic criteria will participate in a randomized pilot trial. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive personalized normative alcohol feedback in the context of one
      of two treatment conditions: CBT-I (n = 22) or a sleep hygiene education control (SH; n =
      22). Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6 weeks),
      mid-treatment (after 3 sessions), and at 3 months post-intervention. Outcomes of interest
      include insomnia severity, total wake time, sleep quality, drinking quantity/frequency,
      alcohol-related consequences, executive functioning, negative affect, emotion regulation,
      craving for alcohol, and use of alcohol as a sleep aid.
