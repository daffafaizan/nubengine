      (HibMenC and LicMenC). An additional control group in the UK at the time of the second year
      follow-up for persistence (subjects aged 40-43 months primed with MenC conjugate and Hib
      vaccines in infancy with no subsequent booster dose, group NoBoost at Visit 2). These
      subjects will receive a Hib catch-up vaccine at 40-43 months of age. The subjects of groups
      HibMenC and LicMenC were randomized in the primary vaccination study 103974 and will not be
      further randomized. The subjects of group NoBoost will not be randomized. All subjects at the
      UK centre will receive Infanrix™-IPV at the second visit (i.e. 24 months after Menitorix
      booster or at 40-43 months of age). In addition, the subjects of group NoBoost will receive a
      Hib catch-up vaccine (Menitorix™) at the same visit.

      Subjects of groups HibMenC and LicMenC will have 3 blood samples taken for immunogenicity
      analyses: at 12, 24 & 48 months after the booster vaccination. Subjects of group NoBoost will
      have 1 blood sample taken for immunogenicity analyses at 40-43 months of age. 75 new subjects
      will be enrolled in this study (group NoBoost).
