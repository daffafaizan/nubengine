      mobility, nutritional status, psychological status, and social circumstances as well as
      measurements of cellular senescence and chronic inflammation will be performed in a cohort of
      prostate cancer patients at baseline (before radiotherapy), at the end of radiotherapy and at
      follow-up intervals thereafter. The evaluation of aging-related biomarkers will include
      determination of markers of cellular senescence and markers of systemic inflammation. The
      correlation between genetic variants modulating telomere length and the risk of developing
      age-related phenotypes will also be analyzed.
