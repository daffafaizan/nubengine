      been investigated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, however, there is a lack of
      preventive intervention on postherpetic neuralgia. A recent retrospective study revealed that
      the administration of gabapentin during the acute herpes zoster period significantly
      decreased the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. In the present study, the investigators
      aim to conduct a prospective, randomized, open-label, endpoint blinded study to investigate
      the preventive efficacy of prophylactic use of duloxetine on postherpetic neuralgia.
