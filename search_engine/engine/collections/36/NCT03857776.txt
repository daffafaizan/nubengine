    
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will participate in a scheduled open dialogue
      about CAM with a specialist nurse, who has completed the Fellowship in Integrative Medicine
      at the University of Arizona. This is a training program for health professionals in
      empowering individuals and communities to optimize health and well-being through
      evidence-based, sustainable and integrative approaches. The open dialogue will be based on
      the fundamentals of person-centered care according to this program and include patient
      preferences and wishes, reliable information and counselling and advice about the potential
      risks and benefits of using CAM as an adjunct to conventional oncology care.

      All dialogue, each lasting approximately 60 minutes, will be conducted by the same nurse as
      soon as possible and at the latest two weeks after enrolment. According to patient needs and
      wishes there may be a follow-up dialogue over the telephone or in the Oncology Outpatient
      Clinic. The potential second dialogue is estimated to last approximately 30 minutes.

      Participants in the control group will receive standard information including reference to
      www.KABcancer.dk, which is a website presenting research on CAM, including information about
      its potential effects and outcomes.
