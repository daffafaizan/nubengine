      arthritis (RA) but no consensus exists. The aim of this study is to study the efficacy of
      various treatment regimens in early RA. Patients were divided into three groups. In group A,
      patients were treated with single drug (methotrexate 15 mg/wk). The patients in Group B were
      treated with a combination of DMARDS (Methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine).
      The patients in Group C received combination therapy as in group B and 3 pulses of
      methylprednisolone intravenously.
