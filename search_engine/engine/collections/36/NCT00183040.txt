      functional capacity for activities of daily living. Aging is also associated with a loss of
      hormones believed to be related to muscle and strength, namely testosterone and growth
      hormone (GH). The hypothesis being tested is that both hormone systems regulate
      musculoskeletal protein mass and contractile fibers by different and complimentary mechanisms
      and that optimal levels of both testosterone and GH are necessary to maintain skeletal muscle
      mass, muscular strength and power, and full functional activities of daily living during the
      aging process.

      This is a controlled, 16 week study to evaluate the independent effects and interaction of
      these two anabolic hormone systems in community dwelling elderly men 65-90 years of age who
      are hyposomatotropic (deficiency of growth hormone) with low eugonadal status (total
      testosterone of 150-550 ng/dL). The study will utilize a two tiered randomization in which
      108 study participants will first be randomized to either the low or high eugonadal level of
      testosterone using a novel Leydig cell clamp method (GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)
      agonist plus topical testosterone supplementation) to achieve target levels of testosterone.
      Low gonadal status (150-550 ng/dL) will be maintained with 5 g daily doses of topical
      testosterone, whereas high gonadal status (650-950 ng/dL) will be achieved with 10 g daily
      doses. Within these two groups, participants will be randomized to receive placebo or one of
      two doses of rhGH (recombinant human growth hormone) therapy (0, 3.0, 5.0 mcg/kg/day) in a
      double blinded fashion.
