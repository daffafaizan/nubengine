      in healthy volunteers at three different doses. The data obtained from this study will
      provide us with pharmacokinetic information that will help develop dosing regimens for future
      clinical efficacy studies in anxiety patients. Currently, there is no information on the
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of amiloride in humans after intranasal administration.
      All participants will be allowed to self-administer amiloride nasal spray at 0.2, 0.4, and
      0.6 mg doses of amiloride. A series of timed blood samples (0,10, 15, 30, 60 minutes, and 4,
      6, 8, 12 and 24 hours,1mL each time point) will be collected.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of amiloride nasal spray at three different doses 0.2,
           0.4, and 0.6 mg in healthy human volunteers.

        2. To calculate the following pharmacokinetic parameters after intranasal administration of
           amiloride: time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), maximum plasma
           concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), the volume of distribution (Vd) and
           clearance (CL).
