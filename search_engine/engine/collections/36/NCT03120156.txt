      separated into 3 training-groups. Exclusion criteria are structural neuropathic cause for
      dizziness, severe ocular deficience, cochlear causes for dizziness.

      The 3 Groups differ in following criteria:

      Group 1: Gets basic insoles after 3-D-Scan of the foot Group 2: Gets sensomotoric insoles
      (Jahrling) after 3-D-Scan of the foot. Group 3: Control-Group = no insoles

      Alle groups are doing a 6 weeks proprioceptive training 2 times a week for 45min.
      Balance-Ability is measured by a posturographic plate prior to the training, after 3 weeks
      training and after 6 weeks of training. ABC-Score, Tinetti Gait and Balance test and
      functional reach test are secondary outcome measurements and are evaluated prior the training
      and after 6 weeks of training.
