      vivo-generated allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells with or without preceding
      non-myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy.

      This study is a phase I safety and feasibility study in a series of 12 patients who are
      suffering from recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Prior to NK
      cell infusion, a laparoscopy is performed to place a catheter in the peritoneal cavity. The
      first cohort of three patients will receive an intraperitoneal infusion of allogeneic UCB-NK
      cells generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from an allogeneic
      UCB unit without a preparative regimen. In the second group of three patients the same UCB-NK
      cell dosage will be given with a preparative regimen of four days non-myeloablative
      immunosuppressive conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (CyFlu). If no
      severe toxicity is seen in these 6 patients, an extension cohort of 6 patients will be
      included to answer the secondary objective.
