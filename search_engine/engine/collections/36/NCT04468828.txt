      Boney landmarks (shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, etc.) will be used to place small reflective
      markers for use with motion capture analysis. The radar will be positioned so that the MDS
      data can be captured simultaneously with the motion capture data. Each volunteer will
      complete the following activities: â€¢ Walk with athletic shoes

        -  Walk with bilateral heel lifts in shoes

        -  Walk with unilateral heel lift

        -  Squat jump with athletic shoes

        -  Squat jump with bilateral heel lifts in shoes

        -  Squat Jump with unilateral heel lift

        -  Stationary standing posture with athletic shoes

        -  Stationary standing posture with bilateral heel lifts in shoes

        -  Stationary standing posture with unilateral heel lift Each activity will be performed
           three times toward the radar in order to assess repeatability and reliability, and also
           for maintaining adequate statistical training and testing datasets for confirming the
           use of previous established classification algorithms. These algorithms will again be
           used to calculate prediction accuracy for the different activities (walking, jumping,
           and stationary posture) and different footwear conditions (shoes without inserts, shoes
           with bilateral inserts, shoes with unilateral inserts). The biomechanical motion capture
           data will be processed similarly to the MDS data to compare to accuracy between the two
           methods for the same observed task-specific differences. Our goal is to determine if MDS
           can achieve the same measurement accuracy as motion capture for the same task. Since
           biomechanical motion capture is the "gold standard" of human movement measurement, the
           successful completion of this aim will establish the validity of MDS as an effective
           clinical measure of human movement.
