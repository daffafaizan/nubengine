    
      The study was conducted as part of a master level course in Clinical Nutrition at the
      University of Oslo. Thus, the main objective of the study was to teach the master students
      about planning, conducting and analysing data from a clinical trial. The students themselves
      are subjects of the study, however the participation in the study was voluntary and did in no
      way affect the approval of the course.

      Since the primary objective of the study was teaching, the study was confirmed by the
      "Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics" (REC) to be exempt from REC
      approval.
