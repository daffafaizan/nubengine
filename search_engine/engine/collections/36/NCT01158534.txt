      I. To estimate the objective response rate of interferon alpha plus celecoxib in metastatic
      RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare cellular immune parameters in metastatic RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor
      immunostaining to patients with < 1+ tumor immunostaining.

      II. To evaluate the effect of celecoxib and interferon alpha therapy on cellular immune
      parameters in metastatic RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily and recombinant interferon alpha-2b
      subcutaneously, once daily, 5 times a week. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
