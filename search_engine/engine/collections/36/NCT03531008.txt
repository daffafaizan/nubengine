      collaboration with the Epilepsy Study Consortium. This study (which is called HEP2 for short)
      is designed to better understand the challenges of living with focal seizures that do not
      respond to medication. The HEP2 study will follow 200 people with medication-resistant focal
      epilepsy (with seizures that occur at least 2 times per month) over two years to measure
      changes in their seizure frequency, treatments used, adverse events experienced, presence of
      co-morbidities like depression and anxiety, healthcare costs, and quality of life. Blood
      samples will also be collected in order to look for biomarkers of epilepsy severity and
      treatment response.

      Participants can join the HEP2 study at any one of nine recruiting study centers. These study
      centers were selected because they are epilepsy centers with track records of conducting
      high-quality research in epilepsy and efficiently recruiting participants into studies. The
      designated sites for the HEP2 study are located in New York, California, Minnesota,
      Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. A participant may enroll in the HEP2 study but
      continue to receive their standard epilepsy care with their current physician, as long as the
      participant is willing to share his or her medical records, and travel to the study center
      for two or three in person visits at the beginning of the study, after the first year, and a
      final visit after the second year.
