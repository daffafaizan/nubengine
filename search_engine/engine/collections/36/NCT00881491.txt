      with a regenerative procedure using a triple antibiotic paste (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole,
      minocycline). However, this method can result in considerable staining due to minocycline. In
      this randomized clinical trial, we will compare clinical outcomes of a triple antibiotic
      paste versus a double antibiotic paste (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole) intracanal medicament
      as compared to a standard treatment (immediate apexification with MTA) in permanent teeth
      with necrotic pulps and immature root development. We hypothesize there will be no
      significant differences between radiographic measures of root development after treatment
      with either the double versus triple antibiotic paste, and that both methods will produce
      significantly greater increases in root length and width compared to standard treatment. The
      primary outcome measures will be radiographic measurement of root length and dentinal wall
      thickness and the secondary outcomes will be lack of clinical symptoms and crown staining.
