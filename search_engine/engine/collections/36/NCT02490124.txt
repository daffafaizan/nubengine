      will assess function in conduit (pulse wave velocity-PWV, flow-mediated dilation-FMD and
      augmentation index-AI), resistance (post-ischemic flow velocity-PIFV) and heart and skeletal
      muscle microvascular (contrast enhanced ultrasound-CEU) vessels before and after 2 hrs of a
      euglycemic insulin clamp.
