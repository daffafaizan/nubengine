      effectiveness of CS gel in preventing male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV among HIV
      sero-negative women at high risk for HIV infection. Eligible participants who are HIV
      negative, at risk for becoming infected, and are willing to use a vaginal microbicide each
      time they have intercourse throughout 12 months of study participation will be recruited in
      Port Harcourt and Lagos, Nigeria. The enrollment phase will last until 2,160 women have
      enrolled. It is anticipated that the enrollment will be completed within 12 months.
