    
      This is a prospective open-label randomised controlled trial among adult patients
      hospitalised after April 2020 for virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group: a 3-day course of 3 doses
      of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) consecutively on day
      1 to day 3 and hydroxychloroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg daily for 2 days plus standard
      care, or the control group: a 3-day course of hydroxycholoroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg
      daily for 2 days plus standard care alone (1:1).

      For the control group, if the day 4 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) viral load remains positive,
      then patients will receive another 3 days of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL
      (0.25mg; 8 million IU) and hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily.
