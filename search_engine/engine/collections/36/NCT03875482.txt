      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg/mL formulation in PFS in
      adult participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study included a 30-day
      screening period, a 28-week treatment period with study visits at Weeks 0, 4, 16 and 28, and
      a subsequent follow-up telephone call at approximately 20 weeks after the last dose of study
      drug. Study drug dosing consisted of 3 self-administered, subcutaneous (SC) doses on Weeks 0,
      4, and 16. Dosing on Week 4 was self-administered at home.
