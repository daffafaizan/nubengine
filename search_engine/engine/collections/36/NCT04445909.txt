      ECMO support, transcutaneous, arterial, venous, as well as end-tidal carbon dioxide partial
      pressure values are measured simultaneously at steady state conditions and compared with each
      other at various time points over a four-hour observation period. In addition, oxygen
      tensions are registered transcutaneously and in arterial and venous blood while respirator
      settings, sweep gas flow, ECMO flow, body temperature, volume status, and the dosage of
      vasopressors are also being recorded.
