      1:1 into intervention group and placebo-controlled group. Triptolide wilfordii (20mg tid po)
      would be given to invention group for 24 weeks. T cell activation and inflammation biomarkers
      including CD8+HLA-DR+CD38+, IL-6, D-Dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
      protein degradation-1 (PD-1), Ki67 ,soluble CD14 and CD163, PD-1, CCR5 and CD57 would be
      tested. Patients in placebo-controlled group will change to take Triptolide wilfordii (20mg
      tid po) for another 24 weeks. All patients will be followed up till 48 weeks. We hypothesis
      that Triptolide wilfordii might reduce immune activation and inflammation of HIV
      immunological non-responders and increase CD4 T cell count, which provides a new strategy for
      treatment of HIV-infected immunological non-responders.
