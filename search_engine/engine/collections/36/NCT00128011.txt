      technology transfer from Sweden, Vietnamese scientists developed and produced an oral killed
      monovalent cholera vaccine for Vietnam's public health programs. A 2-dose regimen of this
      vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious. Subsequently, a bivalent vaccine was
      developed containing the newly emergent O139 V. cholerae. This vaccine has several advantages
      over the existing Swedish vaccine. It confers protection against the El Tor biotype in
      younger children, is considerably less expensive, does not require a buffer during
      administration and does not require strict cold chain requirements. However, this vaccine is
      not licensed for use in countries other than Vietnam. In order to make this vaccine available
      to other countries, the IVI has provided technical assistance to produce this vaccine
      following the WHO Good Manufacturing Practices standards. A new formulation of the current
      oral cholera vaccine was produced following these guidelines. Since this vaccine is slightly
      different from the previous vaccine, a study is necessary to demonstrate safety and
      immunogenicity for local licensure and larger Phase III studies in other countries.
