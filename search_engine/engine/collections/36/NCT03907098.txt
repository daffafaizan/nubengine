      of endostar in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locoregionally recurrent or
      metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer.

      Endostar is an anti-angiogenesis drug. It is prepared by adding 9 amino acids to the
      N-terminal of the peptide chain on the basis of endostatin. Studies have shown that there may
      be a synergistic effect between endostar and chemotherapeutic agents.
