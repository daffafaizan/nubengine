    
      The Clinical Retrospective Reader Study is an observational case-controlled, multi-reader
      multi-case Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) study involving approximately 16
      Interpreting Physicians (Readers) and approximately 200 breast screening cases which will be
      reviewed and of those, 164 breast screening cases will be included in the primary data
      analysis. All primary data analysis cases will consist of screening mammogram and Automated
      Breast Ultrasound image readings from the same asymptomatic females with >50% parenchymal
      density for whom the screening mammogram was assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category 1
      (negative) or 2 (normal with benign findings).

      The Readers will review a total of 200 cases: the Non-Cancer Case Set, the Cancer Case Set,
      and additional Control and Supplemental Case Sets. These cases will be randomized during the
      reading session so each Reader will review the entire Case Set in a unique order.

      The primary Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis will be performed on the Readers'
      Likelihood of Malignancy (LOM) ratings from their initial review of the screening mammogram
      alone and their final review of the screening mammogram and Automated Breast Ultrasound for
      the Non-Cancer Case Set and Cancer Case Set.
