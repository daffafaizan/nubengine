      in conjunction with either CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
      scanning allows assessment of the metabolic activity of lesions as well as the structural
      anatomy of the lung. The standard radiolabelled tracer for PET is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) which labels metabolically active cells. However, one of the main limitations of FDG is
      the non-specific uptake leading to difficulty differentiating between tumours, infection and
      inflammatory pathologies.

      11C-acetate is a PET ligand used currently to image various conditions but has not been used
      to identify TB lesions previously. 11C-acetate may be taken up by the lipid bodies in the
      dormant bacteria in TB, enabling visualization of this sub-population of bacteria. Using the
      11C-acetate ligand for imaging pulmonary TB may add to the utility of PET scanning,
      potentially allowing monitoring of drug activity against the persister population and
      identification of those patients who may be at risk of relapse following drug therapy.

      This pilot study will compare 11C-acetate to the standard ligand, FDG, using PET/CT and
      PET/MRI. The target population for this study is those individuals with confirmed pulmonary
      TB who have a high chance of demonstrable bacillary burden who are therefore likely to have
      populations of persister bacteria in the lungs.
