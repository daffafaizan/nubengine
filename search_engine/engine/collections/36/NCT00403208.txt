    
      This is a multicenter observational-interventional study on critically ill patients who
      require mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, involving 13 ICU in Chile.

      Main exclusion criteria are neurologic impairment, previous chronic cardiac, liver and renal
      failure, second period of mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, short term expected
      mortality.

      There is an initial descriptive phase of sedation practice, involving sedative drugs,
      sedation level assessment, and outcome: ventilator-free days, ICU stay, costs and mortality.

      After a period of analysis and training, an analgesia-based, goal-directed, nurse-driven
      sedation protocol is applied. Fentanyl infusion is started and titrated to obtain a patient
      calm and cooperative or mildly sedated while on mechanical ventilation. Hypnotics and opiates
      i.v. boluses are allowed during the first hours of mechanical ventilation. Midazolam infusion
      is started if ventilatory distress continue despite fentanyl 1.8 Âµg/kg/min. Haldol, muscle
      relaxants and other sedative drugs are allowed depending on patient condition. After 48 hours
      of mechanical ventilation, sedative drugs are discontinued in the morning.

      Main outcome: ventilator-free days. Secondary outcome: ICU stay, costs, and sedation quality.
      At 6 moths SF-36. Each period is planned to included at least 140 patients, for a 20%
      difference in ventilator-free days, with 80% power and a 0.05 type I error.
