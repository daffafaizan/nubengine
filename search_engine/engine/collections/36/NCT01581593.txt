      experience recurrent protozoal, bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Antibody deficiencies
      make up the largest group of PIDs.

      The standard care for patients with PID is replacement immunoglobulin (a class of antibodies)
      solution. Prophylactic treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) solution has been
      shown to increase the time free from serious infection.

      Kedrion IVIG 10% is a new preparation of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) solution. Kedrion IVIG 10%
      will be given by IV infusion to all study participants. The data collected will help
      determine whether Kedrion IVIG 10% is suitable for treating PID subjects.
