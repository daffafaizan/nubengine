      the colon where they're used by selected groups of microflora positive bacteria, specifically
      bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.

      Therefore, oligosaccharides have prebiotic effects accountable for health benefits in
      infants.

      Over the last years the supplementation of infant formulae has been studied to mimic breast
      milk prebiotic functions enhancing gut microflora growth similar to that of breast fed
      infants.

      However further scientific data are necessary to support the efficacy of the supplementation
      of oligosaccharide in infant formulae.
