      issues resulting from the chronic comorbid condition of dysvascular lower limb amputation.
      This study examines the use of an evidence-based walking biobehavioral intervention to
      increase physical activity after dysvascular amputation. The proposed intervention leverages
      successes in conventional prosthetic rehabilitation, while addressing the complex health
      conditions and chronic sedentary behaviors that underlie dysvascular amputation, with the
      ultimate goal of improved physical activity self-management to minimize disability.
