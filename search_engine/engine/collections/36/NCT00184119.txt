      Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in an acute psychiatric department.The acute ward of Ã˜stmarka
      psychiatric department, St. Olavs Hospital has a PICU separated from the rest of the ward.
      The PICU is separated with a locked door. Under two different conditions at different times
      all patients evaluated to be in need of PICU were admitted to the PICU. In the first
      condition the doors inside the PICU and between the rest of the acute ward and PICU were
      closed or locked. In the second condition the doors inside the PICU and the door between the
      PICU and the rest of the acute ward were either removed or held permanently open. In the
      second condition the patients thus were admitted to a PICU unit not using PICU principles.

      The patients were evaluated with different rating scales at admittance, day three and at
      discharge from PICU.
