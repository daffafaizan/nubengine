      childhood headache. In this study, we have combined strategies from these interventions into
      a single, seven-session protocol to treat sleep and pain problems in youth with co-morbid
      headache and insomnia. In this single-arm pilot study, we will test the feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of this intervention.
