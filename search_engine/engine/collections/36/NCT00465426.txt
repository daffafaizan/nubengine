      demonstrate metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and body
      composition abnormalities that may predispose them to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Initial
      studies suggest increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and endothelial dysfunction in
      this population. Increased carotid IMT over time has been demonstrated in HIV-infected
      patients compared to control subjects. However, traditional risk factors, such as
      dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and body composition changes alone do not fully predict
      increased cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients. One possible explanation is
      increased inflammation, related directly to effects of ARV therapy or indirectly from changes
      in fat distribution. In preliminary studies, our group has shown that changes in fat
      distribution were highly predictive of TNF and IL-6, as well as adiponectin, and that
      specific inflammatory cytokines were related in cross-sectional studies to increased IMT. In
      the proposed study we will investigate using detailed methodologies the relationship between
      adipocytokine concentrations and subclinical atherosclerosis in both cross-sectional and
      longitudinal studies. We will determine in HIV-infected patients on ARVs for greater than 6
      months, progression rates of IMT and whether progression rates are predicted by increased
      inflammatory indices, controlling for traditional risk factors, and body composition changes.
      We will test the hypothesis that inflammation, more than traditional risk factors and ARV
      use, mediates subclinical atherosclerotic disease in HIV-infected patients.
