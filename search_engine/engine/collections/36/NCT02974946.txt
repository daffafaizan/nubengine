      KIDNEY study if they fulfil the inclusion criteria. Upon consent pre-operative blood tests
      will be as per the usual practice. Moreover, 2ml of the serum will be stored for NGAL
      analysis.

      Following the consenting process, patients will be randomised (envelop- based) into either
      having the RenalGuard® System (Study group) or current medical management (Control group).

      Study group:

      Patients in the study group will have the RenalGuard® System started in anaesthetic room once
      the peripheral line and arterial lines are sited. The RenalGuard® System will continue to run
      throughout the cardiac procedure in the operating room and up to 6 hours post-op after the
      patient has been transferred to the unit. Patients will be managed at a zero balance i.e.
      volume of the urine output will be matched to the volume of Hartmann's fluid infusion. Forced
      diuresis is then initiated.

      Control group:

      Patients in the control group will be managed as per current medical practice which will
      include no forced diuresis in operating room and the use of inotropes for maintenance of mean
      arterial pressure and intravenous furosemide for diuresis.

      An additional blood test (NGAL) at six hours post-op will be taken and would require 2mls of
      blood. The NGAL specimens will be dealt with by the biochemistry lab (centrifuged & stored)
      so that the specimens can be analysed in batches.

      Patients kidney function (U&Es) will be tested at the time of post-operatively as per usual
      practice (Day1, pre-discharge and as clinically indicated) and at the post-operative surgical
      out-patient visit.

      Pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative data will be collected for each patient
      group.
