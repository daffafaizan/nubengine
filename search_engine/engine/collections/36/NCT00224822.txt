      disorders, associated with marked social or occupational dysfunction, tenfold suicidal risk,
      intensive healthcare resource utilization and poor prognosis. Atypical antipsychotics
      developed in the last decade are proving beneficial to a subset of patients. These agents
      share a reduced risk for EPS and tardive dyskinesia in comparison with first generation
      antipsychotics. They also appear to improve negative, cognitive, and depressive symptoms
      while being at least as efficacious as first generation "typical" drugs in controlling
      positive symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Unfortunately, during the
      late 1990's, case reports and studies began to document a number of adverse events associated
      with the use of most second generation antipsychotics such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia and
      hyperglycemia subsumed under the name "metabolic syndrome". Aripiprazole has a unique
      pharmacological mechanism, making this drug the ideal medication for treatment to patients
      who experience metabolic syndrome from other second generation antipsychotics. In numerous
      pervious trials, it has been demonstrated that aripiprazole is a safe and effective treatment
      for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder and that it may actually
      reduce plasma glucose levels and improve lipid profiles, lowering the risk for cardiovascular
      disease and /or diabetes. Thirty patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or
      bipolar disorder who have experienced a 10 pound increase in weight while on a second
      generation antipsychotic or hyperlipidemia, or hyperglycemia, will switch to aripiprazole and
      be monitored for any improvement in BMI, lipids and glucose.
