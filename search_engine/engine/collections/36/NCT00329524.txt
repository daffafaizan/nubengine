      debilitating unilateral or bilateral tinnitus. All subjects must report experiencing the
      presence of their phantom auditory perception for at least 6 months and have a Tinnitus
      Handicap Questionnaire (THQ) score >30. Subjects will be recruited from the Otolaryngology
      Clinic at UAMS, where routine testing includes a physical exam; pure tone audiometry; and
      evaluation of middle ear status using tympanometry, stapedius reflex tests, and otoscopy.
      Patients will undergo a gadolinium-contrast MRI of the head to rule out acoustic neuroma or
      any other central nervous system pathology. All subjects will be thoroughly informed of the
      risks associated with the procedures in this study, as described in the Hazards to Subjects
      section, and written informed consent will be obtained. Subjects will be recruited for this
      study without regard to race or ethnicity.
