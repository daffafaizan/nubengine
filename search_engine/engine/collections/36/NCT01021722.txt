      The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Lund University and informed
      consent was obtained from all the women involved. Twenty-six women presenting with at least a
      3B rupture were recruited by one of the two surgeons (MJ, PL). The modified technique
      included:

        1. Adoption of a structured way of describing the damage according to Fornell an
           co-workers[7] and recommended by RCOG.[8] Grade 3A: any tear of the ESM < 50% Grade 3B:
           an ESM tear > 50% Grade 3C: related damage to the ISM Grade 4: related rupture of the
           anal mucosa

        2. The use of monofilament resorbable suture material for all sutures in the mucosa or
           sphincter muscles. The anal mucosa was sutured with a continuous layer of 3.0 glycomer
           631 (Biosyn® ,Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, MA, USA); the ISM with a continuous layer of
           3.0 glycomer 631; and the ESM (both superficial and profound portions) with interrupted
           end-to-end 2.0 glycomer 631 sutures. The perineal body was usually sutured with 2.0 or
           3.0 lactomer (Polysorb®, Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, MA, USA).

        3. Metronidazole 1.5g as a single IV injection and/or Cefuroxime 1.5g IV during the
           procedure and 6 hours post-operative was usually given as prophylaxis.

        4. All women were sutured under either regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural, or pudendal)
           or general anaesthesia. Thus, the modified procedure included both a new technique of
           suturing and the operation was performed by one of the two surgeons involved in the
           study. Apart from this, all women were treated according to routine departmental
           practice.
