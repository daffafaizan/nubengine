    
      Two panels, each consisting of eight participants (8 elderly males with mild to moderate
      hypertension in Panel A and 8 elderly females with mild to moderate hypertension in Panel B)
      will be randomized to receive either MK-8266 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Participants
      will receive single doses of MK-8266 or matching placebo in three treatment periods (Periods
      1 through 3). In both Panel A and Panel B, doses will escalate in a rising, fixed sequence.
      In Period 1 (0.3 mg), Period 2 (0.6 mg), and Period 3 (0.7 mg and then 0.3 mg 10 hours later)
      once daily doses of MK-8266 or matching placebo will be administered.

      All participants will receive at least 2 doses of MK-8266. Participants completing placebo
      treatment in Period 1 will flow to the MK-8266 arm in the next period, with 2 participants
      from the MK-8266 arm receiving placebo in the next period.

      Blood samples will be obtained pre-dose and at selected time points up to 48 hours post-dose
      for determination of MK-8266 plasma concentrations.
