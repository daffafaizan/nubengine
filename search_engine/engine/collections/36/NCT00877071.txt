    
      LC BeadTM is a new product specifically designed for TACE. LC BeadTM microspheres can be
      loaded with doxorubicin (Trade name: adriamycin), a chemotherapeutic anthracycline glycolide
      agent widely accepted for treatment of HCC. This novel bead slowly releases the ionically
      bound chemotherapeutic agent rather than administering a bolus of chemotherapy as is the case
      with many alternative methods of TACE. Thus, the LC BeadTM offers the potential advantage of
      less toxicity and prolonged tumor exposure.

      This study offers local regional therapy to a defined population of patients beyond
      transplant criteria as an attempt to downstage them to eligibility for liver transplantation.
      This study will make an important contribution to understanding the beads' local effect as
      seen in the explanted livers of those patients who go on to receive a liver transplant.
      Additionally, we will examine the impact of this novel treatment tool on patients' quality of
      life.
