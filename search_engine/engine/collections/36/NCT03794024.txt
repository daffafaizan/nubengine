    
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between dorsal column spinal cord
      stimulation and dorsal root ganglion spinal cord stimulation in patients with Complex
      Regional Pain Syndrome at an infraumbilical location who have failed a course of conservative
      management including analgesic pharmacotherapy and physical therapy.

      This is a prospective randomized post-marketing clinical study. Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to Dorsal Column or Dorsal Root Ganglion Spinal Cord Stimulation if they have
      failed a course of conservative management including analgesics and physical therapy. All
      patients are expected to undergo clinical, neurological, and imaging assessments, if
      appropriate, at selected follow-up visits.

      The study will be conducted a single center with a target maximum of 62 patients (31
      randomized to each group).

      Enrollment of subjects in this study is anticipated to take 24 months. Clinical follow-up
      evaluations will be conducted at 10 days, 1, 3 and 6 months post-implant. The total study
      duration is expected to be at least 30 months.

      All patients presenting to the Investigators with Budapest criteria, research subset , for
      the diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome at an infraumbilical location who have not
      had an adequate response to a course of conservative management including analgesics and
      physical therapy will be screened for eligibility. A Screening/Enrollment Log will be
      utilized in order to maintain a cumulative tracking of all screened patients.

      Patients must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment in the clinical study.
      Reasons for screening failure(s) will be documented.
