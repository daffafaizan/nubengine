      discloses the patient's current risk of ACN, based on a prediction rule developed and
      validated by Dr. Thomas Imperiale, a member of the study team. The Imperiale Prediction Rule
      uses five variables (gender, age, CRC family history, waist circumference, and smoking
      history) and identifies a wide range of risk for current ACN among average risk patients. For
      patients with "high-average" risk (22%), personalized messages in the decision aid and
      provider notification highlight the advantage of colonoscopy because of the likelihood of
      finding and removing an ACN. For patients at low risk for ACN (2% or 4%), personalized
      messages highlight the advantage of stool testing, due to the relatively low chance of
      failing to detect ACN.

      The investigators' long-term goal is to increase uptake of CRC screening by informing and
      improving patient and provider discussion and decisions. The main objective of this project
      is to test whether providing patients and their providers with personalized messages about
      ACN risk results in higher screening uptake and higher decision quality, compared to an
      approach that does not utilize ACN risk.
