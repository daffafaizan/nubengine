      patients with steroid resistant chronic graft versus host disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Phase I: Patients receive fludarabine IV over less
      than 30 minutes for 1-3 days. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of relapse of underlying disease, malignancy, graft rejection, or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with progressive graft versus host disease after completion of 3 courses
      are taken off study. Patients with complete response are taken off study. Patients with
      partial response may continue treatment at the immediate prior dose level. Cohorts 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive fludarabine at the MTD from phase I of the
      study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
