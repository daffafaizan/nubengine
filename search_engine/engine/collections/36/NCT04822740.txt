    
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the use of a continuous glucose monitoring
      system (CGMS) on glycemic variability in diabetic patients admitted in Intensive care unit
      (ICU) for an acute coronary syndrome ( ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) or
      Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)) and treated with insulin infusion
      with a standardized protocol.

      60 patients in 2 centers will be included, and all patient will have the CGMS (Dexcom G6
      model).

      Randomization will be done in the 12 hours after admission. Participants will be randomized
      in two groups :

        -  Conventional strategy: management of hyperglycemia with standard of care, glycemia
           monitoring with capillary blood glucose measurement. The goal is to maintain glycemia
           between 140-180mg/dL. CGMS will be blinded in this group.

        -  Novel strategy: management of hyperglycemia using CGMS. Measurements of CGMS will be
           transmitted in real time to medical staff and use to maintain glycemia between
           140-180mg/dL. Alarms will be set to warn medical staff in case of glycemia outside the
           range.

      The duration of follow-up for each patient will be 72 hours or until discharge from Intensive
      care unit (if <72 hours)
