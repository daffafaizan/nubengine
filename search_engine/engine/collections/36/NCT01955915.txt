      iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Iris melanomas rarely metastasize (spread to other tissues
      or organs). In contrast, uveal melanomas arising in the ciliary body and choroid are highly
      malignant (cancerous and invasive to other tissues or organs). Despite having excellent local
      tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a life-threatening cancer, and even eye-sparing
      therapy with radiation treatment often leads to significant loss of vision. Therefore
      patients diagnosed with uveal melanoma must cope with not only a life-threatening illness,
      but also the frightening prospect of significant vision loss. Choroidal melanomas located in
      the posterior pole, an anatomical area of the eye which includes the optic nerve and macula
      (central retina), are of particular concern with regards to visual outcome, as radiation
      treatment to these areas for even the smallest of tumors is often associated with severe
      vision loss. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of small choroidal melanomas is critical to
      patient survival. When tumors with metastatic potential are recognized and treated at an
      early stage, survival prognosis improves dramatically.

      The purpose of this study is to learn if malignant (life-threatening) choroidal tumors versus
      benign (non-life-threatening) tumors will show distinct blood vessel patterns using
      functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Angiography is the mapping of
      blood vessels. The investigators believe that OCT angiography can provide data which may help
      in identifying life-threatening tumors at the earliest stages and improve overall survival
      for patients with this type of melanoma.
