    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the timing, pathophysiology, and magnitude of changes in tumor imaging and
      pharmacodynamic markers with XL184 (cabozantinib-s-malate) treatment in metastatic castrate
      resistant prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) achieved with XL184 in metastatic castrate
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of the therapy, and the toxicities associated. III. To
      evaluate overall survival (OS) in metastatic CRPC patients post androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) treated with XL-184.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then
      periodically thereafter.
