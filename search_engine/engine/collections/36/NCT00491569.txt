      symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments. In addition to dopamine system
      hyperactivity, hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a role in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Consequently, enhancing NMDA receptor neurotransmission has
      been regarded as a novel treatment approach. To date, there have been several reported trials
      on NMDA enhancers. Both sarcosine (N-methylglycine, a glycine transporter I inhibitor) and
      D-serine (a potent NMDA-glycine site agonist) showed therapeutic effects in chronically
      stable patients. Interestingly, sarcosine appeared more efficacious than D-serine in acutely
      exacerbated ones when added-on to antipsychotics. Both sarcosine and D-serine yielded
      excellent safety profiles.

      It remains unclear whether sarcosine can be also more efficacious than D-serine in the
      treatment for chronically stable schizophrenia. The aim of this project is to examine the
      efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of sarcosine vs. D-serine in chronically stable
      schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics.

      In the study, 60-75 schizophrenic patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly
      assigned into the three groups (2 gm/d sarcosine, 2 gm/d D-serine, or placebo) with a
      double-blind manner. Clinical manifestation (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS],
      side effects and quality of life (QOL) are evaluated every two weeks during the trial.. The
      efficacies of three groups are compared.
