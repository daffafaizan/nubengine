      patterns of salivary cortisol, cardiovascular, and electrodermal activity account for our
      previously observed significant outcomes (i.e., reduced irritability and hyperactivity, and
      improved social and communication), and additional outcomes (emotion regulation and caregiver
      quality of life), in youth ages 6-16 yrs. with ASD and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses
      randomized to a 10-week manualized THR intervention compared to a no-horse Barn Activity (BA)
      control (Aim 1). We will evaluate the durability of Aim 1 outcomes in the THR group compared
      to the BA control group six-months after the intervention period (Aim 2). Finally, we will
      explore dose and sub-population effects of THR and BA interventions by comparing effect size
      differences in THR and BA groups to (a) a 10-week wait-list control group; (b) a Hybrid
      intervention group (five weeks BA followed by five weeks THR); and (c) a subsample of the THR
      study population randomized following psychiatric hospitalization (Aim 3).
