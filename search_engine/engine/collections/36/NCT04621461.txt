      action depending on the concentration Zinc supplementation has been reviewed extensively for
      use in the common cold, and has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms. In-vitro
      studies have shown zinc can inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in coronavirus, which
      is typically a conserved region in the viral genome. In-vitro experiments have also shown
      that lung epithelium in a zinc depleted state can become susceptible to apoptosis and loss of
      barrier function, increasing permeability, which can lead to acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS).

      If a patient can travel to St. Francis Hospital they can have a COVID test on site at a
      designated St. Francis testing location. The COVID test will be resulted via a rapid Covid
      (Point of Care device) or at a local lab.

      Patients who are unable to travel to St. Francis Hospital or one of the outpatient practices,
      will be allowed to enroll remotely. Patients are eligible to enroll within 72 hours of a
      positive Covid-19 test result. Study medications will be mailed to the patient overnight
      after being enrolled.
