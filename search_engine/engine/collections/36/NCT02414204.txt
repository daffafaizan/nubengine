      Sildenafil compared to placebo will improve the vascular health of arteries and veins before
      arteriovenous fistula creation (shunt) and how quickly your veins and arteries dilate and
      increase in blood flow after fistula creation. An arteriovenous fistula (shunt) is a
      connection between the artery and vein in the arm for dialysis use. Another purpose of this
      study is to determine if Sildenafil reduces the blood and tissue levels of oxidants prior to
      fistula creation. Oxidants are harmful substances in the body that damage the cells tissues,
      and organs.
