    
      This is a Phase II open-label, baseline-controlled study. Approximately 10 adult male or
      nonpregnant female patients known to have had a myocardial infarct (nonacute) are intended to
      be enrolled at the current dose.

      Prior to entry into this study, all subjects will undergo a standard physical examination
      including medical history, details regarding the prior myocardial infarct(s), prescription
      and over-the-counter drug questionnaire, vital signs, ECG, evaluation of the major organ
      systems, hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis. In addition, female subjects will
      undergo a serum pregnancy test. All subjects will sign an Informed Consent prior to entry
      into the study.

      EVP 1001-1 will be administered intravenously over approximately one minute. Safety will be
      assessed by monitoring vital signs, ECG, and blood test after giving EVP 1001-1. MRI will be
      performed before and after EVP-1001-1 to measure enhancement relative to areas of myocardial
      infarction.
