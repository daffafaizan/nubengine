      abdomen. One of the areas will be treated by fractional laser once every three months for 2
      times combined with PRP injection once a month for 6 times. Another area will be treated by
      nanofat grafting once every three months for 2 times and PRP therapy once a month for 6
      times. The participants were asked to come back 1、3、6、9 months after treatment for further
      follow-up.

      Before and after the treatment, the striae gravidarum will be assessed subjectively by
      satisfaction assessment, dermatoscope and ultrasound, and objectively by immunohistochemical
      analysis.
