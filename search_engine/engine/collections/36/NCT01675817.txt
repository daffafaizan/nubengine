      perioperatively in cardiac surgery through measurement of functional assays of heparin
      (anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). In the first phase of this study, protamine titration assays
      will be carried out on normal pooled plasma incubated with heparin in the laboratory.

      Once the correct dose of protamine required to neutralize the heparin is established in the
      laboratory, the second phase will begin. Herein, plasma samples from patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery (with anticoagulation with two different commercial preparations of heparin)
      will be evaluated for residual heparin (Anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). Protamine titration
      assays wil then be carried out in vitro to assess neutralization of heparin.
