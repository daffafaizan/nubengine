      infection in the US, causing almost half a million cases per year with an estimated annual
      cost of 4.8 billion dollars. Despite the existence of a few treatment options against CDI,
      yearly attributable deaths are estimated at 29,300 in the US. From April 2014 to April 2016,
      Froedtert Health reported 899 CDIs. Over half of these events are NAAT (Nucleic Acid
      Amplification Test)(+)/EIA (Enzyme immunoassay)(-) events. To test for CDI, NAAT followed by
      EIA is used in a Multistep algorithmic testing in which a sensitive nucleic acid
      amplification test (NAAT) is followed by a specific toxin A and toxin B enzyme immunoassay
      (EIA) and are among the most accurate methods for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)
      diagnosis. There is currently uncertainty on how to treat these CDI events.

      The primary outcome of this randomized double blind controlled intervention trial will be
      changes in C. difficile (Clostridium difficile) loads between day 1 and day 14 and changes in
      C. difficile load between day 14 and day 28. Thirty patients with documented C. difficile
      will be randomized to either 14 days of vancomycin or placebo capsules. Block randomization
      will be used to assign patients to the treatment or placebo arms. Randomized assignments will
      be placed in sealed envelopes which will only be handled by the research pharmacist. Study
      related stool collections will be obtained on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (+/- 2days) [Day
      1=first day study drug was administered]. Patients will be followed for 90 days starting on
      day 1. Patients unable to complete at least 7 days of study treatment will be removed from
      analysis and replaced.
