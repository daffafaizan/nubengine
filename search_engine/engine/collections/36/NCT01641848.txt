      data from which to design a pivotal IDE study. FDA has stated that their decision for this
      was based upon "adequate safety information" which was submitted to them as part of the
      original IDE submission. Therefore, the purpose of this "limited enrollment" registry study
      is to gather initial data on the device's performance, when used with a Calcaneal Stem.
