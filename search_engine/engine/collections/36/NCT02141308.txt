      cross-sectional imaging of retinal and choroidal tissue structure in real time by measuring
      the intensity of reflected light. Tomographic images are generated by scanning the optical
      probe beam across the tissue structure of interest. OCT has become one of the most widely
      used imaging technologies by ophthalmologists. Its advantages include being a non-contact
      imaging modality, having micron-level resolution, producing a digital image that can be
      viewed electronically, and providing a reproducible quantitative measurement. New functional
      OCT including Doppler OCT and OCT angiography may allow an assessment of retinal blood flow
      and do away with the need for the more invasive fluorescein angiography (FA) test.

      Thus, if the diagnostic data provided by functional OCT are at least equivalent or superior
      to those achieved by FA, patients and healthcare providers could realize a substantial
      benefit in utilizing this technology in the evaluation of retinal vascular disease. Even in
      the scenario in which an FA is not usually clinically indicated, OCT angiography may provide
      information over that of standard OCT and clinical examination and history, that might help
      clinicians better understand the etiology of the disease, and may even help inform treatment
      response.
