    
      This study will evaluate the safety and drug detection of the dapivirine (DPV) vaginal ring
      (VR) and oral Truvada in breastfeeding mother-infant pairs.

      Mother-infant pairs will be randomly assigned to receive either the DPV VR or oral Truvada.
      Mothers randomized to the DPV VR will use the VR continuously for approximately one month (4
      weeks), replacing the VR each month for approximately three months (12 weeks). Mothers using
      the Truvada tablet will take one tablet by mouth daily for approximately three months (12
      weeks).

      Study visits will occur at Day 0, Weeks 1 and 2, and Months 1, 2, 3, and 3.5. Study visits
      may include behavioral assessments; product acceptability assessments; infant feeding
      assessments; physical examinations; blood, urine, and breast milk collection; and pelvic
      examination and specimen collection.
