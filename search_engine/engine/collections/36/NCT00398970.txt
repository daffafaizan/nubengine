      guides the sampling with brushing, biopsy or trans bronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) if the
      lesion not is visible. Ct guided trans-thoracic sampling will be performed if a the sample is
      non representative. This will delay the diagnosis, and trans-thoracic sampling has a higher
      risk of pneumothorax. The use of a ultrasound miniprobe might increase the diagnostic yield
      of bronchoscopy in non visible lesions. The ultrasound probe in a guide sheath is advanced to
      the lesion with use of X-ray fluorescence. When the lesion is visualised the miniprobe is
      removed and sampling is performed with TBNA, biopsy and brushing through the guide sheath. If
      rapid on site cytoevaluation is negative, new TBNA is performed. Previous trials have shown a
      diagnostic yield without ultrasound between 40-50% and with ultrasound between 60-80%. The
      studies with ultrasound have been performed by "super specialists". This study will evaluate
      bronchoscopy with the use of ultrasound miniprobe in clinical practice without "super
      specialists". It is a prospective randomised trial.
