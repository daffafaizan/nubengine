      weekly health-themed workshops designed to introduce basic literacy skills to children
      entering Kindergarten and their parents. There will be a pre and post test assessment for
      participating parents and children. During the 8 weeks, parents will receive 2-3 weekly text
      messages to reinforce material presented at the weekly workshop.
