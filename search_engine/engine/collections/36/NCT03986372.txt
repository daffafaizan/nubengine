      anterior knee pain, activity-related pain、local tenderness over inferior pole of patella. The
      discomfort can result in decreasing athletic performance and be one of the most challenge for
      sports medicine doctor.

      The patellar tendon suffer from repetitive microtrauma，result in reactive patellar
      tendinopathy. The overload tendon combining with risk factors of patellar tendinopathy will
      not recover timely and progress to chronic patellar tendinopathy. Hence, to reverse the
      progression is our aim.

      According to previous studies, several nonsurgical treatment options have been proposed such
      as medication, eccentric exercise, corticosteroid injection, shockwave and platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP). Among all the options, the effect of PRP could last longer. However, the type,
      concentration, time and frequent of injection are still debated。Moreover, there is no study
      about the relationship between efficacy and the ratio and concentration of growth factor in
      the PRP.

      The aim of this study is to understand (1) The effect of multiple injection of platlet-rich
      plasma in chronic patellar tendinopathy. (2) The effect of leukocyte-rich PRP in chronic
      patellar tendinopathy (3) Analyze the relation between efficacy of PRP and the growth factor
      in PRP.
