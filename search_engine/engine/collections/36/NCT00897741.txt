        -  Compare the gene expression profiles of pancreatic cancer cells from the primary and
           metastatic sites in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        -  Characterize the function of the differentially upregulated and downregulated genes
           identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of primary and metastatic cells in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Fresh biopsy samples are collected for gene expression profiling and other
      biomarker/laboratory analyses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
