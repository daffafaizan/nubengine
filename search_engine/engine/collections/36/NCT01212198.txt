      Therefore the importance of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes needs no further
      emphasis. At the moment, current studies demonstrate that mortality has increased twofold in
      the last 10 years due to lack of adequate control, and that medical expenses related to
      diabetes is increasing. Therefore, the necessity to find means for effective prevention and
      management of diabetes seems pressing.

      However, unfortunately, in Korea, results of systematic clinical trials carried out in the
      Korean population are not available. All the currently available management guidelines have
      been formulated based on the results of clinical trials carried out in other populations, on
      patients with perhaps different characteristics compared to ours. There are quite a number of
      problems in applying these guidelines to our patients.

      This study's purpose is to create a basis on which we could establish effective prevention,
      diagnosis, and therapeutic plan based on specific characteristics of Korean patients with
      type 2 diabetes.
