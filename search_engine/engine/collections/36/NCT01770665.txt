    
      This study will be conducted in two phases.

      During the Feasibility Phase, specimens from any tumor will be sent to the central DiaTech
      MiCK assay laboratory to determine the ease of sample acquisition, processing, transport, and
      assay interpretation.

      Once DiaTech has completed analyses for the feasibility phase specimens and has confirmed
      that the sample acquisition, processing, transport, and assay interpretation are appropriate,
      we will proceed with the Demonstration Phase.

      During the Mesothelioma Demonstration Phase, 20 mesothelioma samples will be assayed and the
      results will be correlated with prior patient therapy, performance status, and extent of
      disease.
