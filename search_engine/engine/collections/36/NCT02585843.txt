      Americans suffering from this syndrome. Hospitalization rates for acute decompensated heart
      failure (ADHF) are also remarkably high, exceeding more than 1 million admissions per year.
      Congestion is the main cause of hospitalization for ADHF. Loop diuretics as the main therapy
      for decongestion, often are not adequate since many patients with ADHF develop "loop diuretic
      resistance". These patients will require hospitalization for intravenous diuretic or other
      advanced decongestion therapies. Thus, novel decongestion therapies are needed to decrease
      hospital admission rates and subsequent complications of multiple hospitalizations.
      Hyperaldosteronism, not only is a pivotal pathogenic factor in HF, but also contributes to
      loop diuretic resistance. Attempts for normalization of circulatory aldosterone with
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), mainly spironolactone, have shown to decrease
      mortality in HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover,
      MRAs significantly decrease the rate of rehospitalization in both HF with preserved and
      reduced LVEF. The dose of spironolactone in these trials is 25mg daily. However, this dose
      does not increase natriuresis (urinary sodium excretion). Natriuresis is achieved with higher
      doses of MRAs. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of 7-day
      100mg daily of spironolactone on weight loss and resolution of signs and symptoms of
      congestion in patients aged 60 years with ADHF and loop diuretic resistance.
