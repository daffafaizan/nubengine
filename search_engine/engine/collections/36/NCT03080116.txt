    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the difference in antitumor effect between the treatment arms by
      measuring MRD following radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To measure differences between study arms in

        -  Proportions of post neoadjuvant prostate specific antigen (PSA) â‰¤ 0.3 ng/ml as a
           predictor of prostate cancer mortality

        -  T down-staging, complete pathological response, PSA kinetics, Testosterone kinetics,
           operation time, blood loss, grade of surgical difficulty

        -  New generation hybrid imaging 68Ga PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen) PET/MR
           (Positron emission tomography/Magnetic Resonance) derived parameters

        -  Early biochemical recurrence as prognostic factor of prostate cancer mortality

        -  Transcriptome and genome

        -  Tissue microarrays (TMA) protein expression (DNA repair, resistance etc.) by
           immunohistochemistry

        -  Perioperative safety and tolerability

        -  Quality of life, erection recovery, continence through validated preoperative and
           postoperative questionnaires pre and postop (IEEF5, ICIQ, EORTC QLQ-C30)

      OUTLINE: interventional, single center, phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled trial.
