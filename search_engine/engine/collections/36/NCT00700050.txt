      inflammation and progressive airway damage. Agents that reduce inflammation or enhance airway
      antibacterial defences hold potential therapeutic value. Therefore, there is considerable
      current interest in identifying and stimulating the activities of these agents. Although sex
      hormones are generally acknowledged to modulate respiratory inflammation, the downstream
      mechanism of such action remains incompletely understood.

      We have identified three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), responsive to sex hormone in the CF
      human respiratory tract, including one (LTF) with known activity against P. aeruginosa
      biofilm formation. Our preliminary results show additive activity of LTF and STH against P.
      aeruginosa biofilm formation, and that LTF and STH also inhibit attachment of P. aeruginosa
      to airway epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the concept
      that female sex hormones exert their negative effect on the CF lung, in part, by reducing the
      levels of these AMPs in the airway. The next step is to determine if female sex hormones
      alter airway inflammation and infection or AMP levels in the respiratory secretions of CF
      patients.
