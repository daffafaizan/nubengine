    
      In the present study, we observe perioperative findings of electroencephalogram in sedated
      and non-sedated elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.
      Electroencephalogram is performed before, during, and 1 day after surgery.

      After the induction of anesthesia, sedation is performed according to the patient's request.
      If a patient want to be sedated during surgery, one of the three sedatives (dexmedetomidine,
      propofol, and midazolam) is administered.
