    
      Pragmatic prospective randomized controlled assessor-blinded effect-size finding trial
      involving approximately 100 patients total at two academic tertiary care hospitals: Beth
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Patients
      will be randomized into one of two study groups: standard care group which uses Rocuronium
      (NMBA) as an adjunct for maintenance of general anesthesia and non-relaxant arm that avoids
      the use of NMBA and instead uses additional inhalational anesthetics, opioids, propofol,
      dexmedetomidine, or ketamine for maintenance of general anesthesia. Assessment of
      postoperative pulmonary complications and in-hospital mortality would be achieved by close
      review of the patient's medical records during the hospital stay, for a maximum of 28 days.
