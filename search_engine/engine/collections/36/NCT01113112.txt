      for the majority of ovarian cancer patients, identification of factors contributing to tumor
      progression is of paramount importance. Epidemiologic studies have suggested an association
      between biobehavioral factors such as life stress, depression, low social support and cancer
      progression. Direct links have been demonstrated between biobehavioral factors and cytokines
      supporting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that enhance tumor growth and
      progression. However, little is known regarding tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and
      interactions between TAM tumor cells in a way that favors tumor growth, but there is
      preliminary data indicating that ovarian cancer patients with higher levels of depressive
      symptoms and life stress have greater TAM production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a key
      molecule promoting angiogenesis and tumor invasion. We also have preliminary data that
      ovarian cancer patients with high levels of depressive symptoms accompanied by low social
      support have greater tumor expression of a number of genes related to inflammation and tumor
      progression.
