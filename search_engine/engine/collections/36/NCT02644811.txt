    
      Participants are recruited from the orthodontic specialist clinic in Gävle, Sweden. After
      informed consent participants are randomized into Group A and B. The treatment starts with
      extractions of the maxillary first premolars. Extractions are performed by the participants´
      general practitioner. Orthodontic treatment starts after the tooth extractions.

      All participants get treatment with fixed appliance according to the straight wire concept
      (3M Victory brackets, .022 slot size, McLaughlin-Bennet-Trevesi prescription). The
      recommended wire sequence is: .016 Heat Activated Nickel Titanium, .019x.025 Heat Activated
      Nickel Titanium, .019x.025 Stainless Steel. Treatment time is about two years.

      T0 (Before treatment start): Study models, baseline questionnaire,

      T1 (after tooth extractions, before the orthodontic treatment): Study models, cephalographic
      x-ray, questionnaire at the evening after tooth extractions, questionnaire one week after
      tooth extractions.

      T2 (After miniscrew placement (Group A), Before space closure): Study models, cephalographic
