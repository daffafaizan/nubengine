      health care because there are high morbidity and mortality rates during it (1).

      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a woman should wait at least 24 months
      after delivery before the next pregnancy to decrease the adverse maternal, perinatal ,and
      infant outcomes (2, 3).

      A woman's fertility may begin to return rapidly and ovulate within 4:6 weeks postpartum
      particularly if she is not exclusively breastfeeding. In addition , more than 50% of women
      become sexually active by 6 weeks postpartum (4, 5).

      So, it is important to provide highly effective contraception immediately after delivery
      before leaving the delivery setting especially in communities where women cannot return
      easily for follow up visits due to financial and social barriers or who have limited access
      to medical service (6, 7).

      The use of effective postpartum contraception particularly longـacting reversible
      contraception (LARC) methods like the intrauterine device (IUD) has been shown to decrease
      the risk of unintended pregnancy and its complications and avoid repeated caesarean sections
      with higher continuation rates of use than other methods 6 months after delivery (8-10).

      Immediate post placental intraـcaesarean IUD insertion has many advantages as it is effective
      reversible longـterm contraception, doesn't interfere with breastfeeding, is coitus
      independent and the woman can avoid discomfort and pain during the standard insertion and
      bleeding from insertion will be masked by lochia (11-14).

      Studies have shown that with effective provider training, the immediate postpartum IUD
      insertion (IPPIUD) complications such as expulsion, pelvic infection, bleeding, pain, missing
      threads ,and failure rates are not significantly different from those of interval PPIUD
      insertion (4:6 weeks) after delivery (15, 16).

      By using a novel technique in this study, these complications would be decreased.
