    
      Allergic rhinitis is a high-prevalence disease in many developed countries, affecting about
      10 to 20% of the general population. House dust mite allergens are known to cause perennial
      allergic rhinitis.

      In designing the present study, the guidelines proposed by the World Allergy Organization
      (WAO) task force for methodology of immunotherapy studies have been taken into consideration.

      After a 2-month screening period, patients will be administered the dose of 300 IR- or 500
      IR-house dust mite allergen-based tablets or placebo for a period of 12 months. The
      carry-over effect will be evaluated after a treatment-free follow up period of 12 months.
