    
      This protocol is designed to screen subjects (and some family members) with suspected or
      identified genetic diseases of allergic inflammation or mast cell homeostasis and activation.
      Patients determined by clinical history and initial outside evaluation by their referring
      physician to be of interest will be consented and enrolled into this study. Blood specimens
      stored blood products and derivatives, saliva, hair, finger nail clippings, cord blood,
      umbilical cord, and/or buccal swabs from such patients and/or their family members will be
      obtained for research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of
      these diseases. Outside medical records may be obtained for chart review to correlate
      clinical history to research laboratory testing results. Results will be relayed to the
      referring physicians and, where applicable, patients will be referred to other appropriate
      National Institutes of Health protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The
      study will enroll up to 1000 subjects and family members.
