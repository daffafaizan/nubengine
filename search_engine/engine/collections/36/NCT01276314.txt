      Stevens-Johnson syndrome(SJS), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)
      is a life threatening disease. There is no gold standard in the therapy of SCAR. Treatment
      with high dose systemic corticosteroids is controversial. Although there have been recent
      reports of success with various therapies such as plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous
      immunoglobulins, their efficacy is not yet proven. Assessment of these therapies is difficult
      because of their non-specific immunosuppressant or immunomodulating modes of action. Recent
      studies have shown evidence of the pathogenetic importance of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a,
      suggesting a new therapeutic approach in selective blockade of TNF-a using specific
      antibodies. We report successful treatment TEN using monoclonal IgG anti-TNF-antibodies. The
      aims of this project are (1) to compare the effect of treatment between systemic steroid and
      anti-TNF-α. Including skin healing time, beginning of re-epithelialization time, internal
      organ recovery time, mortality rate, adverse events and (2) to investigate the molecular
      mechanism of severe cutaneous adverse reaction after anti-TNF-α treatment.
