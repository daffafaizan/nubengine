        -  Determine the toxicity and tumor response in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or
           refractory malignancies treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine, interferon alfa, and
           long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia (LL-WBH).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cisplatin.

        -  Phase I and II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 8. Patients
           receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 15, followed by subcutaneous interferon alfa on
           days 16 and 17. Patients undergo long-duration, low temperature whole body hyperthermia
           over 6 hours plus gemcitabine over 30 minutes on day 17. Courses repeat every 5 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
           which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The MTD of
           cisplatin is used for phase II study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
