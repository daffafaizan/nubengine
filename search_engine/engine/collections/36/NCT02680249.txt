    
      This study will assess in healthy male subjects a solid oral dose formulation of CTP-656
      under fasted and fed conditions.

      Primary:

      â€¢ To characterize the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of a single 150 mg
      solid oral dose of CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and fed
      moderate-fat conditions.

      Secondary:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of metabolites of CTP-656 following a single
           150 mg solid oral dose of CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and
           fed moderate-fat conditions.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability following a single 150 mg solid oral dose of
           CTP-656 in healthy volunteers under fasted, fed low-fat and fed moderate-fat conditions.
