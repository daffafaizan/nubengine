    
      This is a single arm, open-label, Phase Ib/II study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the oral AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 when administered to
      subjects with proteasome inhibitor refractory MM.

      During Part 1 of the study, dose escalation will follow a 3 + 3 dose escalation procedure
      starting with an initial dosing regimen of 125 mg GSK2110183 with escalate to next dose level
      with an increase of GSK2110183 less than or equal to 50% if DLTs are below a certain level
      described in the protocol. Subjects will receive a single dose of GSK2110183 on Day -3 of
      Cycle 0, followed by PK sampling over the next 72 hours. Cycle 1 may commence at any time
      (but within 7 days) after collection of the 72 hour Cycle 0 PK sample. GSK2110183 will be
      administered to subjects in sequential PK Cohorts on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21
      day cycles until one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria is met. Sparse PK sampling
      will also be collected during the first 8 cycles. Urine PK samples will be collected prior to
      the first dose of GSK2110183 and as a 24-hour urine collection at steady-state. The PK
      Cohorts will characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK2110183 in plasma and urine, as well as
      determine the RP2D of GSK2110183. The RP2D will be that dose that provides adequate PK
      exposure and biologic activity without exceeding the MTD in MM subjects as defined in the
      current study. GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy will not be given to subjects who
      progress on GSK2110183 monotherapy in the PK Cohorts. Following the completion of PK sampling
      in the PK Cohorts and the determination of a RP2D of GSK2110183, Part 2 of the study will
      then commence at the RP2D.

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the R2PD using a flexible 2-stage design with a
      stopping rule to allow for early termination based on lack of efficacy at the end of Stage 1.
      GSK2110183 will be administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21-day cycles until
      one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria is met. Twenty subjects will be enrolled in
      Stage 1, if no subject responds, the study will be stopped; otherwise, the study will
      continue to enroll an additional 20 subjects in Stage 2. At the end of Stage 2, if 4 or fewer
      of 40 subjects respond, the study will not be deemed as a success for the monotherapy. Those
      subjects meeting the criteria for progression during Part 2 [as defined by the 2011 Report of
      the International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 1], who also meet the additional
      eligibility criteria for salvage therapy may proceed to GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage
      therapy. GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy will be continued until one of the Treatment
      Discontinuation Criteria is met.

      Exploratory PK/PD analyses may be performed in Part 1 and Part 2 to examine the potential
      relationships between GSK2110183 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers (e.g., pAKT,
      pPRAS40 in the bone marrow), markers for disease activity in serum (e.g., beta-2
      microglobulin, C-reactive protein), or blood-based cytokines and angiogenesis factors (e.g.,
      IL-6, VEGF).

      A secondary objective of this study is to determine whether the addition of bortezomib to
      GSK2110183 has clinical activity in patients refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy who
      progress on single-agent GSK2110183 therapy.
