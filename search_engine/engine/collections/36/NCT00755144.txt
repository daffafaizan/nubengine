      replacements. The study will be conducted at a single clinical unit with a senior orthopaedic
      surgeon implanting all devices.Their performances will be assessed by clinical scores and
      comprehensive function outcome documentation undertaken by qualified physiotherapists. The
      persons undertaking the assessments will be blinded to which implants the patients have.
