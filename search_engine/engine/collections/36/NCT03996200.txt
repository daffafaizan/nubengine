      pressure) lowering effects with or without the use of glaucoma medications. The procedure
      will be a stand alone surgery. Patient follow up with several examinations up to 24 months
      after surgery.

      The primary endpoint is the reduction in medicated mean diurnal IOP at 6 months follow up
      compared to medicated diurnal IOP at baseline visit.
