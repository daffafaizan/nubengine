        1. Test if the helpline is a resourceful tool for patients with opioid use disorder looking
           for referrals and support to access treatment. The opioid helpline will provide
           individuals with opioid use disorder seeking treatment, direct access to a live person
           who can answer questions regarding referrals and various treatment programs. The
           helpline will also follow-up on treatment compliance and offer support and motivational
           techniques for these individuals to stay engaged in treatment

        2. Test if the helpline is a resourceful tool for patients with new onset of pain or
           chronic pain being prescribed opioids. The opioid helpline will provide these
           individuals the necessary educational materials on managing pain safely while avoiding
           misuse. It will offer free imagery guided meditation and other non-pharmacological tools
           to help with pain management.

        3. Test if providers find the opioid helpline helpful and resourceful for their practice
           and are willing to refer patients to the helpline.
