    
      Females with precocious puberty who have low levels of serum gonadotropins and high levels of
      serum estrogen, or those who have demonstrated an inadequate clinical response to therapy
      with the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog (Lupron, Histerelin, Deslorelin), will
      be treated with testolactone. Testolactone inhibits aromatase, the last enzyme of estrogen
      biosynthesis. The goal of treatment is to inhibit estrogen secretion and thus delay secondary
      sexual maturation and epiphyseal closure until the normal age. The intent is to alleviate the
      psychological problems and short stature frequently associated with this disorder. Throughout
      therapy, patients will receive frequent clinical, hormonal, and toxicological monitoring. The
      initial treatment period will be six months. If patients respond to the treatment and
      tolerate it well, testolactone will be given until puberty is desired. Patients who exhibit
      pubertal levels of serum gonadotropins during testolactone therapy, indicating the onset of
      secondary, gonadotropin-dependent puberty, will receive an LHRH analog in addition to
      testolactone.
