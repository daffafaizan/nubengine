      pregnant women and fetus. Early treatment is useful for GDM prevention. Therefore early
      screening is important for healthcare doctors to detect the potential patients. Glycated
      albumin (GA) is an optimal index for blood glucose evaluation compared to HbA1c, however it
      may be influenced by body weight and composition. The investigators are going to investigate
      the predictive ability of glycated albumin combined with body composition, including body
      weight, BMI, fat free mass and fat mass for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis.
      This study recruit pregnant women before 12 weeks of their pregnant age and test GA level and
      body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis. During 24-28 weeks of pregnant age,
      all participants will do the glucose tolerant test for GDM diagnosis.
