    
      Adipose tissue is a central organ in mediating metabolic health. There is some evidence that
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a degree of adipose tissue dysfunction which
      may negatively affect their metabolic health. The aim of this study was to assess
      transcriptomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue of women with PCOS in comparison with
      a control population matched on the basis of age and body mass index (BMI). A secondary aim
      was to then relate these gene expression profiles to the biochemical environment.
