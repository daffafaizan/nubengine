      Fibrosis (CF). Patients with Cystic Fibrosis have a hard time absorbing certain foods and
      often have low vitamin D levels. Studies show that vitamin D may help fight infections common
      in Cystic Fibrosis. The investigators would like to see if a powder pill form of vitamin D
      will work better than a pill mixed with oil. Each person will randomly receive either a
      powder pill or an oil based pill. Blood will be tested while during a 3-4 day hospital stay.
      The investigators plan to enroll no more than 24 patients with CF from Emory University
      Hospital for this study.
