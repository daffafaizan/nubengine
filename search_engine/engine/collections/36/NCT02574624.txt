      procedure. Currently 3 ports are inserted by creating holes in the sclera (white part of the
      eye) to enter into the posterior part of the eye. When complex dissection is needed, a fourth
      port will be inserted. The assistant will insert light source through the 4th port. This
      eliminates the need for the surgeon to hold the light in one hand. Hence allows freeing of
      both hands for the surgeon to use a forceps in one hand to grasp and elevate membranes and a
      scissors in the other to cut connections between the retina and the membranes. When membranes
      are particularly thick, it can be difficult to dissect with a single forceps holding up the
      membrane. In this situation, a 5th port will be inserted allowing the assistant to insert a
      light source through one and a forceps though another. The surgeon will have a forceps in one
      hand and a scissors in another making dissection process more efficient.
