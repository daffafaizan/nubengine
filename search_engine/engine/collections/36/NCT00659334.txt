      clinics at OHSU. There are four groups of the study:

        -  Subjects receive the combidex infusion only.

        -  Subjects receive Combidex and undergo a previously schedule neurosurgery.

        -  Subjects undergo surgery only and provide a sample of their tumor tissue to be used in
           pathology studies of Combidex.

        -  Subjects with MS or stroke are invited to participate in receiving Combidex to evaluate
           the effectiveness of enhancing the area of damage within the brain.

      Subjects are deemed eligible for the study and undergo a baseline MRI within 28 days of
      receiving Combidex. Subjects receiving Combidex are admitted for a half day into the Oregon
      Clinical & Translational Research Institute(OCTRI). Combidex is infused I.V. over 30 minutes.
      Subjects are monitored for side effects and are discharged within about 5 hours after the
      infusion, if no complications have been noted. Subjects return 24 hours after the infusion
      for a post infusion MRI scan and return again to one of the neurology clinics for one month
      follow-up. Subjects enrolled in group 2 undergo surgery 1-2 days after the Combidex infusion
      and also undergo a 24 post infusion MRI and return for one month follow-up. These subjects
      are also followed closely by the neurosurgical physician during the course of follow-up.
      Subjects enrolled in group 3 only undergo surgery and agree to have a piece of their tumor
      resection or biopsy donated for use in the study. Group 4 is the same as group 1, except the
      patient population includes multiple sclerosis and stroke instead of patients with brain
      tumors.
