      18 months to recruit a minimum of 60 couples distributed in two groups:

      The inclusion in the study will be made in two phases:

        -  The couples of the non-interventional group (NI) will be recruited at first to avoid the
           possibility to of sharing information between patients on their care. Indeed, it is
           about a comparative study and it is necessary that the couples of the NI group do not
           know about information proposed to the group I, at the risk of cancelling the effect of
           the information.

        -  The couples of the interventional group (I) will so be recruited during the last phase
           of the study of the NI group, that is approximately 6 months after the beginning of the
           study.

      The choice of the minimal size of participants' sample is stretched out by the necessity of a
      minimum number of 30 participants by group to make relevant statistical analyses.

      Once the information were given to the patients and to the partners, according to the group
      in which they are included, the participants will perform individually same sets of validated
      questionnaires at three different point times:

        -  initial visit: at the inclusion

        -  intermediate visit: 2 months after the inclusion

        -  final visit: 6 months after the inclusion

      The Questionnaires will be manage through a local statistical analysis. The set of analyses
      will be led thanks to the statistical software SPSS. Descriptive analyses of the data, the
      correlations between the variables of the study and finally the tests of comparison will be
      perform to have an objective assessment criterion for this study.
