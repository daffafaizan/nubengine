    
      This study is a prospective, observational, multicenter short-term safety study of the use of
      oseltamivir (prophylaxis or treatment) in children 24 months of age or younger. An internal
      comparator group of children diagnosed with influenza and not treated with antiviral
      medications will be enrolled. The study includes a 30-day follow-up period and will be
      conducted in multiple sites in multiple countries within the European Union. The study will
      cover two consecutive influenza seasons: 01 October 2009 - 31 May 2010 and 01 October 2010 -
      31 May 2011. Data collection may be interrupted in the interim period between influenza
      seasons (June 1, 2010 - September 30, 2010), depending on whether the influenza season
      follows the expected cycle.
