    
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of treatment with metformin at a dose of 1700 mg / day in adults with HD.

      A total recruitment of 60 patients is expected, which will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio. 30
      patients will receive metformin 1700 g / day, or placebo, for 52 weeks.

      Patients will begin taking low doses of metformin, to facilitate tolerance and decrease
      intestinal discomfort. Half the daily dose (425 mg twice daily) will be administered over
      four weeks, along with the main meals. Patients who tolerate this dose well will continue
      with treatment by taking 850mg twice daily. Patients who donÂ´t tolerate the initial dose (425
      mg twice daily) will be withdrawn from the study.
