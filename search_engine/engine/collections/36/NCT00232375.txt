      patients were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAb). Sixty
      GADAb-positive non-insulin requiring diabetic patients with duration of diabetes =/<5 years
      were assigned to either the SU group (n = 30) or the Insulin group (n = 30). Serum C-peptide
      response to annual oral glucose tolerance tests were followed for 57 mean months. The primary
      endpoint was insulin-dependency (IDDM: integrated C-peptide values [sigma C-peptide] <4
      ng/ml).
