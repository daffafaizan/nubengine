      chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer. II.
      Determine the duration of response to this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine
      the effect of prior response to chemotherapy on the response to HMAF in these patients. IV.
      Determine the survival and failure-free survival of patients treated with HMAF. V. Evaluate
      the toxicity profile of HMAF as salvage therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into relapsed or refractory patient groups based on results
      achieved with prior therapy. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5 minutes
      daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every 28 days. Patients with stable or responding disease
      are treated for a minimum of 6 courses (2 courses beyond optimal response) in the absence of
      unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression. Patients are followed at least every 3
      months for 1 year, then every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (33 for each stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 12-18 months.
