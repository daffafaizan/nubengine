      of frailty. Subjects will be screened into the study by testing each domain; only those who
      meet criteria for frailty will be included in the study. The clinical intervention, which all
      subjects will receive, will begin immediately upon enrollment and completion of baseline
      measurements. Upon enrollment the 3 most recent previous outpatient serum creatinine
      measurements (up to 1 year) will be used to determine baseline slope of estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR). The main objectives of the pilot study will be to gain knowledge in
      the successful implementation and completion of an intervention targeted toward frailty.
      Ultimately information ascertained from this pilot will serve as a springboard for planning
      of a randomized trial aimed at addressing all the domains of frailty, which is key given that
      previous studies have only implemented interventions aimed at a single domain or in pairs,
      but no studies have evaluated the extent to which frailty can be reversed through a cohesive
      intervention addressing all domains together. The intervention outlined in this proposal is
      comprehensive and focused while maintaining feasibility.
