      experimental group was treated with functional cervical pillow and the control group was
      treated with general pillow. All applications of pillow were limited to 3-4 weeks. Primary
      outcomes were measured using the VAS scale. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to
      measure primary outcomes at baseline, 3 day, per weeks until the duration of admission.
      Satisfaction levels of the patient's current status, Neck disability Index(NDI) PSQI, EQ-5D
      will also be collected. The applicants will also get thru the diagnosis of range of motion by
      X-ray(flexion, neutral, extension of their neck position)
