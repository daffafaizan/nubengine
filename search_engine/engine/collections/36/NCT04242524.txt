      10-15 years. In addition to promoting weight loss, bariatric surgery has become increasingly
      recognized for use in the management of diabetes. Recent studies have indicated that
      bariatric surgery can result in a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity before long term
      weight loss is attained. The goal of this project is to delineate the changes in the insulin
      responsiveness of subcutaneous adipocytes obtained by needle biopsy 2 weeks prior to surgery
      vs. 12 weeks after bariatric surgery, which could account for improvements in overall insulin
      sensitivity seen before any long-term sustained weight loss has occurred. The investigators
      will also examine gene expression in adipocytes (fat cells).
