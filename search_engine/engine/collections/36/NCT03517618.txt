    
      Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used to determine the sample size for this study.

      • Stage I: >1/9: The first 9 evaluable patients enrolled, >1 (or ≥2) responders are required
      in order to enter the second stage, otherwise the trial will be terminated at the first stage
      due to futility.

      • Stage II: Total >8/34: For the total 34 evaluable patients, >8 (or ≥9) responders are
      required to conclude the effectiveness of the study regimen.

      The primary endpoint will be disease control rate which will be presented in frequency
      tabulation with two-sided 95% confidence interval (using binomial estimation).

      The secondary endpoints are described as follows:

        -  ORR will be presented in frequency tabulation with two-sided 95% confidence interval;

        -  TTP will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval;

        -  OS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval;

        -  Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) [Safety and
           Tolerability] : assessed by CTCAE v4.0. Safety parameters will only be analyzed on the
           safety analysis set and be presented in frequency tabulation.
