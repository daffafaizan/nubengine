      breast cancer patients. The trial will include a dose deescalation phase where three doses of
      paclitaxel will be tried on 3 patients each followed by a dose expansion phase on 25
      patients. Paclitaxel will be given weekly for 1 cycle followed by combination of Paclitaxel
      and Durvalumab. Once 6 cycles of Paclitaxel are completed, Durvalumab will be given alone
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The toxicity and tolerability of the
      combination will be the main end point while the efficacy will be a secondary end point.
