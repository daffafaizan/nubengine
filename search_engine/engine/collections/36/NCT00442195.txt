      older), skin tissue samples (ages 18 and older), and/or buccal mucosa samples (ages 8 and
      older) from healthy volunteers. Samples will be used for clinical and translational research
      in the Hematology Branch and are indispensable for many of our research projects, including
      studies of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis, the viral etiology of blood diseases, the role
      of the immune system in marrow failure and genetic risk factors for aplastic anemia. This
      protocol provides a mechanism for collection, tracking, storing, dispensing, analyzing and
      disposing of these laboratory research samples.
