    
      Mixed methods, longitudinal study; 5 work streams, supported by a Parent Advisory Panel:

      Work stream 1:Clinical Outcomes Study Using routinely collected data from the National
      Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) for babies born at 27-31 weeks of gestation, admitted to
      neonatal units in England 01/01/14-31/12/17.Estimates of differences in mortality and
      specified morbidities between babies cared for in LNUs and NICUs will be obtained Data will
      be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (morbidity) and ONS(mortality) up to 1 year of age
      for longer term outcomes.

      Work stream 2:Types of clinical care provided Using NNRD, data from a unit questionnaire
      (01/01/017-31/12/2017), and review of guidelines from neonatal units, variation in clinical
      practice in 6 areas will be examined: medical/nurse staffing; policies/practice re
      respiratory support; infection control, feeding and developmental care, discharge and length
      of stay. Where appropriate, outcomes (mortality, chronic lung disease, central line sepsis,
      receipt of breastmilk on discharge and length of stay in hospital) by week of gestational
      age, will be analysed between units with similar practices.

      Work stream 3:Economic analysis A cost-effectiveness study comparing costs and outcomes of
      LNU versus NICU will be conducted.

      Work stream 4:Ethnographic study with a representative group of parents and clinicians
      Observations and interviews will be used to explore factors parents think should guide
      decision making about place of care and how it happens in practice; clinicians'
      perspectives/practices on decision making and place of care; impact on parents/families of
      these decisions and subsequent change in care location; and how parents can best be supported
      at this time. 40 cases from 2 networks [20 real-time, 20 retrospective] will be studied.

      Workstream 5:

      Once the results of the 4 work streams are analysed, and conclusions reached, a working group
      will be set up in collaboration with BAPM to develop recommendations to be made available for
      health service delivery planning.
