      menstrually-related mood disorder (MRMD), but not women lacking this disorder, experience
      mood deterioration within approximately a week after exposure to either estradiol or
      progesterone in the context of gonadal suppression (induced by use of the depot gonadotropin
      releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate). It is unknown whether this hormone-induced
      depression occurs consequent to changes in gonadal steroid levels or to simple exposure to
      levels above a critical threshold. Additionally, since the symptoms of depression stimulated
      by hormone addback appeared to remit by the fourth week of hormone administration, it is
      unclear whether continued administration of hormone would result in continued or repeated
      experience of depression or whether no further symptoms would appear subsequent to the
      initial precipitated episode. To address these points of uncertainty, we first will establish
      the efficacy of gonadal suppression in our MRMD subjects by administering depot leuprolide
      acetate for three months and then will administer both estradiol and progesterone in a
      continuous fashion for three months to determine whether maintenance of stable gonadal
      steroid levels will prevent the characteristic cyclic mood disorder.
