    
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of the TX-12-004-HR formulation in reducing moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal
      atrophy associated with menopause and to investigate the systemic exposure to estradiol
      following once daily intravaginal administrations of TX-12-004-HR for 14 days.

      Postmenopausal subjects who met the study entry criteria were randomized to one of two
      treatment groups (TX-12-004-HR or Placebo). During the Screening period subjects were asked
      to self-assess the symptoms of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy, including vaginal dryness,
      vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, vaginal pain associated with sexual
      activity and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity. Subjects with at least one
      self-assessed moderate to severe symptom of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy identified by the
      subject as being most bothersome to her were eligible to participate in the study.
