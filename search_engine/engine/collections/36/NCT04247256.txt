      with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients. All patients included have previously had effect from
      treatment with FOLFIRI, but have now progressed (i.e. treatment failure due to acquired
      resistance).

      FOLFIRI is a key anti-cancer chemotherapeutic combination in the treatment of several solid
      tumor cancers, e.g. colorectal cancer. Cancer resistance to FOLFIRI exposure is a well known
      phenomenon and can often be attributed to upregulation of cellular efflux pumps, e.g.
      ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)G2 and ABCB1, involved in the efflux of the chemotherapeutic agents
      from the cancer cells and resulting in treatment failure.

      SCO-101 is an inhibitor of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) efflux pumps and SRPK1 kinase which is
      responsible for phosphorylation of splicing factors, a key element involved in tumour growth.

      The combination of SCO-101 with FOLFIRI is expected to inhibit the active efflux of
      chemotherapy molecules from the cancer cell thereby re-sensitizing it to the chemotherapeutic
      agents.
