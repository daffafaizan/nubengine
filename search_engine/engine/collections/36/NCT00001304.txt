      with chronic hypercalciuria due to their lack of calcium-retaining effect in the kidney. This
      side effect usually occurs even while maintaining the serum calcium in the normal range and
      may lead to calcium deposition in the kidney (nephrocalcinosis) and renal insufficiency. This
      study examines the long-term effects of subcutaneous parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy on
      calcium metabolism, bone, and renal function. Our previous short-term pilot study comparing
      subcutaneous PTH with calcitriol demonstrated a significant decrease in urinary calcium
      excretion during PTH therapy. Based upon these results, we hypothesized that treatment with
      PTH is more physiologic and provides improved long-term metabolic control. Additionally,
      treatment with PTH may avoid the adverse side effects on the kidney that are associated with
      conventional therapy. Patients initially come to the Clinical Center for a two week inpatient
      evaluation. Subsequent follow-up will occur semiannually on an outpatient basis.
