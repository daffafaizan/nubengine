      Clean Intermittent Self Catheterisation (CISC) by specialist Nurse Continence Advisors.

      For several decades, patients have been taught to catheterise using a "clean" technique where
      they rinse their catheter under tap water and store the catheter in a sterile solution (e.g.
      Milton). The catheter is re-used for up to one week. The risk of urinary tract infection
      (UTI) was known to be minimal (and certainly much less than having a permanent indwelling
      catheter).

      Recently, the Therapeutics Goods Administration has issued a guideline that CISC catheters
      should be "single-use items" but no data to support this guideline appears to have been
      collected.

      The aim of this project is to assess the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) when
      comparing single-use catheters with re-use of catheters for CISC, and to determine the cost
      differences between the two methods.
