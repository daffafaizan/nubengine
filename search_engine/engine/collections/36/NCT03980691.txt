      reservoirs remains a major barrier to cure human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      infection. Recently, the shock and kill strategy, by which such reservoirs are eradicated
      following reactivation of latent HIV-1 by latency-reversing agents (LRAs), has been
      extensively practiced. It is important to reestablish virus-specific and reliable immune
      surveillance to eradicate the reactivated virus-harboring cells. Some studies have shown that
      Chidamide can highly activate the HIV reservoirs. The VC-CAR-T cells effectively induced the
      cytolysis of LRA-reactivated HIV-1-infected CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from infected
      individuals receiving suppressive cART. Our previous study demonstrated that the special
      features of genetically engineered CAR-T cells make them a particularly suitable candidate
      for therapeutic application in efforts to reach a functional HIV cure. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chidamide together with Chimeric Antigen
      Receptor(CAR)-T or T cell receptor(TCR)-T cell therapy based on cART in HIV-infected adults
      whose plasma HIV has been successfully suppressed after cART.
