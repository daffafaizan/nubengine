      of cholestasis palliation and a low rate of post cholangitis when compared with endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP). The advantage of percutaneous approach is the
      precise lobar selection for drainage and this approach should yield a lower rate of
      cholangitis.

      Guideline recommendation European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) biliary
      stenting clinical guideline and Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations the goal of palliative
      stenting of HCCA is drainage of adequate liver volume (50% or more), irrespective of
      unilateral, bilateral, or multi-segmental stenting was based on heterogeneous group of
      malignancy by ERCP in retrospective study.There are no randomized clinical trials compared
      with these two internal biliary drainage methods in HCCA using metal stent.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the effect and safety of bilateral versus
      unilateral stenting in patients with HCCA.
