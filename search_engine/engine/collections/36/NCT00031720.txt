    
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to duration of hot flashes (less than 9 months vs 9 months or more)
      and frequency of hot flashes (7 to 9 per day vs more than 9 per day). For more information
      regarding the treatment regimens, please see the treatment arms section.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To compare the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on the daily number of
           hot flushes experienced by postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen measured at three
           months from baseline

        2. To compare the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on hot flush severity
           as measured by the average daily hot flash score in this population of women measured at
           three months from baseline

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effect of soy supplementation as compared to women randomized to placebo
           on quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep subscale, the
           Mental Health Inventory (MHI), the CES-D Short Form, the Menopause and Reproductive
           Health Questionnaire, and the General Quality of Life Form

        2. To measure the effect of soy supplementation as compared to women randomized to placebo
           on serum isoflavones, estradiol, SHBG, IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels as measures of hormonal
           change

        3. To estimate the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on the time to first
           relief of hot flushes

      A total of 112 patients accrued on this study. Patients were followed 6 months
      post-randomization.
