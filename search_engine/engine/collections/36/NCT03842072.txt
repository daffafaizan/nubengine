      performed spinal operations internationally, often in the context of symptomatic
      radiculopathy or myelopathy secondary to cervical degenerative disease. Approximately half of
      surgeons continue to prescribe a period of post-operative bracing with a cervical collar.
      However, there is currently no high quality evidence available to support the routine use of
      post-operative bracing after ACDF; further, braces are expensive and have been associated
      with a variety of local complications. In summary, the current lack of evidence, and lack of
      consensus amongst surgeons, regarding best practices in the use of post-operative bracing
      after ACDF, places the surgeon and the patient in a precarious position.
