      prescribed rivaroxaban from January 1, 2012 to November 7, 2016 at UT MDACC for NVAF or
      patients that had prior VTE and diagnosis of cancer. The list of patients prescribed
      rivaroxaban during the study period will be obtained from Pharmacy Informatics. We will
      review the eligibility of all patients on the pharmacy list who were prescribed rivaroxaban
      during the study time-frame. The eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will
      be identified. All available data concerning demographic, clinical parameters and rivaroxaban
      usage will be collected for eligible patients from Pharmacy Informatics, CS, Laboratory
      Informatics, and Clinical Informatics Databases.

      The variables of interest include demographic information, clinical parameters (tumor type,
      extent of disease, clinical exam findings, and presence of comorbidities, diagnostic
      assessments, and treatment interventions), reason for rivaroxaban discontinuation and
      outcomes. The confidentiality of all patient-specific data will be maintained. By using
      Pharmacy Informatics and CS, we can capture most of patients prescribed rivaroxaban at the UT
      MDACC.This is a descriptive study and the final sample size will depend on available records
      for chart review from 01/01/2012 to 11/07/2016.
