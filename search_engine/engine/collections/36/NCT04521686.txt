    
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of oral LY3410738 in patients with IDH1 R132-mutant advanced solid tumor
      types, including but not limited to cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and glioma.

      This study includes 2 parts, Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 1 dose expansion. The Phase 1
      dose escalation monotherapy cohort will enroll any eligible patient with IDH1 R132-mutant
      advanced solid tumor. Once the LY3410738 monotherapy RP2D is established, Phase 1 dose
      expansion will begin and will include 4 cohorts to further evaluate safety and clinical
      activity - three cohorts will be administered LY3410738 monotherapy and the fourth cohort
      wiil administer LY3410738 to patients in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      IDH1 R132 mutations will be identified through standard of care testing as routinely
      performed at each participating site utilizing material collected prior to patient consent .
      Molecular assays utilized for enrollment are required to be performed in CLIA, ISO/IEC, CAP,
      or other similarly certified laboratory. Enrollment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma,
      chondrosarcoma or glioma may be made based on molecular tests performed in either tumor or
      blood. Enrollment of patients with other tumor types is limited to testing performed in tumor
      tissue.
