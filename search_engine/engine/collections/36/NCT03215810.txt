      tumor tissue that will be surgically removed. Certain parts of these cells will be
      multiplied, or grown, in the laboratory, using the drug interleukin-2 (IL-2) during part of
      the process. They will then be given back to the participant by an infusion in their veins.
      These cells are called tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The use of TILs involves a
      combination of drugs, including the following:

        -  Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide - two types of chemotherapy drugs. These drugs will be
           used for what is called lymphodepletion. The purpose of lymphodepletion in this study is
           to temporarily reduce the number of normal lymphocytes circulating in the participant's
           body before they are given the TILs that were grown in the lab. This is so that there
           will be more "space" for the lymphocytes (TILs) that will be infused in their veins.

        -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) - a drug used to help the body's response to treatment on the
           immune system. A high dose regimen of IL-2 will be given after the participant receives
           the infusion of the T-cells.
