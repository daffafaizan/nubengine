      are fed with expressed breast milk or preterm formulas of which the temperature is not
      routinely measured. In this study, the investigators aimed to examine the effects of feeds
      with warm versus room temperature milk in preterm infants. Infants with a birth weight of
      ≤1500 g or gestational age of ≤ 34 weeks were included in the study and assigned to two
      different feeding temperature groups (22-24°C and 32-34°C). Some infants in both groups were
      exclusive breast milk fed and some received artificial milk. Feeding tolerance of patients in
      both groups and the consequences were evaluated.
