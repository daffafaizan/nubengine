      association between CAI and SIJD after a pilot study done in order to detect odd's ratio. ,
      calculation made by a program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      with the following inputting data :

      Two-sided confidence interval 95%, power 80%, ratio of controls to cases 1, percent of
      control exposed 4.5% , odds ratio 32%. The sample size calculations required for this study
      was 28 participants (14 in each group).

      Data distributions was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test and for equality of
      variance using Box's test. Box and whiskers plots were used for detecting the outliers.
      Descriptive statistics calculated for demographic data. Intraclass correlation coefficients
      (ICC) and standard errors of measurement (SEM) were calculated to estimate the intratester
      reliability and precision of measurement for the static pelvic rotation

      The outcomes of these study were:

        1. Association between CAI and SIJD represents through odd's ratio (primary outcome)

        2. Pelvic torsion difference between CAI and control Calculated by Mann- Whitney test
           (secondary outcome)

        3. Correlations between pelvic torsion with perceived ankle instability and number of
           giving way episodes calculated Pearson correlation coefficient(secondary outcome) Effect
           size analysis was calculated to determine the clinical significant difference.
           Statistical analysis was conducted using the statistical package for social studies
           (SPSS) for windows, version 24 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The normative data presented
           as Mean Â± standard deviation (SD) while non-normative data presented as median.
           Significance was set at p < 0.05 and total study power was set 80%
