    
      Single centre, Phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study investigating 4
      multiple rising oral doses of BIA 2-093 in 4 groups of 8 young healthy male subjects. Within
      each group, 2 subjects were randomised to receive placebo and the remaining 6 subjects to
      receive BIA 2-093. No subject was a member of more than one group. The dose regimens
      investigated were: 200 mg b.i.d.(twice daily), 400 mg o.d.(once daily; this was changed from
      400 mg b.i.d. in protocol amendment 1, on the basis of interim pharmacokinetic analysis of
      Group 1 data), 800 mg o.d, and 1200 mg o.d. BIA 2-093/placebo was administered orally once
      daily on Days 1-8, or twice a day (at 12-hour intervals) on Days 1-7 with a final dose in the
      morning of Day 8. The multiple dose regimens were to be investigated in ascending order.
      Progression to each higher dose level was only to occur if the previous dose level was deemed
      by the investigator and the sponsor to be safe and well tolerated.
