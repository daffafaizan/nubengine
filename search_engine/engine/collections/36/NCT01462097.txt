    
      This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial comparing 12 months of aerobic and
      resistance exercise training vs. health education (attention control) on neurocognitive and
      physical performance among community-dwelling older adults (age >55) and CKD stage 3b and 4.
      Co-primary outcomes are change in physical performance (including aerobic capacity and
      submaximal walking) and neurocogntivie performance (including executive functions).

      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 6- and 12 months. Exercise training
      will occur thrice weekly at a dedicated research exercise center and will be supervised by
      exercise specialists.
