      back pain (LBP) remain misunderstood, limiting progress towards effective management.

      We have developed an innovative two-tier design to study the transition from acute to chronic
      LBP. The objective of the first tier is to create a provincial web- based infrastructure to
      recruit and monitor the trajectory of individuals with acute LBP. The objective of the second
      tier is to fuel hypothesis-driven satellite data collection centers with specialized
      expertise to study the role of biomechanical, epigenetic, genetic, neuroanatomical,
      ontological, physiological, psychological, and socioeconomic factors in LBP chronicity.

      Methods This paper describes the first tier of the protocol: establishment of the Core
      Dataset and Cohort. Adults with acute LBP will be recruited through networks, media and
      health care settings. A web-based interface will be used to collect self-reported variables
      at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Acute LBP will be defined according to the Dionne
      2008 consensus. Measurements will include the Canadian minimum dataset for chronic low back
      pain research, DN4 for neuropathic pain, comorbidities, EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and
      linkage with provincial medico-administrative databases. The primary outcome will be the
      transition to chronic LBP, as defined by Deyo 2014. Secondary outcomes include healthcare
      resource utilization, disability, sick leave, mood, and quality of life. Perspective This
      study brings together diverse research expertise to investigate the transition from acute to
      chronic LBP, characterize the progression to recovery or chronicity, and identify patterns
      associated with that progression.
