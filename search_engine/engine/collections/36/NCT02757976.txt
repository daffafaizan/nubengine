      Device implantation will be performed within 10 working days of randomization.

      Patients randomized to LV endocardial CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD,
      placed in the same time frame and will have RA and RV leads implanted as the conventional CRT
      group. The device will be implanted in a facility that has the capacity to perform
      trans-atrial septal puncture with ultrasound guidance. The LV lead will be placed using a
      trans-atrial septal approach using a specially designed puncture tools and LVendo delivery
      tool kits specifically designed for this study
