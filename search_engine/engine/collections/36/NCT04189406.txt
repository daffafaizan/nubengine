      relatedness:

      The subjects will have twice an extra venapunction for collection of 3.5mL blood during their
      infancy, which is not stated in the guidelines for TS. There is very little risk for adverse
      events associated with this blood sample collection, however it is an extra procedure. The
      outcome parameters will not be helpful for individual study participants, however they are
      likely to help clinicians and researchers in understanding how the ovarian function operates
      develops in girls with TS. Furthermore, these markers could be used to estimate the ovarian
      reserve and the urgency of fertility preservation in young females with TS. This information
      could help clinicians, patients and their parents in decision making.
