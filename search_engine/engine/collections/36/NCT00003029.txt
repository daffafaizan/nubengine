        -  Confirm the value of chronomodulated infusion with respect to survival in patients with
           locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        -  Test the value of adding cisplatin to fluorouracil in extending survival in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study.

      The study design is a 2 X 2 factorial such that patients are allocated to one of 4 treatment
      groups involving the use or absence of chronomodulation and cisplatin (CDDP). Treatment in
      each of the 4 groups is repeated for 3 courses where each course is a 5-day course of
      treatment.

      Patients in the first group receive a chronomodulated schedule based on delivery of
      fluorouracil (FU). Patients in the second group receive a chronomodulated schedule of FU and
      CDDP. Patients in the third and fourth experimental groups receive flat schedules of FU alone
      or FU and CDDP, respectively. Dosages of FU are increased across the three courses whereas
      dosages of CDDP remain constant.

      Treatment is continued until disease progression, severe toxicity, or complete remission for
      more than 4 months occurs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 200 patients will be accrued.
