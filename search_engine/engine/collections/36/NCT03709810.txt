      cross-over design in participants with full upper and lower dentures. The study hypothesis is
      that this methodology will enable comparisons between denture adhesives and no adhesive to
      demonstrate the effectiveness of denture adhesives in restricting food ingress under dentures
      during eating. This study will consist of three visits: Visit 1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2 -
      Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit. Participants will use test product which is a
      marketed denture adhesive (Super Poligrip Max Seal [SPMS]) (application will be controlled by
      weight) to the dentures in a pattern of continuous strips which will be applied to upper and
      lower denture and will be then placed in mouth and participants will also use no adhesive as
      a control. Participants will cross-over between treatments so that all participants will
      participate in all 2 treatment arms. An hour after the participant has worn their denture,
      they will chew a portion of peanuts in a controlled manner. After a rinsing procedure with
      water, the dentures will be removed, and any peanuts that have been migrated under each
      denture will be collected and weighed after a drying process. Participants will also answer a
      short questionnaire on the procedure and record the number of times their denture dislodged
      during the chewing procedure. The number of denture dislodgments reported by the participants
      during the chewing of the peanuts will also be collected and analyzed and this, and the
      questionnaire data, will be used to support the findings of the peanuts mass measure.
