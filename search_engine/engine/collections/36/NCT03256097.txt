      Guard sound coding strategy is adaptive in nature and can alter the output from the cochlear
      implant based on the levels of the listening environment. Hence, it can adapt to soft, medium
      or conversational and loud speech levels.The XDP on the other hand is not adaptive and cannot
      alter the cochlear implant output according to the levels of the listening environment.

      In the study we are hypothesising that the Voice Guard sound processing strategy will perform
      better than the XDP strategy for soft (40 dB SPL) and loud (85 dB SPL) speech input levels.
      Speech perception scores will be recorded at 40, 65 and 85 dB SPL and a cross over study
      design has been adopted.

      In addition, the efficacy of a cochlear implant sound reduction technique called Voice Track
      will also be evaluated. The Voice Track is designed to reduce the adverse effect of
      background noise on cochlear implant speech perception.
