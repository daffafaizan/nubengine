    
      This is a 2-panel (2 groups), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), 3- way crossover (method used to
      switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study. The study
      consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (less than or equal to 21 days before
      administration of study medication), treatment phase (84 days), and the follow-up phase (up
      to 30 to 35 days after the last blood sample in the last treatment session is collected).
      Approximately 24 healthy participants will be allocated to one of two panels: Panel A
      (participants will receive study medication under fed condition); and Panel B (participants
      will receive study medication under fasted condition). Participants in Panel A will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (Treatment sequences ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CBA,
      and CAB) to receive the following 3 formulations of TMC207 with food: Treatments A: the Phase
      II tablet formulation; Treatment B: newly developed tablet formulation with fine particle
      size distribution; and Treatment C: newly developed tablet formulation with coarse particle
      size distribution. Participants in Panel B will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment
      sequences (Treatment sequences DEF, DFE, EDF, EFD, FDE, and FED) to receive the following 3
      formulations of TMC207 without food: Treatments D: the Phase II tablet formulation; Treatment
      E: newly developed tablet formulation with fine particle size distribution; and Treatment F:
      newly developed tablet formulation with coarse particle size distribution. Subsequent
      treatments will be separated by a period of 4 weeks. The total duration of the study for each
      participant will be approximately 20 weeks. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, physical
      examination, and alcohol urine medicine screen which will be monitored throughout the study.
