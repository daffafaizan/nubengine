      undergo routine pre-operative laboratory testing including hemoglobin and hematocrit. If
      enrolled in the study, patients will be consented at their pre-op appointment for the study
      and be asked to complete a visual analog scale to assess pre-operative pain. Patients will be
      randomized to receive misoprostol 800mcg per rectum or an identical inert tablet(s) per
      rectum 30 minutes preoperatively. Randomization will be performed by a third party so that
      neither the surgeon nor patient will know which intervention was performed, and interventions
      will be placed in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Researcher team will have
      all needed data corresponding with randomized code which will be broken at conclusion of
      study and will be able to match code with patient's initials and medical record number after
      study completion to analyze data. Myomectomy will then be performed per standard care with
      the use of local vasopressin to aid in decreasing blood loss per our normal standard of care.
