    
      A single-centre clinical trial is proposed in which adult patients will be selected to
      consult the Hospital Emergency Department (ED) of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau
      (HSCSP) for a primary or secondary diagnosis of DRP and will be randomised with a 1:1
      distribution to be included in the medication code (intervention group) or to receive usual
      care (control group). The intervention will be evaluated in terms of health outcomes (ED
      consultations and hospital readmission).
