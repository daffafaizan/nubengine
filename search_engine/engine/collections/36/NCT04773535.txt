      clinical use. The DyCare® Lynx system is user-friendly and has been proven reliable for
      motion evaluation of different joints, but not yet for the wrist.

      Therefore, this project is set to compare the wrist joint movement measurements of the
      DyCare® Lynx System with optoelectronic motion analysis using a marker system and infrared
      cameras. DyCare® Lynx is based on two inertial sensors (DyTrack) capable of objectively
      measuring three dimensional joint movements in real time. Each inertial sensor includes an
      accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer and captures up to 1'000 samples per second.
      DyCare® Lynx is certified for measurements on the human musculoskeletal apparatus (EN ISO
      13485:2003 Certificate No. 15185 - M), is CE marked and will only be applied to each
      participant for a few minutes during the measurements. The control measurements will be
      conducted using a Vicon® motion capture system in the Motion Analysis Laboratory of the
      Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. The
      Vicon® system is equipped with 11 infrared cameras. The system is made for 'Life science
      application' and is approved as CE medical device. A total of 10 healthy test persons will be
      subjected to both the DyCare® Lynx and the Vicon® measurements during standard movements as
      well as during activities of daily living. The wrist joint angles measured with both systems
      will be compared, therefore limits of agreement, maximum difference and root mean squared
      difference will be calculated to quantify the deviation between methods. The standard error
      of measurements will be calculated to determine repeatability of the systems.
