    
      Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) produced by ulnar nerve electrical stimulation will be
      collected with combined MEG and EGG.

      Functional MRI will be performed during electrical stimulation of ulnar nerve and during
      mechanical vibration of ADM tendon.

      Brain diffusion MRI will be performed. Anatomical MRI will be done for source location. Brain
      resting state activity will be recorded with MEG/EEG and fMRI.
