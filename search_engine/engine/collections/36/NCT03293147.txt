      pressure control and translates into increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Currently, there is no effective intervention for therapeutic non-adherence.

      An ultra-sensitive and highly specific biochemical assay has been developed to detect urinary
      biomarkers of antihypertensive treatment. The high performance liquid chromatography mass
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)-based assay screens spot urine samples for the presence of 40
      commonly prescribed blood pressure lowering medications. The results of the test provide a
      clinician with information on the presence/absence of prescribed antihypertensive drugs
      or/and their metabolites in urine - a direct confirmation of therapeutic
      adherence/non-adherence.

      The study is a prospective multi-centre randomised controlled trial to examine if
      HPLC-MS/MS-guided intervention is superior to standard clinical care in improving clinical,
      behavioural and health-economy outcomes in hypertensive patients who are non-adherent to
      antihypertensive treatment.

      Patient adherence to antihypertensive treatment will be determined at baseline. Non-adherent
      hypertensive patients at baseline will be randomised in a 1:1 ration to either usual clinical
      care plus HPLC-MS/MS-guided intervention (Arm A) or usual clinical care only (Arm B).

      The study also evaluates a cohort of patients who are adherent to antihypertensive treatment
      at baseline. Those adherent hypertensive patients will receive the usual clinical care (Arm
      C). The main purpose of involving this group of patients is to blind the clinical research
      staff to the adherence status of those patients randomised receiving standard care alone, to
      prevent introducing any bias in treating non-adherent patients.
