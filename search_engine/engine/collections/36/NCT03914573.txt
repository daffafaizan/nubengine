      sample of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957 to determine
      the association between participation in high-school football and self-rated health, pain,
      and obesity in late adulthood. The WLS is an optimal observational dataset to answer these
      hypotheses. WLS captures early-life exposures that are important predictors of health and
      well-being in later life such parental socioeconomic status, occupation, and education level,
      family structure, and race. It also captures whether study participants participated in high
      school football and contains detailed measurements of their health in adulthood. WLS provides
      a robust and longitudinal dataset, overcoming the limitations of prior cross-sectional
      studies, to compare the health in later adulthood of those who played high school football to
      those who did not, after carefully controlling for a potential confounders

      A matched observational study will be conducted, in which football players and controls will
      be divided into smaller subgroups which are relatively homogeneous along a range of baseline
      covariates. The outcomes will be compared within each matched set, after adjusting for
      residual imbalances in the distribution of these baseline covariates between the football
      players and controls.
