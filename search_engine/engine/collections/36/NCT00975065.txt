           patients over time to achieve and maintain glycemic control. Early combination, compared
           with maximal dose of monotherapy, could be more effective in lowering glycemia with
           better tolerability.

        -  Vildagliptin is a new oral antidiabetic drug acting as a potent and selective inhibitor
           of dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4), the enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of
           circulating glucagon-like peptide-1. Vildagliptin improves islet function by a mechanism
           of increasing plasma levels of the active forms of the incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP.

        -  Metformin improves hyperglycemia primarily through its suppression of hepatic
           gluconeogenesis as well as enhancement of peripheral glucose update. Metformin is the
           most commonly prescribed first-line antidiabetic drug worldwide, but due to the
           progressive worsening of blood glucose control during the natural history of type 2
           diabetes, combination therapy usually becomes necessary.

        -  Thus their combination therapy with complimentary action mechanism could be as effective
           as up titration of monotherapy.
