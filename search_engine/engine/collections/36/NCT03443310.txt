      abbreviated bedside compression ultrasound test for diagnosis of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)
      in the proximal region. This abbreviated ultrasound test conducted in the groin and popliteal
      regions to assess the compressibility of the femoral and popliteal veins required as little
      as 3.5 min to complete 15 and can be easily mastered by residents with minimum training.
      These studies showed a promising sensitivity ranging from 70% to 100% and a specificity
      ranging from 75.9% to 99.6%.

      Anesthesiologists are now well-trained in performing ultrasound scans as they perform
      ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks routinely. Scanning for significant proximal DVT
      could potentially be anesthesiologists' extended role as they follow up patients who
      underwent orthopedic surgeries for postoperative pain control as part of the acute pain
      service.
