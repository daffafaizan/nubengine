      deaths are attributable to ventricular arrhythmias in Europe every year. The gold standard
      treatment is to implant a cardiac defibrillator that will be able to stop arrhythmia by
      delivering pacing or internal shocks.

      In order to avoid internal shocks, ablation techniques have been developed, consisting in
      placing catheters in the left ventricle, to induce the VT, and then to perform a mapping of
      its circuit. Once this circuit is clearly defined, ablation of the critical part of the
      circuit, so called VT isthmus can be performed, using a radiofrequency power. One of the
      limitations of this technique is that it requires VT induction during the procedure, and that
      the VT lasts long enough to enable its mapping.

      Nancy University Hospital developed a technique using pace mapping to define the VT isthmus
      even when the VT is not sustained. The pace mapping technique enables to reveal conduction
      troubles in the studied ventricles, that correspond with the VT isthmus.

      During this study, the investigators will collect pacemapping data from ventricles of patient
      presenting infarction history and VT, from patients with infarction history without VT, and
      from patients without ventricular pathology.
