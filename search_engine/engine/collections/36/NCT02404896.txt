      other diverse physiological functions. Circulating levels of leptin closely correlate with
      the amount of adipose tissue present. Metreleptin, a recombinant analogue of human leptin, is
      a 147-amino acid polypeptide that differs from the human leptin sequence by 1 additional
      amino acid, methionine, located at the amino-terminal end. Metreleptin has the same
      physiological effects as leptin, including regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic
      function.

      The patient group covered under this expanded access submission has demonstrated evidence of
      clinical benefit from treatment with metreleptin in clinical study FHA101/MB002-002, and
      needs expanded access to continue treatment without interruption.
