    
      lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) will be performed at base line and at each visit (total
      of 7 breath samples from each patient). All subjects will be presented for the lactose
      hydrogen breath test after 8 hours fast.

      At the initial stage, the subjects will take a base reading at time 0.

      Subjects will then receive 50 g of lactose dissolved in a 100 ml of plain water and will
      perform further breath test samples every 30 minutes for 3 h. All breath samples will be
      end-expiratory and analyzed immediately by a Portable Breath Hydrogen Monitor (Gastro+
      gastrolyzer, Bedfont Instruments, Holywell Lane, Upchurch, Kent, England). The concentration
      of breath hydrogen will be measured in parts per million (ppm). The measurements will then be
      plotted graphically and analyzed. The effect of probiotics on LI treatment will be measured
      by the following criteria:

        1. If hydrogen levels measured after 6 months of treatment will be lower than levels
           measured at time 0 and/or patients will report a decrease of symptoms, the treatment of
           LI with Probiotics will be considered successful.

        2. If hydrogen levels measured after 6 months of treatment will be the same or higher than
           levels measured at time 0 and/or patients will report an unchanged state or an increase
           of symptoms, the treatment of LI with probiotics will be considered unsuccessful.
