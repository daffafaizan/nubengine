    
      Treatment of prolactin secreting pituitary tumors with traditional ergot dopamine agonist
      drugs can be limited by medication side effects, pharmacologic resistance, and by concerns
      regarding the potential risk of cardiac valve disease. The overall goal of this project is
      therefore to evaluate, for the first time, the efficacy and tolerability of the selective
      D2/D3 receptor non-ergot dopamine agonist ropinirole for the treatment of prolactinomas. This
      proposal will establish the pharmacologic profile of this medication when used to treat
      hyperprolactinemia in patients with prolactinomas and will determine the impact of long-term
      ropinirole administration on critical clinical parameters including serum prolactin levels,
      gonadal function, and tumor regression, in order to establish ropinirole's utility as a new,
      clinically efficacious, safer and more tolerable therapeutic option for the treatment of
      prolactinomas that may prove particularly useful in patients with underlying cardiac valve
      disease and in those with resistance or intolerance to ergot dopamine agonists.
