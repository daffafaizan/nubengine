      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin S polymerization leads to red
      cell rigidity, microvascular obstruction, inflammation, and end-organ ischemia-reperfusion
      injury and infarction. Our published data indicate that up to 50% of sickle cell patients
      have endothelial dysfunction due to impaired bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide due
      in large part to scavenging of nitric oxide by cell-free plasma hemoglobin. These data
      suggest that therapies directed at restoring NO bioavailability might prove beneficial. We
      have recently discovered that the nitrite anion, available currently for human use as a
      component of the cyanide antidote kit, is a vasodilator in vivo by generating nitric oxide
      (NO) in tissues with lower oxygen tension and pH. The mechanism involves a novel
      physiological function of human hemoglobin as an oxygen- and pH dependent nitrite reductase.
      To date we have observed that nitrite infusions in animal models significantly reduce liver
      and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarction in mouse models, prevent cerebral
      vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in primates, and decrease pulmonary hypertension in
      newborn hypoxic sheep. The current protocol is designed as a phase I/II trial to address the
      hypothesis that nitrite infusions will vasodilate the circulation in patients with sickle
      cell disease at rest and during vaso-occlusive pain crisis, inactivate circulating cell-free
      plasma hemoglobin, reduce pulmonary artery pressures and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury
      (measured by circulating markers of oxidant stress).
