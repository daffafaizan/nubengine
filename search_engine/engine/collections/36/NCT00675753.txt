      Study Design A gene association study, using a case-control design, will be utilized. Each
      case and each control will include the genetic mother and her newborn infant.

      Setting A multicenter (n=2) study is proposed. St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach,
      Florida and Broward General Medical Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida are the two research
      centers.

      Sample:

      It is estimated that a sample of 166 mother-infant dyads (332 individuals) will be needed to
      test the study hypotheses. The sample size has been adjusted to allow for a 10% drop out
      rate. The control group will include 110 term mothers and 110 term infants. The case group
      will include 56 preterm mothers and 56 preterm infants.

      It is expected that each site will be able to enroll 83 family dyads in less than two years.
      A reasonable effort will be made to enroll eligible family dyads. Enrollment of less than 50%
      of eligible subjects will lead to a site review to remedy the problem or result in possible
      site closure. Enrollment for each site will be a minimal of 66 family dyads and a maximum of
      100 family dyads.
