      therapy-naïve patients (144 weeks), 2) therapy-experienced but protease inhibitor naïve
      patients (240 weeks,) and 3) non-B subtype infected patients (240 weeks).

      These three groups of participants with HIV-1 infection were at first registered as three
      different studies: KAL1RO (this study, NCT01083810, n=137), KAL2RO /KAL5RO (NCT01083836,
      n=92), and KAL6RO (NCT01081470, n=55) but were now reconciled under KAL1RO (NCT01083810) as a
      single study with three reporting groups.
