      randomized controlled trials have evaluated its usefulness in stress and fatigue. There were
      benefits in attention in some of these studies. Mild side effects and beneficial antioxidant
      properties make reasonable an assessment of its potential benefits in adults with ADHD. To
      our knowledge, Rhodiola rosea was never studied in ADHD.
