      gastrointestinal, respiratory, cutaneous and behavioral systems. Therapeutic positioning is
      routinely used to provide containment, maintain a flexed position and prevent skeletal
      deformities and delays in motor development. Premature infants have feeding difficulties and
      frequently experience gastroesophageal reflux, discomfort, refusal to feed, irritability, and
      crying. The neonatal intensive care environment can create stress and disrupts sleep-wake
      cycles and self-regulatory behaviors. Cycling from active to deep sleep states is required
      for neurosensory processing, learning, memory formation and brain plasticity. Sleep and
      waking states for premature infants are predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The
      purpose of the study is to determine whether the use of conformational positioning will be
      associated with greater total sleep time in premature infants with a history feeding
      difficulty compared to positioning on a mattress alone. We hypothesize that the number of
      arousals and total sleep time will be affected by the support surface. Specifically, the
      number of arousals will be lower and total sleep time will be greater for infants when they
      are on a conformational positioning (CP) device compared to when they are on the standard
      positioning system (mattress) (SP). The use of CP will reduce the number of arousals,
      increase the total sleep time, and bring about behavioral states that are conducive to
      regulation of attention, state and motor response relative to SP.
