    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the administration of anti-ESO (cancer/test
      antigen) mTCR (T cell receptor)-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (anti-thyroglobulin
      mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes) plus high-dose aldesleukin following
      a nonmyeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2
      positive patients with metastatic cancer expressing the ESO antigen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo survival of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-engineered cells.

      II. Determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -7 to -6
      and fludarabine phosphate via intravenous piggy back (IVPB) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1
      followed by anti-ESO (cancer/test antigen) mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood
      lymphocytes IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes approximately
      every 8 hours on days 0-4. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, annually for 5
      years, and then periodically for 10 years thereafter.
