      variation, and system fragmentation in addressing behavioral health. As an ongoing
      science-based process for improving care and lowering costs, robust increases in
      translational capability are needed to re-tool health delivery systems for behavioral health
      integration. A logic linking translational capability to behavioral health integration as an
      ongoing shared information process, founded on the core belief that enabling human action
      with new information technology tools can grow knowledge, is the most powerful way to solve
      problems and improve health care.

      Given these connected and interacting issues and obstacles, the Contractor has developed a
      solution strategy, building on four tiers of prior innovation and validation:

        -  The Behavioral Health Screen (BHS);

        -  BH-Works: the web software delivery of the BHS and new production features from Phase I;

        -  BH-Works Portal: new production software features from Phase I; and

        -  BH-Works Services: expertise and professional services to help primary care providers
           and healthcare systems integrate behavioral health into their organizations and
           workflows.
