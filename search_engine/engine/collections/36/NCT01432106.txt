      provide incremental reduction in blood pressure when compared to traditional blockade of
      Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) with ramipril. As an exploratory analysis, we
      propose that the blood pressure effect will be associated with suppressing plasma aldosterone
      levels, preserving the availability of nitric oxide, and preventing the development of
      insulin resistance. Other variables of interest include changes from baseline in adiponectin,
      Procollagen 1 and 3, osteopontin, cystatin C, and serum K+. In a nested cohort we will
      determine the impact of novel dual RAAS blockade on left ventricular remodeling.

      Should our hypotheses be proven correct and novel dual RAAS blockade is more effective than
      ramipril in reducing blood pressure, plasma aldosterone, preserving the availability of
      nitric oxide, as reflected by an increase in asymmetric dimethly arginine (ADMA) levels, and
      improves cardiovascular remodeling, this would have important implications for the long term
      prevention of target organ damage and cardiovascular events in this high risk ethnic group.
