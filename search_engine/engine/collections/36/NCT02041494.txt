      overall costs of two prosthetic meshes in the repair of complex ventral hernias. The two
      prosthetic meshes to be studied are Ventralight (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ), a synthetic mesh
      chiefly made of polypropylene and Strattice (LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ), a biologic mesh
      derived from porcine dermis. The study population will consist of patients who are in need of
      a repair of a complex ventral hernia. Patients will be enrolled in the study for 24 months
      following their operation or until they experience a recurrence of their hernia, whichever
      occurs first. The primary outcome variable is recurrence and the secondary outcome variables
      are post-operative surgical site infections and overall costs.

      There is no universally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a "complex" ventral
      hernia. For our purposes, a "complex" ventral hernia is one that involves a compromised
      surgical field, in which gastrointestinal, biliary, or genitourinary procedures are
      performed, one in which the wound class is considered clean-contaminated, contaminated, or
      dirty due to other causes, such as infected meshes and enterocutaneous fistulas, or surgical
      procedures conducted in patients with large ventral hernia defects (>10 cm in any single
      dimension).
