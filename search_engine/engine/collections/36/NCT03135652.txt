      treatments like surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation result in 5-year survival of
      35%. However, relapse still occurs in 70% of patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
      has emerged as a valid treatment not only to provide excellent symptom palliation, but also
      is effective in local control of metastatic lesions and improves survival. The potential
      efficacy of SBRT as adjuvant radiotherapy in CRLM patients after surgical resection or
      radiofrequency ablation is still unknown.
