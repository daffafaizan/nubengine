      method used to teach children is the social stories method, which was created by Gray (1993)
      to address the social difficulties of children with ASD. The theoretical framework of the
      social stories is based on theory of mind (TOM) hypothesis. Difficulties associated with the
      impaired TOM was addressed by explaining the complex social concepts in simple words and
      often include the description of perspectives of others. Several studies have shown the
      efficacy of the social story intervention. It is usually provided individually, but we want
      to use it in the group.

      In this study, we plan to randomly assign thirty-six 5-7-year-old children with ASD to one of
      two kinds of social skills groups: the social skills group or the play activities group
      (control condition). Group met for 16 weeks, one time per week, one hour each time.
      Participants were recruited between October 2020 and September 2023. Assessment were
      conducted at baseline and endpoint (16 weeks). To empower parents, we would also ask parents
      of participants to attend our treatment and lecture.
