      approach the study collaborators will design, build, implement, and evaluate in up to 90 IBD
      care sites the the following four key components of the IBD Learning Health System: 1) a
      Health Information Technology (HIT) environment that can "feed-forward" PROs and clinical
      data to be used at the point of care and integrated into a registry (IBD Plexus); 2)
      decision-support dashboards for use by patients and clinicians in real time to coproduce
      care; 3) meaningful reports for patients and clinicians; and 4) multi-stakeholder
      collaborative networks for improvement and research.

      Prior work from Sweden and the US show that successful uptake of the model can offer
      important benefits. Patients will be able to use web-based tools to monitor their health and
      manage their care, securely share data with clinicians in a timely manner, visualize outcomes
      that matter to them, and compare their results to other people. Clinicians will have new
      information that can improve their ability to track patient outcomes and costs over time; use
      PRO data to support pre-visit planning, shared decision-making at the point of care, and
      post-visit monitoring; and receive comparative performance reports to support quality
      improvement, public reporting, and professional development. Researchers will benefit by
      having PROs and cost data added to data registries to support clinical, translational, and
      comparative effectiveness research.
