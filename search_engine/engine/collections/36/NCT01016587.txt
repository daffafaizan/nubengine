    
      The specific aims of this translational, interdisciplinary, multi-center, international
      research study will follow 308 COPD patients with repeated measures over 12 months, are to:

        1. Explore COPD patients' symptoms, symptom clusters, and changes in symptoms and symptom
           clusters over time; as well as the genetic markers for subgroups of patients with
           different symptom clusters.

        2. Identify the occurrence of HGG and assess immune function in COPD patients.

        3. Explore relationships between HGG and immune function, genetic markers, symptoms,
           symptom clusters, health and respiratory status, frequency of exacerbations and
           health-related QOL.
