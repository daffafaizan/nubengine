      four 2-week treatment periods with bedtime doses of either placebo, zolpidem, LY2624803 1 mg,
      or LY2624803 3 mg. Neither patients nor investigators will be told what treatments are being
      given in any treatment period. A patient who completes all four treatment periods will be
      treated with placebo in 1, 2, or 3 of the periods; with zolpidem in 0, 1, or 2 of the
      periods; and with LY2624803 in either 1 or 2 of the periods. No patient will receive placebo
      for all four of the 2-week treatment periods. All patients will receive LY2624803 for at
      least one of the four 2-week treatment periods. During each treatment period, patients will
      record information each morning about their sleep the night before, and each evening about
      their functioning since waking up. Patients will also wear wrist actigraphy devices to record
      their physical activity. At the conclusion of each treatment period, patients will answer
      questions about their sleep, functioning, health, and relative preference for treatments.
