      pulmonary vein stenosis.

      Large animal studies have demonstrated that losartan can ameliorate the progression of
      pulmonary vein stenosis in a surgical model of pulmonary vein stenosis.

      There is no safety data for losartan in children < 6months of age or in children with
      pulmonary vein stenosis. Therefore, this study will test the safety and feasibility of
      losartan in children in an open label single arm interventional study.

      Patient inclusion criteria includes stenosis involving 2 or more pulmonary veins. Patients
      who are consented into the trial with be on losartan therapy for one year. They will undergo
      study visits every 3 months. Patients will be screened for adverse events through biochemical
      tests, routine clinical tests and questionnaires.

      An exploratory efficacy analysis will compare progression of pulmonary vein stenosis in
      children enrolled in losartan to a contemporary cohort of children with pulmonary vein
      stenosis, who did not receive losartan.
