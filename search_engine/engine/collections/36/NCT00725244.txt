      randomized in two groups :

        -  fifteen patients in group 1- bipolar eletrocoagulation (BE) and

        -  fifteen in group 2 - argon plasma coagulation(APC). For inclusion in the study, all
           patients were required to have active (at least one episode last week) and chronic
           (persist or appear 6 months after the conclusion of radiotherapy) rectal bleeding.
           Between May 2005 and April 2008, patients were treated and followed at the Endoscopy
           Unit in the SÃ£o Paulo Hospital (UNIFESP).
