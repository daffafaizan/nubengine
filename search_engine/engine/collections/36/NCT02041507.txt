    
      Design: Prospective double-blinded multicenter randomized controlled trial. Methods:
      Colonoscopy with Air Insufflation, Water Immersion, Water Exchange to aid insertion of
      colonoscope; split dose bowel preparation. Sedation available at the start of the procedure
      or on-demand.

      Control method: Air insufflation colonoscopy. Study methods: Water Immersion colonoscopy,
      Water Exchange colonoscopy.

      Population: Consecutive 50 to 70 year-old screening patients. After informed consent,
      assignment to control or study arms based on computer generated randomization list with block
      allocation and stratification.

      Primary outcome: overall Adenoma Detection Rate. Secondary outcomes: proximal colon ADR, Mean
      Adenomas resected per Procedure (MAP), cecal intubation rate and time, total procedure time
      (including biopsy and/or polypectomy), maximum pain during colonoscopy assessed during
      insertion and at discharge, the need for sedation/analgesia and its dosage. In addition loop
      reduction maneuvers, position changes, abdominal compression, the amount of infused and
      suctioned water during insertion and withdrawal, and patients willingness to repeat the
      examination will be evaluated.
