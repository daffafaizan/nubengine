    
      REGISTRY integrates prospectively and systematically collected clinical research data (e.g.
      phenotypical clinical features, family history, demographical characteristics) with access to
      biological specimens (e.g. blood, urine) obtained from individuals with manifest HD,
      unaffected individuals known to carry the HD mutation or at risk of carrying the HD mutation,
      and control research participants (e.g. spouses, siblings or offspring of HD mutation
      carriers known not to carry the HD mutation).

      REGISTRY is an open-ended study and eligible subjects are assessed at annual study visits on
      the phenotypical characteristics of HD regardless of whether they display clinical symptoms
      and signs of the disease and of individuals who are part of an HD family (irrespective of
      their mutation carrier status). At each study visit, general clinical, motor function,
      behavior, cognitive, Health Economics, Quality of Life assessments are administered. In
      addition, participants are given the option to consent to the donation of biosamples for the
      purposes of mutation (CAG repeat length) testing and for research to identify biological
      modifiers and markers of HD. Biological specimens and phenotypical data are made available to
      qualified scientists whose projects are reviewed and approved by the Scientific and
      Bioethical Advisory Committee (SBAC) of EHDN. Successful applicants agree to accept the EHDN
      policies surrounding the use of the data/materials provided and publication of results (see
      data sharing and publication policies of EHDN, attached). Research projects should aim to
      advance scientific knowledge towards establishing clinically effective treatments that delay
      onset and/or slow the progression of the disease.
