      clarify the mechanisms underlying these clinical benefits. Currently, dapagliflozin is
      indicated in patients with diabetes irrespective of the presence of HF. The initiation in
      patients with HF represents an opportunity to elucidate the effect of dapagliflozin on
      cardiac remodeling in this population. Therefore, we propose a study that aims to assess the
      effects of dapagliflozin in echocardiographic parameters of cardiac remodeling, with special
      interest in LA geometry and function, as well as in biomarkers reflecting expanded
      pathophysiological pathways. LA volume has shown to identify the progression of HF
      irrespective of LVEF and, therefore, it represents a meaningful measure of the cardiac impact
      of dapagliflozin in the entire spectrum of chronic HF.
