    
      Design of intervention vs. control Intra-operative injective of (chirocaine) before incision
      Location of injection: inferior alveolar nerve proximal to its entrance to ramus of mandible,
      maxillary nerve around pterygopalatine ganglion Amount of injection on each injection site:
      (1) Experimental group 1: 5mg/ml chirocaine 5cc (2)Experimental group 2: 5mg/ml chirocaine
      2.5cc (3)Control group: normal saline 5cc. There are totally 4 injection sites for two jaw
      surgery and 2 injection sites for one jaw surgery. The experimental site and control site
      will be determined randomly before injection.

      Outcome measurement

        -  Primary: effectiveness of intra-operative nerve block on post-operative pain control

        -  Secondary:

             1. whether the pain relieve effect is dose-related

             2. how long will this effect last

      The intensity of post-operative pain will be measured by VAS, visual analog scale)daily until
      patients are discharged.

      Report adverse outcome:

        -  Intolerable pain on control group

        -  Adverse reaction to local anesthetic agent

        -  Injection-related complications (puncture of major vessels, hematoma on -injection site,
           etc.)
