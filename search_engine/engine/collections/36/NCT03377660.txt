      treatment strategies have resulted in more people who remain free from cancer recurrence in
      the long term following treatment.

      Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with oesophageal cancer, but while
      surgical removal of the tumour (oesophagectomy) may offer the best chance of cure, these are
      major operations associated with specific long term complications. Poor appetite, weight loss
      and nutritional impairment are common problems among patients who attain long-term cancer
      remission and cure after surgery.

      A new clinic has been established to treat patients who are in remission but who have lost
      more than 10% of their body weight secondary to the effects of the surgery and struggling to
      regain weight. These patients will be treated as per standard of care with medications to aid
      weight gain.

      The investigators are interested to conduct research into how the reward value of food
      changes during the clinical treatment pathway. The hypothesis is that there will be an
      increased reward response to food after medication use, the magnitude of which will correlate
      with weight gain. To assess this, patients who are already part of this clinic will be
      approached to have fMRI that can demonstrate changes in brain reward centres as well as a
      Progressive Ratio Task, which is a direct measure of appetitive behaviour. Changes in brain
      reward centre responses and appetitive behaviour will be correlated with changes in weight
      after pharmacotherapy. This may further inform future clinical protocols to provide improved
      precision medicine.
