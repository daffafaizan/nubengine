      cerebral palsy, an impaired ability to integrate multiple senses including pressure from
      ground, limb proprioception, and vestibular inputs leads to a movement pattern that is
      coarse, spastic and inefficient. In the pediatric rehab clinic spastic movement disorders
      have been treated with flexible, molded orthotics for the foot and ankle (AFO) to enhance
      sensation of ground reaction forces, and flexible elastomeric compression garments to enhance
      body and limb proprioception. While the investigators observed substantial improvements in
      gait quality and postural stability using sensory input orthotics, these clinical
      observations have not been objectively quantified. The goal is to use validated tools for
      measuring function and movement in pediatric populations in order to gather data on the value
      of sensory input orthotic interventions in children with cerebral palsy.

      Under the term, sensory input orthotic, the following items are included which will be used
      in this study. 1) A flexible, thin polypropylene shell ankle-foot orthotic designed according
      to Hylton et al. Journal of P&O 1989. 2) Wearable elastomeric compression garments
      manufactured by SPIO or from the Boston Brace DMO garment line. 3) A vibrating anklet that
      provides subsensory vibrational stimulation to the leg, manufactured by Accelera.
