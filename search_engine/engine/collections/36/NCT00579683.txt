      (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A number
      of trials have shown small molecule kinase inhibitors to be active agents in the treatment of
      NSCLC [1]. Clinically these drugs have been noted to produce dramatic but infrequent
      responses. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor have been shown to correlate
      with sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib[2,3]. However, we know that most patients who
      have initial responses to EGFR-TKI eventually progress. The mechanism of acquired clinical
      resistance to these inhibitors in patients incompletely understood.

      This is a protocol to study clinical characteristics and biopsy tissue of patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer who have had previous clinical response to small molecule kinase
      inhibitors and subsequently experience progression of disease. The tissues and other
      specimens will be used to carry out laboratory studies to explore the molecular basis of
      sensitivity and resistance to small molecule kinase inhibitors.
