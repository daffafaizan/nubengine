      in patients who have never been diagnosed with diabetes. This high blood sugar can lead to
      complications after surgery such as infections at the site of the incision. Additionally, if
      there is any cardiac muscle injury either prior to or during surgery, the injured cardiac
      muscle can not use glucose (the body's fuel and energy source) as well as it did prior to the
      injury. This reduced ability to use glucose slows the cardiac muscles ability to repair
      itself and provide the normal pumping force and function needed to circulate the blood
      throughout the body. This inability to repair itself and/or provide the normal pumping force
      and function can make it difficult for the patient as well as increase the length of stay
      required in the CSICU.

      GLP-1 has the ability to lower blood sugar and help cells use glucose for fuel and energy but
      when the blood sugar becomes low its glucose lowering ability decreases. In this study, we
      want to see we want to see if GLP-1 may help keep the blood sugar within normal limits and
      reduce or eliminate the need for insulin. We will also see whether it will help the heart
      recover more quickly.
