      in patients with advanced osteoarthritis of the knee.

      There is a bigger demand of patients requiring total knee arthroplasty than the number of
      surgeries performed by the Unified Health System in Brazil. For this reason the queues to
      perform this surgery are huge and time-consuming in the referral hospitals. Whereas all these
      patients are suffering from severe pain and limiting, and awaiting the surgery for a few
      years, it is necessary to try any treatment, even if temporary, to ease the pain and
      suffering of those patients.

      A double-blind randomized prospective study will be held at Hospital Federal dos Servidores
      do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, with patients from the waiting list for Total Knee Arthroplasty
      who accept to participate and sign the informed consent form. Will be selected the last 150
      knees in TKA queue. Patients will be randomized and divided in 3 groups of 50 knees. A group
      will be submitted to an intraarticular injection of corticosteroid (1 ml of sterile
      Triamcinolone Hexacetonide solution 20 mg/ml). A second group will be subjected to
      administration of 6 ml of Hylan GF20. The third group will receive Hylan GF20 associated with
      corticosteroid (7 ml solution containing 1 ml of triamcinolone and 6 ml of Hylan GF20). The
      injection technique will be the same for all patients. The outcome results will be measured
      by a form with patient data, functional scores (Knee Society Score and Lysholm) before
      treatment and at one, three and six months after treatment.
