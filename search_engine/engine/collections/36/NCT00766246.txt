      treatment safety as first-line therapy for patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Following
      disease progression or treatment failure, the potential benefit of continued bevacizumab
      therapy will be tested by randomizing patients to two treatment arms, including second-line
      chemotherapy with or without further bevacizumab. It is hypothesized that continuation of
      bevacizumab with pemetrexed as second-line treatment following progression will result in
      improved clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC.
