    
      Investigate whether PD-L1 and other immuno-markers will be influenced by osimertinib
      treatment in advanced EGFR T790M positive advanced NSCLC patients.

      explore whether PD-L1 and other immuno-markers can predict the safety and efficacy of
      subsequent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors at the time of PD due to osimertinib
      resistance.
