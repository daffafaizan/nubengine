      anesthetic option after undergoing an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the outpatient
      setting. Conducting this study, will allow the option for a surgeon to administer a local
      anesthetic, in a single injection, to the exact location of the surgical procedure and in a
      sterile environment. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if EXPAREL® can be used
      as a safe alternative to current post-operative pain control methods, while limiting narcotic
      use and providing appropriate postoperative analgesia.
