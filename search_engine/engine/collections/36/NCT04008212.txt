      conventional operating room with a mobile flat-panel detector (Cios Alpha, Siemens) connected
      to an angio-navigation station (EndoNaut, Therenva). The intention is to perform preoperative
      3D CT/perioperative 2D fluoroscopy fusion Imaging using an automatic registration process.
      Registration is considered successful when the software was able to correctly overlay
      preoperative 3D vascular structures onto the fluoroscopy image. For EVAR, contrast dose,
      operation and fluoroscopy time were compared to those of a control group drawn from the
      department's database who underwent a procedure with a C-arm image intensifier.
