      ng/ml) has also been linked to adverse health outcomes such as malignancy, cardiovascular
      disease, immune functioning, and glucose metabolism. Recent data from retrospective and
      prospective trials have demonstrated contradictive results concerning the role of vitamin D
      in female reproduction and IVF outcome. Some studies have found that women deficient in
      vitamin D had lower ovarian reserve and significantly lower clinical pregnancy rates when
      compared to patients who were sufficient levels in vitamin D. Some studies also demonstrated
      that serum 25-OH-D3 levels correlates with antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels in women of
      advanced reproductive age. It may also have a role to play in endocrine dysfunction and
      abnormal folliculogenesis in polycystic ovaries .

      The aim of this prospective cohort study including infertile women undergoing IVF treatment
      is to investigate the association between serum 25-OH- D3 levels and parametres of ovarian
      reserve (AMH, antral follicle count, number of oocytes collected) and clinical pregnancy and
      miscarriage rates .
