      numerous metabolic processes. Since its discovery, adiponectin has garnered considerable
      attention for its role in cardiovascular pathology. It has been shown to be a predictor of
      cardiovascular events in both the general population and patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
      In this study,we are planning to investigate the relationship between serum adiponectin and
      clinical prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
