      metronidazole and minocycline), double (DAP- ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) and modified
      triple antibiotic pastes (mTAP- ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and cefaclor) on mesenchmal stem
      cells derived from apical papilla (SCAP). SCAP were isolated from the impacted third molar
      teeth of the young adults. TAP, DAP and mTAP treatment (14-day medication and 28-day
      medication) were applied on SCAP and viability, proliferation and apoptosis of the cells were
      evaluated after four weeks. Osteocalcin (BGLAP), dentin sialo phosphoprotein (DSPP) and
      alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) gene expression levels were also evaluated.
