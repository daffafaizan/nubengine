      the epilepsy monitoring unit will be studied using near-infrared spectroscopy for cytochrome
      c oxidase (CCO) redox state and blood oxygen saturation. Along with routine EEG monitoring, a
      set of light sensors, called optodes, attached to a net that goes over the head will be put
      on. These optodes will send out very weak red light signals, which will pass through the
      scalp and bounce back to detectors on the netting. The changes in the light signals will be
      used to calculate the changes in the various forms of the enzyme CCO, as well as the amount
      of oxygen in the blood. We hope to use these measurements to study changes in blood flow and
      cellular energy usage in the brain during seizures, which might help us to understand
      epilepsy better in the future and design better treatments.
