      toxin exposure in fast and slow nicotine metabolizing smokers. We will recruit current
      smokers (split between slow and rapid nicotine metabolizing smokers) for a 35-day protocol.
      Participants will smoke their own brand cigarettes during a baseline 5 day period, followed
      by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 1: 0.25 mg nicotine
      content, followed by a 15-day period of smoking low nicotine content cigarette level 2: 0.08
      mg nicotine content. This application is designed to provide empirical science to inform the
      FDA on the effect smoking low nicotine content cigarettes will have on use patterns and harm
      exposure.
