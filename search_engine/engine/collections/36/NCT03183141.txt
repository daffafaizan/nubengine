      study SERES-012 within 8 weeks of receipt of study drug, have responded to a course of
      standard of care (SOC) antibiotic treatment, and who have completed their SERES-012 Week 8
      visit will receive an oral dose of SER-109. A treatment regimen of SER-109 is defined as an

      SERES-012.

      Cohort 2 is an open-label program for subjects who were not part of SERES-012. Subjects 18
      years of age or older who had one or more CDI recurrence within 12 months and have responded
      to a course of SOC antibiotic treatment will receive an oral dose of SER-109. The CDI
      recurrence must be confirmed by a positive C. difficile stool toxin assay. A treatment
      regimen of SER-109 is defined as an oral dose of SER-109 (4 capsules once daily) for 3
      consecutive days.
