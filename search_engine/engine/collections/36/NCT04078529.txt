      incidence of falls, as well as fear of falling, there is little research to investigate the
      effectiveness of falls prevention programmes for visually impaired populations. At the time
      of writing there were no studies identified that used this type of intensive training over a
      period of several days, rather most of the studies that exist have been conducted in
      community settings.

      This study will aim to compare the effectiveness of a comprehensive exercise programme aimed
      at improving balance, walking technique, postural control and ability to complete functional
      tasks, with a home exercise programme with either written or audio instructions.
