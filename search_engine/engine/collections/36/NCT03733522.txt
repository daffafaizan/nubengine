      The aim of this study is to evaluate the survival of direct composite resin restorations in
      primary molars using different methods for isolation of the operative field: absolute
      isolation (local anesthesia, use of dental clamp and rubber dam) and relative isolation
      (cotton rollers and saliva ejector) by a randomized clinical trial.

      Materials and Methods:

      All composite restorations will be performed on children aged 4 to 10 years who present at
      least one dentin caries lesion or restoration needing replacement, without pulp involvement
      in a primary tooth. The treatments will be performed in the dental clinic of the University
      of São Paulo (FOUSP) by trained operators. The teeth will be randomized between the groups:
      Absolute Isolation (AI) and Relative Isolation (IR) and restored with composite resin
      (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive adhesive system and Filtek BulkFill composite resin - 3M ESPE)
      stratified by surface (single or multi surface).

      Restoration evaluation will be performed after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months by a blind, trained
      and calibrated examiner.

      As a primary outcome, the survival of the restorations will be evaluated. The secondary
      outcomes involve the procedure time (in minutes), professional and material cost (in
      Brazilian reais), as well as the cost-effectiveness of the restorations and the discomfort
      reported by the patient (measured using the Wong-Baker scale).

      The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test will be applied to the survival of the
      restoration. All variables will be modeled and compared with a Cox regression model of shared
      fragility. The discomfort reported by the patient will be analyzed by Ordinal Logistic
      Regression (α = 5%).
