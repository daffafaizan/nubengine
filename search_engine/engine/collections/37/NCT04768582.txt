      compared to Clopidogrel.

      Rapid and effective inhibition of the platelet P2Y12 receptor is of pivotal importance in
      patients with AMI who undergo PCI.

      Prasugrel (60 mg loading and 10 mg/day maintenance dose) is a new generation P2Y12 inhibitor
      that achieves greater and faster platelet inhibition comparing with clopidogrel in patients
      undergoing PCI.

      As revealed by 2 head-to-head studies, reducing Prasugrel dosages to 20/3.75 LD/MD (mg) was
      still efficacious but led to less bleeding events than the original 60/10 LD/MD (mg).

      In TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, prasugrel was associated with not only significantly less ischemic
      events but also more non-CABG TIMI major bleeding, as compared to Clopidogrel.

      In the PRASFIT-ACS study from Japan (20 mg loading and 3.75 mg/day maintenance dose),
      prasugrel was associated with a 23% reduction of MACE and the incidence of non-CABG major
      bleeding was similar to clopidogrel.

      There is NO data regarding the effectiveness of Japanese loading dose of prasugrel on
      platelet reactivity in Taiwanese patients with AMI.

      This study use PRU for efficacy and ISTH major bleeding for safety evaluations; the
      anticipated results are prompt and effective platelet inhibition as well as comparably low
      bleeding rate.
