      to decrease stress in recently quit smokers; and (2) to examine whether a just-in-time
      adaptive intervention that decreases stress also reduces the near-term odds of a smoking
      lapse.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the administration of a prompt to perform a
      relaxation exercise as compared to no prompt will lead to a lower likelihood of being
      stressed in the subsequent two hours, and that this effect will be stronger when the prompt
      is administered when the individual is stressed. The secondary hypothesis is that stress
      episodes will predict the timing of smoking lapses. The third hypothesis is that
      administration of a prompt to perform a relaxation exercise will reduce the odds of smoking
      for the next two hours, and that this effect will be stronger when the prompt is administered
      when the individual is stressed. The fourth (exploratory) hypothesis is that stress will
      predict the timing of overeating episodes.

      These data will also be used for developing automated risk prediction of smoking relapse, and
      for developing decision rules for the timing of Just-In-Time-Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs).
