      effective treatment for opioid dependence. However, there is concern that buprenorphine may
      be abused due to its high abuse potential. A sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone combination
      tablet may reduce the risk of abuse associated with buprenorphine alone. The purpose of this
      study is to characterize the effects of buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid-dependent
      individuals.

      This study will last 10 weeks. Participants will stay in a residential research unit, and
      will be maintained on oral hydromorphone (10 mg). During twice-weekly experimental sessions,
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sublingual tablets, intramuscular
      injections, or a placebo. The 15 conditions studied will include: sublingual or intramuscular
      buprenorphine/naloxone (1/0.25 mg, 2/0.5 mg, 4/1 mg, 8/2 mg, and 16/4 mg), 0.25 mg of
      intramuscular naloxone (antagonist control), 10 mg of intramuscular hydromorphone (agonist
      control), sublingual and intramuscular buprenorphine (8 mg), and placebo.
