      for a variety of traumatic, degenerative, or deformity conditions. In recent years, the
      development of more sophisticated segmental instrumentation techniques and hardware has
      allowed for incorporation of multiple spinal levels in single settings. The long-term
      consequences for spinal motion segments adjacent to such fusions remain unknown.

      The investigators propose to undertake a retrospective case study analysis evaluating both
      radiologic and clinical parameters indicative of adjacent-segment pathology in patients who
      have undergone instrumented arthrodesis procedures at Ohio State University, performed by
      either Dr. Francis Farhadi, James B. Elder, or Gary Rea.
