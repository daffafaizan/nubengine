      have Atrial Fibrillation, the most common sustained arrhythmia.1 That number of patients is
      expected to increase to 5.6 million by 2050.1 Atrial Fibrillation is associated with a 4-5
      fold increase in the risk of stroke, 3-fold increase in the risk of heart failure and 1.5-1.9
      increased risk of death.2-6 The prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation increases as individuals
      age; 5.9% of those over 65 years of age and 9% of those over 80 years are diagnosed with the
      arrhythmia.25 The lifetime risk for development of Atrial Fibrillation is estimated to be 1
      in 4 for men and women forty years of age and older.26 The proper management of patients with
      AF is critical due to the well-documented association with heart failure and stroke.2-6, 11,
      27.

      The number of Emergency Department visits for complaints related to Atrial Fibrillation
      increased by 88% between 1993 and 2003 and now account for approximately 1% percent of all
      Emergency Department visits in the United States.7, 24 More than 65% of these Atrial
      Fibrillation visits result in hospital admission and over $6.65 billion in expenditures,
      including $3.88 billion for hospitalizations, $1.53 billion for outpatient treatment and
      nearly $240 million for prescription drugs.8, 24 Patients with a primary admission diagnosis
      of AF had a mean length of stay and hospital charge of 4 days and $7000 in 1999.28 Over the
      past 20 years, the admission rate for Atrial Fibrillation has increased by 66%.29-31 The
      combination of increasing Atrial Fibrillation prevalence, unnecessarily high admission rate
      and Emergency Department crowding is likely to severely burden our healthcare system.
