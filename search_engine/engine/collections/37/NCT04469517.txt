      malformations leading to recurrent bleedings and shunt formation especially in the liver,
      lungs and the brain. The underlying pathogenic HHT mechanism remains unclear. The wide
      variability in age of onset and severity of symptoms amongst patients, even within the same
      family, suggests several factors contribute to the complexity of this disease. Mutations in
      several genes of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² superfamily pathway influence
      angiogenesis in patients with HHT. The genetic loss of ALK1 or ENG alone are not sufficient
      to induce AVMs; environmental insults that could trigger angiogenesis (e.g. wounding) are
      also needed. In this study it will be analyzed if hypoxic induced factors could have an
      influence on the disease HHT.
