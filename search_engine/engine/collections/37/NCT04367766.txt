    
      The overall objective of this study will be to compare the three treatment modalities after
      tooth extraction (immediate implant placement, alveolar ridge preservation, spontaneous
      healing) in terms of:

        -  patient-related (morbidity) outcomes during surgical procedure and the first 2 weeks
           after the surgical procedure

        -  cost-effectiveness ratio (treatment time, number of surgeries, number of appointments
           and overall appointments time, need for bone and soft tissue augmentation, overall
           costs) at the time of prosthesis delivery

        -  volumetric bone and soft tissue changes of the site before treatment (prior to tooth
           extraction), 4 months after tooth extraction, 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.

        -  clinical, radiographic, aesthetic and patient-related (satisfaction) outcomes at the
           time of prosthesis delivery and 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.

        -  Implant Success and Survival at 1, 3 and 5 years after final prosthesis.
