        -  C control (non exposure) : non-pharmacological treatment ( psychotherapy)

        -  O Outcome:

      Primary 1ry : Assess gustatory thresholds among a sample of depressed Egyptian adults (age
      from 20 to 50 years old) under anti-depressants therapy ( for at least 3 months) using filter
      paper disc(FPD) method through a scoring system.

      Secondary 2ry: - Determine the taste intensity at supra-threshold among these patients using
      a psychophysical method through a scoring system. - Identify gustatory dysfunction modulators
      among these patients using a questionnaire ( appendix) with a binary measuring unit (yes/no).
