      treatment outcomes. Our prior data indicates that the cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) enzyme is
      critical in the metabolic inactivation of nicotine, and also influences smoking behavior and
      response to therapies. With a vision toward translation of our research to practice, we have
      characterized a genetically-informed biomarker of CYP2A6 activity, specifically the nicotine
      metabolite ratio (NMR; 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine), which reflects both CYP2A6 genetic
      variation and environmental influences on CYP2A6 activity. The NMR is measured non-invasively
      in smokers with established reliability, stability, analytic validity, and efficacy as a
      predictor of the ability to quit smoking and treatment response in multiple retrospective
      trials. Translation of these findings to clinical practice requires validation in a
      prospective clinical trial comparing alternative therapies for smoking cessation. Thus, the
      proposed trial is a prospective, stratified, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial
      of alternative therapies for smoking cessation treatment in approximately 1,200 smokers.
      Randomization to placebo (PLA), transdermal nicotine (TN), or varenicline (VAR) will be
      stratified prospectively based on the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR). Abstinence from
      smoking at the end of treatment will be the primary outcome. Quit rate at 6-month follow-up
      is a secondary outcome. To facilitate translation to practice, analysis of the
      cost-effectiveness of our proposed approach will also be completed. The proposed research
      provides the next critical step to validate a genetically-informed diagnostic tool, the NMR,
      which clinicians can use in the future to optimize treatment decisions for their patients who
      wish to quit smoking.
