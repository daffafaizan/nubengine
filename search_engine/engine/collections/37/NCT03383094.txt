    
      This study is a prospective, multi-institutional, open-label, randomized phase II trial that
      will evaluate the efficacy of concurrent and adjuvant pembrolizumab with radiation therapy
      (RT) versus RT plus cisplatin in intermediate/high-riskp16-positive locoregionally advanced
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The primary endpoint is progression-free
      survival (PFS).
