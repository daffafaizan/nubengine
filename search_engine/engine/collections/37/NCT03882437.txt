    
      The study is a non-randomized open-label Phase I clinical trial to characterize the safety
      and toxicity associated with infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated serotype 9 (rAAV9)
      capsid containing the human lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform B (LAMP2B)
      transgene (investigational product (IP), RP-A501) in male patients with Danon Disease (DD).

      During the course of the study, approximately 11-23 subjects will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of the IP with each cohort receiving RP-A501 at sequentially higher
      dose levels. Three dose levels are planned to be investigated in 6 distinct cohorts. Prior to
      infusion of IP, rituximab and tacrolimus will be administered prophylactically.

        -  Cohort 1: Age 15 -17 years: Low Dose (n=3 subjects)

        -  Cohort 2: Age 15 - 17 years: Intermediate Dose (n=2-4)

        -  Cohort 3: Age 15 - 17 years: High Dose (n=2-4)

        -  Cohort 1A: Age 8 - 14 years: Low Dose (n=2-4)

        -  Cohort 2A: Age 8 - 14 years : Intermediate Dose (n=2-4)

        -  Cohort 3A: Age 8 - 14 years: High Dose (n=2-4)

      Pending determination of safety in the current cohort, concomitant enrollment in subsequent
      cohort is permissible.

      The study will also enable an initial evaluation of whether or not the IP results in
      cardiomyocyte and skeletal muscle transduction and gene expression and preliminary assessment
      of the extent of cardiomyocyte and histologic correction. Additionally, a preliminary
      evaluation of clinical stabilization following infusion will also be made.
