      pain, functional disability, quality of life, global perceived effect, return to work,
      physical activity, physical capacity and strength of the lower limbs in patients with chronic
      non-specific low back pain

      Design: Sixty-six will be randomized into two groups namely: Graded Activity program (GA)(n =
      33) and supervised exercise (SE) (n = 33). The primary clinical outcomes will be pain,
      assessed with the numerical pain scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire, and disability assessed
      with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be measured with Global
      Perceived Effect, quality of life, return to work, physical activity, functional capacity and
      strength of the lower limbs. The program lasts for 6 weeks, and sessions happen twice a week,
      with duration of one hour each. Evaluations will be performed before(baseline), after
      (6weeks) and with a follow-up 3 and 6 months after treatment. Data will be collected by a
      blinded examiner who also had made the allocation of patients to groups. Significance level
      is established at 5%.
