    
      Between November 2011 and January 2017, medical records of all women with ≥stage II cystocele
      who underwent 20 min pad testing and urodynamic studies in a medical center were reviewed.
      Only those with complete data of maximum flow rate (Qmax) and detrusor pressure at maximum
      flow rate (PdetQmax) were enrolled. ANOVA test and post-hoc testing with bonferroni's
      correction were used for statistical analysis. Woman were defined as having DU when Qmax was
      <12 mL/s and PdetQmax was <10 cmH2O, and were defined as having BOO when Qmax was <12 mL/s
      and PdetQmax was ≥25 cmH2O with sustained detrusor contraction during voiding cystometry.
