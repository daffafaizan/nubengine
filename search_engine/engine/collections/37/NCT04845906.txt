    
      This is a healthy human wear study of a minimum of 100 study participants who will wear the
      StatLock™ Catheter Stabilization Device and the StatLock™ stabilization device accessory
      (Foam Strip). Participants will report to the research center, on Day 0 to have their skin
      assessed by the investigator, clinician, and/or designee. On Day 0 the participants will have
      the StatLock™ Catheter Stabilization Devices and the foam strip applied. There will be 4
      separate StatLock™ devices being tested, which will be randomly applied to the participants
      on their inner (ventral) forearms. Each participant will have 2 separate devices applied, one
      to each arm. Those participants who have the StatLock ™ Arterial Plus, StatLock™ Dialysis II,
      or the StatLock IV Select , will also have the Foam Strip applied.

      The participant will also wear a dressing over top of a StatLock™ compatible catheter, which
      will be connected to an extension set. For this study, the catheter will not be inserted into
      the study participant but instead will be shortened or modified and placed on the skin and
      secured with the StatLock™ Stabilization Device. The catheter tip will be marked with
      indelible ink, to assess for any catheter movement. The use of the catheters, extension set,
      and the dressing represents how the device would be used in a clinical setting.

      Once the devices are applied the participant will have the skin assessed (using a modified
      Draize Scale) by the investigator, clinician, and/or designee on Day 0. The participant will
      wear the devices at home for 1 week and will return on Day 7 for a skin assessment,
      evaluation of pad and foam strip lift, and catheter movement, evaluation of pain, and removal
      of the devices by the investigator, clinician, and/or designee. On Day 8, there may be a
      phone call and/or video call with the participant to review the skin condition of the site
      where the device was removed from.
