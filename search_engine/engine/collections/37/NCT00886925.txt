      with poor prognosis. The most common presentation is an acute episode of hepatic
      encephalopathy precipitated by factors that increase the exposure of the brain to ammonia.
      Current therapies are based on measures that decrease plasma ammonia and counteract the
      effect of factors such as infection or electrolyte's disturbances. Brain edema and
      abnormalities of cerebral blood flow appear to be important. Part of the impairment of
      astrocyte function could be related to an increase of oxidative stress injury.

      In patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, the concentration of albumin in plasma
      is usually low. Administration of human albumin in patients with hepatorenal syndrome and
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a major impact on the prognosis of these complications.
      Albumin prevents circulatory dysfunction and renal failure. The mechanisms of action may
      include the maintenance of oncotic pressure and a scavenger effect of toxic substances
      present in blood. Albumin has also shown beneficial effects in neurological injury secondary
      to stroke, probably in relation to this scavenger effect.

      The administration of intravenous albumin to patients with hepatic encephalopathy may have
      beneficial effects on the course of encephalopathy.
