      inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will undergo the procedure of bone marrow
      cell aspiration from iliac crest for the purpose of receiving autologous multipotent
      mesenchymal stem cells. The cells will be cultivated for 3 passages (for 3 - 4 weeks) in
      order to expand them to sufficient quantity. Suspension of the cultured AMSC will then be
      sterilely packed and transported to the surgery site. During the posterolateral spine fusion
      operation, 1.5 ml of cell suspension will be mixed with 5 cc of beta-tricalcium phosphate
      foam (Vitossâ„¢, Orthovita) and 3.5 ml of patient's blood, and inserted between the transverse
      processes of the lumbar spine.

      All subjects will be hospitalized and followed up as per standard medical care rules used in
      the investigational site hospital for this type of intervention.
