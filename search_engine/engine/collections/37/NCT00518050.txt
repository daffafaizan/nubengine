      cancer, are among the greatest increases of all preventable cancers over the past decade.
      However, because of recent advances in early detection, secondary prevention efforts, and
      treatment, the number of melanoma survivors is increasing. Little research has been conducted
      on melanoma survivors and important opportunities exist for research in this understudied
      population. Understanding recurrence and second primary cancer risk, cognitive
      characteristics, behaviors, surveillance patterns, economic sequelae, and family issues of
      melanoma survivors is imperative from a public health standpoint to promote the health and
      well-being of this cohort. The objectives of this study are to: 1) conduct focus groups to
      enhance our understanding of the behaviors of melanoma survivors, and 2) conduct a pilot
      survey study based on the results of the focus groups to further describe the behavioral and
      psychosocial issues in melanoma survivors. This will be among the first studies that explores
      behavioral and psychosocial issues in melanoma survivors. The study findings will inform a
      large-scale melanoma survivorship grant proposal to the National Cancer Institute or other
      federal/private sources of funding.
