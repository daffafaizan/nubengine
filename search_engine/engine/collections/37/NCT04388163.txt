      found in intertriginous areas of the body. The pain and impairment of HS leads patients to
      report a decreased quality of life, even in comparison to other debilitating cutaneous
      disease states. Pharmalogic management of HS can vary from topical antibiotics or
      intralesional corticosteroids for mild cases to immunosuppressants and biologic agents in
      refractory cases. Gentian violet is a topical antiseptic used to treat many cutaneous yeast
      infections. It also has a role in improving wound healing in sites of active ulceration. It
      is our hypothesis that gentian violet will help minimize skin trauma in sites of active HS to
      promote improved wound healing and quality of life.
