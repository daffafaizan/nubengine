      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of various single IVT
      doses of LKA651 in up to 48 subjects with diabetic macular edema. Subjects will be randomized
      to receive active or sham injections in a 3:1 ratio. A total of 6 cohorts (8 subjects per
      cohort) may be enrolled in Part 1. Each subject will participate in a screening/eligibility
      period (up to 60 days), a treatment period (single day), and an 84 day follow up period. A
      total of up to 11 visits will take place, all on an out-patient basis. An independent data
      monitoring committee (DMC) will be chartered to review cumulative safety data and approve
      each dose escalation and cohort progression in this first-in-human trial.

      Part 2 is a double-masked design to assess the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of a single IVT dose of LKA651 when co-administered with LucentisÂ®. A total
      of up to 3 cohorts (8 subjects per cohort) may be enrolled in Part 2. Each subject will
      participate in a screening/eligibility period (up to 60 days), a treatment period
      (combination therapy, single day), and an 84 day follow up period. A total of up to 11 visits
      will take place, all on an out-patient basis. For the LKA651 vs sham injections, the unmasked
      ophthalmologist is not permitted to do any of the assessments except for the injection (and
      an inspection of the injection site immediately following). All other ocular assessments
      after randomization will be conducted by a second ophthalmologist masked to the type of
      injection (active or sham). The Lucentis injection (Part 2) is given open label to all
      patients following either the LKA651 or sham injection.
