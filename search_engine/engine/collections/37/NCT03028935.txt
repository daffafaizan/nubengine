      I. Adapt an effective evidence-based exercise and nutrition program to meet the needs of
      rural Latinas.

      II. Implement the adapted program in a rural Latina population. III. Evaluate feasibility and
      potential to improve physical activity and dietary behavior of the adapted program in a rural
      Latina population.

      OUTLINE:

      Phase I: Create a community advisory board to adapt Strong Women Healthy Hearts Program
      (SWHHP) using feedback on the existing SWHHP from Latinas residing in the community.

      Phase II: Conduct a small pilot study to assess effectiveness of the adapted program (one
      group pre-post design, with data collected at three time points).

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo instructor-led exercise and nutrition education
      classes for 60 minutes each twice a week for 12 weeks.
