      the coingestion of nutrients through multiple mechanisms. The ingestion itself, the contact
      with the gastric mucosa, the arrival into the intestine and the subsequent digestion are
      known to produce neural reflexes, hormonal responses and plasma substrates gradients which,
      by modulating gastric emptying, insulin secretion and insulin clearance participate in the
      regulation of postprandial glycaemia. The size of this effect is influenced by a number of
      factors: the specific nutrient chemical characteristics (fat vs protein and composition) and
      their physical properties (solid vs liquid), the timing (pre-load vs coingestion) and finally
      the individual glucose tolerance status. The effect on 5 h glucose excursions of a
      combination of protein and fat given before carbohydrate is still unknown.
