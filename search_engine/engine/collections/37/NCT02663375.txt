    
      The SAVI2 registry is a single arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized and open
      registry up to 1 year follow-up with the Symetis ACURATE TA™.

      The ACURATE TA™ is an aortic bioprosthesis for minimal invasive implantation via transapical
      access to treat patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis where conventional aortic
      valve replacement (AVR) via open surgery is considered to be associated with high surgical
      risk.

      The primary objectives of the registry is to further evaluate the safety and performance of
      the implantation and the safety at 30-Day Follow-up.
