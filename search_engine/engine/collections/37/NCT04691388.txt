      the innate immune escape mechanism, allowing them to grow and survive. Different from the
      inherent resistance mechanism, some patients who initially responded to immune checkpoint
      inhibitors developed disease progression after a period of treatment and follow-up,
      suggesting acquired resistance. Therefore, clinical strategies continue to be applied to
      overcome inherent and acquired resistance to improve the clinical efficacy of immune
      checkpoint inhibitors. Combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with another drug that has
      both immune regulation and anti-tumor properties can enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of any
      one drug when used alone. Studies have shown that tumor angiogenesis participates in
      anti-tumor immune regulation and will aggravate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment,
      and anti-angiogenesis therapy can normalize the abnormal vascular structure and function of
      tumors, and help the recruitment and infiltration of effector T cells. , Reduce the
      accumulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, relieve the immunosuppressive state,
      thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. The combination of anti-angiogenic drugs and
      immune checkpoint inhibitors has become a promising treatment strategy.
