      aid in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A glove device produces non-painful sensory
      (tactile) vibratory stimulation to the fingertips of Parkinson's patients. Participants will
      either be randomized to receive the real stimulation, or fake ("sham") stimulation. This will
      help investigators compare durability and efficacy of the tactile stimulation to current
      medical therapy. Participants randomized to the "sham" arm will be allowed to receive the
      real stimulation after 3 months of follow-up. All patients will be followed for total of 6
      months (both real and sham stimulation groups). If the results of this study suggest that
      vibrotactile CR stimulation is safe and effective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,
      this non-invasive treatment approach would have a substantial impact on Parkinson's disease.
