      premedication protocol (premedication patient data management system, PDMS). A total of 2000
      adult patients are randomly selected who were seen in the premedication outpatient clinic of
      Klinikum rechts der Isar between June 2018 and June 2020. The information from the
      premedication questionnaire will be transferred to a new premedication module. The new
      premedication software then outputs the appropriate guideline recommendations that would have
      been applicable in the particular case. Using a logic stored in this system, the current
      guideline recommendations of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) (De Hert, Staender
      et al. 2018) and the recommendations of the German Society for Anesthesiology and Intensive
      Care Medicine (DGAI) (Geldner 2017) that apply to the respective case are pointed out on the
      basis of the patient data entered, for example the recommendation to discontinue or change
      medication or the order of additional examinations such as pulmonary function testing or
      echocardiography.

      By comparison with the old premedication sheet, it is determined which guideline
      recommendations were followed and which were not. The respective guideline recommendations
      and their compliance or non-compliance are transferred to a table for further evaluation. A
      random sample of 2000 patients will be studied.

      Guideline adherence to each recommendation is determined, as well as the possible
      organizational reasons for not following them.
