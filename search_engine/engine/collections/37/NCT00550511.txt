      abdominal pain is quite common in Continental Europe and USA. It is considered to be
      implemented at emergency departments all over Sweden. This is the first randomized study
      performed to evaluate the method. In our study we compare diagnostic accuracy and further
      management of patients admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain, with or
      without examination with surgeon-performed ultrasound bedside.
