      including the availability of a genetics counselor for women at risk for hereditary cancer,
      especially ovarian cancer; to provide referrals for diagnostic tests and appropriate clinics
      involved in early detection of cancer; to provide access to clinical trials and
      investigational screening methods in cancer early detection and prevention, whenever
      applicable; to provide women with educational materials; to develop a database of information
      compiled from the questionnaires and clinics for use in future studies; to create a registry
      of family history data from women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who attend our
      clinic, i.e. who perceive themselves to be at increased risk of breast or gynecologic
      cancers.Women that participate in the study will be interviewed and asked to fill out a
      questionnaire. An assessment will then be made based on their information. Based on this
      assessment, women will be referred to the appropriate clinic or for diagnostic testing or
      provided with information regarding available protocol studies.
