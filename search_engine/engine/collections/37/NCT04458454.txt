      effectiveness of invitro fertilization protocols. The hormone plays an important role in the
      processes of folliculogenesis, growth and maturation of oocytes, development of embryos,
      implantation processes, pregnancy and childbirth. A pilot study was conducted on a group of
      patients undergoing infertility treatment using assisted reproductive technologies in the
      superovulation stimulation protocol using gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonists. Blood
      and follicular fluid samples were obtained on the day of transvaginal follicular puncture.
      The results allow us to consider the hormone relaxin as a promising predictor of the result
      of ovarian stimulation, the effectiveness of fertilization in IVF cycles.
