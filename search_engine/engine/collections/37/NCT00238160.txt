        -  Compare the efficacy of surgical resection with vs without postoperative hepatic
           arterial chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor
           thrombus.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade
      of portal invasion and Child-Pugh classification. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo macroscopic curative resection. Within 28 days after surgery,
           patients without post-surgery complications undergo hepatic arterial infusion comprising
           fluorouracil and cisplatin on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment continues for 6
           months.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo macroscopic curative resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
