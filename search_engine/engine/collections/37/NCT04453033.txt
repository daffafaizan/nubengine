      week 13 and week 26. The Celeste specialized phototherapy device is similar to a tablet with
      a stand that allows the device to be angled towards the participant's face. The light is to
      be used each evening in the home for 1 hour, while the participant watches TV, eats dinner,
      reads, etc. The primary outcome measure is Parts 1 and 2 of the Movement Disorders
      Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 and 2
      measure non-motor and motor function in Parkinson's. Participants will be assessed via online
