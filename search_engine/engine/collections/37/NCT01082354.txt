    
      The term "small for gestational age" (SGA) is a pathological medical condition known since
      about two decades supported by two consensus conferences of 2001. It inhibits the height
      and/or weight of the child at birth without prejudging the mechanisms that alter these. This
      study will be carried out by hospital pediatricians, endocrinologists or physicians in
      private, mixed private and hospital practice in metropolitan France. Subjects will be
      monitored by doctors in accordance with the normal scope of follow-up of pathology until
      their final growth and until they reach adult height and/or until the treatment is
      discontinued. The participating doctors will include all the short SGA subjects coming for
      consultation or the follow-up (for less than 12 months) of their treatment by Saizen in this
      study. The inclusions will take place over a period of 21 months.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To describe the characteristics of short children born SGA (SGA subjects) treated with
           Saizen

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the terms and conditions for the prescription of Saizen in terms of dosage,
           duration of treatment, reason for discontinuation and compliance

        -  To describe the effects of Saizen on growth and final height

        -  To describe the tolerance of Saizen. For each subject and during each visit, the
           participating doctor will complete an electronic data collection form.
