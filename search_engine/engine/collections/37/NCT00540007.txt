      classical HL (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL). Progress has been made in
      cHL therapy resulting in 5-year failure free survival rates between 61%-89% even in the
      setting of advanced stage or bulky disease. Patients who relapse however, have a variable
      prognosis ranging from a 8-year overall survival rate of less than 8% for patients who never
      achieve a remission to 54% for patients with a complete remission lasting greater than 12
      months. High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the standard of care for
      patients with relapsed cHL but for those that relapse despite aggressive salvage therapy 20 -
      50%, with median remission durations of approximately 6 months. Furthermore, a subset of
      relapsed HL patients may not be candidates for aggressive salvage regimens. These novel
      salvage therapies are needed for relapsed/refractory cHL, especially agents without serious
      late toxicities are particularly attractive in this disease. Advances in the understanding of
      HL pathogenesis and lenalidomide's mechanisms of action provide substantial rationale for
      evaluating lenalidomide in HL patients.
