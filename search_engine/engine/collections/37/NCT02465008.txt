      Surgery with cohesive silicone gel prosthesis insubpectoral plane). Remains challenging

      end the following objectives are proposed: evaluate the analgesic efficacy of L-Bupivacaine
      0.25% vs. Placebo (saline) administered irrigation into the surgical pocket bilaterally
      intraoperatively.
