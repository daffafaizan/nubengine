      on adults, and studies that focus on effective intervention strategies for youth with mood
      disorders are needed. This 8-session study is an adjunct to ongoing medication management and
      individual and family psychotherapy for children with mood disorders.

      In this study, parents learn about mood disorders, their treatments, and how to work
      effectively with mental health and school systems. Parents also practice problem-solving and
      communication skills for symptom management. Children learn about mood disorders and their
      treatments, including basic cognitive-behavioral principles. Children also learn and practice
      anger management, problem-solving, and communication skills.

      Patients and their families are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The first group receives
      8 sessions of psychoeducation plus treatment as usual (TAU). The second group is a wait-list
      control in which participants receive only TAU. Patients and caregivers undergo a variety of
      interviews, tests, and behavioral observations throughout the study. Anxiety, depression,
      psychosocial stressors, manic symptoms, and children's experiences with psychotropic
      medications and with treatment or service providers are assessed. Caregivers, teachers, and
      family friends undergo interviews and make observations of the patient's level of support,
      general appearance and behavior, and overall functional capacity. The extent to which
      caregivers agree on the need for treatment and the extent of caregivers' knowledge of mood
      disorders is also assessed. Assessments occur at 3, 6, 12, 15, and 18 months after study
      enrollment. A comprehensive assessment is conducted at study entry and 1 year later.
