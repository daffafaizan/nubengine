      (CGM).

      In the second segment of the study, participants will be randomized into two groups:
      antibiotics or placebo, they will consume the pills for 7 days.

      In the third segment, participants will undergo a Fecal Microbiota Transplant/placebo
      administration. Subjects will be NPO at least 4 h before and for 1 hour following capsule
      intake, to minimize the risk of vomiting during ingestion of capsules. In the event of
      vomiting, patients will not be re-dosed. All patients will be evaluated after taking capsules
      by the study investigators and observed for 15 minutes. Phone follow up and assessment using
      open-ended questions and a standardized adverse event grading scale will take place 24-48hrs
      after the administration.

      Throughout the study, participants will collect stool and buccal samples which will be used
      for microbiota profiling.

      In study meetings, anthropometric measurements, medical history, GI symptoms questioner,
      blood samples, urine samples, and Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be taken. Participants
      will also perform an extensive set of physical abilities test.
