      those with PTSD. Problematic anger is associated with significant functional impairment. One
      of the mechanisms associated with problematic anger and aggression is hostile interpretation
      bias, i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous interpersonal situations as hostile. The
      investigator has previously developed and piloted a computer-based interpretation bias
      modification intervention that successfully reduces both hostile interpretation bias and
      anger outcomes. In the current project, the investigators will pilot-test a mobile
      application version of the existing computer-based intervention, entitled Mobile Intervention
      for Reducing Anger (MIRA), among Veterans with PTSD and problematic anger. The project will
      compare the MIRA app to a contact control condition to evaluate the feasibility of
      recruitment, randomization, and retention procedures. The investigators will also utilize
      psychophysiological and electronic diary monitoring to determine whether this assessment
      could be used as an outcome or mechanistic variable in a subsequent randomized clinical trial
      application focused on evaluating the efficacy of the MIRA intervention.
