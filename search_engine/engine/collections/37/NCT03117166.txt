      attempt during implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) among patients
      who receive a standard dose of intravenous lidocaine (for attenuation of pain associated with
      propofol injection) versus patients who do not receive an intravenous lidocaine dose.

      During implantation of an ICD, defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing is performed. DFT is
      calibrated as the lowest energy delivered by the ICD that will successfully terminate
      malignant arrhythmia. Lidocaine, a routine anesthetic agent, is also identified as an
      antiarrhythmic drug. Experimentally, lidocaine has been shown to increase thresholds during
      DFT' testing due to the drugs dual effect. The rationale behind this project is that the
      lidocaine may yield falsely elevated DFT, resulting in higher calibration of the ICD device.
      This alteration can affect ICD battery and overall ICD life. Comparisons between study groups
      may elucidate effects of IV lidocaine on DFT.
