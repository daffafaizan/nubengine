      compared to the Withings Move on both patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization over
      6 months and up to 1 year. Our research method will employ a patient-centered health data
      sharing platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 150 total patients
      after they receive elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for treatment of atrial
      fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of atrial fibrillation). A total of
      50 patients at each of 3 clinical sites, Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, and Duke
      Health before they undergo DCCV. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive the Apple
      Watch Series 6, while half will receive a control device (Withings Move). Patients will then
      be queried about specific symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and medication adherence
      monthly. This project will provide novel and needed post-market data about the Apple Watch
      Series 6 ECG and irregular rhythm detection notification features and, on a larger scale,
      help delineate the impact of an innovative digital health technology on real-world patient
      outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of using the Apple Watch ECG and irregular rhythm
      notification features on patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization after patients
      receive cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of
      atrial fibrillation).

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG compared to physician
      interpretation of 12-lead ECGs obtained in routine clinical care.
