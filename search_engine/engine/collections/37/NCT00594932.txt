    
      Patients and Methods:

      27 patients with active BILAG B or A arthritis, with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints
      entered a six month study of MMF vs placebo for three months followed by open label MMF. 14
      patients (12 women and 2 men) received placebo at baseline and 13 patients (11 women and 2
      men) received MMF. Primary Outcome was Major Clinical Response at 3 months, then all patients
      received open label Cellcept for another 3 months. Blood was drawn for safety, lupus disease
      activity measures and exploratory Biomarkers, Joint counts were performed monthly. At
      baseline background DMARDs were stopped. Plaquenil was allowed. All patients received 160 mg
      depomedrol at baseline and were allowed 80 mg shots at subsequent months after blood draws
      and procedures had been completed.

      DEFINITION of RESPONSE

      Prespecified Primary Endpoint: Complete Clinical Response:

      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.25 or less of tender +swollen jt
      counts

      Prespecified Secondary Endpoint: Partial response:

      One letter drop in musculoskeletal by Week 12 OR decrease to 0.5 or less tender + swollen jt
      counts

      Exploratory Measure (not prespecified): Major Clinical Response:

      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.5 or less of tender +swollen jt
      counts. (In the primary analysis the one patient who met this endpoint was designated as a
      partial responder since those prespecified criteria were also met.

      Non response:

      Does not meet above criteria for complete or partial response

      Additional Measures: (prespecified secondary endpoints) included joint counts, changes in
      BILAG and SLEDAI and physician and patient global assessments.
