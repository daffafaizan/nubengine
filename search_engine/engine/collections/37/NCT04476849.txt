      Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP)
      administration on Day 1. Eligible participants with mild, moderate and severe renal function
      and healthy participants with normal renal function will be admitted to the clinical unit on
      Day -1 and will be residential for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1,
      participants will receive a single oral dose of fezolinetant under fasting conditions
      followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and urine sampling period. Participants are to remain
      awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least
      four hours postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted.
      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all
      required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer
      stay in the clinical unit.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation from
      the study.
