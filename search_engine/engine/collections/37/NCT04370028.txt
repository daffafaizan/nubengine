      collected from patients to whom Divaza is prescribed to be taken according to the following
      regimen: 2 tablets 3 times per day for 12 weeks.

      Neurologists assess the patients' cognitive functions with MoCA scale before starting therapy
      with Divaza (visit 1) and 12 weeks after the treatment (visit 2).

      The efficacy of Divaza for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic
      cerebral ischemia (CCI) is evaluated.

      Safety is assessed based on the frequency and severity of adverse events. In addition, the
      relationship between MoCA test performance and gender or regional social and economic factors
      is evaluated.
