      (NSAIDs) but they do not reverse the basic pathology of disease, rather may accelerate it,
      like degeneration of cartilage, inhibition of chondroitin synthesis and suppression of
      proteoglycans synthesis by the chondrocyte.

      Research shows that IL-1β plays a fundamental role in osteoarthritis pathophysiology and
      cartilage destruction. Diacerein, a purified compound with anthraquinonic structure, inhibits
      IL-1β, retarding all pathological processes initiated in OA. Also, Diacerein has proven
      analgesic efficacy comparable to that of diclofenac in patients of osteoarthritis knee12.
      Because of these factors, the present study has been planned to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of diacerein as add on therapy to diclofenac sodium in Indian patients of
      symptomatic OA knee.
