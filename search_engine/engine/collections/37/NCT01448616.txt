      55 adult, healthy women who are HSV-2 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative. Women will first
      participate in a run-in phase with twice daily swabbing. Following 4 weeks of swabbing,
      participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to one of three groups: 1) oral tenofovir and placebo
      gel, 2) oral placebo and tenofovir gel, or 3) oral placebo and placebo gel. Participants will
      begin treatment and swab the genital region twice daily for 5 more weeks. Study drug will be
      administered daily.
