    
      This study is designed as a prospective study to evaluate and treat patients with parasitic
      infection. Patients with known or suspected parasitic infection will be enrolled and will be
      evaluated for the presence of a parasitic infection. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit
      will include a medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests and
      specialized diagnostic procedures for possible parasitic infections. Treatment plans will be
      individualized for each patient's particular condition, and the number and length of
      additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment
      regimens will be in accordance with standard medical practice.
