    
      Patients are randomly assigned to the three groups: 1) peroral hydration, 2) Na bicarbonate
      (NaHCO3), and 3) NaHCO3 plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion The first group of patients
      receives standard peroral hydration of 1500 ml water on the day of the procedure.

      The second group receives 3 mL/kg/hour of Na bicarbonate, an hour prior to angiography and 1
      mL/kg/hour, within six hours after angiography.

      The third group receives parenteral NAC (1200 mg twice a day) one day before angiography, on
      the day of the angiography, and one day after the diagnostic procedure in addition to Na
      bicarbonate solution on the day of the angiography.

      The low-osmolar iodinated contrast agent was used.
