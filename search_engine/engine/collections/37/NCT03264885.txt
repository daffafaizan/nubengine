    
      A randomized controlled study individuals with VI with baseline visual acuity (VA) and
      vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) assessed in the community. Participants were
      randomised to either receiving ICS or usual care (UC). ICS is a novel intervention that
      incorporates patient education, social support, and financial assistance to assist
      individuals. Participants in UC received a standard GP referral letter advising them to seek
      further care. Our main outcome measure was compliance to tertiary eye-care referral. Our
      secondary outcome measure was VA and VRQoL assessed at 3 months.
