    
      This study is composed of two stages:Part I is mono-therapy dose escalation and dose
      expansion study, and Part II is the study of combination therapy.

      The dose escalation study will be conducted using Part I for testing optimal doses at 0.3,1,
      3, 10, 20, 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). An accelerated titration followed by traditional 3+3
      design will be used in this study with a 21-day dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation
      period. Based on the data of dose escalation study, determine whether to carry out dose
      escalation at frequency of every 2 weeks(Q2W) and how many cohorts will be added in dose
      expansion study.

      Based on the data of Part I, one or two doses will be conducted in the study of combination
      therapy. The study of PART II is composed of two cohorts. Cohort 1:Subjects with untreated
      CLDN18.2 positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma(G/GEJAC) will be treated
      with MIL93 and standard first-line chemotherapy.Cohort 2:Subjects with untreated CLDN18.2
      positive pancreatic cancer will be treated with MIL93 and standard first-line chemotherapy.
