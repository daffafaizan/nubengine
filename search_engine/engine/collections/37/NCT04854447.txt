      single-vision spectacles on myopic progression. 30 myopic subjects, aged 6-16 years old, with
      a spherical equivalent refraction between -0.50D and -6.00D, were recruited. A random number
      table was used to allocate participants into either a) part-time use of single-vision
      spectacles, or b) full-time use of single-vision spectacles. Part-time use was for 4-6 hours
      a day, 7 days a week for a year. Clinical assessment included follow-up at 6 months and at 12
      months upon allocation. The primary outcomes were a) change in spherical equivalent
      refraction (SER) measured by cycloplegic autorefraction, and b) change in axial eye length
      (AL). The secondary outcomes were a) change in choroidal thickness (ChT), and b) assessment
      of the subjective tolerance.
