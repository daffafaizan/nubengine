      tolerability of ER OROS paliperidone 3 to 15 mg/day in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia.
      In addition, the long-term efficacy and effect of ER OROS paliperidone on overall functioning
      and personal and social functioning, as well as quality of life, health economics, and
      subjective sleep measures, was explored. This open-label extension study followed a
      recurrence prevention study (R076477-SCH-301) that had both an open-label
      run-in/stabilization phase and a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase.

      Open-label study drug (ER OROS paliperidone 3 mg to 15 mg/day) was administered for 52 weeks.
