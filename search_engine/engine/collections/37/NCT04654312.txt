      hydrochlorothiazide (HCT).

      The underlying pilot study examins, if the intake of HCT leads to increased dermal
      photosensitivity and in combination with UV-exposition to a DNA-damage of the skin.

      Up until today, there is no prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating
      the impact of HCT on dermal photosensitivity in greater detail. Our pilot trial is designed
      as feasibility study to clarify the impact of HCT on dermal photosensitivity. This may
      facilitate evidence-based recommendations as to whether or not HCT increases the risk for
      skin cancer. Of note, HCT is one of most frequently prescribed drugs in Germany.
