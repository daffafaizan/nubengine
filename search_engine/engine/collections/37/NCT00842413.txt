      the one hand, its role in conscious visual perception, and on the other hand, the part it may
      play in the perception and imitation of other people's movements. Healthy subjects will be
      compared with subjects suffering from focal lesions within the premotor cortex, on two tasks:
      in the first task, the subjects will have to make a decision concerning the absence or
      presence of a visual item in their field of vision. They will make (virtual) bets based on
      the subjective certainty of their perceptions - they will be told that these bets are purely
      virtual, and will not result in any financial gain or loss. This study will help us
      understand the contribution of the prefrontal cortex to subjective weighing of perceptual
      certainty. In the second task, the subjects will imitate a finger movement, based either on a
      fixed picture, or on a short motion picture. Previous studies have shown that whether the
      movement is copied from a fixed picture or a moving picture changes reaction times and types
      of mistakes. Neuroimaging studies have shown that a premotor area is involved in this effect.
      The comparison of brain-damaged and healthy subjects will tell us what exactly the
      contribution of the prefrontal consists in.
