    
      This is a single centre, prospective, non randomised, non controlled, pilot study of the
      potential abnormality of a new test group of patients in whom the results are postulated to
      be abnormal.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To measure IL-4 by a new rapid on-site technique in patients with documented coronary
           artery disease presenting in a variety of acute clinical circumstances

        2. To evaluate any abnormal measurements in relation to the severity of the disease, acute
           vascular complication and newly prescribed medications.

      It is proposed to study 4 small groups of patients with ischemic heart disease.

        1. Patients with unstable coronary artery disease admitted to the Coronary Care Unit. They
           will be studied on admission and then daily until coronary angiography is performed.

        2. Patients having coronary angioplasty. They will be studied before, immediately after and
           24 hours after the procedure.

        3. Patients having coronary artery bypass grafting will be studied immediately after and 24
           hours post surgery.

        4. Patients with stable coronary artery disease about to receive a statin and or
           angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy will be studied before and twice weekly
           after commencement of therapy for 4 weeks.
