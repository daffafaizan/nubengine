      human body. If the tendon has to be fixed at the bone during surgery, the weak point in
      obtaining a successful surgery is the fixation of the tendon at the bone insertion site.
      Tendon belongs to the bradytrophic tissue conditional on the reduced blood flow, deep mitosis
      rate and lowered healing potential.

      The patients in this study have 60 years or more. The tissue of these patients isn't as good
      as in young patients. The patch will be used to improve the strength of the tendon at the
      insertion site and the ingrowth process of the new tissue at this area. Additionally the
      investigators can boost the healing process with a selective use of PRP (PRP = platelet rich
      plasma). In this process, the healing site is delivered with an elevated concentration of
      thrombocytes and also growth factors which are constituent parts of them.
