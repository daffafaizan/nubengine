      within mindfulness-based approaches, classically described as a weekly two-hour commitment
      which lasts eight weeks. Such approaches might reach larger and stratified groups, more
      suitable for usage in Brazilian health-system context. For such evaluations, the
      investigators will use a 3-arms randomized clinical trial design, with Sociodemographic and
      Labor variables, such as age, sex, number of offspring, adherence to the program, adherence
      to the mindfulness practices, Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire -(BCSQ-36), Maslach
      Burnout Inventory (MBI-GS), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Freiburg
      Mindfulness Inventory adapted for Brazil (FMI-Br-13), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
      (FFMQ-Br). DNA methylation will be measured by Methylase-reaction, and BDNF (brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor) will be quantified by ELISA-sandwich. The primary outcome will be the
      effectiveness of such programs on different clinical subtypes of Burnout symptoms (frenetic,
      under challenged and worn-out). The secondary outcome will be mindfulness levels, and
      adherence to the program and to the mindfulness practice, and on inflammation and epigenetic
      variables.
