      marker of the hyperactive-impulsive dimension in 120 ADHD 7-12 years, medication-free
      children. This study will characterize the effects of a single dose of atomoxetine compared
      to placebo on cognitive correlates of SICI change. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to
      either atomoxetine or placebo. The study will also characterize the effects of four weeks of
      atomoxetine treatment on cortical inhibition and will correlate SICI change with clinical
      outcomes.
