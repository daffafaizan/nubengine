      Radical therapy of symptomatic brain metastases is seldom possible and only very rarely, long
      term survival can be achieved. PCI has shown to reduce the incidence of brain metastases in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer to the same extent as in limited disease small-cell
      lung cancer. However, the exact value of PCI in stage III NSCLC patient, treated with
      contemporary chemo-radiation schedule with or without surgery, remains unsettled. Therefore
      this study is launched, in order to investigate whether PCI should become the standard of
      care in patients with stage III NSCLC who are treated with curative intention.
