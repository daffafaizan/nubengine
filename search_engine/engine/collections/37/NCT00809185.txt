    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical activity (improvement in erythroid response and/or improvement in
           other cytopenias, bone marrow morphology/cytogenetics) of RAD001(everolimus) in patients
           with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Examine laboratory correlates (S6K1 levels, angiogenesis pre- and post-treatment) and
           determine how these correlates correspond to dosing and clinical activity of
           RAD001(everolimus).

        -  Evaluate the presence of HLA-DR15 and cytotoxic T-cell populations in patients pre- and
           post-treatment and correlate this with response to treatment.

        -  Examine the incidence of the null GSTT-1 phenotype in myelodysplastic syndromes patients
           and correlate this with response to RAD001(everolimus).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral RAD001(everolimus) once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or relapse.

      Blood samples are collected periodically during study. Samples are analyzed for S6K1
      activity, effector T cells by flow cytometry, GSTT-1 by PCR, and HLA-DR15 levels.
