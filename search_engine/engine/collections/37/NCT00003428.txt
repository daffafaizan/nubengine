      advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with 1 of 2 different doses of arzoxifene
      hydrochloride. II. Compare the response rates and clinical benefit rates for patients with
      tamoxifen-sensitive versus tamoxifen-refractory disease. III. Compare the degree of toxicity
      between the 2 doses of arzoxifene hydrochloride in these patients. IV. Compare the quality of
      life and survival of these patients receiving high versus low dose arzoxifene hydrochloride.
      V. Determine the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, and response
      duration of this treatment in these patients. VII. Measure changes in serum estradiol,
      follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone binding globulin in these
      patients during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified according to
      number of metastatic sites (less than 3 vs 3 or more), tamoxifen sensitivity (sensitive vs
      refractory), and degree of estrogen receptor positivity (high vs low vs unknown). Patients
      are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of arzoxifene hydrochloride. Patients receive
      arzoxifene hydrochloride orally once daily for 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence
      of toxicity and disease progression. Quality of life is assessed before, during, and at the
      completion of the study. Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, at 30 days after
      the last treatment, and every 2-3 months after the last treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 104-114 patients.
