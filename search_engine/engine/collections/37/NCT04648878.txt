    
      This prospective randomized control trial with three treatment arms will begin by:

        -  Determining if the subject is a candidate for exoskeleton treatment.

        -  Randomly assigning subjects to three groups (physical therapy only, exoskeleton only, or
           a hybrid of physical therapy and exoskeleton).

        -  Body measurements to individualize the fit of the exoskeleton to each subject at each
           session.

        -  Activities-based balance confidence (ABC) questionnaire will be administered before and
           after the study begins.

        -  Timed up and go test (TUGT).

        -  Ten-meter walk test (10MWT).

        -  Six-minute walk test (6MWT)

        -  Berg Balance Test (BBT).

        -  Five times sit to stand (5XSTS).

        -  Heart rate through a portable heartrate monitor.
