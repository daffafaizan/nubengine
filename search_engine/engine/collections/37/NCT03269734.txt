      It is performed under X-ray scopy in frontal incidence with possible variations of the
      angulation of the arch to optimize the visualization of vessels 'origin (brachiocephalic
      trunk, left and right common carotid arteries, subclavian arteries).

      Before the beginning of catheterization, a conventional arterial roadmap with iodine
      injection is usually performed. The Vessel Navigator (VN) developed by Philips allows the use
      of pre-acquired angio-scan or angio-MRI image by superimposing it (X-ray Fusion) on X-ray
      scopy to provide the arterial tracing (Fusion Roadmap).

      An angio-MRI (Philips 3 Tesla MRI) imaging of the aortic arch will be first performed (as
      part of preoperative assessment or systematic follow-up of aneurysms or arteriovenous
      malformations). A first operator will perform the arteriography under the usual conditions
      without using the VN. A second operator will have access to the fusion imaging and will
      assess the accuracy of the coregistration. Snapshots will be taken by the second operator.
