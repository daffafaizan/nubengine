      over the last decades due to implementation of multimodal cancer therapies such as
      radiotherapy or combined radiochemotherapy. Surgery, however, still is the mainstay of
      curative treatment options for this cancer entity. Due to the significant improvement in
      surgical technique and perioperative management, the postoperative mortality rate has fallen
      to about 5% with an estimated 5-year survival of 35%. Nevertheless, patients after
      esophagectomy are at high risk for local recurrence especially within the first 2 years after
      treatment. Independent risk factors for the development of carcinoma recurrence are
      incomplete resection (R1), extracapsular lymph node involvement and postoperative
      complications. Exfoliated, malignant cells remaining in luminal organs like the esophagus or
      colorectum could present another important risk factor for local recurrence especially at the
      site of anastomosis. In the treatment of rectal cancer, data have shown, that intraoperative
      rectal washout significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence from about 10% to 5%. For
      this reason, rectal washout during anterior resection has become a standard in many surgical
      institutions. Besides agents like cetrimide, sodium hypochlorite, formalin or saline,
      povidone-iodine has also been used for rectal mucosal application in prospective studies.
      Questions arise, weather similar positive outcomes could be achieved in esophageal surgery.
      The investigators hypothesize that esophageal washout with a povidone-iodine solution
      (BetaisodonaÂ®, Mundipharma) reduces the risk of local carcinoma recurrence after radical
      resection.
