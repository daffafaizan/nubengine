      mutation truncates the cystic fibrosis transductive regulator (CFTR) protein production by
      introducing a premature stop in the messenger RNA (mRNA), this type of mutation is known as a
      stop mutation. Ataluren is a novel, oral drug that promotes this gene to work effectively and
      readthrough that premature "stop sign". It is hypothesized that ivacaftor may increase the
      efficacy of Ataluren by activating a specific protein that may not be functioning properly.
