      patients with locoregional advanced head and neck cancers.

      This study evaluates the outcome of induction chemotherapy (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU)
      followed by radiation therapy + Erbitux for patients with head and neck carcinoma with almost
      one measurable lesion by RMI or CT scan.

      We hope we can improve the progression free survival of 14% at two years .
