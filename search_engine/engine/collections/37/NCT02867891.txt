      with Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in relapse of FLT3-ITD+ Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The investigators therefore
      launched an observational multicenter trial. The outcomes are assessed in 4 pre-defined
      groups of individuals according to the therapeutic intervention (chemotherapy-alone-group,
      chemotherapy/DLI group, sorafenib alone group and sorafenib/DLI group). The specific
      interventions to the subjects of the study are assigned by the individual transplant center.
      The investigators will determine the outcome of each group by monitoring the survival and the
      response rates (complete remission, disease burden reduction, no response) of patients with
      FLT3-ITD AML relapse after allo-HSCT.
