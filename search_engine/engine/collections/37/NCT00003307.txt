      gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities in patients with primary prostate
      adenocarcinoma receiving amifostine plus fractionated radiotherapy. II. Determine the
      incidence and nature of toxicity associated with amifostine in these patients. III. Assess
      tumor response to this treatment in these patients. IV. Assess impotency rates following
      radiotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive fractionated radiotherapy five days
      per week for 7 weeks plus amifostine IV push over 5 minutes, 15 minutes before each radiation
      treatment. Patients are followed at 1 month after radiotherapy, and then every 3 months for
      at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 25 patients accrued into this study over 2 years.
