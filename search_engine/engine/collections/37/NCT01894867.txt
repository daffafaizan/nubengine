      role in many of its functions.

      There are no readily available and easy methods to assess magnesium status but it is
      estimated that magnesium deficiency is a common problem.

      Magnesium deficiency can cause a wide variety of features including hypocalcaemia,
      hypokalaemia and cardiac and neurological manifestations. Chronic low magnesium state has
      been associated with a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, coronary
      heart disease, and osteoporosis.

      There are not enough studies on magnesium status in chronic cirrhotics who may be in
      depletion. However , several studies have shown in patients magnesium deficiency with liver
      cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis showed considerably reduced muscle strength and
      muscle Mg . Magnesium may have a role in the neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric
      manifestations of chronic liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy and muscle cramps).

      The use of magnesium as a therapeutic agent in asthma, myocardial infarction, and
      pre-eclampsia is also discussed. We suggest addition of magnesium to patients with
      established cirrhosis in order to reduce the neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric
      manifestations of chronic liver disease.
