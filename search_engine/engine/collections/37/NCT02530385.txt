      human metabolism. In this study, subjects will receive FMT capsules from lean metabolically
      healthy donors to study effects on body weight and insulin sensitivity. Subjects who
      participate will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active FMT capsules or placebo capsules.
      Subjects and providers will be blinded to treatment assignment. The study will last for 24
      weeks. Subjects will be asked to come to MGH for a baseline visit at week 0, return for 6
      weekly visits and come back at week 12. Major study outcomes include change in weight,
      insulin sensitivity, and body composition. Fecal samples will also be collected for
      intestinal microbiome analysis.
