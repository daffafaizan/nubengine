      anticipate enrolling 40 study subjects. Treatment Procedures: Following initial treatment
      planning discussions between the dentists and their patients regarding all of their dental
      treatment options, those patients who opt to have dental implants placed will be approached
      to discuss participation in the current study. Before entry into the study, the Investigator
      or an authorized member of the investigational staff will explain to potential subjects the
      aims, methods, reasonable anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any
      discomfort it may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and
      that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that
      choosing not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the
      treatment of their condition. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available
      and that if they decline to take part in the present study that such a refusal will not
      prejudice future treatment. Those patients who are willing to participate will be scheduled
      for their initial and follow-up dental implant visits at the School of Dentistry. At the
      baseline visit the study outcome data will be collected; including: 1) measuring the
      bone-ridge width, before and after implant site preparation (drilling); 2) intraoral
      photographs of the prepared opening; 3) dental implant torque readings will be obtained; and
      4) ISQ as measure of both initial and the dynamic development of osseointegration (the
      formation of a direct interface between the dental implant and bone) over time. The ISQ
      measurements will be collected again at three and six-weeks post treatment.
