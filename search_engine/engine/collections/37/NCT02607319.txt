      more consecutive In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles despite the transfer of good quality
      embryos, is a major cause of distress amongst infertile couples. While factors underlying
      implantation failure are many, most cases remain unexplained. In order to improve pregnancy
      outcomes and delivery rates in women with unexplained RIF, various investigational treatments
      have been proposed.

      The investigators propose a prospective controlled randomized comparative study to evaluate
      the effect of Bemiparin on implantation rates in women with unexplained RIF. A total of 200
      patients will be recruited and randomized between two groups. The study group will receive
      Bemiparin plus standard care; while the control group will receive only standard care.
      Treatment will start on the day following embryo transfer and will be continued until 12
      weeks gestation in the event of pregnancy.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of Bemiparin on implantation rate in women
      with unexplained recurrent implantation failure.
