      cardiac safety study in 48 healthy subjects (both male and female subjects) designed to
      assess the effect of FDKP on cardiac repolarization, if any, following introduction of
      TechnosphereÂ® Inhalation Powder via inhalation. Each trial subject will be administered 20 mg
      of FDKP, 40 mg of FDKP, 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin (active), and placebo in a crossover
      design during an 11 day in-patient stay.
