      microbiota which can increase gut permeability affect the antigen presentation to the immune
      system. Synbiotic supplementation is expected to improve immune system, gut permeability, and
      gut microbiota in patients with connective tissue disease.

      The subjects who fulfill inclusion criteria, willing to participate and sign informed consent
      will be randomized into two groups: the group receiving synbiotic containing probiotic
      (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 60%, Bifidobacterium infantis R0033 20%, dan Bifidobacterium
      bifidum R0071 20%) and 80 mg fructooligosaccharide (group I, n=23) and the group receiving
      placebo (group II, n=23). Both groups receive intervention for two months. Patients continue
      to receive their immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate
      mofetil, azathioprine, or cyclosporine).

      Percentage of FOXP3 Regulatory T-cells, serum IL-17, zonulin, high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein, and gut microbiota are evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study. FOXP3
      regulatory T-cell is evaluated by flowcytometry. Serum IL-17 and zonulin are measured by
      ELISA. Gut microbiota is evaluated using 16s ribosomal RNA gene next generation sequencing.
      The DNA from the stool is isolated by DNA stool mini kit (QIAamp).

      The results are presented in mean Â± standard deviation, median (IQR 25-75%) and n (%). The
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to determine the normality of the data, assuming the
      normality of the data is fulfilled if p> 0.05. Bivariate analysis uses paired T test if the
      data has normal distribution. If the distribution is not normal, Wilcoxon test will be used.
      Differences are said to be significant when the value of p <0.05.
