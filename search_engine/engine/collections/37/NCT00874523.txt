      comprising a minimum of three agents from at least two drug classes. There are problems with
      the current recommendations for although treatments are effective, their success is often
      limited by tolerability, adverse effects and the need to take many pills. Antiretroviral
      adherence remains vital and regimens should be simplified wherever possible to facilitate
      maximal adherence. The recent availability of the potent HIV integrase inhibitor,
      raltegravir, provides an opportunity to explore moves away from current regimen components.
      Evidence to support the use of novel regimens must be generated through adequately powered
      randomized clinical trials. However, before such trials can be undertaken, preliminary data
      to define the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of these regimens are needed to
      minimize unnecessary risk for participants. This eight week study will investigate the
      steady-state pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety and efficacy of two dosing strategies
      (once and twice daily) of raltegravir plus atazanavir in treatment experienced HIV-infected
      adults.
