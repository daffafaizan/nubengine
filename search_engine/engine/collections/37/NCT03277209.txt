    
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label, Phase I, dose escalation trial of
      plerixafor in patients with histological documentation of advanced pancreatic, high grade
      serous ovarian or colorectal adenocarcinoma. We will investigate the feasibility of
      administering plerixafor in terms of safety, and will try to identify the proof of mechanism
      in patients. This trial will follow the standard 3+3, Phase I trial design, leading to a
      treatment expansion phase to confirm the RP2D.
