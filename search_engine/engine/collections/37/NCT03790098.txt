      yoga randomized trial (24 classes, held twice per week) for women aged 60 or older who
      experience chronic pain; and (2) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of restorative-flow yoga
      to decrease pain and inflammation among women aged 60 or older. Feasibility measures will
      include three areas of focus (a) acceptability, (b) implementation, and (c) demand and use,
      evaluated using recruitment rate, retention rate, class and home practice adherence rates,
      resource utilization, and safety. With a sample size of 40, this pilot feasibility study is
      likely under-powered to determine intervention effects. However, the study will evaluate
      preliminary efficacy of the yoga intervention. The study will measure BMI, blood pressure,
      resting heart rate, physical function measures, and inflammatory markers C-reactive protein,
      IL-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) at baseline and outcome assessments (after 24
      class sequence).
