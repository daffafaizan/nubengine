      unresectable colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver treated with isolated hepatic
      perfusion with melphalan followed by postoperative hepatic arterial chemotherapy.

      II. Determine the patterns of recurrence in this patient population with this treatment
      regimen.

      III. Evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate health related quality of life and determine whether baseline correlates with
      the length of survival.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery and hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion with
      melphalan given intra-arterially over 60 minutes.

      At six weeks post-hepatic perfusion, patients receive floxuridine and leucovorin calcium
      intra-arterially as a continuous infusion over 14 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to study and then at each followup visit. Patients are
      followed every 3-4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months thereafter or until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
