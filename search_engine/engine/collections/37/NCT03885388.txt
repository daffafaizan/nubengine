      patients. However, there are also more and more clinical evidences showing that the
      International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology（FIGO）/world health organization (WHO)
      system is not so perfect. The main problem is that a considerable number of patients are
      resistant to initial chemotherapy, 25-35% occur in low risk (≤ 6 points), and 70-80% occur in
      patients with a score of 5-6 points. According to reference, the drug resistance factors
      include high HCG level before chemotherapy, metastatic foci, histological diagnosis of
      choriocarcinoma, etc. However, according to the score before 2000, there is a moderate risk
      score group with 4-6 points, i.e. most of the single drug resistance to the initial regimen
      occurs in the previous moderate risk score group.Therefore, most scholars believe that there
      are grey areas with a score of 5-6. According to the analysis of 5-6 scores in the scoring
      system, the prognosis of single-drug chemotherapy is poor, and the initial remission rate is
      only about 30-40%. Therefore, many authors call for the current staging scoring system to be
      revised to a more accurate model so that some patients who may be drug resistant can adopt
      more effective plans at the beginning of treatment.

      In this study, the investigators plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter randomized
      controlled study to compare the clinical efficacy and toxicity response of combination
      MTX+ACTD multi-course regimen in low-risk GTN patients with score 5-6 with standard MTX
      single-drug multi-course regimen. The experiment arm of the trial is multi-course combination
      of MTX and ACTD. The primary endpoint is complete remission rate of primary treatment or
      failure of primary treatment. Drug toxicity is surveillanced.
