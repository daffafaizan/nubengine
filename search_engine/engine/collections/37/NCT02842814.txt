      course. For patients in remission, glucocorticoid (GC) is used to be maintained in a low dose
      for a long time in fear of disease flare. Long-term GC could bring a lot of side-effects even
      in a low dose. Whether and when patients with stable disease should withdraw GC? How about
      the relapse risk? What are the risk factors for disease flare? All the above remain unclear.
      The aim of this study is to explore the relapse risk after GC withdrawal in SLE patients with
      stable disease and to establish a predictive model for risk stratification. Meanwhile the
      investigators aim to testify the effects of hydroxychloroquine in preventing SLE relapse.
      This study is an open-labeled randomized controlled clinical trial.
