    
      Objective- To evaluate the effect of 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 of epinephrine on
      hemodynamic measures and bleeding in the surgical field in patients undergoing nasal surgery
      compared to 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000.

      Recruitment plan- Patients undergoing general anesthetic for nasal surgery (septoplasty or
      sinus surgery) will be asked to participate in this study. All patients undergoing nasal
      surgery are injected with local anesthetic into the nasal mucosa after induction of general
      anesthetic. Those patients who agree to participate in the study will be randomized into 2
      groups (injection either 1 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 or 1:200,000 of epinephrine).

      Procedures

        1. Patients will be put to sleep following standard general anesthetic protocol

        2. Patients will be injected with either 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 or 1% lidocaine with
           1:200,000 into the nasal mucosa

        3. After injection the following will be measured every 15 minutes for the first hour to
           evaluate effectiveness of the local anesthetic.

             1. Heart rate

             2. Blood pressure

             3. Routine ECG monitoring

             4. MAP (mean arterial pressure)

             5. Surgical field, degree of bleeding.

      Alternatives- Subjects can refuse to participate in the study. If subjects refuse to
      participate in the study they will still be injected with 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 of
      epinephrine which is standard of care

      Data analysis- data will be compiled and statistical analysis will be made using PRISM
      software.
