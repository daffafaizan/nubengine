      I. To compare aspiration in oropharyngeal carcinoma patients that underwent transoral robotic
      surgery (TORS) vs. chemoradiotherapy (CRT) via an objective instrument, the modified barium
      swallow (MBS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare patient-perceived swallowing function of oropharyngeal carcinoma patients that
      underwent TORS vs. CRT via a subjective instrument, the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory
      (MDADI) using the total MDADI score.

      II. To compare patient-perceived swallowing function of oropharyngeal carcinoma patients that
      underwent TORS vs. CRT via a second subjective instrument, the Eating Assessment Tool
      (EAT-10) using the total EAT-10 score.

      III. To estimate the correlation between the maximum Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) score
      and MDADI total score in TORS or CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patients regardless of treatment
      modality.

      IV. To estimate the correlation between the maximum PAS score and EAT-10 total score in TORS
      or CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patients regardless of treatment modality.

      V. To estimate the correlation between MDADI total score and EAT-10 total score in TORS or
      CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patients regardless of treatment modality.

      VI. To estimate cervical esophageal stricture diameters after TORS vs. CRT via an objective
      instrument, the MBS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo the modified barium swallow, comprising swallowing boluses of thin liquid
      barium, barium honey, barium pudding, and barium crackers while undergoing fluoroscopic
      imaging.
