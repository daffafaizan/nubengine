    
      Multiple Sclerosis (ME) is a degenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune demyelinating disease
      of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelination due to inflammation and
      degeneration of the myelin sheaths enveloping nerves of the eye, periventricular grey matter,
      brain, spinal cord and brainstem. The symptoms associated with MS include symptomatic
      fatigue, muscle weakness, ataxia, mobility and balance problems or cognitive problems.
      Resistance training has been shown to improve strength, sleep quality and mobility in persons
      with MS.
