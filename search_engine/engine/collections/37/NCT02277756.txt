    
      Adults with autism without intellectual disability (IQ > 85) are matched with members of
      siblings and control group (sex and chronological age).

      Pain reactivity (Visual analog scale,endogenous modulation systems, salivary cortisol,
      automatic nervous system and behavioral responses to thermal stimulation assessed by an
      inspired behavior scale.) in adult with autism is tested using an experimental model of pain.
      Excitatory and inhibitory modulation systems were elicited using a temporal summation test
      administered before and after activation of the Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) by
      means of a cold-pressor test.

      Demographic and clinical data are also collected (sensory profile, sleep disorders and
      depression inventory).
