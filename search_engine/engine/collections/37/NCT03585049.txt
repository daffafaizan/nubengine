      samples that are primarily taken for routine wet mount microscopic diagnostics in a
      vulvovaginal clinic at the Women's health center, Ramat-Eshkol, Jerusalem.

      In order to create an anonymous archive of digital microscopy images, before each swab is
      disposed of, the investigator will dilute the collected discharge on the swab with 0.5ml
      Saline into an Eppendorf tube. The diluted discharge will then be applied onto the GynTools
      LTD VagX tray that is then scanned by a tabletop scanner. At this point the VagX tray will be
      washed with water, soap and both the swab and tube will be disposed of.
