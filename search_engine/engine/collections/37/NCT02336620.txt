      choice of initial fluid resuscitation. The isotonic crystalloids are including chloride-rich
      solution (eg.NSS) and balanced salt solution. Retrospective study showed normal saline can
      induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. However, no randomized
      controlled trial compare efficacy between the balanced salt solution and chloride rich
      solution.
