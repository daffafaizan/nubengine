      eligible for the study. Fifty patients who met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of
      COPD exacerbations and signed informed consent will participate in the study. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the effect of the lower respiratory tract microbiome on lung tissue
      remodeling, decreased lung function, and clinical symptoms in patients with AECOPD.

      Baseline screening includes demographic data, medical history, combined medication records,
      symptoms, signs, symptom scores, number of acute exacerbations, blood cells and inflammatory
      factors, electrocardiogram, lung function, alveolar lavage fluid microbe NGS, and safety
      observation indicators.

      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for a period of 1 year. The primary and secondary
      endpoints are as follows.

      Primary endpoint： Changes in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second) within 1
      year of follow-up

      Secondary endpoint： Changes in CAT, CCQ, mMRC scores during 1 year of follow-up Changes in
      lung function during 1 year of follow-up: FEV1 / FVC Changes in blood routine, IgE, and
      eosinophil count within 1 year of follow-up Number of hospital admissions due to acute
      exacerbation during 1 year of follow-up
