      rejections and compromise long-term graft survival. Previous studies on the role of
      alloreactive T cells in transplantation were hampered by the fact that experimental assays to
      quantify alloreactivity were technically demanding and not suitable for use in a clinical
      setting. Based on a recent development of a whole-blood assay, alloreactive T cells may be
      quantified and characterised within one day. This assay therefore provides the experimental
      basis to study the development and the role of alloreactive T cells in a clinical setting in
      patients after renal transplantation. This will be performed in a multicenter study in living
      donor renal transplant recipients where preformed alloreactivity of the recipient towards the
      living donor will be determined and associated with standard clinical parameters of graft
      function and long-term graft outcome on follow-up. In addition, the development of
      donor-specific antibodies will be analysed after transplantation. If this project was able to
      provide evidence for a role of alloreactive T cells in acute rejection episodes or long-term
      graft function, this assay may in future be used to guide individualized immunosuppressive
      drug treatment early after transplantation. It will thereby aid in distinguishing patients
      where standard immunosuppressive drug regimens are sufficient from the minor population of
      patients at high risk for rejection who will benefit from intensified drug regimens.
