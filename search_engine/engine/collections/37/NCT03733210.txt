      cancer for surgical excision. Participants than receive panitumumab-IRDye800 dye and
      89Zr-panitumumab, both by intravenous (IV) infusion, on Day 0. Participants will undergo
      89Zr-panitumumab PET/CT imaging on Day 1 to 2, and then undergo surgical resection of the
      tumor at 2 to 5 days after infusion. Participants with cancer-positive lymph nodes vs
      cancer-negative lymph nodes will be analyzed as separate cohorts. Research imaging will be
      performed intraoperatively using optical imaging devices and a high-energy gamma probe.
      Subsequently, the excised tissue will evaluated ex vivo (back table) using radioactive
      (89Zr-panitumumab) and fluorescence (panitumumab-IRDye800) imaging techniques. After surgery,
      patients are followed up at 15 and 30 days.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab (89Zr
      panitumumab) for the detection of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the number (proportion) of lymph nodes determined to be tumor positive by
      histological and/or pathological evaluation that were NOT predicted tumor-positive by 89Zr
      panitumumab labeling.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of panitumumab IRDye800 for the detection of
      tumor-involved regional lymph nodes.

      II. Determine the number (proportion) of lymph nodes determined to be tumor positive by
      histological and/or pathological evaluation that were NOT predicted tumor-positive by
      panitumumab-IRdye800 labeling.
