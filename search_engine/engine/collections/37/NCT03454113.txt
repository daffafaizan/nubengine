    
      Ellipsys Vascular Access System Registry is a non-randomized, prospective, post-market,
      multi-center registry of the Ellipsys Vascular Access System in which up to 100 patients will
      be enrolled to evaluate the use and performance of the Ellipsys Vascular Access System when
      it is used within its intended use in accordance with standard of care in a clinical setting.
      The Ellipsys Vascular Access System is intended for use to create an AV fistula via
      percutaneous access. The primary performance endpoint is Clinical Success at the 90-day
      endpoint, where Clinical Success is defined as an access site that achieves a venous diameter
      of greater than or equal to 4 mm and blood flow greater than or equal to 500 ml/min in the
      brachial artery as measured via duplex ultrasound.
