      airlines will provide access to data potentially valuable for further flight-epidemiological
      research. Data on medical emergencies / per rpk (revenue passenger kilometres) are sparse and
      often based on data from a single airline. While handling the data the regulations of the
      data protection act of the Ethic commission of the Ruhr-University Bochum are fully
      respected. As noted, evaluation of the data will be completely anonymized without any
      information regarding the airline or other details than the passengers illness.

      Preview: The results of the study specified above will be submitted for publication in a peer
      review and Medline listed journal.

      Study Design: Retrospective, epidemiological study for the evaluation of medical and surgical
      emergencies on board airliners.

      Patients: In the context of a retrospective study approximately 20,000 patient data from 32
      European airlines are collected and statistically evaluated.

      Documentation: The direct documentation takes place through project responsible person into
      an electronic statistical data base.
