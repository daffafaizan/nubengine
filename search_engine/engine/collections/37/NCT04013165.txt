    
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a village-based multilevel
      intervention for late-life depression, focusing on strengthening the autonomy of
      village-dwellers with help from the community mental health service (CMHS).

      DESIGN: A community-based randomized trial with participants (all village-dwellers) assigned
      to two parallel programs: intervention program or the CMHS's usual care.

      SETTING: Two small villages in a rural area of South Korea

      PARTICIPANTS: All older adults (aged â‰¥65 years) living in the two villages were included in
      the intervention or the CMHS's usual care, and the effectiveness of the program was examined
      using representative samples who were age- and sex-stratified randomly selected from both
      groups.

      INTERVENTION: A 12-week intervention was comprised of individual-based risk-stratified case
      management and group-based activities.

      MEASUREMENTS: The Korean version of Geriatric Depression Scale-Short form (SGDS-K) was used
      as the primary outcome while depressive episodes, suicidal ideation/plans/attempts, social
      network, functional status, and global cognitive function were measured as secondary
      outcomes.
