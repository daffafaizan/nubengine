    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of IMC-A12
      (anti-insulin growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody) (cixutumumab) administered as an
      intravenous infusion once weekly in combination with CCI-779 (temsirolimus) administered
      intravenously once weekly to children with refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of IMC-A12 in combination with temsirolimus
      administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12 in combination with temsirolimus in
      children with refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of IMC-A12 and
      temsirolimus within the confines of a Phase I study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of IMC-A12 by assessing: changes in insulin-like growth
      factor receptor (IGFR) expression and phosphorylation and insulin-receptor expression and
      phosphorylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC).

      III. To assess the biological activity of temsirolimus by measuring levels of phosphorylated
      (phosphor)-ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 1 (S6K1), phosphor-protein kinase
      B (AKT), phosphor-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 1 (eIF4G) in PBMNC.

      IV. To assess the incidence of IGFR expression as well as mechanistic target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) pathway activation in recurrent or refractory solid tumors of childhood.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and temsirolimus IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 25 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
