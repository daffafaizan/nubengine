      single case experimental design with weekly measures during two phases: A-B. The A-phase will
      consist of baseline measures at least three weeks prior to treatment. The B-phase will
      consist of the 12 weeks ICBT-program as well as one measure post-treatment. Single case
      descriptions of each participant will be presented. Weekly measures on the Obsessional
      Compulsive Inventory - Child version (OCI-CV) will be analyzed through visual inspection of
      each participants graph and through computation of Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND).
      PND is a frequently used effect measure in SCED and reflects how large percentage of the
      measurements during the treatment-phase that do not overlap with any of the measurements
      during the base-line phase.

      To assess the feasibility and comprehension of the ICBT treatment semi-structured interviews
      (face-to-face or telephone) will be conducted with participants and parents weekly during the
      four first weeks of ICBT and semi-weekly during the rest of the treatment. Detailed notes
      will be taken during each interview and will serve as content material for a thematic
      analysis trying to determine possible accommodations to the ICBT protocol to better suit
      patients with ASD.
