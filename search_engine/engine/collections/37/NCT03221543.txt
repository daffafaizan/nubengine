    
      This is a prospective study enrolling patients from the Baylor Weight Loss Surgery Center who
      have met all of the requirements to proceed with primary bariatric surgery. Patients will
      undergo pre-operative and post-operative metabolic testing (6 months, and 1 year after
      surgery) using a portable calorimeter with eventual follow up of medical record at 5 years.
      Data from up to 50 patients will be collected. The main objectives are to examine if the
      pre-operative resting metabolic rate can accurately predict successful weight loss after
      bariatric surgery and if it can be used to guide the selection of the type of bariatric
      surgery that would be most successful for the patient.
