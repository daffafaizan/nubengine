      of the Centro Superior de Estudios Universitarios La Salle. People were recruited by referral
      from different places of the local community of Madrid according to the CONSORT statement
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Three assessors were trained during 300 minutes
      about how to perform the measurements (Investigator A) and the concerned intervention to each
      group (Investigator B and C). The whole procedure was conducted in the Centro Superior de
      Estudios Universitarios La Salle. After meeting the eligibility criteria for the study,
      participants were randomly allocated by an external investigator to one of the two groups:

        -  Mixed reality group

        -  Conventional Exercise group
