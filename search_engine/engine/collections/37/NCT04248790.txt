      factors and decisions that affect PrEP adherence in high-risk populations to improve PrEP
      adherence. Key components of the app include a sex/PrEP diary using ecological momentary
      assessment to facilitate accurate data collection; PrEP taking reminder; HIV and sexually
      transmitted infections (STI) testing information and reminders; HIV and PrEP information and
      videos; geo-location.

      After eligible PrEP candidates agree to participate in the study, we will ask participants to
      install the app. Then, we will begin to collect their sexual diary and PrEP taking log via
      ecological momentary assessment. Participants will also complete monthly assessments. The
      monthly follow-up will test HIV/STI and drug concentration. The participants will be
      interviewed for difficulties when they use our app and giving feedback on it.
