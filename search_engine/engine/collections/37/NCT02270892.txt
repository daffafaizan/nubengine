      conducted at one clinical site. Investigator will assess baseline buttock ptosis to confirm
      subject eligibility.

      Enrolled subjects meeting all entrance criteria and who are confirmed to be eligible for
      study treatment will be randomized/assigned into one of two treatment groups: "Right side
      treated" and "Left side treated". All subjects will receive two, single-sided, dual-depth
      UltherapyÂ® treatments using the 4-4.5mm and 7-3.0mm transducers at 0.90J and 0.30J,
      respectively. Standardized images will be taken using standard 2D and Vectra 3D digital
      imaging systems. Subjects completing all study visits will be given the option of receiving
      two balancing treatments, 90 days apart, and will be required to complete one study visit at
      90 days following the last balancing treatment. Quantititative and qualititative assessment
      of pre- versus post-treatment buttock ptosis will be completed for each post-treatment time
      point. Subjects will also complete a questionnaire at each study visit.
