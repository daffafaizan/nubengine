      Assess if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 2 to 3 weeks after surgery leads to the same
      clinical decisions and has the same probability of being chosen by a physician for guiding
      the subsequent management of the patient, compared with immediately postoperative MRI.

      Secondary aims:

      Investigate the differences between early and late MRI by comparing:

        -  Size of tumor in three dimensions;

        -  Extent of edema;

        -  Presence and extent of fluid collection;

        -  Spine Oncology Study Group score;

        -  Involvement of adjacent levels;

        -  Progression of tumor;

        -  Patient's preference/performance scale right after each image had taken: level of
           discomfort at around the time each MRI was performed.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective diagnostic study for which no standard of care currently exists.
