      disorders involves a trial and error process. Pediatric psychiatrists start with the first
      line treatments (i.e. SSRI or psychotherapy), which requires from 4-8 weeks to work. There is
      a long interval between treatment initiation and response with only 50 to 60% likelihood that
      the treatment chosen will succeed in reducing anxiety symptoms. The science that will enable
      us to predict who will respond to medication treatment does not exist. Studies have
      demonstrated a correlation between cellular markers in white blood cells and psychiatric
      disorders suggesting that certain genes may also change their expression in peripheral cells
      in response to treatment of psychiatric disorders. Several studies report a significant
      decrease in expression of key genes that are involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and
      depression in the brain, such as BDNF, CREB and HDAC5 levels in leukocytes of people with
      mood and anxiety disorders. The levels of BDNF, HDAC5 and CREB in white blood cells then
      respond to treatment and match that of controls after treatment with SSRIs. The increased
      accessibility to sequencing technology allows us to survey many more potential biomarkers
      than what was possible just several years ago. This may enable us to formulate a test that
      will predict, based on biocellular markers, treatment outcome in anxiety disorders for
      children, adolescents, and young adults before the onset of treatment. By finding molecular
      markers that can predict treatment success from the onset, the investigators can improve
      treatment outcomes considerably compared to current standard treatment practices. This kind
      of personalized medicine is the future of psychiatry.
