      activators, prevent insulin resistance through AMPK-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1
      (S6K1) inhibition. And it is well known that the modulation of S6K1 by oltipraz inhibited the
      development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia through the AMPK-S6K1 pathway.Also some
      research reported that LXRg (a member of the nuclear hormone receptor)-mediated increases in
      SREBP-1c (the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c gene) promote the expression of
      lipogenic genes and enhance fatty acid synthesis and oltipraz inhibits LXRg and SREBP-c.
      Therefore, Oltipraz inhibits fatty acid synthesis through AMPK-S6K1 pathway and LXRg-SREBP-1c
      pathway in liver.
