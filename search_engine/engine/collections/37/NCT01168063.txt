      of naïve patients with triple therapy ( PPI+amoxicillin+clarithromycin for 7 days) markedly
      decreased last years to reach 70% due to a clarithromycin resistance rate about 20% in
      France. In case of failure, the recommended second line treatment
      (PPI+amoxicillin+metronidazole for 14 days) gives a success rate of 60%. However, as culture
      is uneasy and is only possible in specialised labs sensitivity to antibiotics is not
      currently studied before treatment.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical and medico-economic benefit of the molecular
      detection of antibiotic resistance in order to guide the treatment.

      The test is performed after DNA extraction from biopsy specimens taken at gastroscopy
      allowing rapid detection of H pylori and clarithromycin or quinolone resistance.

      Patients with bacteriologically proven H pylori infection will be randomly allocated to
      either empirical usual treatment with PPI , amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500 mg X 2 /day
      for 7 days in naïve patients and PPI, amoxicillin 1g,metronidazole 500 mg X 2 /day for 14
      days in patients who failed a first line treatment , or to treatment guided by the molecular
      test: PPI , amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500 mg X 2 /day for 7 days in case of sensitivity
      to clarithromycin.In case of resistance to clarithromycin, quinolone should be given and in
      case of resistance to quinolone clarithromycin should be given. In case of resistance to both
      antibiotics metronidazole should be given.

      Eradication will be assessed by performing 4 weeks after the completion of treatment with
      Urea Breath Test.
