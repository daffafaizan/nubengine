      users. The cognitive performance will be measured with the Stroop test and 3 Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) tests: Paired Associate Learning (PAL),
      Delayed Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM),and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP).
      Performance on these tests has been shown to be impaired in abstinent cocaine users, compared
      to healthy controls.

      Galantamine, compared to placebo, will not be associated with any significant changes in
      mood. Monitoring of mood will be achieved with 3 mood scales: 1) Center for Epidemiologic
      Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the
      Profile of Mood States (POMS).
