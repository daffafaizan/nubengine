      allergens should be avoided, and specific allergen immunotherapy applied. The initial cause
      of the onset of allergy, namely the immune hyperactive state of the atopic subjects, is not
      addressed at all. The investigators hypothesize that atopy is defined by a mild functional
      iron deficiency and that improving the iron status of immune cells will decrease the
      reactivity of these cells.

      In this prophylactic dietary intervention study oral supplementation of placebo or chelated
      and whey protein-bound iron will be given over the course of six months to allergic and
      non-allergic women. Changes in 1) the clinical reactivity 2) the iron status and 3) the
      microflora will be assessed. The study will be the first systematic approach in humans to
      assess the contribution of iron deficiency to allergy and will be pivotal in supporting the
      implementation of prophylactic and therapeutic recommendations.
