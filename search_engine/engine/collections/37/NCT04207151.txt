      intervention to (1) increase PrEP initiation overall, (2) increase uptake among groups
      disproportionately impacted by the HIV pandemic, and (3) to preserve high PrEP retention
      while expanding use. In addition, the proposal includes innovative secondary outcomes of (4)
      identifying barriers and facilitators of PrEP use that may be unique to urban safety-net
      populations, and (5) estimating the HIV infections averted due to greater PrEP uptake from
      the intervention.

      The intervention is multi-level yet, targets the "weakest chains in the link" of PrEP
      initiation at safety-net hospitals designed for scalability, sustainability, and
      implementability across a wide range of settings. It consists of Surveillance by STI testing,
      Navigation by unannounced patient navigators to the Sexual Health Clinic (SHC), Accelerated
      follow-up with providers with PrEP expertise, Point-of-care PrEP counseling and laboratory
      testing, and Seamless, consistent, longitudinal, comprehensive care (SNAPS).
