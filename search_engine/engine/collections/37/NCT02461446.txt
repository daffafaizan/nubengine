    
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by
      social communication/interaction impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviors. ASD
      associated with germline heterozygous PTEN mutations (PTEN ASD) is a genetically defined
      sub-group that, may be one of the more prevalent genetic disorders contributing to ASD
      (0.5-2%). The purpose of this research study is to carefully track the phenotypic and
      molecular characteristics of PTEN ASD and identify biomarkers for intervention studies.

      Individuals with PTEN ASD, with macrocephalic ASD without a PTEN mutation (macro-ASD),
      healthy controls, and individuals with PTEN mutations without ASD (PTEN no-ASD) will be asked
      to participate in this study if they are 18 months and older. Both males and females will be
      asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals'
      primary communicative language must be English.

      The study involves 3 on site visits over the course of two years. Study visits will vary in
      length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam, medical history
      questions, neuropsychological assessments, and a blood draw done for laboratory studies. A
      subset of participants between the ages of 2 and 11 years old will take part in the EEG
      portion of the study. Individuals who have a clinically indicated MRI will have an option to
      provide routine clinical scans for analysis.
