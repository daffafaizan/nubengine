    
      This is a randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of a proactive
      pregnancy-tailored high intensity intervention for smoking cessation, with a usual care low
      intensity intervention, that is the control condition.

      Intervention group participants will receive a high intensity intervention, which includes:
      30 minutes of cognitive-behavioural intervention delivered by a trained health care
      professional through out the first 24 weeks of gestation and a self-help manual especially
      tailored for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Control group participants will receive 5
      minutes of low intensity intervention.

      Participants' smoking status will be biochemically validated with urine cotinine and nicotine
      both at the baseline and at the 32nd week of gestation, expired carbon monoxide (CO) will be
      measured only at the baseline. After childbirth the infants' birth weight, the premature
      birth and any other complications in pregnancy and childbirth will be recorded. No medication
      is going to be used.
