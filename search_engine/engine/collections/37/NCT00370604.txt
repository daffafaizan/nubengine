      This complication leads to longer hospital stays and many repeated visits to hospital for
      management. Women suffering from severe postdural puncture headache (PDPH) are often
      bedridden and unable to care for themselves or their babies.The efficacy of epidural blood
      patch as a "gold standard" therapy is over-estimated by the earlier, poor quality studies.
      The prevalence of dural puncture during epidural anesthesia using current techniques ranges
      from 0.03 to 6% in the literature. Of these patients, 70 to 80% will suffer from moderate to
      severe PDPH. Avoidance of dural puncture is always the goal. However, complete avoidance is
      unlikely using current techniques of needle placement. This study proposes another method of
      prevention (i.e., reducing the gauge of the epidural needles if it is shown to be suitable
      for continuous infusion in adults). Most of the risk factors for developing PDPH cannot be
      changed (e.g., younger age, female sex, low body mass index, history of migraines). However,
      epidural needle gauge is a modifiable risk factor. Evidence suggests that the use of smaller
      gauge epidural needles, like spinal needles, have the potential to reduce the incidence and
      severity of PDPH.
