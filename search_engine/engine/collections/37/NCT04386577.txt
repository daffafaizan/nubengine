      TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259)" at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC)
      and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Our research focuses on the separate and synergistic
      effects of vitamin D and omega -3 supplements on telomere length, a cellular aging marker,
      using de-identified samples from VITAL-CTSC cohort.

      Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation decreases leukocyte telomere
      length attrition. The investigators will determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      telomere length attrition over time (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 4); 2) To test the hypothesis
      that marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation decreases LTL attrition. The investigators
      will determine the effect of marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on telomere length
      attrition over time (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 4); 3) To determine to what extent the
      effects of vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation on inflammatory cytokines and CVD risk
      factors are mediated by telomere length attrition over time; 4) To explore the synergistic
      effects vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.
