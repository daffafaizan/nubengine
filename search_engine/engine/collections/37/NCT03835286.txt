    
      Randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial. Adult patients admitted to the ICU of
      the Hospital Español de México with a diagnosis of septic shock will be included.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the study groups:

      Intervention Group: Vitamin C 6 grams in 250 ml of 0.9% saline solution every 24 hours, in
      continuous infusion for 72 hours.

      Placebo Group: 0.9% saline solution 250 ml every 24 hours, in continuous infusion for 72
      hours.

      Bottles will be identical, only identified by the sequential number of the patient that has
      been included.

      Primary objective is to demonstrate that the administration of intravenous Vitamin C
      decreases the dose of exogenous vasopressors in patients with septic shock
