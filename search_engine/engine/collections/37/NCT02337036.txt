      use is complicated by its narrow therapeutic index and variable pharmacokinetics. Therapeutic
      drug monitoring (TDM) of tacrolimus, based on whole-blood trough concentration (C0) values,
      is mandatory for use of twice-daily tacrolimus (Prograf_) as in order to decrease
      interindividual variability in exposure and thereby minimize the risk of acute rejection and
      the occurrence of adverse effects (mainly nephrotoxicity and, to a lesser extent,
      neurotoxicity).

      Until now, the C0 is the easiest means of individual dose adjustment, as only one blood
      sample is required and the clinician can easily calculate the dose needed to reach the
      target. Many factors have an impact on the pharmacokinetic parameters. However the adaptation
      of the time to achieve the target stays an issue. Among factors of inter and intra
      variability of pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, some of them are specific of the pediatric
      liver transplantation population.

      Aims: To build a population pharmacokinetic model that describes the apparent clearance of
      tacrolimus and the potential demographic, clinical and genetically controlled factors that
      could lead to inter-patient pharmacokinetic variability within children following liver
      transplantation.
