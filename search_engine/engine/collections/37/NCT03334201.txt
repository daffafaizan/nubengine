      Western diet and exercise, influences arterial function in humans, the investigators will
      capitalize on the plasticity of the gut microbiome to dietary perturbations. A randomized,
      single-blind, 2x1-week dietary intervention crossover study (with 3 week washout) will be
      conducted in young (18-29 years) and old (60-79 years), exercising and non-exercising, male
      and female adults from all races and ethnic backgrounds. Testing will take place on the
      University of Colorado Boulder main campus at the Clinical and Translational Research Center
      (CTRC - located in the Wardenburg Health Center). Subjects will undergo telephone and
      in-person CTRC screening, with those eligible assigned to either Group A or Group B using
      block randomization stratified by age and exercise status. Group A will undergo isocaloric WD
      feeding (high fat [40%], high sugar [25%], low fiber [15g], low nutrient) during Phase 1
      (first 1-week treatment period) and non-WD feeding (low-fat [25%], low sugar [15%], high
      fiber [22g], high nutrient) during Phase 2 (second 1-week treatment period). Group B will
      undergo the dietary interventions in the opposite order. Phases 1 and 2 will be separated by
      a 3-week washout period to prevent carry over effects. During each 1-week intervention
      period, fecal swabs will be collected daily to characterize the gut microbiome and vascular
      function, will be measured at baseline and after 2 and 7 days of controlled feeding to gain
      insight into the temporal relation between these outcomes.
