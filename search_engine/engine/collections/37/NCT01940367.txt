      percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) therapy versus transcutaneous electrical sacral
      nerve stimulation (TENS) for the treatment of subjects with idiopathic overactive bladder.
      Previous short-term studies suggest that these therapies have equal efficacy in improving OAB
      symptoms, but we hypothesize that long-term efficacy and success is actually higher in the
      TENS group due to ease of use, since subjects can self-administer this therapy. Secondary
      goals are to evaluate subject quality of life improvement scores, bladder diary scores
      (change in the frequency of urination), and changes in urodynamic studies while undergoing
      these therapies.
