      common result of stroke.Many people with hemiplegia propel themselves using their sound-side
      arms and legs ("hemiplegic-pattern propulsion") in manual wheelchairs.Often people using this
      pattern are prescribed wheelchairs with a reduced seat height to facilitate foot propulsion.
      Despite the seeming obviousness of the need to lower the seat height for people who use foot
      propulsion,there is little available evidence to help establish optimal wheelchair seat
      height. The study objective is to test the hypothesis that there is an optimum wheelchair
      seat height (expressed as a percentage of the lower leg length) for hemiplegic-pattern
      wheelchair propulsion. The investigators expect that the optimum seat height will be lower
      than that usually used for wheelchairs that are hand-propelled.

      A single-subject design with able-bodied participants will be used to investigate 5
      randomized seat heights. The 5 seat heights will be set relative to the subjects leg length
      at a single 60 minute data collection session All measures will be obtained during one
      session. The optimal seat height will be chosen based on wheelchair propulsion speed, push
      frequency and effectiveness over 10m going forward on smooth surface, and 5m going backwards
      over a soft surface.
