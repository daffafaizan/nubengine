    
      Genital warts (GW; also called condylomas or condylomata acuminata) are lesions caused by
      infection of Human papillomavirus (HPV)(specifically HPV-6 or HPV-11 types, found in > 95% of
      lesions). GW are sexually transmitted and affect about 1% of the sexually active population.
      GW represent a distressful condition for social and sexual life, especially in the cases of
      external condylomas. No HPV-specific antiviral treatment exists to date, and all existing
      therapies (either surgical or drug) have limited efficacy, with a significant level of GW
      recurrences and are associated with local skin reactions. AP611074 is a synthetic new
      chemical entity that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the interaction between two viral
      proteins from HPV6 and HPV11, an interaction that is a necessary step for HPV DNA replication
      and thus viral production. AP611074 is the "first in class" specific HPV antiviral described
      to treat condyloma caused by HPV infection.
