      conducted at an Education and Training Hospital, Istanbul from May to July, 2020, and it was
      performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee and
      health ministry (No:2020.05.20). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or
      their representatives when data were collected prospectively.

      Age, gender, mortality status, APACHE II score, number of days in ICU, procalcitonin and
      C-reactive protein values, leukocyte values, comorbid diseases, The cluster of
      differentiations 4 and 8 (CD4 and CD8), interleukin -2, interleukin -6, Tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha-beta levels will be recorded.

      Clinical results, changes in inflammatory and immune function levels, and side effects will
      be recorded. The patient's lung function and symptoms will be recorded after Mesenchymal Stem
      Cell transplantation. After treatment, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, Tumor Necrosis
      alpha-beta levels , interleukin-6 levels will be recorded.

      Patients were divided into 3 groups:

        1. group: Intubated without comorbidity (n:7)

        2. group: Intubated with comorbidity (n:7)

        3. group: No intubated (n:7)

      Dosage of Mesenchymal stem cells:

        1. 1 million cell/kg iv--------------------------------------------------day 0

        2. 1 million cell/kg iv -------------------------------------------------day 2

        3. 1 million cell/kg iv -------------------------------------------------day 4
