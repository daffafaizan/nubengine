    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of PCR in identification and
      detection of tuberculosis using DNA extracts from stained slides (Ziehl Neelsen and
      Fluorescence) and Filter paper (FTA card and Genocard).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the MTB extraction yield from
      smear-negative, low and high bacilli load specimens on slides, filter paper ( Genocardand
      FTA), to determine the amount of sample required to make a detectable PCR reaction and to
      assess the feasibility of storage and extraction methods.
