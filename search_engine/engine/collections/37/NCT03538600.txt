      biology efforts across the National Institutes of Health, in large measure through its
      development of new tools for high-throughput data generation and complex systems modeling.
      The lab's experimental component requires ongoing assay development and optimization, which
      depend on the availability of human biological samples for testing. The primary purpose of
      this protocol is to obtain biological specimens from healthy volunteers to support the lab s
      development and optimization of scientific assays and to use as control samples for research
      tests in other studies.The secondary objective of this study is to track immunologic changes
      over time using the assays developed and optimized in this study.
