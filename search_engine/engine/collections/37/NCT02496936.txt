      remains unclear; evidence is lacking on whether responses vary according to acute intake. The
      researchers will use a controlled setting to determine whether the source of dietary fat is
      related to perceived satiety, satiety hormone responses, and energy expenditure by conducting
      experiments to evaluate short term (acute) effects.
