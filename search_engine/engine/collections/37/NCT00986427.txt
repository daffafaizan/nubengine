      of Restasis® and its vehicle, Refresh® Dry Eye Therapy in 24 patients. Three target
      fingernails will be identified in each subject. Two of the target nails will be the two nails
      that have the most severe signs of brittle nail syndrome. The third target nail will be a
      normal nail or, in the absence of a normal nail, the patient's second-healthiest appearing
      nail. The patients most normal-appearing nail will be untreated so that growth in the treated
      nails can be compared to growth in an untreated normal nail, this will be the fourth target
      nail. Study medication will be applied to target nails (the subjects may also apply to all
      nails if they wish, except one nail which will be untreated in order to determine the
      subject's baseline rate of fingernail growth) for 24 weeks. The target nails will be assessed
      at each visit, every four weeks. There will be a 12-week follow up period after treatment is
      completed.

      This 36 week study will be conducted at one center. Adult male and female patients meeting
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be screened for eligibility. The principal
      investigator or his/her designee will obtain informed consent from all patients before any
      protocol specific procedures are performed.
