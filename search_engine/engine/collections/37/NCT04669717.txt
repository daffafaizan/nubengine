    
      This is a randomized, 3-arm parallel group, single-blind, comparative superiority and
      exploratory clinical trial of 44 months involving 45 patients with periodontitis attending
      the Division of Regenarative Dental Medecine and Periodontology of the University of Geneva.
      First, a routine clinical and radiographic periodontal examination will be conducted by a
      periodontist. Treatment will be done in 2 appointments by mechanical debridement of the
      diseased sites by two experienced clinicians. At the end of the treatment, one third of the
      patients will be assigned for treatment with 500mgAMO+ 500mgMET 3 times a day during 1 week,
      one third for treatment with 500mgAMO+ 500mgMET 3 times a day during 3 days and the last
      third for treatment with 500mg AZI once a day for 3 days.

      Clinical samples will be taken at Days 0, 2, 4 and 8 after the start of the antibiotic
      administration . Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) will be collected from four sites with
      paperpoints, blood sample by finger puncture, unstimulated saliva and subgingival plaque from
      four sites with paper points. The concentration and duration effect of AMO+MET and AZI in
      GCF, saliva and serum will be assessed in the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at the
      University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The microbiological effect on 6 selected organisms will
      be assessed by RT-PCR at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The clinical results will be
      evaluated 6 months later. The study duration for the patient will be approximately 8 months.

      All adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded and addressed.
