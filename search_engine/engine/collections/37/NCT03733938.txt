      January 2017 till August 2017 were assessed for inclusion in the study according to preset
      criteria. Endodontic microsurgery was performed following modern techniques including
      magnification, root resection with minimal angle, ultrasonic root end preparation and
      placement of a fast set bioceramic putty as retrograde filling material. The case was
      subsequently evaluated clinically and radiographically at 3, 6 and 12 months. And will be
      followed subsequently at 2 years and 4 years post treatment.
