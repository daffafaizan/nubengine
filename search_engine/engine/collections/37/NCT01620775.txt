      provide individual-based treatments. This study will differentiate chronic pain subjects
      (knee osteoarthritis, low back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy) into two groups: those
      who have central pain predominant symptoms and those who have peripheral pain predominant
      symptoms. The response to medical treatment between these two groups is quite different, thus
      a reliable strategy to correctly categorize chronic pain sufferers offers the opportunity to
      provide targeted, effective treatments. Chronic pain is a prevalent problem in the VA veteran
      population with significant associated costs; in particular knee osteoarthritis, chronic low
      back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy are common in this population. The proposed study
      will use different clinical pain tests and advanced neuroimaging techniques to improve our
      understanding of chronic pain and improve patient outcomes.
