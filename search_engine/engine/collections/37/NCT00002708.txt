      treated with conventional whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with vs. without a stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) boost. II. Compare sites of recurrence and cause of death in these
      patients treated with WBRT followed by SRS vs. WBRT alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center
      and extracranial disease (yes or no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I: Patients receive fractionated external beam whole brain irradiation (WBRT) 5 days each
      week for 3 weeks. Both portals are treated during each radiotherapy session. Patients who
      still have a solitary lesion with a diameter no greater than 4.0 cm also receive stereotactic
      radiosurgery within 7 days of completing WBRT. Arm II: Patients receive WBRT only. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 4 months for 2 years, and then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 262 patients will be accrued over 2.5-3.75 years for this
      study. The study may close early if interim analysis after 33% and 67% of patients have been
      followed for 6 months produces significant results. After 6/14/99 an additional 46 patients
      with a solitary brain metastasis only will be accrued.
