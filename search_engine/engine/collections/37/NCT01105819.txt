      Sweden where 50 patients were included (ISRCTN00472141).

      Results have been published in Critical Care 2008, 12:R136 The protocol is the same and in
      this second phase we intend to include 100 patients and results will be summed up.

      Three centres are engaged. The results from the pilot study is encouraging and we are aiming
      at getting statistical significance in the differences in pathogenic findings in the cultures
      from oropharynx and also better a better basis for the calculation of the number of patients
      needed to get sufficient power to study difference in VAP frequency.
