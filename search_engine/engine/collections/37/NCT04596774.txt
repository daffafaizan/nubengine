      the facial region of the skull associated with blood loss, inflammatory reactions, massive
      swelling, postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV), and severe pain. Therefore; in most of the
      patients who are with dentofacial deformity and undergo orthognathic surgery, postoperative
      recovery generally requires a long troublesome period. The aim of this study is to improve
      postoperative outcome by the use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols.

      Material methods: After Ethics Committee approval (2020/965), the data of 90 patients who
      underwent elective orthognathic surgery, were investigated. Following standard monitorization
      and general anesthesia; Group 1 patients were applied traditional approach and received
      intraoperative 10 mL/kg/h IV izolen infusion. Rescue analgesics and PONV prophylaxis were
      applied when required through the postoperative first 48 hours. Group 2 received ERAS
      approach. Patients in Group 2 did not preoperatively smoke for 48 hours, drank clear liquids
      until the last 2 hours, and received 6 mL/kg/h IV izolen infusion intraoperatively. In these;
      gastric aspiration was also applied before extubation, PONV prophylaxis was supported
      routinely, and patient controlled analgesia was added to the routine analgesia plan for the
      first postoperative 48 hours. The primary endpoint was length of hospital stay. The secondary
      endpoints were intraoperative follow-up data, numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, opioid
      consumption, PONV incidences, length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, satisfaction
      scores of two groups through the postoperative first 48 hours.
