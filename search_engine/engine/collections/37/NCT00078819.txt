      etanercept during the initial double-blind period. Participants could enter an escape group
      and receive open-label etanercept until week 12 if, at or after week 4, their Psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index (PASI) score either increased by more than 50% over baseline and by a
      minimum of 4 points at one visit or increased by more than 25% and by a minimum of 4 points
      at each of two consecutive visits.

      During the open-label treatment period, all patients (including those who entered the escape
      group) received open-label etanercept. Participants who did not achieve PASI 50 at week 24 or
      PASI 75 at week 36 could discontinue the study or add topical standard-of-care therapy
      (low-to-moderate-potency topical corticosteroids) and continue to receive open-label
      etanercept until week 48.

      At week 36, participants with PASI 50 at week 24 or PASI 75 at week 36 were randomly assigned
      to placebo or etanercept for 12 weeks in the withdrawal period. Participants in whom PASI 75
      was lost resumed open-label etanercept through week 48 in the re-treatment period.
