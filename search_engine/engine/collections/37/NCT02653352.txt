      implemented using simple messages encouraging water consumption instead of sugar sweetened
      carbonated beverages. The messages were previously tested for understanding in two small
      groups of children of the same age and socio-economic background as the study participants.
      Also, beliefs and behaviors of children in these focus groups were recorded in order to
      orient activities and the production of printed materials to be given to participants.
      Education was delivered via classroom activities; banners were hung promoting water
      consumption, and water bottles with the logo of the campaign were given to children and
      schoolteachers.
