    
      A phase 3, multi-center, partially-blinded, randomized clinical trial in four parallel
      treatment groups. Bedaquiline and pretomanid treatment will not be blinded. Linezolid
      treatment dose and duration will be double-blinded.

      Participants will have a screening period of up to 14 days and will be randomized to receive
      one of the 4 active treatment arms. Participants will be randomized to one of the four
      regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, using an interactive voice and web response system (IXRS) which
      will utilize a randomization system using stratification with a random element to allocate
      participants evenly across the arms by HIV status and type of TB.

      Each participant will receive 26 weeks of treatment. If participant's week 16 sputum sample
      is culture positive between the week 16 and week 26 treatment visits and their clinical
      condition suggests they may have an ongoing TB infection, Investigator may consider extending
      current treatment to 39 weeks. If the culture results between week 16 and week 26 are
      contaminated, missing or considered an isolated positive without clinical significance,
      available culture results should be used to make this decision. All decisions regarding
      treatment extension should be discussed with and approved by, in consultation with the
      Sponsor Medical Monitor before implementation.

      Participants will be followed for 78 weeks after end of treatment.
