      which is expressed on cells involved in tumor vasculature. Studies have found endosialin to
      play a key role in tumor growth and neovessel formation in numerous cancer types including
      melanoma. Preclinical pharmacological studies have shown that MORAb-004 is a potentially
      useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed to determine the efficacy of
      MORAb-004 at two dose levels in subjects with metastatic melanoma, as well as to establish
      serum pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibody.
