      disruptive NPS that requires a specialist consultation based on the long-term care facility
      (LTCF) staff judgment. In the intervention group, a telemedicine (TM) consultation between
      the LTCF staff (medical and nurse staff) and the Memory Center from the University Hospital,
      will occur at inclusion (T0). Then, a second TM consultation will occur at 1 month (T1). In
      the control group management of NPS will be done as usual care. In both groups, patients'
      parameters such as non-programmed hospitalizations and/or consultations due to disruptive
      NPS, psychotropic drugs use, and health costs, will be evaluated at inclusion, 1 month and at
      2 months. Acceptability of the TM among the LTCF staff will be assessed during the study in
      the intervention group.

      The two university hospitals are composed of a group of institutions for elderly people
      located near Toulouse and Limoges.
