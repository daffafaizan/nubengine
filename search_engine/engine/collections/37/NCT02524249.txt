      within 16 hours of birth. 90 newborns will be randomized to receive early caffeine within 24
      hours of life (the "study drug") and 90 newborns will receive a placebo. Either the early
      caffeine (the "study drug") or placebo will be continued throughout the first 15 days of
      life. Newborns in the early caffeine group will receive an IV bolus of 20mg/kg followed by IV
      or PO 5mg/kg daily for 14 days. The clinical team can choose to give PO caffeine if the
      newborn tolerates >75% of fluid goals by feeds. The clinical and research teams will be
      blinded; neither will know whether the newborn is receiving early caffeine or placebo. The
      clinical team will be allowed to use open labeled caffeine as deemed medically necessary
      after 24 hours of receiving either the early caffeine or placebo. Often this clinical need
      would be at the time of extubation (peri-extubation) and comprises the "late" caffeine group,
      which is also the placebo group. Perinatal and postnatal clinical characteristics will be
      prospectively collected. Clinical team may choose to hold study drug if newborns are placed
      on high frequency ventilation or if they need sedation drips for surgical procedures. Two
      blood samples will be collected one at day 7 and one at day 14 for caffeine levels. Data
      safety monitoring committee will be review mortality and morbidity in each group on a
      quarterly basis or after recruitment of every 30 newborns whichever happens earlier.
