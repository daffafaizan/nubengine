      leading cause of acquired adult disability and has negative effects on patients' quality of
      life.Therefore,It's little wonder there's much focus there days on treatment of stroke. For
      the patients who have suffered from ischemic stroke in 3 months, indeed, they have the
      opportunity to get symptomatic improvement through receiving conventional stroke treatments
      that including rehabilitation. At the same time, these treatments are ineffective in some
      cases. Alternatively, the phenomenon of increasing brain plasticity after stroke provoke an
      essential therapy. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment enhances a
      functional improvement after cerebral ischemia, likewise, treament in rodent models are
      proved effective. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells therapy performs a role as take
      the place destroyed cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. The totality of evidence from
      trials running umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplanted into patients suffering
      from ischemic stroke support the safety of this approach. In terms of efficacy, positive
      results are reported in the majority of the trials.

      Our research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of
      safety and efficacy in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 2 parallel groups).
