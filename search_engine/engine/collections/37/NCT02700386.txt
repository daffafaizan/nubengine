      last approximately four (4) weeks, instead of the traditional six (6) week course that women
      have typically received in this situation. The shorter course subjects will receive is
      designed in a way that it is thought to be equivalent to the longer course. This shorter
      course has already been shown to be very safe and effective when treating breast cancer in
      the breast tissue only. However, because cancer cells were found in the lymph nodes that
      drain their breast, subjects require radiation to a larger area of their chest, armpit, and
      shoulder than has been completely tested with this experimental dose.
