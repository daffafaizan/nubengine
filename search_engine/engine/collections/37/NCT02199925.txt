      apoptotic pathways may result in a process of neuroinflammation with a clinical presentation
      of Autism Spectrum Disorder. If Autism Spectrum Disorders are the consequence of a chronic
      inflammatory process that prevents the infant brain from forming the proper neural
      connections, then treatment that reduces inflammation might have a positive impact on autism.
      We believe that there is a correlation between immunological abnormalities and the
      development of the autism.
