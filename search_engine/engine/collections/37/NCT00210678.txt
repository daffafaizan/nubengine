    
      This is a multinational, multicenter, observational study in men with and without PE. The
      study consists of three visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and two visits for
      observation after 1 and 2 months (total duration of 8 weeks). No study treatment for PE is
      administered to patients during the course of the study. Patients and their partners are
      expected to attempt sexual intercourse at least 2 times a week during the 8-week study period
      and to use a stopwatch to record the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) during
      intercourse. At visits during the observation period "patients" (and/or partners if partners
      are responsible for completing questionaires) also provide patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
      by answering several questionnaires that include the topics of control over ejaculation,
      satisfaction with sexual intercourse, personal distress, interpersonal difficulty, and
      self-esteem. The study will estimate the distribution of the average IELT values for men with
      PE and men without PE.
