      four groups depending on their glucose tolerance (how long values remain raised) and the
      tendency for values to subsequently fall to low values.

      On a second occasion 155 healthy older adults, aged 45-80 years, will be randomly assigned to
      receive either a glucose, sucrose or isomaltulose based meal. All meals are matched on
      macronutrient composition and differ only in glycemic load. Cognitive performance and mood
      will be assessed 30, 105 and 180 minutes after breakfast. Measures of memory, attention,
      reaction times and mood will be taken.

      The response to the three meals will be contrasted in those with different glucose profiles
      on day one
