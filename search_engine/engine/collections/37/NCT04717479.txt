    
      Aim 1: Conduct a user-centered design process to refine the SPEAK! training protocols for
      older adults with symptoms of SCD/MCI and ELLs, and the materials that will support
      productive engaging English conversation practice.

      Aim 2: Conduct a randomized, wait-list controlled trial of 12 weeks of SPEAK! participation,
      using a variety of recruitment sources, in order to evaluate our capacity to recruit,
      implement the intervention, and retain older adults with symptoms of SCD/MCI in sufficient
      numbers for a subsequent randomized-controlled trial evaluating the intervention's impact on
      participants' psychological well-being, mood, and cognitive functioning.

      Aim 3: Using mixed methods, evaluate the communication process between older adults with
      symptoms of SCD/MCI and ELLs including factors that contribute to satisfaction of both
      parties, engagement in planned contacts, possible contributors to stress or dissatisfaction,
      and perceptions among older adults of being appreciated and effective. The investigators will
      also estimate variances for key outcome variables and conduct exploratory analyses of
      intervention-control differences in participants' perceptions of their wellbeing, mood, and
      cognitive functioning.
