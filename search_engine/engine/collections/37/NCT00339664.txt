      and/or saliva) will be collected from cancer patients enrolled on approved clinical trials,
      in accordance with the local protocol. These trials are being conducted at outside
      institutions, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the samples will
      be sent to the NCI for pharmacological analysis, involving determination of parent drug
      and/or metabolite concentrations and subsequent pharmacokinetics and statistical data
      analysis. This study aims to further characterize the clinical pharmacokinetic behavior of
      select cancer therapeutics. Future collaborators will be added via the protocol amendment
      procedure.
