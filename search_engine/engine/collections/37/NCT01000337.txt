    
      Female patients undergoing mastectomy or thyroidectomy under sevoflurane or propofol
      anesthesia will be recruited for the study. The type of anesthesia will be determined in a
      random way using a computer generated table.

      All patients will be preoxygenated for 3 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Patients
      assigned to the sevoflurane group will receive an inhalation induction with sevoflurane via a
      primed anesthetic circle system and anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane. In the
      propofol group patients anaesthesia will be induced and maintained with propofol.

      Blood samples for liver apoptotic markers will be collected before induction of anesthesia,
      after skin closure as well as 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.

      Blood samples will be centrifuged, stored at -80 degrees Celsius and analyzed for M30 and M60
      values with radioimmunoassay technique. Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum
      glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels will also be determined.
