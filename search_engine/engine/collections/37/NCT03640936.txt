      patients and 10 healthy volunteers. All patients will have an induced sputum, pulmonary
      function studies, FENO (exhaled fraction of nitric oxide), total and specific IgE measurement
      at d1 (the most common perennial pneumoallergen) in blood and induced sputum, as well as a
      prick skin test with standardized allergen extracts. Measurement of total IgE and IgE for d1
      in induced sputum will be performed in the supernatant and by the ImmunoCAP (Phadia
      ThermoFisher Scientific) immunofluoroassay technique.
