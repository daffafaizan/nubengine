      people died in China every year. There are three types of treatment for CHD, medication,
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However,
      some end-stage CHD patients with severe cardiac ischemia lost the chance to get those
      treatment. Their quality of life is influenced by recurrent angina. Cardiac shock wave
      therapy (CSWT) is a new developed therapy for these patients, which is used in tens of
      countries all over the world. German and Japan are the countries earliest used CSWT. Safety,
      invasiveness, effectiveness is its advantage. Ischemia condition can be improved after CSWT
      by objective examination. New small vessels generation on ischemia area was found on mice and
      pig model. There are only three cities in China run the program of CSWT, that are Kunming,
      Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing hospital has the only CSWT machine in Beijing. The
      investigators designed a randomized double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of CSWT.
