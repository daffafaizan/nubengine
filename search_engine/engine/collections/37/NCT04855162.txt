      bedside assessment of critically ill patients to guide clinical management. LUS is a
      non-invasive and easy-to-perform procedure that provides precise data on lung aeration, lung
      recruitment, lung morphology, and lung perfusion. Studies have shown that LUS is a useful
      tool in monitoring lung reaeration in intubated patients diagnosed with traditional ARDS
      undergoing prone positioning; however there are mixed findings in terms of the use of LUS in
      predicting potential prone positioning response. A recent study found that the non-intubated
      COVID-19 patients who responded to prone positioning had more pronounced disturbances of
      aeration in posterior regions, however, they only investigated patients' response to the
      first prone positioning and the information for the patients' outcome is lacking. In our
      previous study with intubated COVID-19 patients, we found that patients' response to the
      subsequent prone positioning had higher predictive value than the response to the first prone
      positioning. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to explore the physiological
      mechanism of awake, self proning among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      induced by COVID-19, using LUS in the first three days and explore the predictive value of
      LUS in patients' outcome.
