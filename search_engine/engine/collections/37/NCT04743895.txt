      subjects that underwent midline sternal closure with FiberTape cerclage compared to subjects
      that underwent midline sternal closure with stainless steel wire.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complication rate and postoperative pain of
      subjects that underwent midline sternal closure with FiberTape cerclage compared to subjects
      that underwent midline sternal closure with stainless steel wire.

      CT scans are performed at three months postoperatively to assess sternal healing. Two
      radiologists will read all CT scans. Axial slices are analyzed at five locations along the
      sternum (manubrium, top of the aortic arch, aortopulmonary window, main pulmonary arteries,
      and aortic root) using a 6-point quantitative scale (0=no sign of healing, 1=minimal healing,
      2=mild healing, 3=moderate healing, 4=partial synthesis, 5=complete synthesis).

      All adverse events related to the sternal closure procedure or the devices used for closure
      will be collected.

      Postoperative pain scores will be collected using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) with a
      numeric rating of 0 to 10. Sternal pain will be rated at rest, coughing, and with movement.
      Postoperative analgesic use for sternal closure pain will be evaluated.The Veterans Rand
      (VR-12) health survey will be collected postoperatively (see schedule of events for details).
