      whereas the pulse widths of the latest model of PDL are tunable ranging between 0.45-40
      milliseconds. The long-pulsed PDL has been proven to be safe and more effective in treating
      certain vascular abnormalities including adult port-wine-stain and small leg vein.9-12 In the
      present study, we would like to investigate the effect of pulse widths on the treatment
      response of keloidal and hypertrophic sternotomy scars to the 595-nm PDL.
