      special software ( Mimics ) . All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon .

      All surgical procedures were performed under strict aseptic conditions, all patients received
      infiltration local anesthesia (Articaine 4% 1:100 000 epinephrine).

      a midcrestal incision was made in the anterior region using No. 15 blade. A full thickness
      mucoperiosteal flap was raised to expose the underlying alveolar ridge. The residual
      remaining bone in the area was minimal, with a maximum measured ridge thickness of 3 or 4 mm.
      'To reconstruct the lost alveolar bone, an xenograft bone shell approximately 1 to 2 mm thick
      was shaped, after 3D print the bone shell were fixed to the buccal defect, using screws .
      'The space between the plate and the existing palatal bone wall was then filled using a
      combination of autograft bone chips and xenograft bone particles

      . Periosteal releasing incision is done to obtain stress free primary closure. The flap will
      then be closed using interrupted 4/0 resorbable sutures. After 4 month will insert implant .
      After 3 month will insert final restoration which will be mostly PMF .
