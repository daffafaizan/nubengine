      primary cytoreductive surgery.Ovarian cancer(OC) organoids will be then cultured. Organoids
      will be validated with a combination of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis and
      immunohistochemistry (TP53, PAX8 etc). After then, the patient-derived organoids cultured
      from OC will be compared the sensitivity to standard regimens (chemotherapies and targeted
      agents) recommendated by NCCN guidlines versus patients treated in clinical practice.
