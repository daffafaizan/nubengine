      results in improved glycemic control in children <8 years of age, many of the barriers to CGM
      efficacy in this age group may have been due to problems in the wearability and accuracy of
      prior generation devices, as well as to the setting of glycemic targets aimed primarily at
      preventing hypoglycemia at all costs. There may also be behavioral barriers to consistent and
      effective CGM use in this age range. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of CGM
      alone and CGM combined with a family behavioral intervention focused on supporting CGM use on
      glycemic control in very young children with T1D compared with usual care without CGM.
