      significant advantages over the other. The null hypothesis of this study is that there is no
      difference between plating and subcutaneous internal fixation of symphysis disruptions with
      respect to primary and secondary outcomes. The study is a randomized trial with patients who
      sustained a symphysis disruption who will randomize to either closed reduction and
      subcutaneous internal fixation, or open reduction and plating of the symphysis. There will
      also be two observational arms of the study, patients who do not agree to randomization and
      will receive internal fixation according to the treating surgeon's discretion and patients
      with a symphysis disruption that do not require any form of anterior pelvic internal fixation
      based on the treating surgeon's opinion. Clinical assessments will occur at the time of
      hospital admission and at all post-operative follow-up intervals (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months,
      6months, 12 months, and 24 months).
