      IgG4.IgG4 is regarded as an inhibitory IgG which can inhibit the activation of immune
      responses[1]. Recently it was reported that IgG4 could weaken the activation of macrophages
      to promote cancer progression[2]. Autoimmune pancreatitis(AIP) is the most common clinical
      manifestation of IgG4-related sclerosing diseases(IRSD) which is characterized by abundant
      infiltration of IgG4 positive plasma cells[3].Although there are abundant infiltrations of
      IgG4 positive plasma cells in pancreatic lesion of AIP, the correlation of IgG4 positive
      plasma cells with pancreatic cancer has never been reported.Investigators have previously
      found that higher level of infiltration of IgG4 positive plasma cells in tumor tissue
      predicts a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer after curative resection(not
      published).Investigators further attempt to explore the possible roles of IgG4 and the
      inducer of IgG4, IL-10, in the chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.Since gemcitabine is the
      first line chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer, in this primary study,investigators
      plan to observe the dynamic changes of sera IgG4 and IL-10 in peripheral blood after
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and analyze the correlations of IgG4 and IL-10 with the
      response of gemcitabine and overall survival of pancreatic cancer.
