      fatal neurodegenerative condition, affecting close to 15 million family caregivers (CG).
      Circadian rhythm disorders (CRDs) occur in the majority of persons with dementia and include
      late afternoon/evening agitation (e.g. sundowning) and irregular sleep-wake rhythms such as
      daytime hypersomnia, frequent night awakenings, and poor sleep efficiency. CRDs can cause a
      specific cluster of neuropsychiatric symptoms that occur in over 60 percent of patients with
      dementia and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of
      life. Regulating the circadian system via different types of activity have been shown to
      alter core clock processes that drive CRD symptoms and suggests that a combination of
      cognitive, physical, and sensory-based activities, delivered at strategic times, may be an
      effective mechanism to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms, decrease sleep disruptions, and
      enhance quality of life for both the care receiver and the caregiver.

      Specific components of this brief, one-month, eight sessions, home-based intervention
      include: 1) assessing PWD health/functional status and preferences/interests; 2) educating
      caregivers on environmental cues to promote activity and sleep; and 3) training of caregivers
      in using timed morning, afternoon, and evening activities based on circadian needs across the
      day.
