    
      Patients who have bone cancer often have the cancerous bone removed by surgery and replaced
      with a piece of bone taken from a donor (a person who donates parts of their body to be used
      for transplants after their death). However, sometimes this replacement bone does not heal
      together with the patient's bone. The reason the bone does not heal is not known but it is
      thought that the patient's body may react to the donor bone by producing antibodies against
      cells on the donor bone. The purpose of this study is to find out whether or not antibodies
      to the donor bone are present in the blood of patients who receive the donor bone. You have
      been asked to participate in this study because you are scheduled to undergo this type of
      surgery.
