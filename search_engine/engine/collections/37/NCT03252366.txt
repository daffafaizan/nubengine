      teeth and this followed by Pneumatization of the maxillary sinus, the atrophy of the alveolar
      process is a common reason for the limited availability of alveolar bone for implant
      placement in the posterior maxilla.

      Numerous techniques designed to increase bone volume in the maxillary sinus region have been
      proposed. They were mostly based on the insertion of various materials into a void created
      between the sinus (Schneiderian) membrane and the bony walls of the maxillary sinus. (Sohn et
      al 2008) reported simultaneous placement of implants, and insertion of gelatin sponges
      demonstrate new bone formation through clinical and radiographic evaluations. New bone
      formation was verified by stabilization of the elevated sinus membrane from the tenting
      effect of placement of dental implants and absorbable gelatin sponge without any bone graft
      material. This study shows that there is great potential for new bone formation in the
      maxillary sinus without the use of additional bone grafts. Systemic review showed that the
      survival rate for implants utilizing xenografts was statistically the same as for implants
      placed in particulate autogenous bone grafts .
