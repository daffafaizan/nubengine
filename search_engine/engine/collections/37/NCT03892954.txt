      pain intensity in adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and to correlate with
      inflammatory markers and pain related comorbidities. Thus, a total of 150 adolescents aged
      (12-18 years) were invited to participate in this study. They are classified into two groups;
      adolescents with CFS (n=100) and healthy control (n=50). RT-PCR and immunoassay analysis were
      used to estimate miRNAs (miR-558, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-124, and miR-143) and
      immune-inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-Î±, COX-2) respectively.
