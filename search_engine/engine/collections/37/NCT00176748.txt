      cancer (5,960 in men and 17,640 in women) annually in the United States, and about 1,460
      people (620 men and 840 women) will die from this disease.1 It is the most common malignancy
      of the endocrine system. Depending upon type and stage, thyroid cancer may be treated with
      surgery, radioactive iodine (131I), hormone treatment, external radiation, or chemotherapy.

      The systemic therapy of metastatic disease remains palliative until new agents are found that
      might afford a better prognosis. Thyroid tumors are often vascular, and a decrease in the
      number of blood vessels that supply the tumor may starve it of needed nutrients. An approach
      to blocking the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumor is to inhibit the VEGF receptor
      tyrosine kinase (VEGFR TK) signaling pathway. The VEGFR TK inhibitor SU011248 has produced 4
      objective responses in 15 patients receiving the drug on Phase 1 studies.2 AG-013736 is
      another VEGFR TK inhibitor. Besides having potential anti-angiogenesis properties through
      VEGFR TK inhibition, it also has additional potential antitumor through platelet derived
      growth factor receptor (PDGFR) TK inhibition.
