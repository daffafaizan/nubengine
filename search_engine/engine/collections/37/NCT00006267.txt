        -  Determine the antitumor activity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with recurrent or
           metastatic ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 7
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 22
      months.
