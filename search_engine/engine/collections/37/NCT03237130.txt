      identifying lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer.The study will consider the
      relationship between the main lesion and the suspected lymph node, extract association
      characteristics in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the CT radiomics-based
      prediction model for identifying metastasis lymph nodes. The study includes the construction
      of CT radiomics-based prediction model and the validation of the prediction model.
