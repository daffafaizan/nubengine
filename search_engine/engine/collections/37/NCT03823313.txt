      well as the lives of caregivers and others close to the patient who, when faced with life
      crises, may use religion and spirituality (R/S) to cope. This study is the first of its kind
      to incorporate a semi-structured spiritual care and intervention (SCAI) framework into the
      spiritual care of advanced cancer patients while maintaining proper controls in order to
      investigate its feasibility, acceptability and potential effects on the emotional and
      spiritual outcomes of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers. This framework will
      assess 4 areas of spiritual experience: meaning and purpose, relationships, transcendence and
      peace, self-worth and identity. Additionally, not only will this study assess acceptability
      and feasibility of the intervention, it will also track and document coping, satisfaction,
      anxiety, depression, quality of life outcomes and follow-up with both patient and caregivers
      following Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention (SCAI).

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the SCAI intervention for
      adults with advanced cancer and their caregivers.

      Specific Aim 2: To establish our ability to collect outcome data to support a future efficacy
      trial for patients and their caregivers in the outpatient clinic and home setting.

      Specific Aim 3: To test the preliminary impact of the SCAI intervention on patient and
      caregiver spiritual wellbeing (primary outcome) and quality of life, religious coping,
      depression, and anxiety (secondary outcomes)
