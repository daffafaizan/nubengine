      Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration, at the Mulago National Referral Hospital
      complex in Kampala Uganda. The study will consist of 2 groups. One group will consist of 25
      healthy HIV uninfected adults and the other arm will consist of 35 HIV infected adults.
      Within the HIV infected arm there will be two groups, 25 HIV infected adults and 10 long term
      non-progressors. Vaccinees will receive a primary immunization at day 0, and blood samples
      will be obtained at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 100 after immunization.

      We will analyze the early molecular signatures (identified by microarray analyses, as well as
      by FACS analyses of innate immune cells and luminex analyses of cytokines and chemokines)
      that correlate and predict the later immune responses.
