      afterwards to quantify baseline levels of [D10]phenanthrene tetraol ([D10]pheT) and
      [D10]phenanthrols ([D10]HOP). Within 3 days of this baseline measurement, subjects will
      consume 200 micromoles of glucobrassicin in the form of raw Brussels sprouts (~200-300 grams)
      at the study center once daily for 7 consecutive days. Urine will be collected for 24 h after
      vegetable consumption on days 3 Â± 1 and 6 of the feeding intervention for
      3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) quantification. On day 7 of the feeding intervention, a second
      dose of 1 microgram of [D10]phe will be administered at the study center after vegetable
      consumption, followed by another 6 h urine collection.
