    
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL's) represent a subgroup of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with
      poor prognostic features. Compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas, PTCL's often present with
      more advanced disease and sustain less durable remissions following treatment with
      chemotherapy. With standard anthracycline-based regimens such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), PTCLs achieve inferior 5-year overall survival rates
      of around 40% compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas whose 5-year overall survival rates
      reach 50-60%. While several salvage regimens have been established for B-cell lymphomas with
      moderate success, the guidelines for patients with relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's are less
      clear. Several reports suggest that the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDsÂ®) have clinical
      activity in this setting. The aim of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the activity of
      lenalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's.
