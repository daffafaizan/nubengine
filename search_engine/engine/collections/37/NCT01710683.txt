      analgesic treatments with the use of local analgesics and steroid can reduce the immediate
      postoperative pain and convalescence after surgery. In orthopaedic and abdominal surgery
      accelerated stay programs with early mobilisation have reduced pain in the early
      postoperative periode. The late convalescence after discectomy for herniated disc disease can
      be reduced with the use of epidural steroids.
