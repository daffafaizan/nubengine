        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2b in
           patients with advanced refractory solid tumors or chemotherapy-naive advanced cancer.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in
           this patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of PEG-interferon alfa-2b at the MTD when administered
           with temozolomide in this patient population.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7 and 15-21 and PEG-interferon alfa-2b
      subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-9 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2b
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
