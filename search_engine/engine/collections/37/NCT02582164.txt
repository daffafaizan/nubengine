      speed SSOCT system along with technology to identify and use movies, etc. to aid with
      fixation. This study would be the first testing of such a system, first in adults and then
      moving to older children who could provide feedback, and then to young children.

      This imaging data will be compared to other clinical tests and images collected during
      regular health care and eye examinations.
