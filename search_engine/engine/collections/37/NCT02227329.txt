      nutrition (HPN) patients causing morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. CRBSIs
      may also result in the need for central venous catheter (CVC) removal and replacement.
      Current literature supports the use of antibiotics locks in patients with repeated CRBSI.
      There is a growing concern about the increased risk of microbial resistance with the long
      term use antibiotic locks. Ethanol lock therapy (ELT) has broad spectrum coverage and
      includes gram negative bacteria, gram positive bacteria, atypical bacteria, and fungi.
      Compared with antibiotic and other solution locks, which have limitations, ELT has excellent
      broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal killing action and poses no problems with
      development of resistance over time. There is a lack of a randomized controlled study to
      characterize the role of ELT in adult patients on HPN.
