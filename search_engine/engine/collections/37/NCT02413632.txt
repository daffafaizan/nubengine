    
      Main objectives are :

      create and validate a risk score for STIs (DRIVER score) in a population of HIV-positive men
      who have sex with men (MSM).

      determine the prevalence of asymptomatic STIs in a population of HIV-positive MSM

      Secondary objectives are :

      compare 2 screening strategies regarding STIs in HIV-positive MSM (systematic screening vs
      screening according to self-declared risk factors) conduct a cost-efficiency analysis of both
      strategies evaluate patients' knowledge of STIs develop a DRIVER digital tool that will be
      made available to patients on websites, mobile appsâ€¦

      Position of the problem :

      Over the past 15 years, a resurgence of symptomatic STIs has been observed at both at the
      global and at the local (French) level. This has been true for gonorrhea since 2008, for
      syphilis since 2000 and for lymphogranuloma venereum since 2003. The epidemiology of
      asymptomatic STIs has not been studied as thoroughly but asymptomatic carriage of Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis as well as latent syphilis account for at least half of
      cases declared in the past few years. The population of HIV-positive MSM is the demographic
      category with the highest rates of STIs. In addition, risky sexual attitudes are on the rise
      in the MSM population in general (in 2010, the French RESIST Network reported that condom use
      during anal penetrations between males had dropped from 49% in 2008 to 37% in 2010).

      Screening practices are currently center- and healthcare-provider dependant. Study will allow
      a comparison of screening practices thanks to a score that will be built, validated and made
      available to clinicians and patients.
