      investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the investigational
      drugs to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved itacitinib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      The FDA has approved dabrafenib and trametinib as a treatment option for Melanoma.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of itacitinib,
      dabrafenib, and trametinib. The investigators believe this combination of study drugs may
      stop the participant's cancer cells from growing and spreading. All three of the study drugs
      are inhibitors. Trametinib may work by binding to the participant's cancer cells to inhibit
      the cancer cells' signals to decrease cell growth, dabrafenib may work by stopping the
      participant's cancer cells from duplicating, and itacitinib may work by stopping the
      participant's tumor cells from living and growing.
