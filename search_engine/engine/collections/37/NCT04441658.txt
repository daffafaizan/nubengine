      The trial includes a 3-week early screening and lifestyle education period, 6-week treatment
      period, and 18-week follow-up period. Chinese type 2 diabetic subjects receiving traditional
      hypoglycemic treatment（including insulin） were randomly assigned to umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cell or placebo infusion therapy to observe the efficacy and safety of
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion therapy.
