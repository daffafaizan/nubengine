      Primary

        -  Compare the event-free survival of young patients with newly diagnosed lymphoblastic
           lymphoma treated with induction prednisolone vs dexamethasone.

        -  Compare the safety of standard maintenance treatment over 18 months vs 24 months in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine prognostic factors highly predicative for treatment failure in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Cytoreductive prephase: All patients receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) once on day
           1 and prednisolone IV or orally 3 times daily on days 1-7.

        -  Induction phase (part 1): Patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are
           randomized to 1 of 2 induction treatment arms. Patients with LBL with an unknown
           immunophenotype are assigned to arm I. Patients with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic
           lymphoma (pB-LBL) are assigned to arm II.

             -  Arm I (T-LBL or LBL with an unknown immunophenotype): Patients receive prednisolone
                IV or orally 3 times daily on days 8-28; vincristine IV and daunorubicin
                hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, and 29; asparaginase IV over 1 hour
                on days 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33; and methotrexate IT on days 12 and 33;
                Patients with CNS involvement receive additional methotrexate IT on days 18 and 27.
                Patients then proceed to part 2 of the induction phase.

             -  Arm II (T-LBL or pB-LBL): Patients receive dexamethasone IV or orally 3 times daily
                on days 8-28. Patients also receive vincristine, daunorubicin hydrochloride,
                asparaginase, and methotrexate as in arm I. Patients then proceed to part 2 of the
                induction phase.

        -  Induction phase (part 2): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 36
           and 64; cytarabine IV on days 38-41, 45-48, 52-55, and 59-62; oral mercaptopurine on
           days 36-63; and methotrexate IT on days 45 and 59. Two weeks later, patients proceed to
           protocol M.

        -  Protocol M: Patients receive oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-56 and high-dose
           methotrexate IV continuously over 24 hours, and methotrexate IT on days 8, 22, 36, and
           50. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV 42, 48, and 54 hours after the start of
           high-dose methotrexate infusion. Patients are then stratified according to stage of
           disease (I or II vs III or IV). Patients with stage I or II disease proceed directly to
           maintenance therapy 2 weeks after completion of protocol M. Patients with stage III or
           IV disease proceed to the re-induction phase 2 weeks after completion of protocol M.

        -  Re-induction phase: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or orally 3 times daily on days
           1-21; vincristine IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, and
           29; asparaginase IV over 1 hour on days 8, 11, 15, and 18; cyclophosphamide IV over 1
           hour on day 36; cytarabine IV on days 38-41 and 45-48; oral thioguanine on days 36-49;
           and methotrexate IT on days 38 and 45. Patients proceed to maintenance therapy 2 weeks
           after completion of the re-induction phase.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients with T-LBL are randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance treatment
           arms. Patients with pB-LBL or LBL with an unknown immunophenotype are assigned to arm I.
           Any patients with evidence of initial CNS involvement undergo cranial radiotherapy
           before starting maintenance therapy. Patients must show no evidence of progressive
           disease before starting maintenance therapy.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral mercaptopurine once a day and oral methotrexate once a
                week for up to 2 years (from the first day of the cytoreductive phase) in the
                absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I for up to 1Â½ years (from the first
                day of the cytoreductive phase) in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 600 patients will be accrued for this study.
