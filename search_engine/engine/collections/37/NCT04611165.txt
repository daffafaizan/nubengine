    
      <Treatment phase> Nivolumab 3mg/kg IV is administered as 30-minute IV infusion every 2 weeks.
      External beam radiotherapy begins 2-7 days after the first dose of nivolumab. The study drug
      is continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or study
      closure.

      <Follow-Up phase > After the treatment phase, subjects will undergo follow up for survival
      every 12 weeks (Â± 7 days) from the last dose or the use of other anticancer treatments and/or
      therapies, and the survival follow up will be performed for at least 18 months after the
      enrollment of the last subject. The patient will be followed for survival follow up and the
      use of other anticancer treatments and/or therapies.

      Based on the assumed dropout rate of 12%, a total of 50 subjects need to perform the study
      (50=44/(1-0.12))
