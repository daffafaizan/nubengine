      frequently used first-line. However, it is increasingly evident that these medications have
      harmful metabolic effects. The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR
      - NCT00246519) study was a greater than 700 participant, randomized, parallel assignment
      trial, aimed at determining the genetic factors that influence response to both a
      beta-blocker (atenolol) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]). The PEAR trial design
      includes evaluation at baseline, after monotherapy with either medication, and after
      combination therapy with both medications. This pilot, PEAR sub-study aims to characterize
      the ability of two diagnostics tests (fasting glucose versus glucose 2-hours after an OGTT)
      to detect prediabetes development prior to blood pressure medication use, after monotherapy
      (with atenolol or HCTZ) and after combination therapy (with atenolol and HCTZ).
