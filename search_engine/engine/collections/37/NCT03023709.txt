    
      This is a Phase IV study of licensed influenza vaccines with up to 30 male and female adults,
      18-49 years of age that was halted due to the recommendation that live, attenuated influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) not be used as a seasonal flu vaccine. Volunteers were patients undergoing
      tonsillectomy for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      In the initial pilot phase of the study, up to 3 volunteers will be enrolled and will receive
      the current seasonal quadrivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) given intramuscularly
      to confirm the safety of administering the seasonal influenza vaccine 3-14 days prior to
      tonsillectomy. Enrollment of the remaining study volunteers into the main portion of the
      study will begin once the initial pilot phase is completed. All of the remaining study
      volunteers will be given the current year's quadrivalent, live, attenuated seasonal influenza
      vaccine (LAIV4) intranasally.

      The second study visit for all volunteers will occur at the time of the volunteer's
      tonsillectomy surgery, 3-14 days after Visit 01. A member of the surgical team will collect a
      20 mL blood sample and a sample of the resected tonsil tissue that would otherwise be
      discarded to be distributed to the lab.
