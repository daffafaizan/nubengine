      bariatric surgery. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAU) remains the gold standard for detection of
      cholelithiasis. The sensitivity and specificity of transabdominal ultrasound for
      cholelithiasis reported in literature is between 88-97% and 97-99%, respectively. The ability
      to detect cholelithiasis with TAU in the obese population may be inhibited due to the
      presence of increased subcutaneous and visceral fat. Laparoscopic ultrasound (LU) has the
      potential to overcome these technical challenges. In an era of minimally invasive bariatric
      surgery, it has been suggested that routine preoperative ultrasound TAU be performed for the
      detection of cholelithiasis since intraoperative palpation is not feasible. We hypothesize
      that laparoscopic ultrasound will be more sensitive and specific for cholelithiasis than
      transabdominal ultrasound in morbidly obese patients.
