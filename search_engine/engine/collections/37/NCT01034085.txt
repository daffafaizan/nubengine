    
      Objective:

        1. To evaluate the potential of transdermal nicotine to alleviate distinct cognitive
           deficits in schizophrenia, and to determine whether naturally maintained
           cigarette-smoking, in comparison, is an effective self-medication.

        2. To gather preliminary data on genotypes that may account for interindividual and group
           differences in the performance effects of nicotine.

      Study population:

      45 regular smokers with schizophrenia, 45 matched control smokers (greater than or equal to 5
      cigarettes/day).

      Design:

      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study, evaluating cognitive functions under
      conditions of normal smoking, transdermal nicotine (14 mg/day), and placebo (minimal tobacco
      deprivation).

      Outcome measures:

      Measures of cognitive task performance, measures of subjective state, plasma concentrations
      of nicotine and metabolites, and genotype with regards to genes coding for nicotinic receptor
      subunits, MAO, and COMT.
