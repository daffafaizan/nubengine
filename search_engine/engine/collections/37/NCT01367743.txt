      and is associated with high mortality (50%). Hemodynamic management and notably the choice of
      vasopressor in cardiogenic shock states secondary to myocardial infarction (cardiac index <
      2.2 l/min/m-2) is not codified. There are two opposite views: a) the first is based on the
      fact that an hypotensive patient with low cardiac output is primarily in need of an inotropic
      agent and that, consequently, epinephrine is the molecule of choice (inotropic and
      vasoconstrictor); b) the second is based on the fact that hypotension also reflects a certain
      degree of vascular failure and vascular vasoplegia and therefore norepinephrine is the
      molecule of choice along with, if needed, the eventual addition of dobutamine in order to
      separately titrate vasoconstriction and inotropism.

      Study hypotheses: epinephrine could facilitate myocardial function by providing the latter
      with its preferred substrate (lactate) and thus induce a higher cardiac index along with
      increased energy expenditure. Norepinephrine is the therapy of choice of hypotensive states;
      nevertheless its lack of inotropic effect could theoretically exacerbate myocardial failure.
      Thus, the aim of the study is to compared the efficiency and the tolerability of
      norepinephrine and epinephrine in cardiogenic shock after reperfused myocardial infarction.
