      I. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a diet intervention trial with longitudinal
      microbiome collection in Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) Lung
      Cancer Screening Clinic (OSUCCC-LCSC).

      PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the impact of the black raspberry (BRB) nectar intervention on the microbiome
      and inflammatory biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive BRB nectar orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for weeks 0-4 and then
      receive placebo PO BID for weeks 6-10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also
      undergo collection of nasal swabs, blood, urine, and stool samples at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 10.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for weeks 0-4 and then receive BRB nectar PO BID for
      weeks 6-10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo collection of nasal
      swabs, blood, urine, and stool samples at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 10.
