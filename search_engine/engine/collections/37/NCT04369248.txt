      protein 1, is a new marker for obesity and insulin resistance. In hepatic injury, it protects
      liver cells and promotes regeneration. High levels of hepassocin was shown to be
      independently associated with HOMA-IR and diabetes. Since insulin resistance is known to be
      seen in patients with PCOS, it may be expected that hepassocin levels may be higher in this
      group of patients.
