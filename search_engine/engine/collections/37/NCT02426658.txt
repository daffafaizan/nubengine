      I. To evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) on tumor
      progression in ECOG performance status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology
      non-small cell lung cancer in a single arm pilot study.

      II. To evaluate the effect of single agent pemetrexed on quality of life in ECOG performance
      status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer in a single
      arm pilot study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity associated with single agent pemetrexed on tumor progression in ECOG
      performance status 3 patients with stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer
      in a single arm pilot study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then
      every 6 weeks thereafter.
