      subjects (60 years old or more) are planned to be recruited. The subjects will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups witht a ratio of 1:1. One is the experimental group and the other is
      the control group.

      The experimental group will receive 15 weeks of dietary intervention, including 6
      face-to-face meetings and weekly telephone call. Each meeting lasts for 1 hour. The
      participants in the experimental group are required to control of calorie intake (decrease
      energy intake by 12%) and increase protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/body weight kg/day), and take
      dietary diary.

      The control group will not receive any dietary interventions. They will only receive regular
      contacts with a similar frequency as the experimental group. The content of the conversations
      will not involve any topics related to SO.

      After the intervention, 10-15 people from the experimental group will be randomly selected to
      receive semi-structured individual interview, which will last around 1 hour. The researcher
      plan to understand their feelings about participating in the study.
