      basis of a benign condition. The expected mean pain reduction (m) in the LSH group: 3.32, sd
      (s): 2.71.24 A difference in mean pain reduction (d) equal to 1 sd is considered a clinically
      important improvement (standardised difference d/s=1). Number of women required (power 90 %
      and a level of significance 0.05): 62 patients.

      Methods: The study participants are randomised to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 31),
      or laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (n = 31).
