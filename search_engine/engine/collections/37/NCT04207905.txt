      As stated by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the overarching
      goals of the Healthy Michigan Plan (HMP) demonstration are to increase access to quality
      health care, encourage the utilization of high-value services, promote beneficiary adoption
      of healthy behaviors, and implement evidence-based practice initiatives.

      The main objectives of MDHHS for HMP include:

        -  Improving access to healthcare for uninsured or underinsured low-income Michigan
           residents;

        -  Improving the quality of healthcare services delivered;

        -  Reducing uncompensated care;

        -  Strengthening beneficiary engagement and personal responsibility;

        -  Encouraging individuals to seek preventive care, adopt healthy behaviors, and make
           responsible decisions about their healthcare;

        -  Supporting coordinated strategies to address social determinants of health in order to
           promote positive health outcomes, greater independence, and improved quality of life;

        -  Helping uninsured or underinsured individuals manage their health care issues;

        -  Encouraging quality, continuity, and appropriate medical care.

      The evaluation for this demonstration is focused on examining:

        -  The impact of the community engagement requirement on enrollees' employment, earnings
           and financial well-being; enrollment in other public support programs; health outcomes;
           and health insurance status (HMP, commercial health insurance, or uninsurance);

        -  The extent to which new eligibility and coverage policies impact:

             -  Hospital uncompensated care

             -  Insurance coverage in the state

             -  Overall HMP enrollment and characteristics of HMP enrollees

             -  Enrollees' health care utilization

             -  Medicaid health service expenditures

        -  The impact HMP has had on enrollees' health outcomes, employment status, and financial
           well-being;

        -  The experiences of HMP enrollees who are disenrolled regarding insurance coverage
           status, access to care, and re-enrollment; and

        -  Medicaid program sustainability, including Medicaid expenditures.

      The RCT design involves the random selection of a control group of HMP enrollees from across
      the state who are expected to be subject to the community engagement requirement but who are
      designated as being not subject to this requirement during the evaluation period (January 1,
      2020 through December 31, 2023). This control group will be compared to an intervention group
      of HMP enrollees who will be subject to the community engagement requirement. Individuals who
      enroll in HMP after randomization occurs will not be eligible for inclusion in the control
      group.

      The random selection of the control group (22,917 HMP enrollees, representing 10% of the
      individuals identified as subject to the work requirements as of November 2019) was performed
      in December 2019. This sample size for the control group will enable longitudinal analysis of
      key outcomes (e.g., employment, insurance coverage, self-reported health status, health
      services utilization, income, and credit outcomes) over the demonstration period, with
      sufficient statistical power to assess differences in these outcomes.

      Data sources will include beneficiary surveys; state administrative data, including Medicaid
      enrollment files, Medicaid administrative claims, specialty behavioral health administrative
      claims, Michigan Care Improvement Registry immunization history, health risk assessment
      tables, cost-share tables, and other Medicaid tables; state workforce data, including state
      unemployment insurance program data; and public use data, including American Community
      Survey, Current Population Survey, Medicaid enrollment data from Medicaid Budget and
      Expenditure System (MBES), Medicaid and Medicare cost reports, Credit data, Behavioral Risk
      Factor Surveillance System, Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP) inpatient discharge
      data, and program administrative cost data.
