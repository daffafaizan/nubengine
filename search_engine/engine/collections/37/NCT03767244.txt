      prostate cancers. A systemic therapy that eradicates micrometastatic disease is needed to
      improve survival in high-risk participants undergoing RP with pLND. It is hypothesized that
      androgen blockade prior to and after RP with pLND may improve outcomes for participants at
      the highest risk for recurrence. This study is designed to evaluate if androgen blockade
      administered prior to and after RP with pLND will increase the rate of pathological complete
      response (pCR) and lead to better overall outcomes. ERLEADA (apalutamide, also known as
      JNJ-56021927 and ARN-509) is an orally available, non-steroidal small molecule, which acts as
      a potent and selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), currently being developed
      for the treatment of prostate cancer. The study includes screening phase (approximately up to
      35 days before randomization), treatment phase (the planned Treatment Phase will include a
      total of 12 treatment cycles of apalutamide or placebo; 6 cycles prior to RP with pLND (Cycle
      1 through Cycle 6) and 6 cycles after RP with pLND (Cycle 7 through Cycle 12). Cycle 1 Day 1
      will start within 3 days after randomization) and follow-up phase. The end of study (study
      completion) is defined as last participant assessment at study site with approximate study
      duration of 8 years. Participants will undergo efficacy, pharmacokinetics and biomarker
      evaluations. The safety will be monitored throughout the study.
