      resolution of septic shock, whichever occurs first. MB will be injected as a bolus of 2 mg/kg
      subsequently followed by dose-titrated infusion. The latter beginning with 0.25 mg/kg/h
      continuing within the range of from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg/h. The goal is to maintain mean
      arterial pressure within the range of 70-90 mm Hg, with the purpose of reducing any
      concurrent vasopressor therapy. The NO therapy will be started from 10 ppm and aimed at
      maintaining the mean pulmonary artery pressure at the lowest possible levels by inhaling NO
      in concentrations from 1 to 20 ppm.
