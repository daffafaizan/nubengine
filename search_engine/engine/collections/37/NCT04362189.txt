      Efficacy of HB-adMSCs to treat COVID-19 patients. 100 patients will be enrolled. Eligible
      participants are suspected to have COVID-19 and consent to participate. The primary endpoints
      of this study are to detect change from baseline in inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10,
      TNF-alpha, C Reactive protein), improving oxygenation, and decreasing time to return to room
      air (RTRA). In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by
      standard clinical laboratories, change from baseline in exploratory markers (D-dimer,
      myoglobin, troponin, creatinine kinase MB, serum ferritin, CD4:CD8 ratio, CD3-CD56+), time to
      negative PCR results and clinical improvement according to 7-point ordinal scale, as well as
      incidence of adverse events.
