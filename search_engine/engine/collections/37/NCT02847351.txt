      clearly that it delays the onset of cardiovascular disease and some cancers, and improves
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. (1,2). Overweight and obesity are known to be associated
      with increased rate of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as well as to
      colon and breast cancer. The introduction of 25-30gr of dietary fiber daily would therefore
      indicated not only in type 2 diabetic subjects, but also in obese and overweight patients.
      Most of the foods commonly consumed in Western countries are low in dietary fiber: to reach
      the recommended levels people should introduce whole grain cereals, legumes, vegetables and
      dried fruits, not always accepted. We tested the effects on health of crackers baked with a
      special IntegralbiancoÂ® flour, enriched with 3,2g of Arabinoxylan / 100g (vs refined flour).
