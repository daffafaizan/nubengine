      In the first phase data will be collected on all women who had vaginal deliveries between
      2010 and 2015 who had a procedure code indicative of transfusion (99.0x) or received a
      diagnosis suggestive of peripartum hemorrhage (e.g. diagnosis x code 666.xx, 641.x, 645.x,
      646.x 674.x). Phase 2 will consist of all women who delivered (vaginally) at HackensackUMC
      who had blood loss and measured quantitatively by Triton and qualitatively (i.e., EBL) by
      obstetrician. This will be accomplished by reviewing the records of women who delivered and
      were discharged within the data collection period.
