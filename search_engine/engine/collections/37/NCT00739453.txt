    
      The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1), in which OSI-906 is administered on Days 1-3 every
      7 days. Erlotinib will be administered daily starting on Day 2. A treatment period is defined
      as 21 days.

      Initiation of Schedule 2 (S2), in which OSI-906 is administered daily starting on Day 1 and
      erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of clinically
      significant related toxicity >/= grade 2 in any patient on S1 or after > 2 dose levels in S1
      have been examined without evidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).

      Initiation of Schedule 3 (S3), in which OSI-906 is administered twice daily starting on Day 1
      and erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of
      clinically significant related toxicity >/= grade 2 in any patient on S2 or after > 2 dose
      levels in S2 have been examined without evidence of DLT.

      Once the phase 2 dose has been established for S3, 1 expansion cohort will be opened.

      The Expansion Cohort will enroll approximately 30 evaluable patients with stage IIIB/IV
      Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Patients in the NSCLC Expansion Cohort will be
      required to have either archival tissue or fresh tumor tissue available at the start of
      study.
