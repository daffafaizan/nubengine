    
      This protocol is designed to allow the evaluation, follow up, and standard medical care of
      patients (and when appropriate, their stem cell donor) with bone marrow failure states,
      cytopenias, metastatic solid tumors, or hematologic malignancies not currently entered on an
      active NHLBI protocol or not being screened for an active NHLBI research protocol. Its
      purpose is to allow investigation into the hematologic problems of these patients for the
      primary purpose of teaching and furthering general hematologic knowledge. The ability to
      evaluate and treat patients with a wide variety of hematologic disease is critical to
      maintaining our accreditation as a hematology fellowship program and training our fellows to
      be competent hematologists, as well as for keeping all staff, including senior staff,
      up-to-date and familiar with the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide spectrum of
      hematologic disease. It also allows the NHLBI investigators to evaluate patients referred
      with rare or as yet undiagnosed hematologic problems, both potentially benefiting the patient
      and stimulating new research directions for the NHLBI in the future. Periodic follow-up and
      treatment of patients previously entered on NHLBI protocols in order to monitor the long-term
      course of the underlying hematologic state and the consequences of experimental treatments is
      also required for fellowship training, and for maintenance of good referral relationships
      with patients and their physicians.
