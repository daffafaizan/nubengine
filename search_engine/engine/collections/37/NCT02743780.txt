      to placebo in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MGV354 in a multiple ascending dose design (two highest tolerated doses from
      Part 1) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days to patients with ocular hypertension
      or glaucoma. Part 3 will explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single dose level
      of MGV354 (maximum tolerated dose) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days in
      patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.
