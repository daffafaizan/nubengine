      cancer with poor prognosis, the median survival time of patients is less than 1 year and even
      worse in China. Recently, several new modalities have been developed and reported to improve
      survival, including the new chemotherapeutic agents, molecular targeting agents and
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy（HIPEC）.Still, the long-term outcomes based on
      multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are awaited.

      The surgical approach to metastatic lesions has been proved to play a very crucial role in
      prolonging the survival of metastatic colorectal patients, which might be able to cure
      patients with the operation aiming at R0 resection. For patients with metastatic gastric
      cancer, surgical intervention of primary tumor and measurable metastatic lesion is
      technically feasible, while the survival benefit is controversial. Even though the REGATTA
      trial demonstrated that the removal of the primary tumor is not necessarily beneficial, the
      role of operation aiming at R0 resection combined with new regimens like HIPEC and new
      chemotherapeutic agents is still confusing and new categories of classification for
      metastatic gastric cancer based on the treatment response is needed.

      In order to evaluate the survival benefit and safety of cytoreductive surgery(CRS) and HIPEC
      before beginning chemotherapy in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis, patients who
      fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited in this study and receive CRS,
      HIPEC and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimen based on cisplatin and fluorouracil(CF) are
      recommended. Patients are followed up for 2 years and the safety and survival outcome will be
      analyzed.
