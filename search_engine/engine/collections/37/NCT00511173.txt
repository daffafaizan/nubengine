      requiring warfarin therapy will be consented and a tube of blood for DNA analysis will be
      drawn. The clinician dosing group will not be eligible to obtain the pharmacogenetic results
      and the algorithm group will have their warfarin pharmacogenetic SNPs performed and
      integrated into the algorithm and the warfarin dose will be calculated. Outcomes of patients
      receiving both methods will be gathered and statistically analyzed.
