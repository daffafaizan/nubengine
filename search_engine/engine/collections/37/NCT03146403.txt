    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of GEN-003 in
      subjects who have received previous doses of GEN-003 in the GEN-003-003 clinical trial.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 intramuscular (IM) dose (the
      maintenance dose) of GEN-003 or placebo.

      Subjects will use a daily electronic reporting tool for reporting the presence or absence of
      genital herpes lesions, and severity of genital herpes symptoms.

      GEN-003-005 was originally designed to follow subjects for 12 months after the maintenance
      dose but a business decision, unrelated to product safety, was made by Genocea Biosciences in
      3Q2017 to cease GEN-003 spending and activities.
