      not all well understood and the understanding about them is developing constantly. In our
      study we plan to check a large number of immunological parameters to broaden the scope of
      knowledge of evaluating individuals for immune health across multiple sub fields of medicine
      and for advancing a basic understanding of immune cell signaling.

      The study will involve 70 participants between ages 18-45 of both sexes. Persons enrolled to
      the study will have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis caused by dust mite or persons who
      developed a systemic reaction following bee sting who are candidates to be treated by
      immunization.

      After verification of diagnosis of allergic condition and decision to start immunizations,
      blood samples will be drawn from participants before immunization weekly for 24 weeks. Blood
      samples will be analyzed in order to identify immune cell subset differences that change in
      response to allergy immunotherapy. Comparisons will be made of baseline and
      stimulation-induced status of protein phosphorylation individuals over the time-series course
      in which they receive allergy immunotherapy to pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying
      desensitization. Evaluations will be made of cellular mechanisms of allergy immunotherapy by
      comparing over time and between groups, through serum cytokine profiling and blood gene
      expression of individuals undergoing allergy immunotherapy shots.
