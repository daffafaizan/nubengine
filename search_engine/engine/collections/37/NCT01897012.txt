      I. To assess the safety profile of alisertib (MLN8237) plus romidepsin. II. To determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if reached, of MLN8237 administered in combination with
      romidepsin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) of the combined
      regimen.

      II. To assess whether higher levels of expression of aurora kinase A correlate with outcomes.

      III. To determine if this combination results in downregulation of targets of v-myc
      myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (C-Myc) in C-Myc positive patients, induces
      mitotic catastrophe, changes immune system or other host responses, or upregulates markers
      for apoptosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 (dose levels 1-4) or
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 (dose levels 5-8). Patients also receive romidepsin intravenously
      (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 8 (dose levels 1-4) or 2, 9, and 16 (dose levels 5-8).
      Treatment repeats every 21 days (dose levels 1-4) or 28 days (dose levels 5-8) for up to 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
