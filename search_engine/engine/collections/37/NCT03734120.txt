      3 and 6 month on sperm numeration, motility, vitality, morphology, acrosomal integrity and
      DNA fragmentation.

      Design: Experimental study, investigator was blinded to the type of Cryopreservation.

      Patient(s): Semen samples were collected from patients who came in laboratory for semen
      analysis

      Intervention: Samples were frozen with a programmable freezing unit. Each semen sample was
      divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was plunged into liquid nitrogen and the other was
      stored in dry-phase nitrogen for 3 or 6 month. Thawing was performed at room temperature.
