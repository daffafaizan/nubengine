      representative sample of the Danish population aged 4-80 years, and provide data for
      surveillance of the food and nutrient intake and physical activity of the general population.

      The survey is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey, which includes face-to-face
      interviews, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement, blood sampling, 7-day
      web-based food diaries, and pedometer-determined physical activity which is recorded in 7-day
      web-based step diaries. In the interview socio-demographic details as well as lifestyle and
      health attitudes are recorded. Web-based food and step diaries are collected in the entire
      survey population of 4000 individuals, blood pressure is measured in 15-80 year-olds, and
      biological samples (blood) are collected in a subpopulation of approximately 1000 individuals
      aged 40-70 years. Biomarker of metabolic health are measured in a blood sample drawn after an
      overnight fast. The blood-based biomarkers (cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose),
      anthropometric data and blood pressure measurements are used to assess the prevalence of the
      metabolic syndrome (WHO definition) in 40-70 year-old Danes. Surplus blood samples are stored
      in a biobank for 30 years.

      The data from the survey provide the evidence base to support work by the authorities to
      facilitate the adoption of healthier eating and physical activity behavior and reduce
      lifestyle-related diseases. Another objective is to provide detailed data on food consumption
      at the individual level, which enables food chemical exposure assessment and forms an
      essential part of food safety risk assessment. Furthermore, the data will be used to assess
      the environmental impact of the diet.
