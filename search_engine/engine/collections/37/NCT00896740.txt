        -  Describe the complete hematopoietic transcriptomes of Fanconi cells of every common
           complementation group (e.g., A, C, G, and F) as well as transcriptomes of neoplastic
           cells derived from bone marrow of patients with Fanconi anemia.

        -  Define large-scale dynamic gene expression data in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy volunteers undergo bone marrow aspiration or biopsy for biological
      studies. Samples are analyzed for gene expression profiles using microarray assays.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients and 10 healthy volunteers will be accrued for this
      study.
