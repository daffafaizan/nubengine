      based on the Greek version of the print MNREAD.

      Specifically, it aims to evaluate the level of agreement between the conventional printed
      greek MNREAD chart and the corresponding digital chart, as well as test-retest reliability of
      the digital optotype.

      To address these aims, four reading parameters measured with the print and the digital
      version are compared. These parameters are the following:

        1. Reading Acuity (RA)

        2. Maximum Reading Speed (MRS)

        3. Critical Print Size (CPS)

        4. Accessibility Index (ACC)

      All the comparisons take place in two groups: a) a Normal Vision Group (NVG), and b) a Low
      Vision Group (LVG) in order to estimate the reading capacity in a population with a wide
      range of vision.
