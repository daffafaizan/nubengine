      Department of Cardiac Surgery and Department of Anesthesiology, University Medical Center,
      Heidelberg, Germany Exploratory proof of concept study (Investigator initiated trial)

      Indication: Postoperative pulmonary hypertension in infants and children undergoing
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for intracardiac repair of left-to-right shunt

      Objectives: To compare the efficacy of aerosolized iloprost with inhaled nitric oxide to
      prevent postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crises

      Design: Exploratory, open label, randomized study with parallel-group design;

      Duration of observation: 72 hours

      Population: Infants older than 4 weeks and children less than 18 months of age presenting
      with left-to-right shunt and increased pulmonary blood flow. Inclusion will be independent on
      the presence or absence of preoperative pulmonary hypertension

      Sample Size:

        -  20 patients: inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) - group;

        -  20 patients: aerosolized iloprost (ILO) -group

      Treatment:

        -  Both groups: controlled ventilation, sedation, analgetics, inotropic substances as
           required, standardized intensive care treatment.

        -  iNO - group: concentration of iNO at 10 ppm; administered by mechanical ventilation.

        -  ILO - group: aerosolized Iloprost at a dose of 0,5 Âµg/kg body weight (12x / 24h),
           administered by ultrasound nebulizer.

      Efficacy Parameters: Occurrence of "minor" or "major" pulmonary hypertensive crises (PHTC)

      Safety Parameters: Arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, complete blood count

      Statistical Procedures: All analyses in this exploratory trial are descriptive, giving
      confidence intervals for differences between treatment groups.

      Primary analysis variable: Rate of occurrence of "major" or "minor" pulmonary hypertensive
      crises

      Secondary variables: Presence of hours of pulmonary hypertension, Duration of mechanical
      ventilation
