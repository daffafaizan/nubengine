      factors: age, province, type of locality, race, economic household conditions, and marital
      status. Those to be reached through the ASPIRES intervention and evaluation are economically
      disadvantaged Black African youth, male and female, located in urban localities in Gauteng
      province, and are situated within a setting of high risk and vulnerability for HIV. The
      ASPIRES project is providing technical assistance to provide economic strengthening (ES) and
      HIV prevention education programming for adolescents. The ASPIRES ES intervention includes
      financial capability building through the provision of financial education in combination
      with access to appropriate youth-friendly savings mechanisms. The HIV prevention education
      intervention Vhutshilo 2.2 will be used in this study.

      This study will assess whether the integration of an ES intervention with an HIV-prevention
      education intervention improves economic and health outcomes beyond singular interventions,
      estimate the resources required at the program level to support the ES and HIV-prevention
      education interventions; and describe whether the interventions were perceived as effective
      in addressing economic and health outcomes and to describe how and why the interventions were
      perceived as effective or not.

      This study will enroll up to 2000 youth ages 14-17 and randomly assign them to either 1) ES
      intervention only, 2) HIV prevention intervention only, 3) combined ES and HIV intervention,
      or 4) no intervention.
