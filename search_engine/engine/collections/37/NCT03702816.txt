      Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. The cohort has been established under the NIH Center of
      Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant and involves annual collection of detailed
      neuropsychological testing and biomarkers (blood and neuroimaging) from all participants
      annually. Data are filed in a registry (CNTN). Participants include healthy controls,
      participants with PD (with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) and patients with MCI
      (with or without positive florbetapir scan, which demonstrates underlying AD changes likely
      causing the cognitive impairment) and patients with AD. For the current study, we will focus
      on patients with MCI with associated underlying AD or PD.

      Participants will undergo GE180 PET. This will occur twice, once at baseline and one year
      after initial testing. The approach to PET data collection and analysis will be similar to
      work done previously with an earlier generation ligand (Edison et al., 2008) and to other
      work with this tracer (Fan et al., 2016). Participants will complete ECGs and have their
      vitals taken prior to and immediately following injections. Briefly, the ligand will be
      injected, there will be a 90 minute uptake period, and scan acquisition will commence for 30
      minutes, and will be collected in list mode and rebinned into 18 time frames post
      acquisition.

      The total duration of the study visit will be around 4 hours, and the participants will
      receive $50 compensation for the visit.
