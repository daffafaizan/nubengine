      studied to identify the gene(s) involved in GPS using linkage analysis and gene mapping
      strategies. Up to 200 individual members of GPS families will be investigated to identify
      candidate regions of the human genome, which will be further studied using fine mapping and
      sequence analysis. Characterization of gene(s) involved in GPS could provide important
      insight into the mechanisms of vesicle formation and protein sorting in human cells.
