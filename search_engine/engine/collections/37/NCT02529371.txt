      patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the toilet.
      Others may be incontinent of urine. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often placed
      to relieve patients while they are incapacitated; in many cases a catheter is placed despite
      lack of urinary retention. Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with
      discomfort, pain, and urinary tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may
      be used, or a condom-type urine collection device. These may be associated with skin
      irritation and infection.

      The study will evaluate the UriCap-RM non-invasive urine collection device in hospitalized
      men.
