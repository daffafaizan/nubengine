      sessions. The first session was undertaken in a mock MRI scanner and was designed to
      determine if participants could tolerate withdrawal in the scanning environment. Participants
      who were able to successfully and safely tolerate opioid withdrawal while in the scanner were
      approved to continue with the following study sessions. Participants were then pretreated
      intravenously (IV) with either 0.9% normal saline placebo or 8mg ondansetron. Later,
      participants in all sessions received IV naloxone (10mg/70kg) to precipitate opioid
      withdrawal. Participants were assigned to ondansetron or placebo pretreatment conditions in a
      randomized, double-blinded, and counter-balanced order. Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale
      (OOWS) and Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) were assessed throughout the study to
      quantify withdrawal. Study timeline progressed as follows: T=-165, 8mg ondansetron or placebo
      infusion, T=-135, Morphine infusion (10mg/70kg), T=-41 preparation for MRI, T=-21, start MRI,
      T=-13, baseline OOWS/SOWS, T=-9, start of fMRI, T=0 Naloxone induced withdrawal, T=5, OOWS,
      T=15, OOWS, T=20, Retrospective OOWS.
