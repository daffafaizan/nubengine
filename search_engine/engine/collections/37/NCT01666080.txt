      consent to allow routine clinical data to be collected and maintained in OnCore, the Masonic
      Cancer Center's (MCC) clinical database, and specific transplant related endpoints in the
      University Of Minnesota Blood and Bone Marrow Database as part of the historical database
      maintained by the department.
