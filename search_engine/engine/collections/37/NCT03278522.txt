      surgery under general anesthesia. Group I (n=21) receive 0.6mg of ramosetron at anesthesia
      induction. Group R (n=21) received the same at the end of surgery. PONV is evaluated at
      arrival to post-anesthetic care unit (PACU), before induction, discharge from PACU, 24-, 48-,
      and 72- after discharge from PACU. The QTc interval is checked before anesthesia, at arrival
      to PACU, and 24-h after discharge from PACU.

      Forty two subjects are needed with an Î± value of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and effect size
      difference of 0.9.
