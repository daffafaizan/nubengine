      Children aged 6 to 17 years with overweight and obesity (based on the WHO growth criteria)
      will be randomly assigned to receive GNN or placebo (maltodextrin) (both at a dose of 3
      g/day) for 3 months and will be followed up for 3 months. Prior to the intervention, all
      children will receive dietetic advice, and they will be encouraged to engage in physical
      activity. The primary outcome measure will be the BMI-for-age z-score difference between the
      groups at the end of the intervention.
