      "dual-controlled" modes, as AutoFlow, are supposed to improve patient-ventilator interfacing,
      and could led to lesser alarm. This study is a long term clinical evaluation of AutoFlow
      during assist-controlled ventilation, focusing on its efficacy (on gas exchange and outcome)
      and on ventilator alarms.
