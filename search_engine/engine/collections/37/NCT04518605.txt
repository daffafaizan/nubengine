    
      The study is a 2Ã—2-factorial randomized controlled trial with 4 study arms. One-hundred (100)
      subjects will be randomly allocated to eat breakfast consisting of high-protein yoghurt
      (300g/day) with oats or an isocaloric breakfast consisting of bread, jam and juice matched
      for fat and fiber content and to either exercise 3x per week or maintain habitual physical
      activity for 12 weeks. Measurements and biological sampling will be performed at baseline,
      half way (some parameters only) and at the end of the intervention period.

      The primary outcome will be fat mass and fat free mass determined by DXA. The investigators
      will also measure effects on weight, waist, health-related blood parameters, muscle function,
      physical activity, habitual food intake and metabolites in faeces, urine and blood.
