      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, especially overall survival (OS), in the TPF program. 2. Secondary
      purpose: To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) local failure-free survival (LR-FFS),
      the short-term remission rate of the tumor, the adverse chemotherapy response, and the
      treatment compliance Sex, as well as quality of life. 3. Significance of the research project
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Platinum-based
      chemotherapy is used in the treatment of distant metastasis and metastasis. It can
      effectively alleviate local symptoms and reduce local symptoms. The tumor volume thereby
      reduces the high dose area of the target area. Primary lesions and lymphatic drainage area
      radiotherapy can reduce tumor burden, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.
