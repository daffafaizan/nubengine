        -  To evaluate the dose response relationship of a single IV dose of HM10760A on
           pharmacodynamic parameters including hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and reticulocyte
           hemoglobin content

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of single IV dose levels of HM10760A

        -  To determine the pharmacologically active dose(PAD) of HM10760A

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of a single IV dose of HM10760A
