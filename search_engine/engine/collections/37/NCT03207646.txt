      remains poorly prescribed and utilized, often due to the lack of access to programs, poor
      insurance coverage, cost, or patient or physician motivational factors. Low-cost solutions
      that can improve patient adherence to medications, risk factor reduction, and exercise could
      improve cardiovascular outcomes and cost-effectiveness compared to current care models.
