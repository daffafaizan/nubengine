      treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
      directed against VEGF, resulted in an improvement in median progression-free survival when
      compared to placebo in a prospective, randomized trial. More recently, the multitargeted
      agents sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved for use in the treatment of advanced renal
      cell carcinoma. Both have proven superior to previous interferon and other standard
      treatment; however it is not clear how these drugs should be used in the treatment sequence.
      With roughly 80% of cancer patients receiving their oncology care in the community setting,
      we are proposing a review and evaluation of at least 200 advanced renal cell carcinoma
      patients.
