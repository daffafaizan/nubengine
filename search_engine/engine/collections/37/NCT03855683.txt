      I. Identify specific patterns of executive function impairment that distinguish affective and
      cognitive symptoms in anxious and/or depressed patients.

      II. Identify specific components of executive function that predict Unified Protocol
      treatment response. This will set up subsequent cognitive intervention studies targeting
      those components.

      The phone screen includes a confidentiality statement explaining how their information will
      be kept confidential, demographic questions, and questions regarding the participants'
      medical and psychiatric history, and current psychological state. Responses to these
      questions will be used to determine if the individual meets inclusion criteria to engage in
      the study. If the participant meets study eligibility criteria, he/she will be invited to an
      informational session not exceeding two and a half hours at Dr. Warren's lab, which involves
      an explanation the project, informed consent, some questionnaires, and a diagnostic clinical
      interview. Also during the first visit, participants will be informed of the upcoming visits
      and the types of activities they will be asked to engage in for the purposes of this study.
      During a second visit, subjects will undergo cognitive testing designed to measure set
      shifting, working memory updating, cognitive inhibition, processing speed, general
      intelligence, and attentional control. These tests will be administered at Dr. Warren's lab
      and will not exceed two and a half hours. The remainder of the study visits will involve an
      8-week, cognitive-behavioral group therapy titled "Unified Protocol," to take place at the
      Gronowski Clinic. Treatment groups will be facilitated by Dr. Warren and co-facilitated by
      trained graduate students selected by Dr. Warren.
