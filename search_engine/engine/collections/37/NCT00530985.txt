      among veterans who apply for VA benefits. Benefits Counseling involves providing claimants
      information about rehabilitation and work-related activities, benefits determination and
      management, and available substance abuse treatment . Benefits Counseling is designed to
      increase motivation to be active and promote engagement in substance abuse treatment. After
      enrolling 15 participants in an open-label pilot phase, 300 veterans who are not receiving
      benefits and are applying to VBA for disability benefits will be randomly assigned to
      Benefits Counseling or the control condition, VA Orientation, and both groups will be
      followed for one year.

      The primary outcome measures will be observer-rated and self-rated quality of life. Secondary
      outcome measures will include substance use and treatment utilization.
