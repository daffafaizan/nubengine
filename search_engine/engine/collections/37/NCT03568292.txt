      I. To determine the feasibility of VR in patients undergoing procedural intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate differences between the two arms in terms of pain and anxiety. II. To document
      any adverse events that could possibly be attributed to the VR intervention.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the use of biomarkers as a tool to reflect the impact of intervention.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants undergo VR intervention peri-procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar
      puncture) lasting until completion of the procedure.

      ARM II: Participants receive standard of care during procedure (bone marrow biopsy or lumbar
      puncture).
