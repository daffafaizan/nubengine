    
      This is a phase I open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial designed to observe and
      evaluate the safety, cell metabolokinetics, and efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused
      intravenously at single escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Primary objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused intravenously at
      escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectivesï¼š

        -  To evaluate the metabolic kinetics of single infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells

        -  To observe the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular
           carcinoma
