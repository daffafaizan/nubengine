      metastatic lung cancer, and about 50% of them are pan-negative for driver mutations. The
      median overall survival(OS) for these patients is 11 months, and maintenance therapy can only
      prolong 2 months of OS. The NCCN guidelines recommend 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy with or
      without maintenance chemotherapy.

      Published data showed that radiotherapy modulates tumor phenotypes, enhances antigen
      presentation and tumor immunogenicity. The regression of out-field lesions was termed as
      "abscopal effect". The combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapeutic agents may promote
      the host anti-tumor immune response and increase the rate of abscopal effect.Published data
      showed that abscopal effect appeared in 20%-30% patients with metastatic malignant tumors who
      were treated with the combination of SBRT and GM-CSF.

      The investigators evaluate the efficacy of the combination of SBRT and GM-CSF in the
      multi-metastatic NSCLC participants who are pan-negative for driver mutations. Patients
      enrolled will be randomized into two groups. The control group will receive the standard
      regimen as NCCN recommends. The experimental group will receive both the standard
      chemotherapy and the extra SBRT to primary lesions or metastatic lesions combined with
      GM-CSF. The investigators compare progress free survival(PFS) of the two groups.
