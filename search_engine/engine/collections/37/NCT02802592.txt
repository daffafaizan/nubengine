      and administration of single preoperative high dose shot of epoetin alfa (rhEPO) in a young
      (age < 65 years of age) population undergoing cardiac surgery. The investigator believes that
      participants can tolerate a lower Hemoglobin (Hgb). Therefore, the control group will benefit
      from a restrictive transfusion trigger and experimental group will benefit from EPO providing
      a synergistic stimulus for erythropoiesis. This proposed study has potential to reduce
      overall transfusion utilization in cardiac surgery and improve standard of care.
