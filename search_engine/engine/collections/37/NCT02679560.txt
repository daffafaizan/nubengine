      bupivacaine will result in less total opioid administration during the randomization period
      compared to a fascia iliaca compartment block using 0.2% ropivacaine.

      The long-term goal of this study is to provide pilot information to guide and design larger,
      multicenter trials which will evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of long acting
      liposomal bupivacaine as an opioid-sparring analgesic strategy in injured trauma patients.
      Ultimately, it is hoped that this information can improve safe and effective narcotic sparing
      analgesia in the awake, combat casualty, as well as serve as primary steps towards
