      intravenously administered. GRP78 is a key regulator of misfolded protein processing, which
      is unregulated in cancer cells. In nonclinical anti-tumor studies, NKP-1339 showed activity
      against many tumor types, including those resistant to platinum and other standard
      anti-cancer agents. This Phase I trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated
      dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NKP-1339.
