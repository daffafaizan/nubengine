      Recent data suggest that excising endometriomas by ovarian tissue sparing cystectomy does not
      avoid inadvertent removal of ovarian parenchyma surrounding the cyst, particularly in
      enlarged cysts. Although several authors question whether the ovarian parenchyma immediately
      surrounding the cyst may still be functional, there is little doubt that postoperative
      fertility could be significantly impaired by loss of ovarian cortex and provokes the question
      as to whether pregnancy should be initiated before performing a cystectomy, whenever this
      scenario is possible. However ovarian surgery cannot always be delayed to the postpartum
      period, numerous women require endometrioma management while not seeking an immediate
      pregnancy and still wish to conserve their procreative capabilities.

      After a period of some years during which cystectomy appeared to be the best surgical
      technique in the treatment of ovarian endometriomas in women wishing to become pregnant,
      recent data have suggested that ablation of the inner layer of the endometrioma may be a
      valuable alternative technique, as long as the energy employed avoids thermal diffusion to
      surrounding ovarian tissue. The Department of Gynecology at the University Hospital in Rouen,
      France have introduced ablation by plasma energy using the PlasmaJet system (Plasma Surgical
      Ltd, Abingdon, UK) and have already been able to report encouraging results based on non
      comparative pilot studies and on retrospective "before and after" comparative study.

      The aim of the study is to prospectively compare loss of ovarian parenchyma and decrease in
      antral follicle count (AFC) following ovarian endometrioma ablation using plasma energy
      versus cystectomy, when performed by only two expert surgeons. Postoperative examination is
      carried out by 3D ultrasound.
