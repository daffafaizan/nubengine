      fractures, to guide the rational use of blood during surgery, and to improve the prognosis of
      patients.

      2.2 Research content: 2.2.1 Collect basic data, surgical data, blood transfusion related data
      and patient prognosis related data of patients with pelvic fractures.

      2.2.2 Gradually incorporate and exclude data from multiple linear regression models.

      2.2.3 Verify the specificity and sensitivity of the intraoperative blood transfusion
      prediction model.

      2.2.4 Create a visualization window to guide clinical blood. 2.2.5 Put into clinical trial
      and feedback, and continue to verify 2.3 Key issues to be resolved 2.3.1 The factors related
      to intraoperative blood transfusion in patients with pelvic fractures (such as blood
      oxygenation, blood loss, HB value, intraoperative autologous blood recovery, blood pressure,
      heart rate, etc.) were initially screened by univariate analysis.

      2.3.2 Reasonably standardize the objective and subjective indicators of different units and
      different institutions.

      2.4 Expected research results Intraoperative blood transfusion prediction model and window
      for patients with pelvic fractures.

      2.5 Assessment indicators Published 1-2 papers. Create a visual applet and put it into trial.
