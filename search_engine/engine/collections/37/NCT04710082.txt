    
      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is nowadays one of the commonest refractive procedures in
      laser vision correction (LVC). PRK differs from laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in that
      it's a flapless procedure involving the removal of corneal epithelium with different
      techniques including manual removal , alcohol assisted removal or excimer laser assisted
      removal with phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). Mechanical or alcohol assisted debridement
      of the epithelium may lead to potential basement membrane (BM) injury ,with resultant more
      significant haze and pain compared to laser assisted epithelial removal known as 2 step
      trans-epithelial PRK (PTK-PRK).

      Single step trans-epithelial PRK allows removing the epithelium and stroma in a single step
      with a single ablation profile.

      Previous studies paid particular attention for comparing the 2 step PTK-PRK procedure or the
      new single step PRK procedure to the conventional PRK procedures involving epithelial removal
      whether manual or alcohol assisted.

      The aim of this study is to focus on comparing the different outcomes of the new single step
      Trans-epithelial PRK (StreamLight Technology) versus the routine 2 step PTK-PRK in terms of
      postoperative vision, epithelial healing, pain scoring and haze evaluation.
