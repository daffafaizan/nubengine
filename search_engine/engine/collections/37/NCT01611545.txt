      practitioner in determining the right dose or alternate medication for the patient. In
      partnership with the genetics team of the Avera Institute for Human Genetics and physicians
      with the Avera Heart Hospital of South Dakota and North Central Heart Institute, the research
      team will perform genetic analysis to identify genetic variances.
