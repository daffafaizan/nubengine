      I. To determine the feasibility and toxicity of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal
      sarcomas.

      II. To determine the maximum safe proton radiotherapy dose for retroperitoneal sarcomas.

      III. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of proton radiotherapy for patients with
      potentially resectable retroperitoneal sarcoma. (Pre-operative cohort) IV. To assess acute
      side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy and dose/volume constraints that are
      derived from conventional radiotherapy. (Postoperative cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical effectiveness of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma.

      II. To determine the long-term toxicity of proton radiotherapy to the abdomen and pelvis
      region.

      III. To monitor for effects of proton treatment on tumor and normal tissues using
      radiographic imaging (both cohorts) or ex-vivo analysis of tissue samples (preoperative
      cohort only).
