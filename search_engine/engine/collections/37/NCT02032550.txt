      intervention compared to usual care. The investigators will identify preferred attributes of
      prostate cancer treatments that will help in designing a conjoint analysis decision aid to
      help patients weigh treatment attributes. The investigators will employ values markers to
      represent clusters of values for particular aspects of treatments that are valued most by
      individual patients. The investigators will test if the concordance between values markers
      and treatment received is predictive of objective outcomes and subjective outcomes. The study
      hypothesis is that conjoint task may help in treatment choice and prostate cancer patients
      whose treatment is more concordant with their values markers will have improved outcomes.
