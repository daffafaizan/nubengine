      of Î±2 adrenoceptors (dexmedetomidine) is more like natural sleep than that provided by a
      sedative agent that modulates the GABAA receptor (propofol), two common widely used sedative
      agents in ICU. Ten volunteers will be enrolled and each subject will be studied on three
      experimental sessions. Subjects will be randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either
      saline, dexmedetomidine (DEX), or propofol in each of the three sessions. By relying on
      clinical rating scales, the investigators ensure that the doses of DEX and propofol
      administered induce equisedative states before progressing to magnetoencephalography and
      electroencephalography data collection.

      If the restorative and reparative benefits of sleep mitigate the development of cognitive
      dysfunction, this will result in shorter ICU length of stay for critically ill patients with
      a concomitant reduction in healthcare costs. Furthermore, it is possible that the restorative
      properties of sleep for the central nervous system can extend to the immune system with less
      infection and/or greater likelihood of survival from sepsis.

      In this manner, our project will translate experimental data towards clinical practice and
      the adoption of rational and clinically supported interventions in the ICU that are likely to
      improve not only patient reported outcome measures, but also the chance of surviving critical
      illness.

      Each experimental session will take a maximum of 7 hours (5 hours maximum for control
      sessions).

      Sessions have to be separated by at least one week. Subjects will be enrolled for a minimum
      of 3 weeks (1 session on each week) and no more than 3 months.
