      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and it is a class IA indication for anti-arrhythmic
      drug (AAD) refractory symptomatic PAF. However, the consensus statements are vague about the
      utility of AAD management during the 90-day blanking window post-PVI. Moreover, there is no
      specific guidance to cryoballoon users on the usage of AADs during the 90-day blanking period
      that exists anywhere in the published literature. Simply, these studies have not been
      conducted with the cryoballoon procedure.
