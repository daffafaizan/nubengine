      spectacle lens which corrects distance refractive error and at the same time produces myopic
      defocus images on the retina for all distances. The myopic defocus aims at slowing down
      myopia progression. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the MS lens can slow
      myopia progression in Hong Kong Chinese schoolchildren. The subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either treatment group (wear MS lenses) or control group (wear ordinary single
      vision lenses). Their cycloplegic refraction and axial length will be monitored every six
      months over 2 years. The changes in refractive errors and axial length in two groups will be
      compared.
