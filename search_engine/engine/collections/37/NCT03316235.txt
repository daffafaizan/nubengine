      groups: novice (junior ER and ortho residents), intermediate (non-experimented orthopedic
      surgeons), intermediate with a formation on classifying acetabular fractures and finally
      experts (acetabular fracture expert surgeons) . For each patient, representative CT scans are
      provided for each assessment. The study will be divided into 3 phases separated by 4-6 weeks
      of time. In the first phase, for each patient, representative CT scans are provided for each
      assessment with 2D and multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) without 3D views. In the second
      phase, 3D views are added. In the third phase, the cases are evaluated using the "Acetabular
      Diagnosis Tool" To note, the evaluation of the cases is done twice in each phase separated by
      4-6 weeks and the order of the cases is changed, both in order to minimize recall bias
