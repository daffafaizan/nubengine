      which leads to poor oral hygiene, and if unaddressed, problems like missing teeth and decayed
      teeth further in life develop, and ultimately leading to problems making treatment planning
      intricate. Children normally follow the footsteps of their parents so it is of importance to
      consider how to avoid creating dental anxiety among them. If dental anxiety is left
      untreated, it might persist during adulthood, which eventually will deteriorate the oral
      health of such patients. Due to the substantial effect of dental anxiety in paediatric
      patients, many methods have been devised to alleviate or eliminate such anxieties of the
      patients. This study aimed to employ different strategies and measure heart rate and Facial
      Image Scale scores to determine their efficacy in reducing paediatric patient's dental
      anxiety by using these techniques before and after the procedure to compare the effectiveness
      of each of these techniques.
