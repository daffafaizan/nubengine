      will be guided by data from a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) including
      information on heart rate, activity, and fluid status derived from the OptiVol monitor versus
      a conventional management control group. Subjects will followed for 12 months with follow up
      contact for 6 consecutive months and a chart review at 12 months. The study population will
      include patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who have had an ICD implanted
