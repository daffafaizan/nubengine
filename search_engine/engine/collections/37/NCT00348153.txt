      rheumatologic diseases. They have been used to treat severe uveitis by several groups, Suhler
      and coworkers have published the largest series in 2005. Adalimumab, a recombinant,
      full-length immunoglobulin, is the first member of a new class of TNF antibody compounds
      developed to contain exclusively human sequences. The duration of therapeutic efficacy of
      other TNF antibodies, which contain non-human sequences, may be limited to a greater extent
      by antibody responses raised in subjects over time. We want to test the efficacy and safety
      of the TNF alpha Inhibitor Adalimumab in patients with active uveitis despite standard
      immunosuppressive therapy requiring systemic corticosteroids > 7,5mg prednisolone.
