      women, meloxicam was administered when the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 18 mm
      (Jesam, Salvatierra et al. 2010). Results from this study indicate that meloxicam 30 mg given
      for five days in late follicular phase was more effective at delaying follicular rupture than
      15 mg. Follicular rupture was delayed more than 48 hours in 11/22 (50%) volunteers in the
      group treated with 15 mg/day and in 20/22 (91%) volunteers in the group treated with 30
      mg/day.
