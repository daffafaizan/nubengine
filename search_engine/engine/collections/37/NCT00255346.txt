      BCR-ABL, which is the abnormal protein responsible for causing leukemia in some cells.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take dasatinib by mouth
      twice a day. If you have mastocytosis, you will take dasatinib by mouth once a day. A
      treatment cycle will be defined as 4 weeks (28 days) + 7 days. You will be instructed to take
      dasatinib in the morning (between about 6:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m.) and in the evening (between
      about 6:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m.).

      Blood tests (about 2 - 3 teaspoons) will be done once a week for a month, then once a month
      for 5 years, then once every 6 months (if your doctor thinks it is needed) for the remainder
      of your treatment on this study. A bone marrow biopsy will be done after 1-2 months of
      therapy to document response.

      Dasatinib will be given for as long as you are responding. You will be taken off study if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is authorized for use in research only. A total
      of 145 patients will take part in this study. All will be treated at MD Anderson.
