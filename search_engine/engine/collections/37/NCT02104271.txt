      electrosugical generator coupled with an argon delivery unit. However, high gas flow have
      been associated to high rates of complication such as rectal stenosis and deep rectal ulcer.

      In this context, the present study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety between two
      different paramenters of argon plasma coagulation (40-50W and 2.0 L/min of gas flow vs 40W
      and 1.2 L/min of gas flow) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic chronic radiation
      proctitis.
