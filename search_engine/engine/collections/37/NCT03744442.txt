      spiritual distress, death anxieties, depressive symptoms and loss of dignity and purpose in
      life. Fostering dignity and meaning and relieving psychological distress have been identified
      as a core objective for end-of-life care. However, individual's needs for dignity and
      psychological support at the end of life may vary. Therefore, a personalized approach is
      needed. On the basis of theoretical frameworks and existing dignity- fostering and meaning-
      based interventions, as well as an one-day workshop with international experts in the field
      of palliative care, a personalized modular intervention, consisting of three modules,
      including CALM Therapy, Dignity Therapy, and a mindfulness-based Intervention, was developed.
