      access to the casino or other gambling venue. Currently there are over 10000 people in the
      program. Although some self-exclusion programs place a permanent ban on the individual,
      others offer the possibility of reinstatement after a period of time. Many problem gamblers
      actually do change their minds about self-exclusion and wish to return to gambling. Centre
      for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), in cooperation with Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG),
      is developing a tutorial designed to provide practical information to players who choose to
      reinstate and return to gambling. The goal of this study is to evaluate an the intervention
      to determine its impact on problem gamblers who is reinstated from relapsing to problematic
      levels of gambling. The content for the tutorial will be informed by CAMH, will be developed
      for land based gambling, and also adapted for online gambling as well.
