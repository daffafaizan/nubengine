      (CO) will be reduced and smoking cessation success rates enhanced for smokers who receive the
      neurosteroid analog ganaxolone. The trial will be seeking preliminary indications of efficacy
      and tolerability in the smoking population and allow us to estimate effect sizes for future
      controlled trials.
