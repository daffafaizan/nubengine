      removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. Improved therapies for patients
      with advanced esophageal cancer are therefore urgently needed. The epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib (in combination with chemotherapy) has lead to improved
      survival in patients with pancreatic and lung cancer. EGFR is a target in esophageal cancer
      therapy since its overexpression is associated with more aggressive disease and poor
      survival. Early studies have shown some clinical activity of EGFR inhibitors in this disease
      alone or in combination with chemotherapy. This study aims to explore how safe and effective
      treatment with erlotinib and FOLFOX is in patients with advanced esophageal or
      gastro-esophageal cancer.
