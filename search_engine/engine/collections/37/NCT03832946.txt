    
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TD139, a galectin-3 inhibitor,
      administered by dry powder inhalation over 52 weeks. Subjects will continue on their existing
      standard of care (SoC), including pirfenidone or nintedanib. Two doses of TD139, each given
      once per day, will be compared to placebo. A follow up period of up to 52 weeks, where the
      subjects remain on their designated treatment, will provide valuable information on the
      longer-term safety of TD139 in IPF.
