      disorders encountered by orthopaedic physical therapists. Females were 2.23 times more likely
      to develop PFPS than males. Various authors have suggested that hip weakness may be an
      impairment associated with PFPS, because poor hip control may lead to abnormal lower
      extremity or patellofemoral motions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are tools designed to
      improve decision making in clinical practice by assisting practitioners in making a
      particular diagnosis, establishing a prognosis, or matching patients to optimal
      interventions.
