      performance in sports and to prevent or decrease the risk of sports injury. Muscle stretching
      is also used for therapeutic purposes in many clinical conditions.

      It is generally performed in either static or dynamic manner. Muscle is brought to its
      lengthened position and is held at that point for a certain period of time in static
      stretching (SS). In dynamic stretching (DS), however, active movements of muscle take the
      joint through the range of motion and creates a stretch, but the muscle is not held in the
      end position.

      Although recent studies suggest that static stretching has adverse effects on performance,
      reduces maximal muscle force and is not successful in preventing non-contact injuries, as
      believed so; and the dynamic type therefore gaining popularity; it is reported that
      flexibility and range of motion can be improved by stretching as a consequence of the
      decrement in muscle stiffness. However, the effects of stretching depend on the type,
      duration and timing of stretching and there is still debate over which prescription provides
      the best results in terms of flexibility, power, performance or injury protection. And what
      happens to the viscoelastic properties of a muscle when it is stretched statically or
      dynamically is still not well documented. Ultrasound seems to be a good option as it offers
      an objective and a non-invasive way to expose the alteration in muscles and tendons due to
      stretching.
