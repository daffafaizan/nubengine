      dysfunction in septic shock or severe sepsis due to Neisseria meningitidis in children.

      METHODS: Prospective multicentric clinical trial including 7 French pediatric intensive care
      units. Serial cardiac ultra sounds and blood sampling will be done for patients hospitalized
      for purpura fulminans beginning at the time of admission in pediatric intensive care. Any
      child from 6 months to 18 years without preexisting cardiac disease and presenting with
      purpura fulminans will be enrolled after obtaining consent of both parents. From adult's
      studies on septic shock and BNP, a total number of 30 patients was calculated to be necessary
      to prove the interest of BNP in this indication.
