      admitted to our emergency department for trauma from the 1st of October 2019 to the 31st of
      January 2020 will be enrolled after fulfilling the inclusion criteria and in the absence of
      any exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be requested. Viscoelastic tests of coagulation
      will be performed on ROTEM® Delta and ClotPro® simultaneously. We will compare values of
      clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alfa angle, maximum clot firmness (MCF) and
      maximum lysis (ML) for test of extrinsic pathway(EX-test) on ClotPro® vs. test for extrinsic
      pathway (EXTEM) on ROTEM® Delta. Further we will compare values of clotting time (CT), clot
      formation time (CFT), alfa angle, maximum clot firmness (MCF) and maximum lysis (ML) for
      thromboelastometry of fibrinogen (FIB-test) on ClotPro® vs. thromboelastometry of fibrinogen
      (FIBTEM) on ROTEM® Delta. The secondary outcome will be to describe the dependence of
      measurement on temperature of patient.

      Study data will be entered in study form. The measurements can be repeated in time. The
      indication for next measurement is fully on treating physician.

      Differences in estimated viscoelastic coagulation parameters will be analysed.
