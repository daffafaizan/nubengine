      two trimesters of their pregnancies. There are 25 clinical centers as well as the database
      center. The women will be taking one of the following AEDs: carbamazepine, phenytoin,
      valproate, or lamotrigine. Cognitive and behavioral testing of the child will be done up to
      the age of 6 years. The study does not change the woman's doctor and does not interfere with
      the care of the treating physician.
