    
      A multicenter, descriptive cross-sectional study will include children and adolescents whose
      diagnosis of TE has been retained by an abnormal movement specialist before the age of 18
      years.

      Each child will benefit from an examination and a neurological and general clinical
      examination, a functional questionnaire, an electromyogram with accelerometer.

      Will be determined: demographic characteristics (age, sex and ethnicity), family history of
      essential tremor, age of onset of tremor, tremor characteristics (location, occurrence
      conditions, aggravating or precipitating factors, scalability); additional examinations
      carried out and the treatments proposed or taken by the child as well as the functional
      repercussions of TE in the child.

      Patients with tremor who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be selected
      retrospectively or prospectively from the active queue of patients at each center.
