      compared to standard cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse-liability approach.
      Behavioral economic demand analysis constitutes a comprehensive examination of drug
      reinforcement and abuse liability. Laboratory determination of cigarette consumption under
      various response requirements will occur before and after 3 weeks of at-home exposure, with
      participants randomized to cigarettes varying in composition to determine the role of
      experience on the abuse-liability of various cigarettes. Abuse liability will be assessed by
      2 essential demand metrics: lower demand intensity and increased demand elasticity, as well
      as other demand metrics and subjective ratings of "liking". The study will also determine the
      degree to which altered composition cigarettes may substitute for standard composition
      cigarettes - testing whether an altered composition policy would achieve the goal of reducing
      standard cigarette consumption.
