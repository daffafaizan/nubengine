      brain more susceptible to drugs, rehabilitation, or cognitive behavioral therapy. In
      addition, there is experimental evidence that rTMS releases factors that are involved in
      endogenous top-down modulation of pain and neural plasticity. Thus, the analgesic effect of
      rTMS may be mediated via enforcing endogenous pain control systems at the brain level, in
      addition to its effects on neuroplastic effects.

      For active, navigated stimulation targets the investigators have the parietal opercular
      cortex overlying the secondary somatosensory cortex ("S2") and the primary motor cortex (M1).

      The investigators randomize participants to first receive nrTMS to the right "S2" or sham
      stimulation. After ten sessions the investigators follow up the participants up to three
      months. At three months, if the average pain is â‰¥5/10 in numeric rating scale (NRS), the
      participant is offered an active, open nrTMS treatment phase depending on which treatment the
      participant first received. If the participant benefits from the open label treatment, a
      maintenance therapy is offered (6 months with gradually reducing nrTMS treatment frequency).
      The symptoms and quality of life are followed with questionnaires and diaries. After the
      maintenance period, the RN calls a structured interview at 1, 3, and 6 months.
