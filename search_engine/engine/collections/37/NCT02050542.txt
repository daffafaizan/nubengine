    
      The act of current practice evaluated by this research is the act of prostate biopsies : the
      patient will have to undergo 12 systematized transrectal echography guided biopsies of the
      prostate and 3 additional biopsies targeted on the suspicious lesion detected with MRI, which
      are both done in current practice.

        -  A first operator is not informed of the location of the target. He will perform a series
           of 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.

        -  Immediately after the second operator will perform 3 additional targeted biopsies on the
           suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with
           the Koelis ® system

      Act added by the research: Using a fusion of MRI - ultrasound images software system (Koelis
      ®).
