      selected. The donor sites will be harvested. Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds
      will be randomized for treatment using either the Dermafill dressing or Xeroform. The wound
      dressings will then be observed at least once a day beginning post op day 2/48hours after
      surgery until healed, which is defined as 90% or more of the wound surface is confluently
      re-epithelized.
