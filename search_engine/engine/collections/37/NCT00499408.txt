        -  Test the response of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer to a combination of
           cholecalciferol (i.e., vitamin D) and soy isoflavones (i.e., soy extract) after failed
           definitive local therapy as determined by PSA response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral cholecalciferol twice daily and a soy supplement (i.e., soy
      bar or shake) once daily. Treatment continues for 3-12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study to measure serum PSA,
      serum calcium, plasma cholecalciferol, and plasma soy isoflavone levels. Blood samples are
      also analyzed for expression of cholecalciferol receptor, p21, and p27 in peripheral blood
      lymphocytes as surrogate markers of the actions of cholecalciferol and genistein. Protein
      expression is assessed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates as well as quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction.

      Patients complete a toxicity questionnaire once each month to assess for cholecalciferol and
      soy supplementation toxicities and symptoms of hypercalcemia.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
