      quick-test, periosafe(c), that tells specifically about periodontitis. Participants go to
      surgery (upper gi) and have a normal operation following our clinics standards and normal
      follow up. After the investigators analyze the patient data concerning possible complications
      and do they have relations between the positive periodontitis results. Participants are also
      given advice about seeing a dentist if positive results are seen, but the operating surgeons
      do not get to know the mouth rinsing test results.
