      the knowledge of mothers on child nutrition, the eating habits of children, the estimated
      consumption of energy, nutrients of children and food availability on the market during
      harvesting and sowing seasons were evaluated. Moreover, data on zinc supplementation and
      nutrition education sessions conducted with mothers of these children were collected. The
      impact of zinc supplementation and maternal education was evaluated by measuring height/age,
      weight/age and weight/height indices, and levels of serum albumin, calcium, zinc, iron,
      magnesium and phosphorus before and after interventions.
