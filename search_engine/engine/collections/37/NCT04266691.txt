    
      Fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the variation of
      driver gene in regional lymph nodes of early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to
      analyze the relationship between the variation and disease recurrence and survival prognosis.
      evaluate the effect of the variation of driving gene in lymph nodes of early stage NSCLC on
      prognosis, identify the high-risk factors that promote the recurrence and metastasis of early
      stage tumor. so as to improve the diagnosis and treatment path of lung cancer, provide
      important pathological basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of early stage
      non-small cell lung cancer, enable patients to receive more accurate treatment, and improve
      their survival prognosis.
