      this study is to compare the longitudinal changes of lateral rectus (LR) muscle insertion
      between two types of bilateral recession surgery. An AS-OCT scan of the LR muscle was
      performed every visits. Data on gender, age, degree of deviation (prism diopter), and spur-LR
      insertion distance using AS-OCT were collected at postoperative months 1,3 in each group.
