      to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Each recruited participant will be randomly assigned to one group:

        -  experimental group - patients will receive self-modulated functional electrical
           stimulation SM-FES;

        -  control group - patients will receive standard care SC.

      This first main phase of the study includes 10 days intervention delivered to the two groups
      and assessments pre-intervention, post-intervention and after 3 months (follow-up).

      After the follow-up, participants initially recruited in the control group will be able to
      enter a secondary exploratory phase and receive further 10 days of treatment with SM-FES.
