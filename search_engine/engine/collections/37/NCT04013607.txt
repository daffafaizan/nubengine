      manipulation of non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC). NDC are fermented by the microbiota,
      hereby producing fermentation end products, mainly short chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate,
      butyrate, and propionate. It is hypothesized that SCFAs mediate parts of the beneficial
      effects of NDC. In mice, the influx of SCFA into the host correlated strongly with
      improvements of markers of the metabolic syndrome, whereas concentrations of SCFA in the
      cecum did not. The production and influx/incorporation of SCFAs in humans will be
      investigated.

      Study design: At day 1 the catheter will be placed. After an overnight fast at day 2, 5
      subjects will consume a NDC bolus. Isotopically 13C-labelled SCFAs will be delivered in the
      cecum. Samples will be taken in the cecum and blood before, and continuously after dispensing
      the 13C-labelled SCFAs.

      Study population: 5 healthy male volunteers (18-60yrs, and BMI between 18.5-30 kg/m2).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: (isotopic) enrichments of SCFAs in cecum, and label
      incorporation in plasma metabolites such as organic acids, glucose, cholesterol, fatty acids.
