      I. To understand effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) on the course of polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (PV/ET).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate prevalence of OSA in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. II. To
      understand effects of CPAP for sleep apnea on the course of myeloproliferative neoplasms
      (MPNs).

      III. To correlate OSA severity with thrombotic and inflammatory marker values in patients
      with PV/ET at baseline.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (OBSERVATIONAL COHORT): Patients not diagnosed with OSA undergo observation for 6
      months.

      COHORT II (TREATMENT COHORT): Patients diagnosed with OSA and prescribed a CPAP machine for
      treatment receive continuous treatment with CPAP for 6 months.
