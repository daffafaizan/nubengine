      consequences renewed interest in past epidemiologic and animal research about pathogenesis
      and posed new dilemmas about diagnosis and treatment. Cases in the October 2001 US outbreak
      were theoretically exposed via one dispersal method: aerosolization of Ames strain spores.
      While some developed the cutaneous anthrax form, others sustained the more serious
      inhalational disease. Inhaled spores are known to travel to alveolar macrophages and then
      onto the mediastinal lymph nodes where germination to the bacterium form and toxin release
      are thought to occur. Infective dose, significance of dormant spores after long-term
      antibiotic therapy, spectrum of disease and even precise cause of death remain unknown. This
      observational, prospective natural history study was developed during the 2001 outbreak and
      is set up to follow participants from the time of exposure through post-recovery (greater
      than ten years). Healthy vaccinated participants have been included to evaluate serum titers
      and cell markers in relation to dose and frequency of AVA vaccine.
