    
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that is clinically manifested
      by the appearance of effort dyspnea and impaired lung function.

      The natural history of the disease is poorly understood and there is no clear consensus as to
      the most appropriate markers for predicting patient outcome.

      This pilot controlled trial aims to test the efficacy and safety of cotrimoxazole in the
      treatment of IPF. This novel therapeutic strategy, with very encouraging preliminary data is
      based on its pathophysiological basis, primarily related to the elimination of Pneumocystis
      colonization. That elimination, could serve as a potent weapon for reducing morbidity and
      mortality and the cost associated with this devastating disease.
