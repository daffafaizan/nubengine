      proportions that allied to sedentary lifestyle increased body fat. There is already a well
      establish relationship between total body fat excess, cardiometabolic diseases and increased
      mortality, knowing that abdominal fat (android pattern), different from body index, presents
      an additional influence to health risks. Women with their abdominal adipocytes (visceral fat)
      show an increased lipolytic activity that releases free fat acids to the systemic and portal
      circulation leading to a metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

      Aerobic exercise is a way to decrease fat as it stimulates lipolysis through an increase in
      catecholamine's level resulting from a sympathetic system nervous activity raise. The most
      used exercise for lipid elimination is the prolonged aerobic moderate exercise with a minimum
      of 30 minutes.

      Nevertheless aerobic exercise practice reduce globally lipidic sources and not locally .

      Electrolipolysis using microcurrent has been used in clinical practice as a technique to
      reduce abdominal fat. This technique can be applied transcutaneously or percutaneously
      seeming that the former is not so effective as skin can be an obstacle to the current effect
      on visceral and subcutaneous fat .

      Abdominal fat excess is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and can be prevented using
      microcurrent and aerobic exercise to stimulate lipolysis.
