      of HCV. These drugs have proven to be very effective in curing the HCV, without the need for
      interferon injections余 which have always been used in the past. There are many combinations
      of DAAs, which treat specific types of HCV. Persons who test positive for the virus are
      typically referred to be seen and treated by a specialist hepatitis service based in
      hospital. This means that individuals may sometimes not attend the hospital to commence
      treatment余 or follow up on their management.

      The study is designed to explore if testing and treating individuals close to their own
      "local" setting will be an improvement to the current treatment pathway and encourage better
      involvement with the health care team余 as well as looking at what the health care team can do
      to ensure participants in this test-and-treat trial receive the entire course of drug
      treatment prescribed to treat their HCV infection.

      Participants infected with either genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection will be treated with
      Zepatier, a DAA which works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from (multiplying). The study
      medication is taken for 12 or 16 weeks depending on the genotype (or strain of HCV). Some
      participants will be given an additional drug called ribavirin. The study will examine the
      effectiveness of Zepatier at clearing the hepatitis C virus from the blood and body余 and also
      what particular effects may be experienced by participants who may also be taking treatment
      for other conditions. Participants affected with other genotypes (not 1 and 4)will be offered
      standard NHS treatment with the appropriate antiviral combination for these strains.
