      psuedohypoparathyroidism (PHP).Theophylline is a is non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor
      which increases the levels of secondary messenger,cAMP. PHP patients have end organ
      resistance to hormones involving cAMP signaling. Thus, theophylline has a potential to
      abrogate hormone resistance. Also, it may have a role in bone maturation, neurocognition and
      metabolism.
