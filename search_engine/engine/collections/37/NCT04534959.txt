      secondary complications related to hypoxia. Although routine, the practice of excessive
      over-oxygenation may be harmful. An expert panel was convened and developed the strong
      consensus to target normoxia at an oxygen saturation (SpO2) range of 90-96%, an arterial
      oxygen (PaO2) range of 60-100 mmHg (when applicable), and a fraction of inspired oxygen
      (FiO2) of 21% for mechanically ventilated patients or room air for nonmechanically ventilated
      patients.

      Specific Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a multimodal
      educational intervention to reduce supplemental oxygen use in critically injured patients.
      Investigators will also evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of the more targeted
      use of oxygen therapy.

      Hypotheses: Clinical efforts to through a multimodal educational intervention will:

        1. Improve the proportion of time spent within target normoxia thresholds (oxygen
           saturation [SpO2] 90-96% and/or arterial oxygen [PaO2] 60-100 mmHg [when applicable]

        2. Limit use of excessive supplemental oxygen

        3. Reduce exposure to hyperoxia without a substantive increase in hypoxic episodes or
           adverse effects
