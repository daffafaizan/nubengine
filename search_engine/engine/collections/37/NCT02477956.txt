    
      Sun exposure and supplement use questionnaire:

      A registered dietitian asked each subject for information on sun exposure, vitamins,
      medications, and any other supplement usage before each blood sample was taken.

      Lab analysis included serum hydroxy vitamin D levels pre and 3 months postoperative.

      Descriptive statistics which include both the means and standard deviations were calculated
      on the study variables. A paired sample t-test was used to determine if there was a
      significant difference in mean values pre and post vitamin D supplementation. An independent
      sample t-test was used to assess for significant differences in group (control vs. vitamin D
      supplement) means. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
      analyses were done using SPSS Version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, III, USA).
