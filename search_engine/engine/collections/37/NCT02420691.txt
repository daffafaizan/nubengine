      I. To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1)
      objective response rate of LEE011 (ribociclib) among patients with advanced foregut
      neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival duration of LEE011 among patients with advanced
      foregut NETs.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEE011 in patients with advanced foregut NETs.

      III. To determine clinic benefit rate at 6 months (defined as complete response plus partial
      response plus stable disease) with LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine baseline molecular markers (mutations, deletions, and amplifications in
      multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN]1, p27, p16 and cyclin D1 [CCND1]) in archival tumor that
      may predict clinical benefit at 6 months from LEE011.

      II. To determine potential mechanisms/markers of resistance. III. To determine early
      chromogranin and neuron specific enolase responses in patients with elevated levels at
      baseline.

      IV. To determine the pharmacodynamic changes including proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen
      (Ki-67) and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb) upon treatment with LEE011 in patients with
      advanced foregut NETs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
