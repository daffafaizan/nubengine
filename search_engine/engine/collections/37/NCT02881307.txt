    
      This is a pilot 12-week RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) in 60 obese RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis)
      patients to evaluate if a weight loss intervention will improve PDUS (Power Doppler Ultra
      Sound), traditional disease activity measures (DAS28, Disease Activity Score - 28), and
      adipokine/MBDA (Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity) assessments. While there have been
      observational weight loss RA studies, none were RCTs and they did not utilize objective
      measures (PDUS or MBDA).
