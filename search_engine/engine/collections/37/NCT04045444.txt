      variations of the pre-frontal oxygenation during walking and during a dual task in elderly.
      The other aims are to study the effects of age, gender and the Parkinson' disease on
      variations of the pre-frontal oxygenation during walking and during a dual task in elderly.

      For that, 160 participants (females and males) will be included and 8 groups will be
      constituted (woman and man non active young people, woman and man non active old people,
      woman and man active old people, woman and man patients with Parkinson's disease).

      Every participants will performed a set of 6 tasks of 2 minutes. Each task will be separated
      by a 2 minutes resting period. The tasks will be a cognitive task, a control cognitive task,
      walking at 3 kilometers/hour, walking while doing the cognitive task, walking at the
      preferred speed, walking at the preferred speed while doing the cognitive task.

      During the set, prefrontal oxygenation will be measured using the near infrared spectroscopy.
