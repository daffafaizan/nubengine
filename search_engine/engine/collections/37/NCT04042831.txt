      I. To determine the efficacy (objective response rate) of olaparib monotherapy in advanced
      biliary tract cancer (BTC) with mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with
      mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.

      II. To determine the progression free survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer
      with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.

      III. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events in advanced biliary tract cancer
      patients treated with olaparib.

      IV. To assess the duration of response for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with
      mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib who experience an objective response.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the prevalence of mutations including those targeting DNA repair pathways.

      II. Identify mutational signatures associated with pathogenic process in advanced biliary
      tract cancer samples.

      III. Correlate the presence of mutations and mutational signatures linked to mutations in DNA
      repair genes and homologous recombinant repair with clinical responses to olaparib.

      IV. To evaluate putative biomarkers related to:

      Iva. De novo sensitivity. IVb. Tumor evolution and resistance, to PARP inhibition from
      olaparib in BTC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 3 years.
