      The Mallampati score, interincisor garp, cervical spine mobility, upper lip bite test and
      thyromental distance will be measured. The distances will be measured in centimeters and the
      width of the distal part of the third finger will be measured to obtain the distance
      according to the patients fingers. The airway management plan will be defined and the
      incidence of the difficult airway (difficult face mask ventilation - two hand, two operators,
      desaturation, difficult intubation - Cormack-Leehane 3-4, intubation on 3 and more attempts,
      difficult laryngeal mask insertion and the incidence of cannot intubate cannot ventilate
      scenario will be evaluated. The predictability of the test for difficult airway prediction
      (Cormack-Leehane 3-4, cannot-intubate - cannot ventilate scenario, difficult mask
      ventilation) will be statistically analyzed.
