      same monitoring system currently used during parotidectomy and requires placement of the APS
      electrode as the only additional piece of equipment. During this phase, the investigators
      will record intraoperative EMG data generated by the monitoring system as well as document
      intra-operative maneuvers that precede adverse EMG events.

      In the second phase of the study the investigators aim to allow the surgeon to alter his or
      her techniques, with the information provided by the APS electrode, to reverse adverse EMG
      changes.
