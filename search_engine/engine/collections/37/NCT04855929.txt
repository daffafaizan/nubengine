      assess the initial safety and efficacy profile of ANV419 intravenous infusion in patients
      with advanced solid tumours. Phase 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANV419
      alone and to determine a suitable dose for Phase 2 development. Phase 2 will evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy and, the safest and best dose of ANV419 when used alone or together with
      established cancer treatment.
