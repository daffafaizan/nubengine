      proportions in the United States. Recent epidemiological data has shown an inverse
      relationship between calcium intake and body fat and emerging research suggests that
      inadequate dietary calcium consumption may increase obesity. Studies in mice have shown that
      an increase in dietary calcium consumption creates a shift in the utilization of energy
      stores from carbohydrates to fat and a shift in the partitioning of energy from storage (as
      fat) to expenditure (as heat).

      We will give 1500 mg of calcium a day for three months to women who habitually consume low
      levels of dietary calcium. The following measurements will be made before and after calcium
      supplementation: body fat by DEXA, lipolysis by infusion of stable isotopes of
      1,1,2,3,3-[2H5] glycerol , hepatic glucose production by infusion of stable isotopes of
      6,6-[2H2] glucose, lipogenesis by measurement of fatty acid synthase activity (14C
      radiochemical assay) , mRNA expression ( Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) and protein
      content (ELISA), indirect calorimetry measurement of non-protein respiratory quotient (NPRQ),
      energy expenditure, fat and carbohydrate oxidation. Serum calcium, glucose, cholesterol,
      triglycerides, LDL, HDL, parathyroid hormone, leptin, free fatty acids, adiponectin,
      1,25(OH)2D, 25(OH)D and urinary calcium excretion will also be measured.
