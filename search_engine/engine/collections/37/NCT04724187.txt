      designed Performa after informed consent of patient, demographic data will be collected on
      that preform Patients will be randomized and divide in to two groups group A ( study group )
      and group B (controls) , patients under group A will be given 600 microgram misoprostol
      through intra uterine route during lower segment caesarean section after delivery of placenta
      in addition to oxytocin 10IU IV and Group B (control) only oxytocin 10IU IV will be given
      according to WHO protocol .In both groups pre-operative hemoglobin done within 24 hours
      before the surgery will be recorded and compared with post-operative hemoglobin estimated by
      blood sample taken 48 hours after the surgery .Mean blood loss during caesarean section will
      be documented by counting the number of towels , need of additional drugs (repeat oxytocin,
      tranexamic acid, additional misoprostol) ,time of contractility of uterus, blood transfusion,
      side effects of misoprostol that is fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting will be recorded 24
      hours postoperative period.

      All the collected data will be entered and analyzed by SPSS v. 21. Mean and standard
      deviation will be calculated for quantitative variables like age, gestational age, BMI, pre
      and post Hb, and blood loss during caesarean section. Frequencies along with percentages will
      be presented for qualitative variables like need of additional drugs, and side effects of
      misoprostol (fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting). Paired sample t-test will be used to
      compare pre and post Hb levels of both groups. Independent sample t-test will be applied to
      compare post Hb level, blood loss between both groups. Chi-square test will be employed to
      compare side effects (fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting) between both groups. P-value â‰¤ 0.05
      will be taken as significant.
