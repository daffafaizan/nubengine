      psychosocial intervention is limited. We propose to investigate the acceptability,
      feasibility and effectiveness of manual assisted Learning Through Play (LTP) Plus culturally
      adapted Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) among parents experiencing Post
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). LTP Plus is proposed as a low cost intervention to improve
      parents' mental and physical health, and promote healthy child development. The LTP
      research-based activities enhance children's development while simultaneously promoting
      attachment security through building parents' ability to read and be sensitive to their
      children's cues and through active involvement in their children's development. This will be
      integrated with Trauma Focused CBT.

      Purpose of this RCT is to determine the effectiveness of LTP plus TF- CBT intervention. The
      study will be conducted in two cities of Pakistan, Karachi and Peshawar.Participants will be
      screened using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and eligibility checklist. Those scoring
      24 or above will be eligible for more in depth assessment. Assessments will be done at
      baseline and after completion of intervention. Outcome assessments will be done by
      independent Research Assistants blind to group allocations.
