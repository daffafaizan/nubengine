      showed significant decrease of neuroretinal rim area and increase of cupt area in late luteal
      phase. Ulas et al found that choroidal thickness was significant thicker in mid-luteal phase.
      However, the study of retinal vascular density by optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA) during the menstrual cycle has never been published before.
