      decreased emotion-based coping, increased tolerance for uncertainty, improved psychological
      well-being and quality of life while potentially improving relationship quality and
      communication.

      This study utilizes a single-group, uncontrolled design to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of telephone-delivered mindfulness training designed to alleviate caregiver
      burden for African-American rural caregivers of individuals with moderate to severe dementia,
      as defined by the caregiver. The telephone-delivered mindfulness intervention will improve
      geographical access for rural caregivers and deem more flexible for a caregiver's schedule.
      The study's intervention consists of mindfulness training delivered by telephone once weekly
      for 8 weeks. The intervention also includes one in-person 3.5-hour retreat for which respite
      care will be provided. The intervention, based on, Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR), will emphasize the following: 1) mindful experiencing, including
      mindfulness of feelings and body sensations; 2) mindful communication, including non-verbal
      mindfulness, mindful listening, and mindful speaking; and 3) mindful compassion for self and
      others.
