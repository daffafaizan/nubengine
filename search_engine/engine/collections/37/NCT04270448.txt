      feedback during practice that indicates the learner is performing above average (i.e.
      positive social comparative feedback) enhances motor skill learning and self-efficacy in
      healthy adults. While this type of feedback is hypothesized to promote learning in some
      tasks, no studies have examined whether positive social comparative feedback during practice
      promotes motor learning in a traditional motor sequence task. Therefore, the aim of the
      proposed project is to investigate the effect of positive social comparative feedback on the
      learning of a joystick-based motor sequence task in healthy adults. The study aims to recruit
      60 participants who will be randomized into 1 of 3 feedback groups (control group,
      performance feedback, and performance plus positive feedback). Participants will practice a
      motor sequence task on a single day and then return for retention performance testing about
      24 hours later. Changes in performance (response time to complete a sequence) and
      self-efficacy will be measured from baseline to 24 hours later at retention.
