    
      Dutasteride is an inhibitor of the 5 alpha reductase type I and type II enzymes that convert
      testosterone to DHT, the male hormone that leads to benign prostate growth and drives
      malignant growth. Dutasteride has been shown to significantly decrease intraprostatic DHT in
      men with localized prostate cancer, and additionally cause apoptosis and regression of some
      prostate cancers [Andriole, 2004a; Andriole, 2004b]. Furthermore, reduction in tumor volume
      has also been demonstrated in human prostate tissue [Iczkowski, 2004]. Dutasteride is
      currently indicated to treat symptomatic BPH in men with enlarged prostates, but is also
      being studied to reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men at risk (elevated PSA and previous
      negative biopsy). Dutasteride is clinically useful at improving lower urinary tract symptoms
      (LUTS) in men with clinically-localized prostate cancer and voiding difficulty being treated
      with single-dose goserelin, TUIP, and interval SI. [Mitcheson, personal observation].
