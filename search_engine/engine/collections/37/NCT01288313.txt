      neurodevelopment of newborn infants. Many variations in essential PUFA and LCPUFA content of
      human milk are observed according to countries and dietary habits of the mothers.

      Maternal diet supplementation of LCPUFA of lactating women may increase LCPUFA human milk
      according to consensus recommendations.

      This clinical trial is performed to evaluate the effect of different of consumption of n-3
      fatty acids (linolenic acid) in different forms (oils or margarine) in the human milk
      composition.

      Each diet will last 30 days. During the first period of 15 days, the mothers will receive
      mediterranean diet based on olive oil. Then, lactating women will be randomised into four
      groups : one group will receive olive oil (standard group), one group supplemented in
      rapeseed oil, one group with n-3 margarine and one group with diet associating rapeseed oil
      and n-3 margarine.Human milk will be collected during the first breastfeeding of the day (10
      ml) at three times : Days 0 corresponding to the usual diet , at day 15 after the
      Mediterranean diet and at day 30, after the study diet.
