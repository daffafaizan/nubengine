      Health, in collaboration with the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH).

      Epidemiological and laboratory surveillance for pertussis disease among Wisconsin residents
      is routinely conducted by the WDPH. During the period of the study, de-identified data
      regarding all incident pertussis cases will be obtained from WDPH and vaccination coverage
      rates, by vaccine regimen, age group, and period of time, will be obtained from ongoing
      marketplace surveillance conducted on behalf of the Sponsor by a national sample-survey
      organization. Using these data, rates of pertussis disease will be determined.

      No vaccine will be administered as part of this study.
