      associations between falls and certain medications. It is widely accepted that falls-related
      morbidity and mortality could be reduced if systems were in place to identify falls risks and
      intervene to reduce the risks identified. In this study, health care professionals (HCPs)
      within UNC outpatient clinics will be alerted to patients on high-risk medications and
      provide team-based interventions to maximize the success of falls education and medication
      deprescribing.

      This deprescribing intervention will focus specifically on opioids and benzodiazepines (BZDs)
      in patients 65 years of age and older since these medications have high susceptibility to
      negative cognitive effects in older adults and contribute to a higher risk of falls. This
      study will identify factors affecting the adoption, effective implementation, and maintenance
      of a deprescribing program focused on opioids and BZDs with the intent of reducing falls.
