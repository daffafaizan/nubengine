    
      Specific Aims:

      Perform randomized controlled trial of intensive follow-up of stage 2 T1D participants
      utilizing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and early education of families to
      guide early insulin therapy with the goals of:

      maintaining HbA1c less than 7.0%. avoiding adverse outcomes: ER visits, hospitalizations, DKA
      and severe hypoglycemia improving diabetes knowledge through optimal planned education as
      opposed to 'a crash course' at unexpected diagnosis event.

      evaluating patient/caregiver satisfaction with diabetes care received evaluating impact of
      activity on glycemic profile Collect longitudinal biomarkers of beta-cell stress and
      dysfunction in stage 2 T1D.

      Use longitudinal CGM data combined with "gold-standard" OGTT and HbA1c measures to provide
      evidence for CGM-based diagnostic criteria for stage 2 and stage 3 T1D.

      Perform cost-analysis of intensive follow up protocol.
