      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of HBI-8000 40 mg BIW in patients with relapsed or refractory
      PTCL (R/R PTCL). HBI 8000 will be administered orally approximately 30 minutes after any
      regular meal twice a week. There will be 3-4 days between dosing. A cycle is defined as
      consecutive 28 days. HBI-8000 administration will be continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities are observed despite appropriate dose reduction or treatment
      interruption.
