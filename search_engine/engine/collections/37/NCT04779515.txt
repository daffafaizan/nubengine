      into one of two masked groups, labelled red and green. The red-label group was operated at
      standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum, while the green-label group was operated at low-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum. Baseline blood samples were obtained pre-operatively for ten inflammatory
      markers, patients' demographics and intra-operative details collected, then post-operative
      pain and change in inflammatory markers were followed.
