      acupuncture-moxibustion versus a placebo in singleton pregnancies with breech presentation
      between 33+5 to 35+5 weeks of gestation. The intervention arm consists of
      acupuncture-moxibustion at the BL67 acupuncture point, for six seances of twenty minutes two
      days apart. In the placebo group, the cold light of an inactivated laser is to be applied in
      the same point during the same time. When cephalic version fail, a manual external cephalic
      version is to be proposed. The main outcome measure is cephalic presentation at 37+2 weeks of
      gestation.
