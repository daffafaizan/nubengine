      invasive method and the open reduction method.

      Investigators think that the minimally invasive method with intern plate is more efficient
      than the open reduction method.

      These techniques may better preserve perifracture soft tissues, hematoma. It may lead to a
      smaller muscle detachment.

      The minimally invasive technique allows a more efficient vascularization of the fracture
      site, what would increase bone healing and the functional prognosis of tibial pilon lesions.

      It's all these issues investigators would like to assess with a randomized study.
