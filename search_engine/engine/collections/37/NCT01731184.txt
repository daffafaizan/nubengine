    
      Patient will be included in pre-hospital setting. They must have an acute pain NRS greater
      than or equal to 6 from a traumatic origin. The participation of the study for each patient
      will be the time of the pre-hospital setting. The study will stop when the patient arrives at
      the hospital.

      Patient will be randomized after obtaining an informed consent. Then, the nurse will
      administered intravenous morphine 0.10 mg/kg and midazolam 0.04 mg/kg or intravenous morphine
      0.10 mg/kg and placebo.

      Only the nurse will be aware of the treatment received by the patient. Every 5 minutes, life
      constants and pain score will be recorded on the case report form.

      Assessment will be done at the baseline using a validated numeric rating scale. The primary
      outcome will be the proportion of patients with a pain score less than or equal to 3 after 20
      minutes. The secondary outcomes will be in between-group comparison of: the treatment safety,
      pain score every 5 minutes during 30 minutes and the total morphine dose required until
      obtaining a pain score less than or equal to 3.
