      alterations that limit the ability to respond to physiological demands(1,2).These
      abnormalities involve metabolic and neuro-hormonal factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α
      (TNF-α), one of the most important catabolic cytokines related with changes in body
      composition, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, interferon Y, and transmission growth factor β
      (3-9), which produce catabolic and anabolic imbalance and promote loss of fat free mass (FFM)
      with or without loss of fat mass (FM) in patients with HF. This syndrome is called "Cardiac
      Cachexia" (CC) (10). Signs and symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia and decreased muscle
      strength reflect altered body composition (9, 10). There are two possible ways to counteract
      these catabolic factors and restore body compartments. In one of them, protein
      supplementation promotes protein synthesis and inhibits proteolysis (3,11,12); in the other
      resistance exercise (RE) increases muscle mass and muscle strength, maintaining heart rate
      (13,14). Previous studies report the association of protein supplementation (15-17) and
      exercise (18-23) with changes in muscle strength in some cases and exercise capacity in HF
      patients. However, these therapies were not combined, and the studies did not provide enough
      information about changes in body composition. Based on these reports, our hypothesis is that
      the combination of RE and protein supplementation in form of branched chain amino acids
      (BCAA) might have an anabolic effect in patients with HF since the supplementation of BCAA
      could be helpful as "fuel" during the exercise and maintain the muscle mass metabolism (24).
