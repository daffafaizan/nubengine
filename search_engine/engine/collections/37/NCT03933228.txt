      combined interscalene-cervical plexus versus combined supraclavicular-cervical plexus block
      for surgical anesthesia in clavicular fractures.The hypothesis of this study was that the
      supraclavicular-cervical plexus block could provide better anesthesia with less anesthesia
      related complications.
