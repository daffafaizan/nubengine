      Platelet-Rich Plasma (L-PRP) prepared with Biomet Recover L-PRP Mini Platelet Separation Kit
      for the treatment of tendinosis in a controlled setting. This study will allow for the
      capture and evaluation of real-world clinical data on a chronic LE patient population. The
      advantage of a post-market data collection is that it provides a way to examine clinical and
      patient reported outcomes along with the associated costs of chronic LE treatment in a
      diverse, clinically-relevant population. Although several registries exist which capture the
      outcomes following tendon/ligament reconstruction surgery, there are no known registries that
      capture outcomes following non-surgical treatment of chronic LE with Recover L-PRP. This
      study will fill that gap by allowing for an efficient data collection platform in a larger
      heterogeneous population of patients suffering from chronic LE and will document and more
      closely examine the treatment effects of Recover L-PRP.
