      alcohol use will never seek formal alcohol treatment. As an alternative, smartphone apps have
      been developed as one means to provide help to people concerned about their alcohol use.
      While such apps are widely available, the large majority have little or no evidence base, and
      research has indicated that some may actually do more harm than good. An app with proven
      efficacy at reducing alcohol consumption is needed in order to capitalize on this opportunity
      to motivate the large number of people seeking assistance using this promising technology.

      This study will recruit people who consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner. Participants will
      be assigned by chance to one of two groups to either receive access to: 1) the full app; or
      2) a copy of the app where only the educational content is provided (as opposed to the full
      intervention content of the app). Participants will be contacted 6 months after consenting to
      the study to assess changes in their drinking. We predict that the full app will lead to
      larger reductions in drinking and a more sustained impact than the educational content only
      app. In addition, this study will help us understand which components of the smartphone app
      are important to use in order to promote reductions in alcohol consumption.
