      solution. The development of new surgical techniques or therapies is critical in meeting this
      medical need.

      This Canadian trial will be a pivotal protocol study, conducted as a randomized, controlled
      trial. A total of 80 subjects, 40 subjects in each of the two groups (BST-CarGel applied to a
      microfractured lesion or microfracture alone), will be enrolled in this study. The subjects
      and investigative medical staff will not be blinded to treatment due to the difference in
      surgical incision size. However, although the treatment will not be blinded, the primary
      effectiveness assessment will be blinded. The primary endpoint of this study will be
      cartilage repair at 12 months proved by demonstrating that BST-CarGel treatment effectively
      fills cartilage lesions with high quality cartilaginous tissue. The secondary endpoints will
      be pain, stiffness and function while other tertiary endpoints will include safety,
      quality-of-life (QOL), as well as macroscopic characterizations of tissue repair. The primary
      measure of this study will occur at 12 months, when imaging of repair tissue using magnetic
      resonance (MR) and associated analyses will compare tissue volume, quality and other
      anatomical variables. Radiographic evaluations will be blinded. Volunteer biopsies at 13
      months may be obtained. Pain, stiffness, function and QOL will be assessed prior to
      treatment, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following treatment using self-administered validated
      scores (WOMAC and SF-36). In addition, subject safety will be assessed through a record of
      adverse events.
