    
      The objective of this trial is to determine whether an opioid-free general anesthetic can
      help reduce postoperative respiratory depression in the post-anesthesia care unit and ward in
      children with sleep-disordered breathing undergoing tonsillectomy when compared with
      traditional opioid-containing techniques.
