      meta analysis shows that the 5-year survival rate of post-operation chemotherapy group rose
      by 5.4%, therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy has been the main treatment after surgery according
      to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guideline. But patients have poor compliance
      due to physical condition after surgery. Compared with adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant
      therapy has better patient compliance and tolerance.Targeted therapy, with milder side effect
      compared with chemotherapy, may be a promising choice to treat NSCLC previously. But to date,
      there is no enough evidence to support the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant targeted
      therapy in patients with EGFR mutation.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficiency and safety of Gefitinib Neoadjuvant Therapy vs Oral Navelbine Carboplatin
      Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation.
