    
      This is a single arm two-stage phase II study designed to evaluate the objective response
      rate in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer demonstrating c-MET or RON overexpression
      who have received prior therapy with a cisplatin or carboplatin containing regimen.

      Subjects will be recruited at Levine Cancer Institute (LCI) and other participating sites.

      Immunohistochemistry will be utilized to define tumor sample c-MET and RON protein expression
      patterns for assignment into molecular cohorts as described in section 12.1.

      In the first stage of this study, subjects will be enrolled in parallel to three molecularly
      defined cohorts as follows:

        1. c-MET high (>50%), RON null (0-9%) (n = 14 subjects)

        2. c-MET-positive (10-100%), RON-positive (10-100%) (n = 7 subjects)

        3. c-MET null (0-9%), RON-positive (10-100%) (n = 7 subjects)

      All enrolled subjects will continue with study treatment until criteria for treatment
      discontinuation has been met.

      If Stage 1 response criteria are met in a cohort, the cohort may be considered for expansion,
      and additional subjects (16 in Cohort 1 or 25 in Cohorts 2 or 3) may then be enrolled into
      that cohort in Stage 2. An expansion cohort will be defined by the Sponsor- Investigator
      following review of all available trial data which will be conducted after the first Stage 1
      cohort has completed accrual and at least every six months thereafter until all Stage 1
      cohorts have completed accrual.

      If more than one cohort meets Stage 1 response criteria (2 responses out of 14 subjects for
      Cohort 1 or 1 response out of 7 subjects for each of Cohorts 2 and 3), then the cohort
      showing the highest response rate will be given highest consideration for expansion.
