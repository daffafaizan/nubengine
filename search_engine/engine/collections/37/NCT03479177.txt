      of home-based exercise sessions prescribed by the exercise counselor. The exercise sessions
      will be based on exercises the participant can confidentially engage in (regular push-ups vs.
      knee push-ups vs. wall push-ups). The goal will be to engage in three exercise sessions per
      week. The participants will receive weekly telephone calls during the first month and
      bi-weekly calls during months 2 and 3. The exercise counselor will also engage in dialogue
      that will motivate the participant to exercise.
