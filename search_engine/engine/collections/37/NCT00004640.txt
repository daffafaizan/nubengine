      Monitoring Board, designed to provide unequivocal evidence regarding the impact of regular
      rinsing 0.12% chlorhexidine solution on tooth loss in low income, community-dwelling older
      adults who are irregular users of dental services. Of the 1101 subjects enrolled in the study
      in Seattle, WA and Vancouver, B.C., one/half have been assigned to the active rinse
      condition; the other half to the placebo rinse which looks and tastes like the chlorhexidine
      rinse but does not have the active ingredient. Subjects receive two bottles of rinse every
      six months; the first to be used daily for one month, the second weekly for five months.
      Reminder calls are designed to help subjects maintain this rinse regimen. Subjects return
      yearly to research clinics at each participating university, where they are examined by a
      dentist who is trained in clinical research methodology and calibrated annually. The purpose
      of these visits is to examine subjects for tooth loss (followed by contacts with extracting
      dentists to determine the dentist's reasons for extracting the tooth), pocket depth,
      recession, caries and restorations on root and coronal surfaces. Interviews are also
      conducted annually with participants to assess health status, health behaviors, and oral
      health quality of life. A panoramic radiograph was taken at baseline of each subject and is
      to be done again at the five-year (final) yearly exam. These radiographs are used to confirm
      tooth loss and possible reasons for extractions
