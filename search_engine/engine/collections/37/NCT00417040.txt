      colorectal cancer, leukemia and multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of collecting symptom data directly from patients at clinic
      visits via waiting-area computers.

      II. To preliminarily assess the level of agreement between patient and clinician Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) symptom severity scoring, and to measure
      whether their scores converge when clinicians are exposed to patient self-reports.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are registered into the Symptom Tracking and Reporting (STAR) database, obtain a
      password, undergo STAR training, and complete a patient-STAR questionnaire after seeing their
      clinician (baseline self-report) on day 1 of course 2* of chemotherapy. Patients are reminded
      to complete online STAR questionnaire before seeing their clinician on day 1 of courses 3, 4,
      5, and 6* of chemotherapy. Clinicians review these patient reports before creating their own
      assessment. Patients also complete a patient feedback survey on day 1 of course 4* of
      chemotherapy. Clinicians complete feedback survey at study completion.
