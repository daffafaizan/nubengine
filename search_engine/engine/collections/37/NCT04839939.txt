      were given clear, detailed explanation of the proposed procedures before starting the
      experiment, and signed a written informed consent statement. Batterjee Medical College
      Research and Ethical committee reviewed and approved the study, which were conducted in
      compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Thirty-six children (22 males and 14 females)
      with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were enrolled in this study. The children were randomly
      assigned into two study groups (A & B), and a control group (C). Randomization was done by
      asking each child to pick up an index card out of a box that contains 36 cards (12 cards for
      each group) to determine which group participants would be in. Measurements were taken in two
      occasions, baseline, and four weeks after application of the intervention. Spatiotemporal
      Gait parameters were measured as per the published guidelines using the GAITRite system.
      Parameters included were cadence, step length; stride length, single support time, double
      support time, and velocity were evaluated.
