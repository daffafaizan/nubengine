      participating centers. Based on the previous publications an objective response rate (ORR) of
      20% is expected in the GEMOX arm (Arm B). When the sample size of evaluable patients is
      between 110 and 120 evaluable patients (ie. 55 to 60 patients per treatment arm), then a
      two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an arm B response rate PB,
      of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30%, 35% or 40% based on the large sample normal
      approximation will have a width between 15.4% and 16.7%. We assume an objective response rate
      of 30% for Arm A, then a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an
      arm B response rate PB, of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30% will have a width Â±15.4%
      when the sample size of evaluable patients is 120 (i.e., 60 patients per treatment arm).
