    
      This clinical trial is an open-label trial of ruxolitinib for the treatment of severe
      COVID-19 to assess its efficacy and safety.

      Ruxolitinib (INCB018424 phosphate, INC424, ruxolitinib phosphate) is a well established,
      potent and selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, with modest to marked
      selectivity against tyrosine kinase (TYK)2 and JAK3, respectively. Ruxolitinib interferes
      with the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for
      hematopoiesis and immune function.

      Ruxolitinib (JAKAVIÂ®) is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of
      disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
      (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or
      post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF) and for the treatment of adult patients
      with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea (HU). In the US, ruxolitinib has
      been approved in the treatment of steroid refractory graft versus host disease post
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      Because many patients with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 have features
      consistent with the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and increased activation of the JAK/STAT
      pathway, it is postulated that ruxolitinib might have a useful role in treating these
      patients.
