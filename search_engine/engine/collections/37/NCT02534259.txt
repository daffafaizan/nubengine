      Normal struts on the device will be substituted with similar but instrumented struts which
      enable force measurement. During clinical visits, forces in the fixator, plus foot forces,
      will be measured during ambulation. Changes in force measurements across treatment and bone
      healing will be analyzed.

      Severe fractures in the lower limb are associated with high energy trauma in both civilian
      and military patients,and are sometimes treated with external fixation devices to stabilize
      the bone until healing has occurred. The devices are kept on the patient for up to a year or
      more at significant cost, intrusiveness, and risk of infection. The clinician must decide
      when to remove the device such that adequate healing has occurred and the bone will not
      re-fracture, but healing rates are variable and x-rays can be misleading. The clinician must
      also identify when a patient is starting to progress poorly and an early revision surgery is
      needed to prevent further complications.

      The investigators' goal is to develop novel approaches for instrumenting and collecting
      mechanical data from orthopaedic braces and devices, and identifying new methodologies for
      interpreting this large volume of functional data for optimizing personalized treatment. The
      present study is focused on external fixators. Strain gauges will be adhered to the fixators
      so that fixator forces can be measured during clinical visits. In this pilot study the
      investigators will develop methods to predict healing based on these measured forces.
