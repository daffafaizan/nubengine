      are still at a markedly increased risk of eye and kidney disease, nerve damage, limb
      amputation, stroke and myocardial infarction as a result of long-term hyperglycemia. It has
      recently been shown that supplementation with lipid soluble vitamin B1 (benfotiamine) in
      diabetic rats could effectively block three major biochemical pathways of hyperglycemic
      damage. It has also been shown that supplementation prevented the development of experimental
      diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, without changes in glycemic control. However, the
      applicability of the above findings to humans is unknown, and the diabetic late complications
      in experimental animals do not in every aspect mirror the human diabetic complications.

      This project will allow us to evaluate the potential of benfotiamine to reduce or prevent the
      further development of microvascular disease in type 1 diabetics.
