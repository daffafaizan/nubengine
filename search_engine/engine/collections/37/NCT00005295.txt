      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and generally fatal disease that causes
      fibrosis of the pulmonary interstitium. While many environmental agents cause diseases
      clinically similar, the etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis suggests that environmental
      agents could incite the tissue injury that results in the disease; furthermore, host
      characteristics could have an important role in determining the magnitude of the host
      response to the agent initiating injury.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this case control study, cases were ascertained at the multiple collaborating centers and
      controls were identified by telephone screening. A telephone interview was conducted to
      collect information needed to test hypotheses concerning cigarette smoking, occupational
      exposure, indoor exposures, other environmental factors, and host factors. To limit disease
      misclassification, two pathologists experienced with interstitial diseases of the lung
      reviewed histopathological material from all cases to exclude entities other than
      interstitial lung fibrosis and to fully characterize the cases clinically. The mortality of
      this large series of cases was also described.
