      is one of treatment strategies in secondary stroke prevention for patients with
      non-cardioemoblism etiology. However, a concerning issue is that wide interindividual
      variability in P2Y12 antagonist, especially clopidogrel. The rate on-treatment high platelet
      reactivity (HPR) can be as high as in one-third of patients with standard dose of
      clopidogrel( i.e. 75mg), and HPR has been noted in those who received other P2Y12
      antagonists, such as ticagrelor and prasugrel. In the present study, we aimed to investigate
      the safety and potential therapeutic effect of individualized treatment of antiplatelet in
      secondary prevention in a cohort of patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic strokes.
