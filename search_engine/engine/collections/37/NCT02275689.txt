      complicated by partial rupture, appears to be the major lesion in chronic rotator cuff
      tendinopathy. Important features is a poor intrinsic ability to heal.

      Several patients receive treatment for shoulder tendinosis each year. Conservative treatments
      options include rest, stretching, strengthening, ice and/or physical therapy are used with
      difference results. A traditional surgical treatments (acromioplasty) have been reported with
      variable results..

      The aim of this study is to evaluate improvement of VAS and functionality using Constant
      score before and after treatment of rotator cuff tendinosis using radiofrequency-plasma based
      microtenotomy in comparison to traditional acromioplasty and physical therapy.
