      I. To assess the usability and usefulness of a computer-based system for cancer patient
      symptom reporting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary effectiveness data: quality of life outcomes with the Function
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) and self-efficacy as measured by Chronic
      Disease Self-Efficacy Scale, Revised (CDSES-R).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive usual care for 3 weeks, then use a computer-based symptom
      reporting system for 3 weeks. Caregivers may assist patients in the use of the computer based
      symptoms reporting system.

      ARM II: Participants use a computer-based symptom reporting system for 3 weeks, then receive
      usual care for 3 weeks. Caregivers may assist patients in the use of the computer based
      symptoms reporting system.

      After completing study intervention, participants are followed up for 30 days.
