      option to increase the sample size to up to 54 volunteers. The decision to increase the
      sample size to 32 was based on the standard deviation of the ECG intervals observed in the
      first 24 volunteers. This analysis was performed by an independent statistician under blinded
      conditions.

      Each volunteer participated in 2 periods. Each period consisted of 1 baseline day (D-1)
      followed by 3 study days (D1 - D3) when the various food effect and drug treatments or
      placebo were administered. All volunteers received all treatments. Moxifloxacin was always
      given on D3 to prevent any carryover effect and there was a minimum washout period of 3 days
      in between the 2 periods.

      How well the treatments (insulin/glucose, high carbohydrate breakfast, calorie reduced
      breakfast and moxifloxacin) were tolerated by the volunteers was assessed and any side
      effects noted.

      We compared the effects of the various treatments between Caucasian and Japanese volunteers.

      Moxifloxacin and placebo were given to volunteers by mouth, i.e. they were asked to swallow
      them with water. The different types of breakfast were provided which volunteers were asked
      to eat. Insulin and glucose were administered intravenously (Insulin/glucose clamp). Hence,
      the study was performed as an open-label design.

      This study was conducted as a single site study at Richmond Pharmacology/ St George's
      University of London.
