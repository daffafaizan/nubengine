      Versus Placebo (ASPRE)

      Screening: All women with singleton pregnancies undergoing routine screening for aneuploidies
      will be invited to participate in the screening study for PET.

      Interventions: Participants who are screened with a high-risk of developing PET will be
      randomised into one of 2 arms of the trial (on the same day as screening or within 1 week of
      the screening visit). Randomised participants will be advised to start 150mg of
      Aspirin/Placebo once per night within 24 hours of randomisation until 36 weeks' gestation or
      when signs of labour commence.

      The maximum duration for aspirin or placebo intake will be 180 days.

      preterm-PET at 11-13 weeks by the algorithm combining maternal history and characteristics,
      biophysical findings (mean arterial pressure and uterine artery Dopplers) and biochemical
      factors (pregnancy associated plasma protein-A and placental growth factor), English,
