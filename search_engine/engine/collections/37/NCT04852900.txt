      spine in decompression therapy is typically alternated between lower and higher levels of
      tension for predetermined periods of time. In either therapy, spinal tension is maintained
      for the period's typically extending 30-minutes or longer. This study will provide evidence
      about how much dose of decompression more effective for the treatment of lumbar
      radiculopathy. As this hypothesis has no evidence about the dosage of decompression in
      literature till now.
