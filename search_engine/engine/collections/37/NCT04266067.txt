      fall risk, and quality of life in postmenopausal women.

      Methods: Forty-eight postmenopausal women were randomized into PNF (n = 24) (5 days a week)
      and Frenkel (n = 24) (5 days a week as a home exercise program) exercise groups. Hand grip
      strength, quality of life (short form- 36), falling risk (Falls Risk of Older
      People-Community Setting [FROP-COM]), and balance (functional reach test [FRT], one - leg
      stand test [OLST], timed up and go test [TUG], and Berg balance scale [BBS]) of all patients
      were evaluated prior to treatment, and at 4th week follow-up. The treatment responses were
      evaluated at the beginning, and at the 4th week. A total of 13 patients (27.1%) had a history
      of falls in the last 6 months and 12 months. According to the intra-group assessment; there
      was a significant improvement in all parameters in PNF group (p<0.05). In Frenkel group,
      there was a significant improvement in all evaluations except the OLST (p=0.064), and the
      short form-36 mental health score (p=0.057). Among the groups; no significant difference was
      detected in terms of hand grip strength, FROP-COM, FRT and TUG scores (p > 0.05). The OLST
      and BBS scores was significantly higher in the PNF group (p=0.022, and p= 0.002,
      respectively). To conclude, PNF and Frenkel exercise programs had significant effects on
      balance parameters, risk of falling and quality of life in postmenopausal women. Frenkel home
      exercise program is cheaper, easier, and requires less manpower, therefore, we think that it
      may be more preferable in terms of improving balance and reducing fall risk in postmenopausal
      women.
