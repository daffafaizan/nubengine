        -  Determine the clinical complete and partial response rate in patients with stage IB, II,
           or IIIA resectable non-small cell lung cancer treated with neoadjuvant bevacizumab,
           paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the ability to proceed with and complete a potentially curative resection in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive neoadjuvant bevacizumab IV over 60-90 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.

      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo surgical resection within 4-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed within 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
