      last decade, reaching between 10% and 20% in Central Africa, and up to 20% in South Africa.
      In addition, asthma related mortality in many African countries is high. South Africa has the
      third highest asthma related mortality rate in the world. Yet to date, a lack of asthma
      research and research infrastructure means that we do not have the evidence to either inform
      advocacy or to develop interventions that improve asthma outcomes.

      This study aims to collect data about asthma prevalence and to identify existing barriers to
      effective asthma management of young people in 6 sub-Saharan countries: Malawi, South Africa,
      Zimbabwe, Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria. Each of these countries will identify 500 young people
      with asthma between 12 and 16 years of age through a screening questionnaire in schools.
      These 3000 young people with asthma symptoms will fill in a survey about asthma, including
      questions around asthma control, current treatment and access to care, asthma knowledge,
      asthma attitudes, smoking and environmental influences. Some of the participants will also
      discuss asthma related topics in focus groups. A subset of the participants will furthermore
      do Spirometry and FeNO testing. In addition to the data collection, the study will develop
      and test options for an intervention aimed at improving asthma control, including the
      adaption of a United Kingdom - based theater play about asthma awareness. The development of
      WiFi infrastructure and IT solutions will be promoted by the study, where appropriate.
