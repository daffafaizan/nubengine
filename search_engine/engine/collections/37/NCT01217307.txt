      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a total of 380 non-diabetic patients. This
      trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial. The intervention, which consist of
      metformin 500mg twice daily or placebo twice daily, will commence within three hours after
      the percutaneous coronary intervention, and will be continued for 4 months. The primary
      endpoint is the difference between the two intervention groups (metformin vs placebo) in left
      ventricular ejection fraction, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging after 4 months.
      The investigators hypothesize that metformin therapy results in a significantly higher
      ejection fraction in this population.
