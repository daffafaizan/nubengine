    
      E004 is formulated with epinephrine free base as the active ingredient, and hydrofluoroalkane
      (HFA-134a) as the propellant.

      In order to differentiate the inhaled epinephrine from the fluctuating background of
      endogenous epinephrine 1, a stable-isotope deuterium (2H) labeled epinephrine
      (epinephrine-d3) preparation will be used to formulate E004 inhalers, denoted as E004-d3. PK
      of E004 at 125 mcg of epinephrine-d3 per inhalation, will be compared to that of the
      currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine-CFC MDI as the Reference Control (220 mcg per
      inhalation).

      This study is a randomized, evaluator-blind, single dose, two-arm, crossover, PK study, to be
      conducted in ~18 healthy, male and female, adult volunteers. PK will be studied using E004-d3
      at 125 mcg per inhalation (Arm T). A currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine CFC-MDI
      will be used as a Reference Control (Arm C).
