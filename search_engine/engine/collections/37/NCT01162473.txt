      Prior to and after the desensitization, we will conduct double-blind placebo controlled food
      challenges to cow's milk protein. During the desensitization phase, we will give increasing
      doses of cow's milk protein by mouth on a weekly basis, as tolerated. The desensitization
      protocol starts with dilutional doses of milk and build up to a goal of 8 ounces of cow's
      milk.

      Main Study Outcome Measure

      The percentage of children completing the desensitization protocol in each study group will
      be the primary outcome measure.
