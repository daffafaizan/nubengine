      men with prostate cancer who are overweight/ obese are at an increase risk of recurrence,
      metastasis and mortality, elucidating a diet that will both improve biomarkers for prostate
      cancer and lead to long-term weight management could improve survivorship. The primary
      objective of this proposal is to compare a plant-based, olive oil (PBOO) diet to a
      conventional diet for weight loss and improvement in metabolic biomarkers (specifically
      fasting insulin, glucose, and triglycerides) for overweight/ obese men diagnosed with
      prostate cancer on surveillance or who have had an asymptomatic biochemical failure after
      primary therapy. The secondary objective is to determine which diet will be more acceptable
      for long term use. Participants will consume for 8 weeks each a conventional diet for
      treating prostate cancer and a PBOO diet for weight loss and improvement in biomarkers with
      random assignment to the diet order. They will choose one of the diets for 6 months of
      follow-up. Blood samples and body weight will be obtained pre- and post diet and after 6
      months of follow-up and compared between the diets. Based on earlier work by colleagues of
      the PI, it is anticipated that the PBOO diet will result in better weight loss and biomarkers
      and will be more acceptable for long-term weight management. This protocol has the potential
      to elucidate a diet that will improve the body weight and survival of men with prostate
      cancer.
