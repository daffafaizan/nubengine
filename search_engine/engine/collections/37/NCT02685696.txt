    
      Main Hypothesis:

      Does the use of the newly designed Alexis O Retractor lead to improved Surgical Site
      Infection rates intra-operative and post-operative surgical outcomes in the setting of
      planned elective first time Caesarean Sections in patients compared to the traditional
      self-retaining metal retractor?

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      Does the Alexis O Retractor lead to improved intra-operative and post-operative surgical
      outcomes in the setting of planned elective Caesarean Sections?

      Study Design:

      The Study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 100 patients
      randomized to the Alexis O Retractor group and 100 patients to the conventional group.

      All patients will be recruited following a thorough discussion about the purpose and
      methodology of the study and full documented consent will be obtained prior to randomization.

      Patients with wound healing problems, connective tissue disorders, diabetes, bleeding
      disorders, previous abdominal surgery apart from laparoscopy and chorioamnionitis will be
      excluded.

      All surgical operators are thoroughly trained in the use and application of the Alexis O
      Retractor prior to the start of the study and supported by regular teaching demonstrations.
      The Obstetric Theatre Team is informed and trained in use and application of the Alexis O
      Retractor within the Study Design.

      Ethical Approval:

      Ethical Approval has already been obtained from the Ethics committee at the Charit√©
      University Hospital Committee and in keeping with ethical standards.
