      treatment of at least five days of a (LMW) heparin followed by long-term treatment with a
      vitamin K antagonist (VKA), such as warfarin. The eTRIS study will address the clinically
      important question of whether edoxaban monotherapy, without concomitant (LMW) heparin at the
      time of treatment initiation is comparable to or better than standard treatment with (LMW)
      heparin/warfarin therapy in subjects with acute symptomatic DVT as assessed by the relative
      change from baseline in thrombus volume (measured by MRI) at Day 14-21.
