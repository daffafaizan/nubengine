      problems. Because the CF population has historically only been young, this is not something
      that has been focused on. No research has currently identified whether patients with CF have
      a much earlier risk of developing cognitive impairment or how CF impacts on the brain.

      There has not previously been work in this area of CF and the investigators are in a unique
      position with the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) and its expertise
      to be able to perform Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) scans and neurocognitive testing on
      patients with CF for the first time.
