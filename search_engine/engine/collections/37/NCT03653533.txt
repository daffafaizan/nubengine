      improve the glycemia stability in real condition.

      There are several phases:

        -  phase 1: insulin pump without captor (12 weeks)

        -  phase 2: insulin pump with captor and without SmartGuard® function (4X6 days; 4 weeks)

        -  phase 3: insulin pump with captor and with SmartGuard® function (6X6 days; 6 weeks)

        -  phase 4: insulin pump without captor (4 weeks)
