      blood lymphocytes (PBL) specifically associated with acute myelogenous leukemia in patients
      with adult or pediatric Hodgkin's disease treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. II.
      Determine the frequency of these aberrations in patients with pediatric central nervous
      system tumors treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. III. Determine the
      glutathione-S-transferase allotype, associated with human toxicological response to
      carcinogen exposure, for these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of t(14;18) gene
      rearrangement, associated with deregulation of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene in non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma, in PBL of these patients.

      OUTLINE: An extra tube of blood is collected before, every 4 weeks during, and every 3 months
      after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. DNA is isolated from the blood sample and the GSTM1,
      GSTT1, and various cytochrome P (CYP) 450 genotypes are determined by polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). Mononuclear leukocytes are analyzed for chromosome aberrations on chromosome
      numbers 3, 11, and 21. Pretreatment karyotype and frequency of translocations are determined
      for each patient. Peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA is also examined for t(14;18) gene
      rearrangements.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
