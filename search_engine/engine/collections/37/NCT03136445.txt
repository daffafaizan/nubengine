      consequence of the disease or the treatment by chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.
      Platelet transfusions are commonly given to raise any low platelet count and reduce the risk
      of clinical bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). But recent studies have
      indicated that many patients continue to experience bleeding, despite the use of platelet
      transfusions. Tranexamic acid is a type of drug that is called an antifibrinolytic. These
      drugs act to reduce the breakdown of clots formed in response to bleeding. These drugs have
      been used widely in both elective and emergency surgery and have been shown to decrease blood
      loss and the use of red cell transfusions. The purpose of this study is to test whether
      giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of
      bleeding or death, and the need for platelet transfusions. Patients will be randomised to
      receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously through a drip, or orally) or a placebo. The
      investigators will measure the rates of bleeding daily using a short structured assessment of
      bleeding and will record the number of transfusions given to patients.
