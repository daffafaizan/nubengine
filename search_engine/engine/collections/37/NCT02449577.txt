    
      The study is designed as a randomized, 4-way single-blinded cross-over intervention study.
      The participants are randomized individually to the order by which they shall receive 4 test
      meals. There will be implemented a standardized lunch which includes respectively 1)
      Light/alcohol-free (Tuborg Super Light 0,1% alcohol), 2) Regular lager (4,6% alcohol), 3)
      Strong beer(7,2% alcohol) and 4) a control drink without alcohol but with the same energy
      content (carbohydrate and protein) as the average of the other beverages ("sportsdrink").
      Besides 330 ml of each test drink, each test meal consists of grilled cheese sandwiches
      (Tulip Food Company) and the amount of toast adjusted according to the type of drink served
      with each meal, so the content of macronutrients is the same in each meal.

      The study includes 16-20 participants, randomized as to which order they will receive the 4
      test meals with a washout period of at least 6 days in between test days. Upon arrival the
      test persons are asked to urinate (baseline sample), and at the 1st visit they are then
      weighed, height is measured and body composition (bioimpedance) is measured. After resting
      briefly, a baseline blood sample is taken and blood pressure is measured (1st and 4th visit).
      45 minutes after start of the test meal the first postprandial blood sample is taken, and
      again after 45, 120 and 180 minutes. Urine is collected again at 0-90 min, 90-180 min and
      3-24 hours after the test meal. Participants are provided with containers and equipment for
      this purpose, and must submit samples on an ongoing basis to the Dept. of Nutrition, Exercise
      and Sports.
