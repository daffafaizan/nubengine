        -  Determine the modulation of apoptosis-related pathways in patients with cancer of the
           urothelium treated with short-term low-dose interferon alfa.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      In all arms, treatment begins at the time of the pre-operative visit and continues until the
      time of cystoscopy.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa as in arm I at a higher dose.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive interferon alfa SC once daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive interferon alfa as in arm III at a higher dose. In all arms,
           treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
