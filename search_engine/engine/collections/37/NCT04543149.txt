      plays a role in many varying aetiology, including infectious and non-infectious causes. This
      disease can clinically and radiographically mimic breast cancer, which can pose a diagnostic
      challenge as well as concern during evaluation. A nonspecific inflammatory response,
      'granuloma' is defined as necrosis or infiltration of other inflammatory leukocytes, with or
      without mononuclear phagocyte collection. It is thought to be caused by infectious agents or
      foreign substances that activate the immune system, leading to granuloma formation. Some of
      the known inflammatory etiologies of granulomatous mastitis are autoimmune diseases such as
      tuberculosis (most commonly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis), sarcoidosis, fungal
      infection and granulomatosis with polyangiitis and giant cell arteritis. These diseases
      cannot be distinguished clinically, pathologically, and radiographically from idiopathic
      granulomatous mastitis.In this study, we aimed to investigate lymphocyte subtypes in patients
      with granulomatous mastitis and to evaluate the differences in cell populations and its
      usability as a predictive marker in diagnosis.
