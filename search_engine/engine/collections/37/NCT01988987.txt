      years old or older who delivered a child or fetus within the previous 4 days at either
      hospital who also were diagnosed with GDM during the pregnancy will be eligible for
      participation. Women will be excluded if they have issues that would interfere with
      administration of a GTT, are unable /unwilling to provide informed consent, or cannot follow
      up. Anticipated enrollment will be 250 women at each study site.

      While still hospitalized two to four days postpartum, subjects will undergo a 75-gram, 2-hour
      GTT and have blood tested for hemoglobin A1c and glucose levels. They will be reminded to do
      the recommended GTT 6-12 weeks after delivery. Maternal, neonatal, and obstetric
      characteristics will be collected, including the any GTT results. The results of the
      in-hospital GTT will be compared to the result of the GTT taken 6-12 weeks postpartum and
      tested for correlation.
