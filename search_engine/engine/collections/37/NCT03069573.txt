      have been undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to general complaints. The
      demographic, clinical symptoms, endoscopy, pH monitoring, and histology data are assessed
      during the diagnostic process. In the baseline endoscopy procedure samples (blood, saliva,
      esophageal tissue, and esophageal mucus) are taken. After diagnostic process of EoE and
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) supported by International Guidelines the patients are
      divided into three groups - EoE, GERD, and Control.

      The techniques are used for patients characterization and assessment:

        1. Symptoms score: General symptom score and/or Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom
           Score (PEESS v2.0) - translated and adapted version for Brazilian Portuguese

        2. Endoscopic Score: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS)

        3. Peak eosinophil count (PEC) and histological features description

        4. Proteomic analyses

        5. Microbiome analyses

        6. Immunohistochemistry analyses
