      dose given twice a week (BIW) for 3 months followed by a reduction to a maintenance dose of
      50 mg once weekly (QW). While most patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis are
      managed satisfactorily on etanercept monotherapy, a proportion may require a modified or
      alternative treatment regimen (eg, to handle flares or loss of effect) at some point during
      their chronic management. Despite the clinical need, no published data from randomized
      controlled studies are currently available that demonstrate efficacy and safety of combined
      etanercept-based regimens in patients with plaque psoriasis.

      The addition of an as-needed topical medication to the step-down dose of etanercept 50 mg
      once weekly administered after the initial 12 week period of 50 mg twice weekly may be a
      potential option for patients who may require adjunctive therapy. This study aimed to provide
      data on this treatment option by estimating the difference in mean percent change in
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores between step-down etanercept 50 mg once
      weekly supplemented with as-needed topical medication and continuous treatment with
      etanercept 50 mg twice weekly.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study and will receive etanercept 50 mg twice
      weekly for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of etanercept treatment, participants will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups.
