    
      A randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded and parallel group trial (12 therapeutic
      sessions) with optimal protocol (defined in phase 1) and sham tDCS will be conducted to
      evaluated electrical cortical activity and pain control, number of migraine attacks and
      quality of life of migraine patients. Electrical cortical activity will be assessed through:
      (i) motor evoked potential (MEP); (ii) motor threshold (MT); (iii) short interval
      intracortical inhibition (SICI); (iv) intracortical facilitation (ICF); (v) phosphene
      threshold (PT) and (vi) visual evoked-potential (VEP-habituation). Clinical outcomes will be
      evaluated through: (i) headache diary; (ii) visual analog scale (VAS); (iii) Migrainde
      disability assessment (MIDAS); (iv) Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and (v) World Health
      Organization quality of life assessment instrument (WHOQOL BREF).
