      limited data on its clinical efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to assess the functional outcome
      following Sphinkeeper™ surgery in patients with refractory FI.

      Patients with FI, who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled to our study and received
      Sphinkeeper™ implantation. Functional outcome and quality of life was evaluated by standard
      questionnaires before and after surgery. In the routine check-up patients received endoanal
      ultrasound and anorectal manometry.
