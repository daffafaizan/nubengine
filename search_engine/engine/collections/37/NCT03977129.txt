      undergo elective open-heart valvular surgery due to primary valvular heart disease, with
      comorbid coronary artery lesions defined as diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% (visual estimation)
      that are diagnosed by CAG before the surgery.

      QFR group: Calculate the QFR values of all target coronary arteries (anterior descending
      branch, circumflex branch, main right coronary artery or its primary branches with ≥ 1.5 mm
      in diameter, such as diagonal branch, intermediate branch, obtuse marginal branch, posterior
      descending branch and posterior branch of left ventricle) with lesions with diameter stenosis
      of ≥ 50% (visual estimation) suited for CABG revascularization. If QFR ≤ 0.80, then
      simultaneous CABG revascularization of target blood vessels will be carried out. If QFR >
      0.80, then no CABG revascularization of target blood vessels will be carried out.

      CAG group (control group): All target coronary arteries (anterior descending branch,
      circumflex branch, main right coronary artery or its primary branches with ≥ 1.5 mm in
      diameter, such as diagonal branch, intermediate branch, obtuse marginal branch, posterior
      descending branch and posterior branch of left ventricle) with lesions with diameter stenosis
      of ≥ 50% (visual estimation) suited for CABG revascularization will undergo simultaneous CABG
      revascularization.

      Intervention duration: The assessments will be performed after randomization and before the
      surgery to guide the surgery.

      No planned interim analysis.
