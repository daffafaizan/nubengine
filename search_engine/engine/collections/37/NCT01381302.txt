      not treated with anti-parkinson drugs. The clinical diagnosis will be based on the criteria
      of the United Kingdom Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank.5 All patients will undergo
      Tc-99m-Trodat1 SPECT. The severity of the motor symptoms will be assessed with the Unified PD
      Rating Scale (UPDRS). Genomic DNA is extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes for genetic
      analysis.
