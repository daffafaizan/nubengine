      injury defined by disruption of diffusion of water in white matter using diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) as compared to orthopedic injury (OI) controls.

      Methods: Children ages 11-16 years who presented within 6 hours of either a mTBI or an
      isolated OI were recruited from the emergency department (ED). Patients had Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) study performed within 96 hours of injury. Voxel based analysis approach was
      used to quantify the group differences for common DTI measures. In the ED and at the time of
      the scan, symptom burden was measured using the post concussion symptom scale.
