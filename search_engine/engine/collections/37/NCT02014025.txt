    
      Background:primary hepatic carcinoma( PHC) is the world's most common and one of the most
      malignant tumors, the incidence of malignant tumors in the top five in the world, second only
      to mortality in gastric cancer, ranked No. 3. surgery and comprehensive treatment is
      recognized by the medical profession Surgical approach, surgical methods include open and
      laparoscopic liver resection .The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic resection small PHC has
      been recognized, but the safety and efficacy of laparoscopy PHC resection is still a dispute,
      that with a tumor size of 5～10㎝, the clinical evidence is a C or D grade level from the
      standard definition of evidence-based medicine literature which has been published , for
      laparoscopic liver resection versus open liver resection for these hepatocellular carcinoma
      prospective case-control study has not been reported.

      Intervention:We will let the 90 patients who meet the inclusion criteria .Patients in
      hepatobiliary surgery A, D district is undergo traditional open liver resection,
      hepatobiliary surgery E district is undergo laparoscopic liver resection. In addition to the
      surgery way is different, the rest treatments are same.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include:operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood
           transfusion, Rate of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver
           function, resection margin, long-term curative effect and survival time were collected
           and analysed.

        2. Statistical method:groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression
           analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival
           analysis，Log-rank curves were used.
