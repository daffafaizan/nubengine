      nocturnal hemoglobinuria and consisted of 1200 mg immediately prior to transplantation, 600
      mg on postoperative day 1, and 600 mg weekly thereafter for 4 weeks. At week 4, assessment of
      DSA levels was performed. Eculizumab was discontinued in patients whose DSA had significantly
      decreased (B flow crossmatch channel shift<200). In patients with persistently high DSA and
      thus believed to have continued high risk for AMR, eculizumab treatment continued (1200 mg
      week 5, and then every 2 weeks). Another DSA assessment was performed at week 9 and
      eculizumab was discontinued if the B flow crossmatch channel shift was <200.

      The eculizumab group were compared to a historical control group consisting of consecutive
      transplants between 1/1/2005 and 1/10/2017 who met the inclusion criteria. The historical
      control group had been treated with a similar plasma exchange based protocol without
      eculizumab.
