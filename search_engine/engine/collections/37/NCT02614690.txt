      univalve (a split along a single side of the cast) or bivalve (a split along both sides of
      the cast) fashion. Theoretically, the splitting of the cast allows for expansion and soft
      tissue swelling. However, review of the literature yields a paucity of evidence demonstrating
      the efficacy of splitting a cast. In a study by Nietosvaara et. al, a retrospective
      examination of 109 pediatric patients initially treated with closed cylindrical casting for
      closed forearm fractures were evaluated. Of these 109 patients, one-sixth required the
      initial cast to be split, trimmed, or removed secondary to post-traumatic swelling.

      However, the splitting of a cast is not without risks in itself. Once the initial swelling
      dissipates, a univalved or bivalved cast can become excessively loose. This loosening has
      been associated with a loss of reduction. If the loss or reduction is substantial, it may
      require a re-reduction or operation to correct. In addition, with every use of the cast saw a
      patient is placed at risk for iatrogenic cast saw injury. Thermal burns and abrasions from
      cast saws can cause lifelong emotional and physical scars for a patient. They can also be an
      inciting event for litigation against the hospital and or provider, with settlements
      averaging greater than $12,000 per centimeter of cast saw injury.
