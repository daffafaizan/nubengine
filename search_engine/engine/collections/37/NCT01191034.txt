    
      Patients will receive the following treatments:

        1. Vaccinations:

           The vaccine will be the MAGE-3.A1 and/or the NA17.A2 peptide, matching the patient's HLA
           type and the gene expression of his tumor. If both antigens are expressed, then the
           patient will receive both peptides.

        2. Local treatment with a combination of immunomodulatory drugs:

      This treatment will combine peritumoral injection of IL-2, IFN-α and GM-CSF (6000 IU, 100.000
      IU and 300 ng per tumor injected, respectively), as well as topical application of imiquimod
      (applied during 24h). The peritumoral injections of cytokines will be given on days
      +2,+3,+4,+7,+8 and +9, and the Aldara® cream will be applied on days +2 and +7 following
      vaccines 3 and 4. One or 2 cutaneous lesions will be treated, if there are 2 or more such
      lesions present at day 29 of the treatment, respectively.
