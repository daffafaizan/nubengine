      Exosomes are formed by inward budding of late endosomes, producing multivesicular bodies
      (MVBs), and are released into the environment by fusion of the MVBs with the plasma membrane.
      It has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating
      cell and the conditions under which they are produced. Tumor exosome production, transfer and
      education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis.

      Aims of the study:

      Proteomics studies will be done in both tumor tissue and the circulating exosome from the
      gallbladder carcinoma patients. Then, the potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers will
      be searched by bioinformatics to find the correlations between exosome biomarkers and
      gallbladder carcinoma.

      Materials and Methods:

      The investigators will conduct a case-control study in 11 hospitals from China. Cases will be
      the patients with newly-diagnosed gallbladder carcinoma. The controls will be matched （1：1）by
      sex，race and age which will be selected from the patients receiving cholecystectomy due to
      gallstones from the same hospital with the cases. A total of 50 patients with gallbladder
      carcinoma will be recruited. The investigators will obtain the blood and tumor tissue samples
      for further analysis of proteomics studies. Exosome from blood specimens will be isolated and
      purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The potential prognostic and predictive
      biomarkers will be searched by bioinformatics to find the correlations between exosome
      biomarkers and gallbladder carcinoma. Data will be collected from January 2018 to December
      2018.
