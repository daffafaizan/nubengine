      inflammation on the behavioral response to social and non-social rewards, using tasks that
      assess reward motivation, sensitivity, and learning. Both elevated inflammation and reward
      dysregulation are associated with depression and have been shown to predict depression onset;
      understanding how inflammation alters the reward system in the laboratory setting may provide
      insight into risk factors and help identify potential areas for intervention. In this
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of low dose endotoxin in 40 adult
      premenopausal women (25-44 y), the investigators will examine effects of endotoxin on reward
      responsiveness across dimensions (i.e., motivation, sensitivity, learning) and reward types
      (e.g., social and non-social). The investigators hypothesize that as compared to placebo,
      endotoxin will 1) decrease non-social reward responses across reward dimensions; 2) decrease
      "general" social reward responses across reward dimensions; 3) increase "close" social reward
      responses across reward dimensions; 4) decrease resting eye blink rate (EBR); EBR will be
      correlated with learning and motivation for non-social reward. The second component of the
      study is to examine whether effects of endotoxin on reward differ as a function of age; in
      particular it is hypothesized that effects will be more robust in younger compared to older
      women. In order to test for age differences, this study will use data from 40 older women
      (65+ y) participating in a parallel ongoing randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT03256760). Thus, the investigation aims to: 1) Evaluate effects of
      inflammation on non-social reward as a function of age; 2) Evaluate effects of inflammation
      on general and close social reward as a function of age; 3) Examine changes in dopaminergic
      activity as a mechanism linking effects of inflammation on non-social reward processing as a
      function of age.
