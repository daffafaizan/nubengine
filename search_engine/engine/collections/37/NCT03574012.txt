      I. Determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining hematologic malignancy and
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors in a randomized cardiovascular (CV) risk
      reduction mobile health (mHealth) counseling intervention.

      II. Develop and refine a protocol to engage participants using an existing social medial
      platform and commercially available mHealth tools to reinforce lifestyle goals.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants receive individualized goal-setting and coaching in relation
      to physical activity and diet, supplemented with peer support through the study's social
      media platform, over 4 months. They also have access to mHealth apps including Fitbit and
      Healthwatch that provide feedback on physical activity and diet.

      CONTROL GROUP: Participants receive general information about physical activity and diet, and
      access to Fitbit and Healthwatch.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 2 months and at 1 year.
