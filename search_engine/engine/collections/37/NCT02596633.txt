      therefore a large percentage of people with MS would be eligible to take part in a study
      offering a psychotherapeutic component to address these issues.

      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been found to be effective for mood problems, and
      been successfully used in self-help format, but no study has thus-far examined potential for
      use as an effective intervention in this (MS) population.

      People will MS and low mood will be recruited from a neurology outpatient clinic. They will
      be randomized to either receive treatment as usual, or an ACT self-help book with 8
      supportive telephone calls from a trainee clinical psychologist. Measures of anxiety,
      depression, quality of life and physical health will be administered at baseline,
      post-intervention and six month follow up. A sub sample of 10 participants will be
      interviewed to find out their view on taking part in the study.
