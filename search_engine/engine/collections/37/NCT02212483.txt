    
      Methodology/Study schedule :

      A prospective multicenter randomised, open label, controlled trial with blind evaluation of
      the primary evaluation criterion on three parallel groups of patients.

      Procedures :

      Home intervention of MIECs that comprise diagnostic of allergen/irritant exposure (after
      sampling), advices for allergen/irritant avoidance and follow up of advice compliance.

      After randomisation and agreement of the patient and the family, the " intervention group "
      will benefit from a first home intervention of a MIEC during the 4 weeks following inclusion,
      then a final visit at the end of the study after 12 months.

      Two comparative groups will be identified :

        -  the " control group " who will benefit from a first home intervention of a MIEC but
           without advices (only audit + sampling), then a final and a complete visit at the end of
           the study

        -  a " non intervention " group with no initial visit, but who will benefit from a complete
           home intervention of a MIEC at the end of the study.

      Expected findings and impact :

      If our hypothesis that home intervention of MIECs are cost-effective on asthma control, then
      it is relevant to include such service in the medical care during the management of asthma
      patients with a reimbursement by the social security.
