      will receive two doses of ODM-103 and one dose of placebo. Part II of the study is a multiple
      ascending dose parallel group study where healthy volunteers will receive ODM-103 three times
      daily for seven days. Healthy volunteers taking part in Part II of the study will also
      receive levo/carbidopa and entacapone four times daily on day 1 and levo/carbidopa in
      addition to ODM-103 on day 9. The study will also look at the pharmacokinetic(how the body
      handles the drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the drug affects the body) of ODM-103.
