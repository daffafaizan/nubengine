      perturbations in the phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) can
      modulate cardiac function and produce a compensatory hypertrophic response. We have cloned a
      novel human cardiac kinase (MLCK) that targets the cardiac RLC and identified a common allele
      unique to the African-American population. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a
      large group of African-American individuals with hypertension and/or cardiac disease, a
      portion of who will possess this allele. It is well documented that hypertensive
      African-Americans have an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We
      expect that, in this population of hypertensive individuals, we will find an increased left
      ventricular mass in individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for this kinase allele.

      In this study, patients with the allele can be matched to others in the cohort without the
      allele and evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and
      chamber size. In addition, metabolic stress testing will be performed to assess the
      implications of this allele on clinical performance. Another group of 75 Afro-Americans with
      dilated cardiomyopathy will be referred from local heart failure clinics and evaluated in a
      similar fashion. Allele prevalence and associated cardiac findings will also be compared with
      hypertensive patients matched for age and gender. In a parallel experiment, mice
      over-expressing this kinase, are being generated and will provide us with tissue samples with
      which to pursue the biophysical basis of the mechanical changes in muscle function.
