    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety and tolerability
      of IMGN632 and assess the antileukemia activity of IMGN632 when administered in combination
      with azacitidine and/or venetoclax in patients with relapsed and frontline CD123-positive
      AML, and antileukemia activity of IMGN632 when administered as monotherapy in patients with
      MRD+ AML after frontline treatment.

      This study explores multiple IMGN632 doses in combination and monotherapy Regimens, including
      (A) azacitidine, (B) venetoclax, (C) azacitidine+venetoclax, and (D) monotherapy in MRD+ AML.
      For combination Regimens A-C, a Phase 1b Dose Escalation Cohort will determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN632 in that specific combination Regimen, followed by
      a Phase 2 Dose Expansion Cohort for each combination Regimen to further characterize the
      safety profile and assess the antileukemia activity of the different combination Regimens.
      Regimen D will open with a Dose Expansion Cohort using the IMGN632 monotherapy dose and
      schedule based on safety data from the initial Phase 2 study (IMGN632-0801) and will not have
      a Dose Escalation Phase.
