      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium (PD). The cause of these entities is
      unknown. It is unclear what part anesthetics play in the development of POCD and PD. The
      investigators hypothesize that elderly patient's cognitive capacities recover more slowly
      after receiving general anesthesia, perhaps because they have more limited cognitive reserve.
      A more prolonged recovery would confound diagnoses of POCD and PD and potentially puts
      patients who are discharged on the day of surgery at risk of not understanding postoperative
      instructions. The trajectory of postoperative cognitive recovery has never been explored and
      elderly participants have been explicitly not included in any type of emergence research. To
      explore this vital area the investigators propose to study young and elderly volunteers with
      a combination of two state of the art neuropsychological tests (Postoperative Quality of
      Recovery Scale and the NIH Toolbox) and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Starting from
      baseline, the investigators will determine multiple cognitive domains and resting state
      networks, treat the participants with general anesthesia for two hours while continuing to
      examine network activity, and then explore the recovery of the cognitive domains and
      alterations in functional networks using both the PQRS and the NIH Toolbox Cognitive
      Measures. Participants will be evaluated at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months.
