      symptom reduction, there are many negative side effects associated with medication use. Thus,
      there has been an increased emphasis on exercise interventions for symptom reduction. Recent
      research has shown that both sensory attention focused exercise (SAFEx) and strength training
      interventions improved disease severity more so than other exercise interventions (such as
      aerobic, aquatic and no exercise). Upon closer examination, SAFEx showed further symptom
      improvements than the strength training program. Thus exists the need to further examine
      SAFEx using a standardized protocol - a single-blind randomized double-crossover trial - that
      has been used sparingly in exercise interventions. In addition, the 30-second chair stand has
      been implemented into the testing protocol, as it has been shown to be a reliable measurement
      of functional strength for older adults. This test was implemented in order to identify the
      functional strength gains, if any, that are associated with SAFEx. It is hypothesized that
      the SAFEx intervention will improve disease symptoms in PD, and that the results will not be
      due to strength gains.
