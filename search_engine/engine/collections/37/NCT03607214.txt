      would be tested. They will randomly be assigned to the experimental group (taking the
      antidepressant which is in fact an active placebo) or the control group (not taking a
      placebo). Then participants watch a well established film sequence to induce sadness. Sadness
      is assessed before and after receiving the nasal spray and watching the film sequence. In the
      seven consecutive days the participant's mood is assessed each day, only the experimental
      group is taking the placebo each day. Afterwards participants will watch another sad film
      sequence and sadness will be assessed before and afterwards.
