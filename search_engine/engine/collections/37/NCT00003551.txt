      with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion. II.
      Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of aminocamptothecin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion intravenously for 120 hours
      weekly for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
