      patients with breast cancer planning to undergo surgery. Omega-3 fatty acid may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Celecoxib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether omega-3 fatty acid or celecoxib is more effective in treating breast cancer.
