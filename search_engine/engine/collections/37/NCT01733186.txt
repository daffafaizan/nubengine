      resolution of symptoms following damage to the articular cartilage. Despite the numerous
      techniques available today, complete healing of damaged or defective cartilage or consistent
      reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage does not occur, and continuous drug administration
      or secondary surgeries are common.

      Research in mesenchymal stem cells has had a rapid acceleration over the past decade and
      MSC-based therapy has become one of the objects of investigation for a new branch of medicine
      termed regenerative medicine. This emerging technology shows great promise for producing
      transplantable cartilage constructs to restore the function of degenerated joints.

      CARTISTEMÂ®, a combination of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and
      sodium hyaluronate, is intended to be used as a single-dose cellular therapeutic agent for
      cartilage regeneration in human subjects with cartilage defects of the knee as a result of
      ageing, trauma, or degenerative diseases.
