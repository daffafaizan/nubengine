      pharmacological (i.e., prokinetic and symptomatic) agents. Exciting and novel preliminary
      data from our programs demonstrate that (i) reduced expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is
      responsible for loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and delayed gastric emptying in non-obese
      diabetic (NOD) mice, (ii) upregulation of (HO-1) reverses delayed gastric emptying in this
      model, perhaps by generating carbon monoxide (CO), which has anti-apoptotic and
      cytoprotective actions, and may relax smooth muscle, and (iii) hemin upregulates HO-1 in
      humans. However, hemin is exorbitant and can only be administered intravenously. A large
      throughput screening assay uncovered that the histamine H2 receptor antagonist nizatidine and
      the ACE inhibitor lisinopril upregulate HO-1 in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. Hence,
      this double-blind placebo-controlled study will randomly assign 24 healthy subjects to one of
      4 arms, and HO-1 protein activity and concentration will be assessed.
