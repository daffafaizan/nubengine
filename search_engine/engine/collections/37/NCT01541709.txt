      or unresectable GIST, hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Korean
      patients compared to the Western studies.7 It may be caused by relatively higher exposure to
      imatinib per body surface area in Korean patients than in Western population because the
      weight and height of Korean patients are relatively smaller than Western people. So, we plan
      to start imatinib at 400 mg per day and then sequentially escalate the doses of imatinib in
      this study.
