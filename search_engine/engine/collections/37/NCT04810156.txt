      due to an increasing number of indications, including additional types of cancer, combination
      of ICI with other antineoplastic therapies and have recently moved into the adjuvant setting.
      According to clinical trial material, almost all patients in ICI treatment will eventually
      develop any grade of adverse event, here, estimated in up to 90% of treated patients. Around
      10-30 percent of ICI treated patients will show signs of liver injury related to ICI
      treatment and will be diagnosed with immune related hepatitis. The treatment hereof, should
      include observation and medium dose steroids in low grade asymptomatic patients (grade â‰¤ 2
      ir-hepatitis) and high-dose steroids in higher grades according to the current European and
      American guidelines. However, up to 25 percent of patients with ir-hepatitis may not respond
      properly to steroids due to primary resistance or relapse during tapering. These patients
      should be offered a second line immunosuppressive treatment. The present recommendation for
      patients with steroid-dependent ir-hepatitis is based on case series and includes
      immunosuppressive treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). To date, no evidence exists for
      which second line treatment to choose.

      Based on the similarity of immune related hepatitis with autoimmune hepatitis, tacrolimus may
      be more efficient than MMF in achieving complete and faster response in patients with steroid
      refractory or steroid dependent ir-hepatitis. Furthermore, patients with signs of biliary
      injury may benefit from adding ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
