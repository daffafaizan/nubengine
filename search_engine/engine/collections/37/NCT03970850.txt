    
      Clinical performance characteristics of the NeuMoDx CT/NG Assay on NeuMoDx™ 288 Molecular
      System and NeuMoDx™ 96 Molecular System will be evaluated in a multi-center, prospective,
      sampling study by comparing the diagnoses made by the NeuMoDx™ CT/NG Assay to Patient
      Infected Status (PIS) as the reference standard.

      Prospectively collected urine and swab specimens from individual subjects will be tested
      using the NeuMoDx™ CT/NG Assay at one of the three NeuMoDx testing sites. Subjects' PIS for
      CT and PIS for NG will be determined by a central laboratory using FDA-cleared, legally
      marketed CT/NG combo assays on pre-specified sample matrices according to the PIS
      determination algorithms.
