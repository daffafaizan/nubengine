      as part of their standard of care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)
      stenting on the femoropopliteal artery. This will be achieved through the following Specific
      Aims:

      Aim 1. Evaluate standard pre-operative lower extremity CTAs of patients with PAD and
      determine the baseline arterial geometry and lesion characteristics.

      Aim 2. Evaluate the results of intraoperative angiography and blood pressure measurements
      proximal and distal to the stent.

      Aim 3. Six months after stenting perform standard post-operative lower extremity CTA and
      assess the amount of in-stent restenosis and changes to the arterial geometry.

      In our NIH 1R01 HL125736-01 application we propose to build mathematical models of human
      femoropopliteal arteries repaired with several of the most commonly used PAD stents and
      assess the mechanical stress associated with limb flexion. These models will aim at
      predicting disease recurrence for arteries with different patient and lesion characteristics.
