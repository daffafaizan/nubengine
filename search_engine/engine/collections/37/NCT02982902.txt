    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of the treatment of
      opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) with virus-specific, antigen-selected T-cells, selected using the CliniMACS prodigy
      system.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected
           T-cells.

        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected
           T-cells.

        -  To describe the rate of eradication of opportunistic CMV infections after HSCT and and
           treatment with CMV-specific, antigen-selected T-cells using the CliniMACS Prodigy
           System.

      This feasibility study will include a single treatment cohort.
