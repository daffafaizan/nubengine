      functionality. This will lead to an increase in the number of dependent elderly and a high
      socio-economic burden. From the age of 40, a systematic loss of muscle mass and muscle force,
      also known as sarcopenia, will occur. In addition, performing daily tasks requires the
      production of muscle force at a certain speed. The product of force and speed, power,
      decreases even earlier and faster than muscle force.

      This power is typically measured with specialized equipment, which limits the large-scale
      applicability. With the help of accelerometry there is the possibility to measure power
      during more functional tasks and movements, which benefits the applicability, but the
      reliability, reference values and link with other outcome measurements related to sarcopenia
      has to be investigated.
