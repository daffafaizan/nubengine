      anesthesia system using bispectral index as control variable and two
      proportional-differential control algorithms, a propofol and a remifentanil target-controlled
      infusion system. The effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia system has been
      demonstrated in a prospective, randomized study.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups : intubation using a conventional MacIntosh
      laryngoscope or intubation using a videolaryngoscope.

      If our hypothesis is confirmed, the required concentration of remifentanil, an opioid agent,
      will be reduced in the group using a videolaryngoscope.
