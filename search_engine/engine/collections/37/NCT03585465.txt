             -  Arm A: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine

             -  Arm B: Nivolumab + Capecitabin

             -  Arm C: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine + Capecitabin Arm A and Arm B will
                be initially allocated sequentially (A/B/A/B/A/B). Arm C will be opened, if arm A
                and Arm B are deemed safe. In each arm, the second patient will not be recruited
                before the first patient has been observed for a 28-day duration.

        2. Second stage will start after a meeting of IDMC Randomization will be balanced 1:1,
           controlling for histological type (HGG-Midline diffuse glioma / Lymphoma / Other) and
           treating center, using a dynamic allocation of treatment (minimization program) with a
           random factor set at 0.8.
