      (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (> 30.0 kg/m2) and likely to exhibit one or more conditions
      associated with MetS. Participants were >18 years of age, not pregnant, not diabetic, with no
      unresolved infections or diseases (diabetes, CVD, IBD, cancer and liver disease), and
      nonsmokers. Histories of medication and dietary supplement use were collected and those
      taking anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering medications were excluded. After enrollment,
      subjects were randomly assigned to consume daily either 240 mL (8 ounces) of authentic TCJ
      (R.W. Knudsen, Chico, CA) or a placebo beverage (commercial fruit punch; Great Value,
      Bentonville, AR) for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, participants consumed the
      alternate beverage for 4 weeks in this 10-week 2x2 crossover, placebo-controlled dietary
      intervention. Subsequently, the investigators determined the effect of TCJ in at-risk
      participants on markers of lipidemia (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, VLDL, total cholesterol),
      glycemia (fasting insulin and glucose, HOMA, QUICKI, McAuley indirect indices), and
      inflammation (hsCRP, TNF-alpha, and ESR).
