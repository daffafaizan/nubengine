      in patients with stage IV, relapsed, or progressive low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients, including those
      with marrow involvement. III. Determine the rates of complete remission (CR) and partial
      remission and time to failure in previously treated and untreated patients. IV. Determine the
      effectiveness of this regimen in eradicating bcl-2 rearrangements, as determined by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in previously untreated patients. V. Correlate the duration
      of CR to PCR results in responding patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no). Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning
      on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or stable disease. Patients who achieve
      complete remission (CR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional courses. Patients
      who achieve partial remission (PR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional courses,
      and those who achieve CR after completion of course 6 receive 2 additional courses. Patients
      are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.
