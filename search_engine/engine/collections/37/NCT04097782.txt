    
      Background: Caesarean delivery rates are quite high, especially in primipara, in Turkey. Fear
      of birth, low childbirth self-efficacy, and psychological factors may be among the primary
      causes. Since antenatal educations are not universal and there are differences in educational
      contents, there is not sufficient evidence on this topic in international studies.

      Objective: To investigate the effects of antenatal education on birth fear, depression,
      anxiety, stress, childbirth self-efficacy, and mode of delivery in primiparous pregnant
      women.

      Design: A single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting and Participants:
      The study was conducted in a province in Central Anatolia region in Turkey, and the data were
      collected between April 2019 and September 2019. Randomized block assignment was used to
      assign 120 primiparous pregnant women to either the antenatal education group (n = 60) or the
      control group (n = 60). At the end of the study, 112 women were evaluated.

      Measurements: Those in the antenatal education group received two-hour (240 min) educational
      sessions, twice a week, for 4 weeks. Data were collected by demographic and labor outcomes
      information form, The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (Version A and B),
      Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale.
