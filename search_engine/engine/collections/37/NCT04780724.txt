      biological signals and they are used for home monitoring of health conditions. The newest
      models of smartwatches even measure peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The study aims
      to compare the measurement of peripheral blood oxygen saturation using the latest smartwatch
      with a medical-grade pulse oximeter under the condition of normobaric hypoxia. Healthy
      participants will breathe oxygen-reduced mixtures (the hypoxic gas mixture of 12% O2 and 88%
      N2 and the hypercapnic and hypoxic gas mixture of 12% O2, 5% CO2, and 83% N2), which will
      temporarily reduce their blood oxygen saturation. SpO2 measurements will be taken by hand
      from the watch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously. The agreement of the measurements of
      both devices will be evaluated.
