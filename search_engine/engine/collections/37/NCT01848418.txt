      Health (ICF). ICF defines disability as "the negative aspects of the interaction between an
      individual (with a health condition) and that individual's contextual factors (personal and
      environmental factors)". Interactions are specified in five domains, classified from body,
      individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and
      structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Since an individual's
      functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental
      factors.

      ICF core sets, which are short lists of ICF categories relevant for specific conditions,
      serve as practical tools for clinical practice and allow standardisation of data for health
      information and research. Core sets have already been developed and validated for several
      musculoskeletal diseases, such as low back pain, osteoarthritis, or osteoporosis, but not yet
      for systemic sclerosis.
