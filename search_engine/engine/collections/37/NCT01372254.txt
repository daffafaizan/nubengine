      utilize pilot testing with 10 participants (two groups of 5 individuals) to integrate two
      existing behavioral activation manuals to develop the Behavioral Activation for Drug Abusing
      Smokers (BA-DAS). In Phase II, the investigators will randomize 80 patients to either: 1)
      standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or 2) BA-DAS
      (which includes ST and NRT). Based on the outcome of this preliminary trial, the BA-DAS
      protocol will be further refined and readied for larger-scale clinical trials to develop a
      comprehensive approach to treating smoking among low income, largely minority, depressed
      smokers in residential drug use treatment, which may be instrumental in reducing smoking
      among this especially at risk group.
