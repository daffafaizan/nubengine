    
      This is a pilot project to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) score in patients with chronic disease,
      as an adjunct to lifestyle medical therapy.

      The PAI score is a proprietary formula developed by PAI Health (PH) to aid physical fitness.
      A PAI score calculation uses biometrics obtained via a device that measures heart rate and
      steps. For this study, Mio Slice, a commercial wrist worn device will be utilized to obtain
      data which will be linked to a smart phone. Data from the smart phone app will be accessed by
      PAI Health. Feedback information will be given to the participants to encourage increased
      physical activity.

      The short-term aim of this study is to evaluate the logistics of utilizing PAI in the patient
      setting.

      The data obtained from this study will be utilized to devise a larger study to evaluate the
      utility of PAI in patients with chronic disease who are receiving lifestyle medical therapy.
