    
      Context: Navigating the risk-benefit profiles of the various biologic options approved for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be challenging for patients who are considering biologic
      therapies as a treatment option. Thus, there is a need for simple and efficient tools that
      elicit individual preferences and support the patient-provider interaction.

      Objective: The principal objective of this study is to assess the impact of an online
      decision aid called IBD&me on patient perceptions of shared-decision making as compared to a
      standardized education arm.

      Hypothesis: IBD&me, through optimizing shared-decision making (SDM) and improving the
      patient-provider interaction, will provide incremental benefits beyond those provided by
      high-quality educational material without an SDM tool.

      Design: Pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial in IBD outpatient care

        1. Intervention: IBD&me is an online, freely available tool that allows patients to explore
           decision-making around biologic therapies for IBD at their own pace

        2. Control arm: Standardized, high-quality educational material from the Crohn's & Colitis
           Foundation
