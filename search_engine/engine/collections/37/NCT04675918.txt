      Setting: patients will be enrolled by participating investigators from European and
      Latinamerican countries. All sites are susceptible of treating pediatric cardiac arrest
      patients. Participating hospitals differ in levels of care but are all able to submit their
      data to the study's database.

      Patient elegibility: Inclusion criteria: all children aged 1 month to 18 years who suffer a
      CA in hospital. For the study, CA is defined as the absence of vital signs requiring at least
      one minute of chest compressions. Subsequent episodes of CA may be included for the same
      individual.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients being treated with extracorporeal circulatory support (ECMO or
      ventricular assistance) at the time of CA. Patients who suffer a cardiac arrest and require
      ECMO for ROSC, after performing conventional CPR, will not be excluded. Duration of the data
      collection period 24 months.

      Recruitment: Study candidates will be identified by a study physician, who will explain the
      study to parents or guardians. Written informed consent will be obtained from parents or
      guardians prior to inclusion in the study. A CONSORT (Consolidated Standard of Reporting
      Trials) flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.

      Data collection: data will be collected, verified, and uploaded to a protected electronic
      web-based database (Xolomon) by their designated site coordinators/investigators under the
      oversight of their IRB. Database has been designed following the Utstein model (19). Database
      is hosted according to European legislation regarding patient data protection. It is drafted
      in English and Spanish.
