      applied in COPD does not stop the decrease in lung function, nor does it prolong the survival
      time. Spirometric evaluations to determine the severity of the disease are not sufficient to
      explain the perception of patients and their adaptation to their diseases. Therefore,
      evaluating the quality of life has become an important measure of treatment in COPD patients.
      Quality of life measurements should be done to minimize the effect of the disease, to help
      patients better cope with the consequences of an incurable long-term condition, and to
      determine modifiable factors. Identifying modifiable factors; in personalized treatment
      adopted in airway diseases in recent years; it is important to be able to apply appropriate
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments Our aim is to exercise capacity in COPD
      patients; firstly to investigate the effect on quality of life, then to determine the
      relationship between emergency admission and hospitalization, dyspnea, psychological
      symptoms.
