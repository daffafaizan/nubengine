      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Healthy, adult volunteers without identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV-1 infection are
      vaccinated. In phase 1, at each participating unit, four volunteers receive a dose of gp160
      (12.5 mcg); two volunteers receive placebo. Volunteers are monitored 1 month before
      proceeding to the second phase. In phase 2, four volunteers receive gp160 (50 mcg); two
      volunteers receive placebo. Primary immunization and two booster immunizations at day 30 and
      day 180 are done in an outpatient setting. Volunteers are closely monitored for the first 2
      weeks postimmunization (primary and boosters), and extensively followed for a minimum of 2
      years. Volunteers may be offered an additional boost of the same preparation at 18 months.
      Per 07/28/92 amendment, 18 volunteers will receive 200 mcg gp160 in an unblinded study.
      Volunteers in phase 2 who received four doses of 50 mcg gp160 receive an additional boost of
      200 mcg gp160 at 18-19 months post initial vaccination. Per 05/13/94 amendment, volunteers in
      phase 2 who received the additional 200 mcg boost receive another 200 mcg boost 18-24 months
      after the last injection (St. Louis University site only).
