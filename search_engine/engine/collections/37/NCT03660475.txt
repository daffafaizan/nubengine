    
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      compare the safety and efficacy of Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% to placebo for the
      treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects. Subjects eligible to be
      randomized will receive one of the following treatments to be administered bilaterally BID
      for 29 days (from Visit 2 to Visit 5): Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002% or Placebo
      Ophthalmic Solution (Vehicle). During a 10-day study run-in period (for the purpose of
      subject selection) prior to randomization, all subjects will receive Placebo Ophthalmic
      Solution (Vehicle) bilaterally BID. Participants who terminate early during the application
      period will be asked to complete safety assessments (if the participants agree) prior to
      study exit. Participants who are terminated early from the study will not be replaced.
