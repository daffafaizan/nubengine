    
      SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a novel coronavirus reported in
      late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread world-wide with over 1,000,000 coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported. New developments in molecular virology and
      immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, improve our understanding about COVID-19 prevention, management,
      and possible long-term effects. Although viral transmission occurs predominantly through
      respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in blood samples and feces from COVID-19
      patients, raising questions about viral shedding in other bodily fluids, including semen, as
      well as alternative modes of transmission.

      The objectives are to describe detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of COVID-19 positive
      patients, the duration of positive semen and to investigate the impact on semen quality,
      thereby providing insights into the early impact on male reproductive function.
