      by somatic symptoms. These conditions impair students' social, psychological, and academic
      functioning and outcomes. Although students are utilizing campus and community mental health
      centers at increasing rates, these resources are strained. The present study aims to test the
      efficacy of two brief treatment options for students.

      Integrating techniques from several emotion-focused therapies, the investigators have
      developed and tested an intervention encouraging the awareness and expression of habitually
      suppressed or avoided emotions. This Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) has
      been evaluated with various patient populations including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, and medically unexplained symptoms. Results of these trials
      suggest that the intervention is efficacious in improving physical and psychological
      well-being, and is equal to or superior to other psychological interventions for somatic
      conditions. The present study seeks to advance the EAET literature by evaluating the efficacy
      of the intervention for a broader population and by employing a strong and conceptually
      different comparison condition: mindfulness meditation training.
