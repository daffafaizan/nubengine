      placebo-controlled pilot study to determine whether FPP improves cerebral energy metabolism,
      neuroinflammation, systemic inflammation, cognitive function, fatigue, and health-related
      quality of life in older adults.

      Potential participants will participate in a brief 10 minute phone screening that will
      describe the study. If participants meet initial inclusion/exclusion criteria on the phone
      screen, they will be scheduled for an in-person screening visit. Participants will attend
      five (5) in person visits including one Screening Visit performed individually for each
      potential study participant, and four Assessment Visits (V1-V4). Participants will be asked
      to provide a fasting blood sample that will be utilized to evaluate clinical laboratory
      parameters at the Screening visit and all four assessment visits. The participants will
      complete both a treatment and a placebo condition; therefore, a cross-over design will be
      used. After eight (8) weeks on each of these regimens, participants will be asked to complete
      post-treatment outcome assessments at the University of Florida's Institute on Aging -
      Clinical and Translational Research Building (IOA - CTRB). Following the first post-treatment
      test day (V2), participants will complete a six (6) week washout period and will then return
      to the IOA - CTRB to complete the other study arm. The order the participants receive FPP and
      placebo will be determined through randomization
