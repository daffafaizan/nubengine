      impairments, and the development of dementia. Some, but not all basic data suggest that
      alcohol abuse can alter the expression of amyloid precursor protein, and the enzymes that
      process it. Thus, there is a need for in vivo PET studies to further investigate the
      relationship between AUD and AD and the mechanism through which alcohol abuse exerts its
      effect on this type of dementia. Here, we propose to use the amyloid Beta (ABeta) radiotracer
      carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B ([C-11]PiB) and PET (Klunk et al., 2004) to determine
      whether AUD increase the risk to be brain ABeta+ in middle aged adults.
