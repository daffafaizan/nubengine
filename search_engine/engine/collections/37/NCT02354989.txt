    
      Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
      treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacing will be enrolled.
      Two 6' walking test (6WT), one during VVI 70/min biventricular pacing (RR off) and the other
      during VVIR 70-120/min biventricular pacing (RR on), will be performed one week apart;
      patients will be randomly and blindly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to group A (first 6WT RR off)
      or B (first 6WT RR on). The difference between the two tests will be recorded.
