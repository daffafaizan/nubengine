      multiple volumetric datasets of the abdominal aorta over the time period of the cardiac
      cycle, allowing for direct and regional calculations of abdominal aortic distensibility over
      the entire volume of the abdominal aorta, providing insight into risk of abdominal aortic
      aneurysm rupture and early large vessel stiffness.
