      non-invasive body and face contouring, which can heats subcutaneous fat up to 45â„ƒ
      continuously without surface damage and induces adipocytes apoptosis.

      Subjects with an excessive subcutaneous fat on the submental area received twice treatments
      at 1-month intervals. Clinical outcomes including the thickness of the submental fat
      (measured by ultrasound) and the submental circumference (measured by a tape measure), and
      clinical photographs were obtained at baseline, and 1-month and 6-month after last treatment.
