      of less than one year is expected in inoperable tumours. Management of these patients would
      be towards palliation of symptoms. Severe pain occurs in 50 to 70% of the patients and this
      "intractable" pain is often difficult to treat. Pain management is a major part of the
      comprehensive therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and it also affects their quality
      of life. Different pharmacological agents have been used in the past to control this pain and
      these include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotic agents. However, these
      agents are associated with their own adverse effects and may further impair quality of life.
      Radiotherapy and celiac plexus neurolysis also can relieve the cancer pain, patients'
      responses are often variable and difficult to predict.

      Recently, more and more studies were focused on the acupuncture for cancer pain.
      Electroacupuncture (EA) analgesia seems to be a promising way to control the cancer pain and
      reduce the dose and side effects of analgesics. The latest review in 2012 showed that
      acupuncture might be an effective analgesic adjunctive method for cancer pain after
      concluding the results of 15 randomized-control trials. Nevertheless, studies focused on
      patients with pancreatic cancer and results from randomized trials are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of EA analgesia for patients
      with inoperable pancreatic cancer.
