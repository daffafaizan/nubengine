      more effective in preventing gingival recession in adults receiving periodontal maintenance
      than a soft tooth brush with nylon bristles.

      Materials and methods: The investigators will recruit 23 subjects with gingival recession who
      received regular periodontal maintenance care at Western University of Health Sciences Dental
      Center, and who did not exhibit signs of acute dental and systemic disease, occlusal
      discrepancies and parafunctional habits. The investigators will randomly assign these
      subjects to two groups, one using a soft nylon-bristled tooth brush, and the other group
      using the experimental tooth brush that contains a brush head with short, soft, rubbery
      cones. Both groups will receive regular maintenance and periodontal exams by blinded
      examiners every 3-4 months measuring probing depth, bleeding on probing, plaque indices, and
      gingival recession. In addition, gingival recession will also be determined using a measuring
      guide on study models obtained with polyvinylsiloxane impressions. For added control of
      confounding variables, both groups will be supplied with abrasivity tooth paste and waxed
      floss while receiving repeated oral hygiene instruction and phone follow-up.
