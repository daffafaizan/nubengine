      versus carbohydrate on promotion of excessive calorie intake. Advocates of low-carbohydrate
      diets propose that diets high in carbohydrates lead to elevated insulin secretion and
      increased calorie intake. Alternatively, proponents of low-fat diets argue that diets high in
      fat promote passive overconsumption due to the high energy density and low satiety index of
      high-fat foods. Therefore, we will conduct a feeding study in 20 adult men and women to
      investigate the differences in ad libitum energy intake resulting from consuming two test
      diets for a pair of 2-week periods in a randomized, crossover design during a single 4-week
      inpatient period. The test diets presented to participants will be matched for calories and
      protein, but the low-carbohydrate diet (approximately10% of calories) will be high in fat
      (approximately75% of calories) whereas the low-fat diet will be high in carbohydrates
      (approximately75% of calories) and low in fat (approximately 10% of calories).
