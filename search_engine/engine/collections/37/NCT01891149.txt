      evaluation at the Fistula Care Centre in Lilongwe, Malawi. If a woman enrolls in the study,
      her demographic, medical history, physical exam, and lab data will be abstracted from her
      medical records at the Fistula Centre. She will also a pelvic ultrasound on each participant
      so that the characteristics of her cervix, uterus, and ovaries (such as the cervical length,
      endometrial thickness and ovarian volume) can be evaluated. If the participant has an
      obstetric fistula, she will also complete an additional blood draw for lab testing. The
      laboratory tests will evaluate three hormones that are associated with amenorrhea and
      infertility: follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, and antimullerian hormone.
