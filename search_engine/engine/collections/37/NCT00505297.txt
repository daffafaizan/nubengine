        -  Evaluate OA progression by evaluating cartilage morphology, cartilage glycosaminoglycan
           (GAG) content, and joint space changes measured by MRI (3.0T), dGEMRIC index, and
           radiography, respectively using age-matched control subjects to identify disease related
           changes.

        -  Identify subject characteristics associated with more rapidly progressing OA.

        -  Identify most sensitive efficacy endpoints for future DMOAD proof of concept (POC)
           studies.

        -  Establish time interval for future studies based on MRI endpoints.

        -  Evaluate the effect of contrast agent on MRI cartilage morphology and T2 measurements

        -  Define criteria for classifying cartilage legions/deficits using dGEMRIC and T2
           measurements.

        -  Collect biofluid samples for future validation of disease specific biomarkers.
