      good clinical outcomes. However, they have certain disadvantages. The benefits of synthetic
      materials are the avoidance of donor-site morbidity and scars, but also shorter
      hospitalization time, lower expenses and known composition. Custom-made skull bone implant
      can produced based on patients clinical need utilizing rapid prototyping technologies. This
      will result in very high accuracy of the form of the skull defect.

      Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is one of the most widely used alloplastic material in surgery.
      Bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) particles have been used in various clinical indications. BAG was
      added to composite implant of PMMA with glass fibre reinforcement to enhance bone ingrowth to
      implant, and to utilize BAG's antimicrobial effects. Ten patients cranial defects are treated
      with composite implants.
