      anoxic encephalopathy is the bedside behavioural evaluation. Nevertheless, the predictive
      value of such an exclusive clinical approach has been consistently reported as limited and
      insufficient in this challenging clinical setting. Recent theoretical and experimental data
      converge towards the idea of the critical implication of long-range brain connection in
      consciousness access and maintain. Nevertheless, previous studies have focused on the
      specific analysis of some targeted connections (regions of interest), and have used
      exclusively a single approach in neuroimaging (structural or functional imaging), with no
      interest in the neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms likely associated with
      these disconnection phenomena. So, cerebral disconnection characterization at the level of
      the whole brain, at different stages of pathological abolition of consciousness must be made,
      on an anatomical, functional and metabolic scale. This descriptive study represents a first
      step in the identification of relevant multimodal imaging biomarkers. This will then lead to
      a larger study to identify the prognostic impact of these different biomarkers obtained in
      the acute phase of patient management.
