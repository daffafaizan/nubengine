      TBI. There is emerging research indicating that, in addition to cognitive and behavioral
      impairments, social and emotional difficulties following TBI are common and are related to
      significant problems in social relationships, poor social participation, impaired empathy,
      and a high degree of caregiver stress. Emotional processing is a critical component of social
      cognition, including the abilities to both identify and discriminate basic universal
      emotions. The stability of emotional processing deficits following TBI indicates that these
      impairments likely impact individuals with TBI consistently across the lifespan, and do not
      appear to resolve with time.

      The goals of the trial are to (a) Evaluate the effectiveness of an emotional processing
      intervention to improve performance on tests of emotional processing in individuals with TBI,
      (b) Evaluate the improvement of secondary outcomes of psychological, cognitive, and
      functional abilities following the emotional processing intervention in individuals with TBI,
      (c) To examine differences in brain activation patterns during emotional processing following
      treatment in individuals with TBI, BOLD activation in the experimental group will be compared
      to BOLD patterns of the control group during performance of the QFDT, a facial affect
      recognition task.
