      Participants will include those with self-described history of Diabetic Foot Ulcer and
      age-matched healthy volunteers. Participants will wear the exo-skeletons and will be asked to
      walk 32 feet, and to stand quietly for 30 seconds.

      Measurements will be taken to evaluate how the exoskeletons affect how people walk, and will
      also evaluate the pressure on the bottom of their feet. These measurements will be repeated
      multiple times to evaluate four different exo-tendon spring rates, and two sets of control
      shoes.

      Exo-skeletons have been shown to reduce the pressure on the bottoms of people's feet and to
      reduce the effort to walk. This study is necessary to understand the contribution of
      different levels of exo-skeleton spring force to these effects.
