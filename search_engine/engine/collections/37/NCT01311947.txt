      million people worldwide are chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Currently, two therapeutic
      methods can be used to treat CHB. One is the nucleos(t)ide analogues, the other is the
      interferon alfa. Interferon alfa acts mainly by enhancing the immune system and directly
      inhibits the virus to a limited extent. It is known that mutations at preS, S, basal core
      promoter, precore and core gene are associated with an increased risk of HCC. However, it
      remains to be clarified as to the relation between HBV mutations and the therapeutic
      responses to interferon treatment. In order to clarify the association between HBV mutations
      appearing before and during interferon therapy and the therapeutic effects, serial serum
      samples from 100 HBeAg-positive CHB patients undergoing peginterferon alfa-2a therapy will be
      collected and analyzed for the mutations of preS/S gene and BCP-preC/C region, particularly
      for the deletion mutations. Furthermore, Real-Time PCR will be performed to measure the
      ratios of wild-type HBV and deletion mutant HBV before and at the end of peginterferon
      alfa-2a therapy. Finally, statistical analysis will be done to elucidate whether the
      mutations of preS/S gene and BCP-preC/C region have any relation with the therapeutic effect
      of peginterferon alfa-2a.
