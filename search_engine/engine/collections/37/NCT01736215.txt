      multi-center (study conducted in more than 1 center) study to identify the predictive factors
      that will effectively predict the response to erythropoietin treatment in cancer related
      anemia participants receiving chemotherapy. The entire duration of study will be
      approximately 1 year. Participants will primarily be evaluated for achieving at least 1 gram
      per deciliter (g per dl) rise in hemoglobin (substance that carries oxygen and gives blood
      its red color) level after receiving erythropoietin treatment based on National Comprehensive
      Cancer Institute (NCCN) V3.2009 practice guideline criteria. Response to erythropoietin
      treatment will also be predicted using other independent hematological (related to blood)
      factors like C-reactive protein (CRP - is an acute serum protein released from liver). It is
      associated with low hemoglobin [substance that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color]
      or erythropoietin [hormone secreted by kidney that helps in formation of red blood cells in
      bone marrow] resistance), erythropoietin (EPO), hemoglobin, hematocrit (amount of red blood
      cells in blood), reticulocyte (immature red blood cells) count, ferritin (a protein that
      stores iron and allows the body to use iron), serum iron (iron is in the blood which is bound
      to transferrin) and transferring iron binding capacity (TIBC), level. Number of blood
      transfusions and participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
