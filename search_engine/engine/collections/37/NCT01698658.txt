      I. Determine the in-vivo imaging potential of SoftVue through 3-dimensional (3-D) breast
      imaging.

      II. Acquire data for SoftVue evaluation from a cohort of 100 women receiving standard
      ultrasound (US) evaluation as follow-up to mammographic or palpable abnormalities and
      construct reflection, sound speed and attenuation images with SoftVue.

      III. Evaluate the ability of SoftVue to detect dominant breast findings (i.e. major normal
      landmark architecture) or masses previously identified with standard diagnostic evaluation
      (palpation, mammography, standard US) using standard clock position and radial distance
      measurements from the nipple.

      IV. Conduct tomographic (i.e. slice-by-slice) comparison of SoftVue with magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) findings from a subgroup of 50 patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound tomography using SoftVue. Some patients also undergo MRI of the
      breast.
