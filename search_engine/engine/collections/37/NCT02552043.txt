    
      This is a randomized and longitudinal trial. Participants will be randomize in 2 groups:
      control group (CG) and experimental group (EG), by the Â©GrapfPad Software, Inc. The CG will
      carry out their routine patient management, and the EG will perform also a domiciliary
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation program of 30-60 min exercise, 5 days/week during 6 weeks using a
      Nintendo WiiTM platform with the game EA SPORTS ACTIVE 2.

      Before and after we will measure:

        1. exercise tolerance using the six minutes walk test (6MWT) and the modified shuttle walk
           test (MSWT);

        2. muscular strength using horizontal jump test (HJT), medicine ball throw (MBT) and
           handgrip strength (right hand (HGR); left hand (HGL)); and

        3. HRQoL using the 3 versions of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R 6-11,
           CFQ-R 14+, CFQ-R Parents).
