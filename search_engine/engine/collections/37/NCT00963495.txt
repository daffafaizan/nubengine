      Patients will receive 800mg/day of Clioquinol at the start of the trial and the dose will be
      increased by 800mg with each subsequent level until the MTD is determined. Patients will then
      increase their frequency of the drug. Response to Clioquinol will be determined on day 21 for
      the 8 and 15 day dosing schedule and on day 28 for the 22 day dosing schedule ( 1 cycle).
      Patients who have demonstrated a response to the drug will be eligible to receive up to 5
      additional cycles at the same dose and frequency every 21 days.
