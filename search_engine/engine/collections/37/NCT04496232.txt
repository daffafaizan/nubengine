      implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. And a positive correlation with the
      miscarriage rate. Abnormal sperm DNA fragmentation can be improved through the second
      ejaculate strategy, by limiting the time of sperm presence in the epididymis. PICSI is a
      robust sperm selection technique that can select individual mature intact sperm DNA. In our
      study, we will compare PICSI as a valid sperm selection technique to second ejaculate, as a
      natural cost-free strategy to manage abnormal SDF. In addition to a normal SDF arm as a
      control.
