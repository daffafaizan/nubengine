      mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Monitoring is based on clinical and laboratory
      parameters reflecting hemodynamic stability, electrolyte status and plasma renin
      concentration. Reduced subjective well-being is however often described by these patients in
      absence of clinical or laboratory abnormalities and is thus a strong indicator of the gap
      between the concept of adequate hormone substitution and patients' requirements. This study
      investigates the sodium content in the calf muscle and the skin obtained via 23Na-magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency compared to age-, sex-
      and BMI- matched healthy controls. The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential role of
      23Na-MRI for monitoring of hormone replacement by investigating tissue sodium concentrations
      in patients with adrenal insufficiency.
