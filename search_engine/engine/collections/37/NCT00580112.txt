      following participants forward in time), multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical
      school team work on a medical research study) study evaluating the effectiveness and safety
      of trabectedin in 3 subpopulations of breast cancer participants: Group A: triple negative
      profile for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human estrogen receptor, Group B:
      human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing tumors (HER-2+) and Group C: familial
      breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) mutation carrier. Participants
      will receive trabectedin 1.3 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenous infusion (a
      fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over 3-hour every 3 weeks, on
      Day 1 of each cycle. Each cycle length will be 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until
      disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, participant refusal or treatment delay no longer
      than 3 weeks due to toxicity. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of
      participants with confirmed objective response by independent external review and
      Investigators assessment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
