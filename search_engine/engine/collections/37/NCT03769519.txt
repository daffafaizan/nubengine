      and acceptability using a quasi-experimental pre-post study design. The study will enroll
      between 32 and 48 adult African Americans with persistent asthma and suboptimal ICS
      adherence, and their health care providers, to study the use of the intervention and key
      indicators of the intervention's potential effectiveness.
