      replacement only, can cause a partial remission of DMII patients with obesity between the age
      of 18 and 65 diagnosed with DMII within the last 6 years. The goal is to inform the current
      diabetes routine care by standardizing a rural protocol on the effectiveness of
      rural-specific OPTIFAST intervention for people with DMII who want to attain partial
      remission of DMII.
