      function in patients with diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. The study is a double
      blind, placebo controlled, crossover study with the order of treatment randomized. Patients
      will receive each treatment for 8 weeks with a 1 week rest period between treatment periods.
      Endothelial function will be tested using non-invasive techniques before and after each
      treatments. A total of 40 subjects with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome will be enrolled
      at Boston Medical Center.
