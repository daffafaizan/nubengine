    
      Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD) is a recent diagnosis that covers joint hypermobility
      with one or more secondary symptomatic musculoskeletal manifestations. Current clinical
      management of this population with shoulder symptoms is a non-standardized combination of
      physiotherapy modalities including exercise prescription. There is evidence suggesting that
      progressive heavy resistance training increases muscle strength and tendon stiffness, which
      may be valuable for treatment of this population.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of progressive heavy shoulder resistance
      training (PHSRT) for adults with HSD and shoulder symptoms before safely performing a
      definitive RCT-study in a large cohort. The objectives are to address whether PHSRT is
      feasible regarding i) patient recruitment and retention, ii) adherence to exercise protocol
      and its progression levels, iii) completion of objective outcome measures, and iv)
      registering potential flare up in shoulder symptoms.

      Study progression criteria are based on a traffic light system of green (go), amber (amend)
      and red (stop). Results of these progression criteria will be evaluated by the investigator
      group, who will recommend amendments that need to be made before proceeding with the
      definitive RCT.
