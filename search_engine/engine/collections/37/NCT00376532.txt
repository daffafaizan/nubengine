      States. While it is well known that patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic
      cardiomyopathy (ICM, NICM) are at increased risk for SCD, there is little beyond ejection
      fraction which has proven useful as a noninvasive predictor to risk stratify these patients.

      Myocardial scar has been validated as an arrhythmic substrate in ischemic populations; the
      majority of successful ablations for lethal ventricular arrhythmias are performed on tissues
      in peri-infarct regions. Scar provides an anatomic electrical boundary where peri-infarct
      zones may lead to areas of slow conduction due to the disruption of inter-myocyte electrical
      conduction.

      Myocardial scar is a less organized collagen deposition which disrupts the typical cardiac
      extracellular matrix. The collagen matrix provides mechanical support to the myocardium
      dictating ventricular shape, size and stiffness. While typically relatively dormant, the
      fibrillar collagen matrix reflects a dynamic relationship between collagen synthesis mediated
      by fibroblasts and collagen degradation performed by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).

      A marker for scar burden or a marker which could assess a patient's predilection to form scar
      after either an ischemic or non-ischemic insult may be useful in further risk stratifying
      this population. Since MMP levels may fluctuate in the course of ischemic or nonischemic
      injury a static promoter sequence which confers a higher level of MMP expression to an
      ischemic or nonischemic insult may prove to be a reliable marker. Functional polymorphisms of
      the MMP-9 gene promoters have been shown in multivariate analysis to be an independent
      predictor of cardiac mortality regardless of the mechanism of heart failure.
