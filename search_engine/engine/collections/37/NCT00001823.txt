    
      Background:

      Potential research candidates undergo thorough screening including laboratory tests, scans,
      x-rays, and review of pathology slides to determine initial eligibility for National Cancer
      Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) research protocols.

      Objectives:

      Permit evaluation of patients referred to the NCI-SB in order to identify individuals who
      will be suitable candidates for NCI-SB clinical research protocols.

      To assess frequency of HLA type, gene specific mutations or expression of neo antigens in
      malignant tumors across the population of cancer patients undergoing screening for NCI-SB
      protocols.

      Collect results of screening tests for use on subsequent research protocol as baseline (e.g.,
      pretreatment) values.

      Eligibility:

      Age >= 18 years and <= 70 years.

      Patient suspected of having, or with biopsy proven, malignant disease.

      Patient is able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

      Patient is being evaluated for treatment on an NCI-SB protocols..

      Design:

      Patients enrolled on this protocol will be evaluated by NCI-SB physicians to determine the
      individual's suitability for participation in a clinical research protocol. An accrual
      ceiling of 6000 patients has been set to meet the screening needs of the NCI-SB.
