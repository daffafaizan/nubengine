      high-flavanol supplement from cocoa can improve endothelial function, measured by increased
      blood flow from peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), reduce platelet reactivity, and increase
      circulating levels of flavonoids in the blood. The investigators seek with this proposal to
      determine if a similar response can be noted with a different high-flavanol supplement in
      normal, healthy people.
