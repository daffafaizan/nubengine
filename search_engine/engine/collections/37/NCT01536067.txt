      I. Determine overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + minor
      response [MR]) of ofatumumab in combination with bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine complete remission (CR) rate, near (n)CR rate, very good partial response (VGPR)
      rate and PR rate per new criteria.

      II. Determine 5 year progression free survival (PFS). III. Determine time to progression and
      duration of response of ofatumumab in conjunction with bortezomib.

      IV. Determine safety of ofatumumab in combination with bortezomib. V. Conduct laboratory
      correlates.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 8 and 15. Beginning on course 2, patients receive
      ofatumumab IV on days 1 and 15 and bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Beginning 8 weeks after course 4 of induction phase, patients receive
      ofatumumab IV on day 1 and bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
