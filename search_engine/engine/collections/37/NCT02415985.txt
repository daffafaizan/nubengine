      the combined treatment of tuberculosis and HIV infection. Rifabutin represents an alternative
      to rifampicin for HIV infected patients as its half-life is longer and the enzymatic
      induction effect appears to be less important on the associated ART drugs. This phase II
      trial is to determine precisely the pharmacokinetics parameters of rifabutin in combination
      with LPV/r regimens in Thai HIV/TB infected patients, in order to define optimal doses that
      will be further tested in a larger phase III trial comparing safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of rifabutin and rifampicin regimens.
