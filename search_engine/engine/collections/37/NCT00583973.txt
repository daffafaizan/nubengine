      Patients who have been prescribed iron repletion therapy (100 mg IV every dialysis treatment
      for ten treatments) by their primary nephrologist will be recruited for the study. Baseline
      blood samples will be obtained before and after each dialysis treatment for two dialysis
      treatments prior to the administration of iron. On the day of dialysis that iron therapy is
      started, blood samples will be obtained before and after the dialysis treatment via the
      patient's vascular access. This procedure will be repeated each dialysis treatment for the
      ten sessions during which the patient is receiving intravenous iron. Subsequently,
      pre-dialysis blood samples will be obtained every week for four weeks after the
      administration of intravenous iron has been completed
