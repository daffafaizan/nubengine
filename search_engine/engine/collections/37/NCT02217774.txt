    
      Patients, attending the Department of Periodontology at the Rambam School of Graduate
      Dentistry, who are scheduled for implant therapy, will be screened for the study. Patients
      will be referred for CBCT of the upper/lower jaw as appropriate. DICOM data of the patient
      will be uploaded to MGUIDE software and used for diagnosis and treatment planning of the
      case. Surgery will be performed using MGUIDE MORE template and MGUIDE MORE surgical kit.
      Pre-operative and post-operative CBCT will be used for assessment of the difference between
      planned and actual implant positions.
