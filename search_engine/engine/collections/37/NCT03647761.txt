      Previous studies have shown that by applying neoprene or athletic tape to a joint on
      individuals with poor proprioception or a history of joint injury, such modalities enhanced
      their proprioceptive recognition via stimulation of mechanoreceptors responding to skin
      stretch and compression during joint motion. As a result, patients have greater kinesthetic
      and joint position awareness of their limb.
