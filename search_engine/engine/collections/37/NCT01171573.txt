      effective treatment therapies, it will be necessary to collect blood samples and clinical
      details from around 1000 patients with myositis. As the condition is very rare, it will not
      be possible to get the required number of patients from one centre alone, and therefore, a
      collaborative, multicentred approach will be needed. Consultant rheumatologists and
      neurologists throughout the UK, who have patients with PM, DM or IBM, will be approached, and
      asked if they would like to officially enter into the myositis genomic multicentred study.
      Once ethical and R&D approval has been granted, consultants will be named as the 'Principal
      Investigators' at each of these 'research sites' and could then start to recruit suitable
      patients into the study.

      Patients from each research site, with definite PM, DM or IBM, will be asked by their own
      consultants (Principal Investigator) to give 20 mls of blood via venepuncture for genetic and
      antibody analysis. The PI will also complete a clinical/laboratory proforma, for each
      patient, regarding their disease characteristics, to allow subsequent confirmation that
      patients' disease is indeed definite, and this proforma and the blood sample will be sent to
      CIGMR. All of the genetic analyses, will take place at CIGMR, but storage of clinical details
      and certain patient identifiers will be stored at SRFT on a password protected NHS tust
      computer.

      This study will be co-ordinated by Dr RG Cooper through the Rheumatic Diseases Centre,
      Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT), and Professor Bill Ollier from the Centre for
      Integrated Genomic Medical Research unit (CIGMR), Stopford Building, Manchester University.
