    
      50 scleroderma patients without evidence of lung disease who have been seen by an NJH
      Rheumatologist will be invited to participate. They will have their medical records reviewed
      to determine eligibility and then perform hand held spirometry and LCI testing. This measures
      evidence of small airway airflow obstruction and requires normal breathing while first on
      room air followed by inhaling a gas mixture of 100% oxygen. The Oxygen concentration in
      exhaled breathing and the number of breaths needed to return to room air concentration of
      Oxygen will be analyzed by a computer. Medical information from the EMR will be recorded and
      placed in a secure database, REDCap, for statistical analysis to determine if LCI results or
      other clinical features are predictive of which Scleroderma patients are most likely to
      subsequently develop evidence of Interstitial Lung disease (ILD) based upon yearly phone call
      interviews and EMR record reviews within 5 years of baseline testing.
