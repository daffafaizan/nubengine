      the ADAPT platform (iCBT). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the ADAPT
      platform (treatment) or a similar self-guided platform (control) that contains the didactic
      material (learning) but lacks the ADAPT platforms "crowd" features. Participants will use
      their assigned platform for a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants will receive trial
      assessments at baseline, week 4, and week 8 (post-treatment). Follow-up evaluations will
      occur at 16 weeks to evaluate maintenance of gains. This pilot effectiveness trial aims to
      determine the impact on symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether the platform engages
      the putative targets of personal relevance, relationship, resulting in increased skills
      mastery and skills use.
