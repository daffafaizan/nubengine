      RDS and will consist of two parts:

      Part I, with the objective to assess the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of
      nebulised Curosurf® ; Part II, with the objective to compare the efficacy of nebulised
      Curosurf®, administered at two selected doses from part I, during nCPAP, versus nCPAP alone
      in terms of incidence of respiratory failure in the first 72 hours of life.
