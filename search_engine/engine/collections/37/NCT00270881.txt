      stem cell transplantation, its procedure has yet to be standardized. Recently, a single
      institute result of cord blood transplantation for adult patients with hematologic
      malignancies have been reported by Takahashi et al (Blood 2004:104;3813-3820), in which the
      survival was significantly better than that of bone marrow transplantation from unrelated
      donor. The purpose of this study was to reevaluate the safety and efficacy of cord blood
      transplantation for adult patients with hematologic malignancies using the same transplant
      procedures in a multi-institutional setting.
