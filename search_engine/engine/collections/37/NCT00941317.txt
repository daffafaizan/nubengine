      tolerability (pain) of the drilling process by testing several trigger levels. Subjects with
      distolateral onychomycosis will have a series of holes drilled into the unaffected and
      affected areas of 1 or 2 big toenail(s). A pain level < 4 using the subject self-assessment
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is considered as acceptable with regard to the study procedure.

      The study will use a two-cohort design in subjects with distolateral onychomycosis.
