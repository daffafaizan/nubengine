      cardiac output, and stroke volume, adapt to accommodate the increasing needs of a pregnant
      body. The circulatory system works harder to provide blood flow to the placenta and the
      growing fetus.

      Currently, the devices that can give physicians detailed information on the status of the
      blood circulation of normal patients and those with high blood pressure during pregnancy are
      invasive to varying degrees. However, recently, a new noninvasive hemodynamic monitor
      (NonInvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring: NICOM) was introduced to the market. In studies with
      non-pregnant patients, the NICOM has been found to be accurate, precise and reliable.
      However, it has yet to be studied in the field of Obstetrics.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the NICOM is an effective tool for monitoring
      hemodynamic changes in pregnant women, both with normal and high blood pressure. We are
      planning to compare the hemodynamic profiles of normal pregnant patients, hypertensive
      pregnant patients, and non pregnant patients as a control group. If this monitor proves to be
      reliable in assessing these changes in the pregnant patients, this could have a great impact
      in optimizing the care of the patients with different medical conditions in pregnancy, such
      as increased blood pressure.
