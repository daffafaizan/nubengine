      stable anhydrous solution and when applied to the skin enable the uptake and release of
      insulin in a brittle T1D patient.

      A series of formulations were produced at varing dose strengths and in conjunction with
      injected insulin products, applied and serum glucose measured to ascertain response and
      optimize a fomrula to be submitted for IND approval.
