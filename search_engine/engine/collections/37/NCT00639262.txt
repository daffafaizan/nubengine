      radiation therapy alone, while the standard of care for patients with high grade primary
      brain malignancies, astrocytomas, is to receive to receive concurrent temozolomide with
      radiation therapy. In this phase I study, based on the range of efficacy of kinase inhibitors
      and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier we will conduct two parallel studies. The
      first is to combine sorafenib and radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with brain
      metastases and the second is to combine sorafenib with temozolomide for primary brain tumors.
