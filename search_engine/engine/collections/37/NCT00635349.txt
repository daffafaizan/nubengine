    
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), comparative study to compare the efficacy of tramadol
      hydrochloride plus acetaminophen maintenance with that of NSAIDs maintenance in participants
      whose pain was relieved after the add-on treatment of tramadol 37.5 milligram (mg) plus
      acetaminophen 325 mg to NSAIDs. All participants will receive tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg
      plus acetaminophen 325 mg, 1 to 3 tablets per day along with NSAIDs (meloxicam [7.5 mg or 15
      mg once daily] or aceclofenac [100 mg twice daily]) from Day 1 to Day 28, and participants
      will be randomly assigned into 2 treatment groups at Day 29 if the numerical rating scale
      score less than or equal 4. Tramadol plus acetaminophen group will receive 1 or 2 tablets
      containing tramadol 37.5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg 4 times daily (maximum daily dose will
      be 8 tablets) from Day 29 to Day 85 and NSAIDs group will receive either meloxicam 7.5 mg or
      15 mg per day or aceclofenac 100 mg twice a day from Day 29 to Day 85. The efficacy will be
      evaluated on Day 1, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85. The primary efficacy end point will be
      assessed through change in Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
      total score from Day 29 to Day 85. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
