      lifetime of impaired thinking, feeling, and social functioning. The disorder generally
      becomes apparent in children by the age of 3. Autism typically affects a person's ability to
      communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the external world.
      Some people with autism can function at a relatively high level, with speech and intelligence
      intact. Others have serious cognitive impairments and language delays, and some never speak.
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of treating autistic children with
      fluoxetine to enhance developmental processes in core areas impacted by autism.

      Each participant was randomly assigned to treatment with double-blinded placebo or fluoxetine
      for 12 months. After initial screening and randomization, participants were assessed every
      two weeks for approximately the first 3 months, or until the dose of medication is
      stabilized. After this initial period, they were assessed on a monthly basis. Dosing was
      flexible as determined by the adverse and beneficial responses to treatment although there
      was a suggested titration schedule.
