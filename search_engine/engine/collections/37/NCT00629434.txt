      self-management education program not only educates the patient and his/her family to the
      basics of diabetes care but also integrates diabetes care into daily life while providing
      coping skills to adjust to this chronic illness. Unfortunately, comprehensive diabetes care
      is not available to all persons with diabetes. One obstacle to the provision of comprehensive
      diabetes care is the unavailability of a diabetes treatment center. many people with diabetes
      live too far or do not have the transportation to be able to attend education programs that
      met national standards. We have shown that telemedicine is an effective means to provide
      comprehensive 1:1 individualized diabetes education to persons with diabetes. We now propose
      to test the hypothesis that diabetes groups education classes can be provided effectively
      through telemedicine technology to individuals living in rural areas. Patients with diabetes
      will received diabetes education via teleconferencing from our Joslin Diabetes center. The
      participants will be assessed before and after diabetes education via telemedicine using
      measures of glycemia (A1c) and assessments of patient satisfaction, emotional well being, and
      behavioral change and compared to results from participants attending our diabetes education
      classes in-person.
