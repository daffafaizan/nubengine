      cues that induce craving activate an integrated network of brain areas involved in the
      appetitive and motivational process of addiction to drugs of abuse including nicotine (
      Brieter 119; Koob 2001, Volkow 2003).In nicotine deprived smokers both mesolimbic dopamine
      reward pathways (amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and medial thalamus) and areas related to
      visuospatial attention (bilateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex and right fusiform
      gyrus) are activated by exposure to smoking images (Due 2002, David 2005).

      In line with the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) emphasis on novel methods for
      investigating substance use disorders, the current study proposes to use fMRI to better
      understand the neurological correlates of cue reactivity among nicotine dependent smokers.
      This approach will permit the isolation of pathways that are relevant to cue induced craving.
