      interbody fusion device with non-rigid (Titanium Alloy, Z-Brace, Baui Biotech) interbody
      fusion device in ACDF surgery at 11 clinical sites. ACDF was performed with stand-alone
      interbody fusion device and artificial bone graft (hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate).
      Patients have 1-level or 2-level cervical degenerative disc disease approved for ACDF surgery
      by National Health Insurance, which is the blind, third-party, administrative approved and
      insurance reimbursement for surgical indication. Total 180 patients were enrolled, and 180
      patients were randomized into either investigational device (non-rigid) group or the control
      (rigid) group in a 2:1 ratio. After confirming a patient's eligibility and having the patient
      sign an informed consent form, the site investigator or study coordinator call the
      coordinator at National Taiwan University Hospital for the randomization. Each patient will
      be then assigned to 1 of the treatment group according to a randomized schedule. Patient were
      evaluated preoperatively, one month postoperatively, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      postoperatively. Measured outcomes included overall success, Neck Disability Index (NDI), VAS
      neck and arm pain, adjacent range of motion, patient satisfaction, anxiety score, SF-12
      MCS/PCS, major complications, subsequent surgery rate, and subsidence and fusion rate on
      radiological examinations. The primary endpoint was a FDA composite definition of success
      comprising clinical improvement and absence of major complications and secondary surgery
      events.
