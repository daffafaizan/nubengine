    
      This is a multicenter study with 2 arms, and will include 3 phases: a) screening phase of up
      to 28 days before randomization during which participants will complete a 14-day washout
      period from all prior therapies including JAK-inhibitor treatment, and the participant's
      eligibility will be reviewed; b) treatment phase, from randomization until study treatment
      (imetelstat or BAT) discontinuation; and c) post treatment follow-up phase, that begins when
      the participant discontinues treatment, and will continue until death, lost to follow-up,
      withdrawal of consent, or study end, whichever occurs first. Participants will be randomized
      (2:1) into 2 Arms (Arm A will receive imetelstat and Arm B will receive BAT).

      Participants who meet progressive disease criteria and discontinue BAT, may crossover to
      receive imetelstat treatment after sponsor's approval.
