      started receiving regular blood transfusions but whose iron load is not yet at the level
      where chelation treatment would normally begin. The purpose is to see if doing this will
      postpone the build-up of iron without causing serious side effects. Half the children in the
      study will be given deferiprone at a dose that is lower than what is normally prescribed, and
      the other half will be given placebo. All patients will receive the assigned product three
      times a day for up to 12 months. Tests for signs of iron overload will be done monthly, and a
      patient whose iron load reaches the level where chelation therapy would normally begin will
      be immediately taken out of the study and started on standard chelation therapy.
