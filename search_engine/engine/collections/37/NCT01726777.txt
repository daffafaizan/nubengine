      to be increased by low serum vitamin D concentrations. Epidemiological studies show an
      association between increased diabetes risk and low serum vitamin D and studies suggest that
      vitamin D may protect against diabetes by reducing chronic inflammation and improving insulin
      sensitivity and insulin secretion. Although clinical studies show some of these effects, no
      studies have been able to show that vitamin D supplementation reduces post-prandial blood
      glucose, the most clinically relevant marker of diabetes and dysglycemia. Previously, the
      investigators showed that cheddar cheese and low-fat cheese can be fortified with high levels
      of vitamin D3 (28,000IU/ 30g portion) and that, in this form, it is at least as a effective
      as vitamin D3 supplements in raising serum vitamin D concentrations. Since post-prandial
      glucose is most sensitive to changes in insulin sensitivity the main purpose of this study is
      to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on oral glucose tolerance (ie. serum
      glucose 2h after 75g oral glucose) in individuals who are at risk for developing T2D.
      Secondary objective are to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin
      sensitivity, insulin secretion, inflammatory markers, blood lipids and markers of safety
      including serum parathyroid hormone levels and urinary calcium excretion.
