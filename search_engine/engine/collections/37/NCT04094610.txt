    
      Enrollment of subjects into Phase 1 will proceed concurrently by age as follows:

        -  Subjects <12 years old will initially be enrolled in the Phase 1 part to determine the
           pediatric RP2D for this age group; once the pediatric RP2D is determined, subjects age
           <12 years old may be enrolled into the Phase 2 part of the study.

        -  Subjects 12 to 25 years old will be directly enrolled into the Phase 2 part concurrent
           with Phase 1 enrollment.

      Phase 1:

      Approximately 12 pediatric subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors,
      including a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma
      (ALCL), with disease progression or who are non-responsive or intolerant to available
      therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists.

      Phase 2:

      Subjects will be enrolled in one of 3 cohorts as follows:

      Cohort 1: approximately 10-20 subjects with solid tumors characterized by NTRK fusion, TRK
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naÃ¯ve, and centrally confirmed measurable disease at
      baseline.

      Cohort 2: approximately 23 subjects with solid tumors characterized by NTRK fusion, TRK
      TKI-pretreated, and centrally confirmed measurable disease at baseline.

      Cohort 3: approximately 20 subjects with solid tumors or ALCL characterized by other
      ALK/ROS1/NTRK alterations or NTRK fusions without centrally confirmed measurable disease not
      otherwise eligible for Cohort 1 or 2.
