        -  This is a prospective, randomized (simultaneous biventricular (BiV) pacing vs.
           sequential BiV pacing) study.

        -  Any patient that receives an FDA approved St. Jude Medical (SJM) CRT-D with V-V timing
           is eligible for enrollment.

        -  At 3 months post enrollment (or at implant for CRT-D replacements), patients screened as
           non-responders are randomized to either simultaneous or sequential BiV pacing. Patients
           requiring a replacement CRT-D device that are identified as non-responders to CRT are
           enrolled at the screening/randomization visit.

        -  Patients are followed for a period of 6 months post randomization:

             -  Enrollment (1 week pre CRT-D implant to < 2 weeks post CRT-D implant)

             -  Screening/Randomization Visit (3 months post enrollment)

             -  Follow-up Visit (6 months post randomization)

        -  Total # of centers - 80 centers

        -  Sample size - 800 patients screened for CRT non-responders
