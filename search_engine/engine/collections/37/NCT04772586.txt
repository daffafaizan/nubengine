      patients, sarcopenia is associated with difficult to wean of mechanical ventilation. The
      association between sarcopenia and mechanical ventilation is poorly studied in medical
      patients. COVID-19 pandemic has led a lot of medical patient to be admitted in intensive care
      units due to acute respiratory failure with need of mechanical ventilation support.

      The primary objective is to determine if sarcopenia in critically-ill older patients with
      COVID-19 is associated with the indication of mechanical ventilation. Secondarily, the study
      aims at determining if sarcopenia is associated with difficult to wean and mortality in
      critically-ill older patients with COVID-19.
