      million (nearly double since the early 1960s), and over 1.6 billion people are considered
      overweight or obese worldwide. Compounding the health risks associated with obesity is the
      insufficient data supporting dosing strategies for a variety of medication used to treat
      conditions encountered in obese patients. No consensus on the best dosing strategy for IgG in
      obese patients has been established. Total (TBW), ideal (IBW), and adjusted (AdjBW) body
      weight-based dosing are being utilized by different institutions. Thus, there is an urgent
      need to identify evidence supporting optimal dosing strategies for IgG.

      It has been proposed that using TBW to dose IgG in obese patients may increase the risk of
      thrombosis owing to increased blood viscosity, activation of platelets, or vasospasm; and the
      increase in blood viscosity has been reported as IgG dose dependent. The use of using IBW or
      AdjBW has been advocated to reduce the side effect and drug expenditures. It is currently
      unknown what the clinical impact is of using measures of body weight other than TBW to
      calculate IgG doses, and the effect of obesity on IgG pharmacokinetics has not been
      experimentally evaluated.
