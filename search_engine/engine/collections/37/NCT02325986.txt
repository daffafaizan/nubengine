      cell carcinoma is still controversial. Several studies have reported the feasibility and
      efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), mostly with three-weekly or four-weekly
      schedule of chemotherapy. However, treatment compliance was not quite satisfactory, probably
      due to treatment-related toxicities. Since CCRT with weekly chemotherapy regimens have
      demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile as well as promising survival in certain types of
      cancer, the investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy
      concurrently with weekly chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin for patients
      with postoperative locoregional recurrence of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the
      investigators center.The prescribed dose of radiotherapy is generally 60Gy/28fr to tumor and
      50Gy/28fr to the clinical target volume.The concomitant chemotherapy is cisplatin 25mg/m2 on
      day 1, 5-FU 1176mg/m2 on day 1-3, repeated weekly for 4 weeks.
