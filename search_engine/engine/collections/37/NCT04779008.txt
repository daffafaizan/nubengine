    
      A total of 210 patients were randomly divided into three groups according to the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, with 70 patients in each group.

      Experimental Group 1:

      The patient underwent one RIPC (Four five-minute cycles of upper limb ischaemia and Four
      five-minute pauses using a blood pressure cuff air vehicle to 200 mmHg) 1 hours before
      surgery, then normal surgery, and RIPC was performed on the second day after surgery and
      every day after surgery, which lasted for 1 year.

      Experiment Group 2:

      Patients underwent once RIPC 1 hours before surgery, and then normal medical procedures were
      performed with no additional intervention.

      Control group:

      Patients did not receive any additional intervention. All patients were evaluated in three
      ways. First: 7days and 3 months after surgery , the quantitative examination of myocardial
      blood flow was conducted to observe the improvement of myocardial blood perfusion.

      Second: The changes in the concentrations of vascular colorectal growth factor, Nitrc Oxide,
      adenosine, and endothelin-1.

      Third, patients were evaluated for 6 months and 12months MACCE incidence (cardiovascular
      death, Nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization, and stroke).
