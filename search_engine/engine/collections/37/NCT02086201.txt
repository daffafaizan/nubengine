      in the community. Several causes of this science to service gap have been identified. One
      cause, specific to behavioral interventions, is the complexity of interventions and the
      competencies community clinicians must acquire and sustain over time in order to deliver
      them. A realistic solution is to streamline behavioral interventions and tailor them to the
      settings and therapist skill level available in the community. In response to this need, we
      have developed Engage, which: 1) is streamlined on the basis of concepts and findings on the
      neurobiology of depression; 2) consists of psychotherapeutic and ecosystem management
      components of known efficacy; 3) has distilled and simplified these components so as they can
      be accessible to most depressed older patients and taught to larger numbers of clinicians
      than available therapies, e.g., Problem Solving Therapy (PST); and 4) is personalized through
      a structured stepped approach focusing on "reward exposure". Problem Solving Therapy is an
      evidenced-based intervention shown to be effective in treating late-life depression.

      Three hundred (150 per site) patient participants will be randomly assigned to receive 9
      sessions of either Engage or PST. Forty-two clinician participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive training and certification in either Engage or PST. Once certified, clinicians
      will be assigned a patient participant and administer their assigned intervention.
