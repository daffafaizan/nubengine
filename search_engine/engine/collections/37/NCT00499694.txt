    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with metastatic androgen-independent
           prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel currently treated with satraplatin and
           bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess changes in levels of N-terminal collagen peptide (NTX) and bone-specific alkaline
           phosphatase (BSAP) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate urine NTX and serum BSAP levels with time to progression in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral satraplatin on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28-42 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
