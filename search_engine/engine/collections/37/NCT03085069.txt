      approximately 20% of unselected patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Developing
      reliable, validated biomarkers that identify patients with an increased probability of
      response to these antibodies remains a challenge.

      Because the PD-1 pathway may be a key mechanism of immune escape in a subgroup of patients
      with non-small-cell lung cancer, PD-L1 expression in tumor or inflammatory cells is a
      candidate biomarker. However, PD-L1 expression has not been formally validated as a biomarker
      in contemporaneously collected tumor tissue.

      Additionally the purpose of the study is to assess the correlation between the expression of
      PD-L1 in the tumor and the response to treatment with SHR-1210 in non-small cell lung cancer.
