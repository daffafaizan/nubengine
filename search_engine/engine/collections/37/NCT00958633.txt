      The investigators propose a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      in patients with BD who are currently experiencing a depressive episode. The trial will
      consist of two phases: an open-label acute treatment phase, and a double-blind maintenance
      treatment phase.

      OPEN-LABEL ACUTE TREATMENT PHASE

      Experimental Design Patients with BD depression who are receiving treatment with antimanic
      medication(s), defined as: 1) a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex ), 2) a
      second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, or
      ziprasidone), or 3) combination anti-manic therapy (two mood stabilizers; or a mood
      stabilizer plus an SGA (the SGA asenapine will also be permitted if prescribed with a mood
      stabilizer); or a mood stabilizer or SGA plus lamotrigine), will have open-label escitalopram
      10-30 mg/day or bupropion XL 150-450 mg/day added to their medication(s) for up to 16
      weeks.Patients who complete at least 4 weeks of treatment and achieve remission from their
      index depression which is maintained for ≥ 2 weeks will be eligible to enter the double-blind
      study phase. The duration of treatment in the open-label phase will be 4-16 weeks, depending
      on the time required to achieve remission.

      DOUBLE-BLIND MAINTENANCE TREATMENT PHASE

      Patients who are in remission from their index depression for ≥ 2 weeks and ≤ 8 weeks are
      eligible to take part in the double-blind maintenance phase. There are two routes to enter
      the double-blind phase:

        -  following completion of the open-label phase, or

        -  following a period of clinical treatment, not exceeding 16 weeks, with the same
           medications used in the open-label phase. Patients who respond to clinical treatment
           with carbamazepine plus an antidepressant may also enter the double-blind phase.

      Experimental Design

      During the double-blind phase, all patients will continue treatment with their anti-manic
      medication(s) and will be randomized to one of two treatment arms for up to 52 weeks:

        -  Patients randomized to the "8 week arm" will discontinue antidepressant treatment after
           8 weeks, as recommended in current clinical practice guidelines..

        -  Patients randomized to the "52 week arm" will continue treatment with their
           antidepressant medication for 52 weeks, or until withdrawal from the study.
