      health benefit on the host. This health-promoting effects of Lactobacillus reuteri have been
      extensively studied in the gastrointestinal tract but it is clear that other areas are also
      interesting for the use of probiotics.

      Atopic Dermatitis is a relapsing inflammatory skin disease appearing on persons with a
      genetic predisposition of allergic pathology. AD generally starts in childhood, however in
      some cases can continue into adult hood, in at least 10% of cases. AD can effect a persons
      quality of life and in the chronic stage it can present with dry skin and lichenification.

      Research has shown that probiotics have an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and barrier
      function effect, and could therefore be used on subjects with Atopic Dermatitis to relieve
      and protect.
