      opportunistic mycoses after liver transplantation.

      Retransplantation and renal failure are amongst the most significant risk factors for
      invasive fungal infections in these patients.

      Most Invasive fungal infections in these high-risk patients occur within the first month
      posttransplant.

      Studies utilizing universal prophylaxis have primarily employed fluconazole. A recent
      meta-analysis of prophylactic trials documented a beneficial effect on morbidity and
      attributable mortality, but an emergence of infections due to non-albicans Candida spp. in
      patients receiving prophylaxis.

      The availability of echinocandins has led to an expanded armamentarium of antifungal drugs
      with a potentially promising role as agents for targeted prophylaxis for invasive fungal
      infections in high-risk liver transplant recipients. Anidulafungin is unique amongst
      echinocandins in that it is eliminated from the body almost exclusively through
      biotransformation by slow non-enzymatic degradation in the blood, without hepatic metabolism
      or renal elimination. Anidulafungin has demonstrated good safety profile. We hypothesize that
      anidulafungin will be more effective and a better tolerated antifungal prophylactic agent in
      this setting.
