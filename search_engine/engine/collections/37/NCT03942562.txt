    
      Basal measurements are taken in relation to the study variables.

      The variables are:

        -  pressure pain thresholds

        -  electromyography values

        -  static and dynamic plantar pressure measurement

        -  active knee extensibility

        -  maximal strength of knee flexors

        -  thermography

        -  scales of pain perception

      Immediately subjects perform eccentric exercise on right hamstrings to develop DOMS (delay
      onset muscle soreness).

      Measurements of the study variables are taken in the same conditions 48, 96 and 168 hours
      after the exercise to study the evolution of the variables while recovering from DOMS.
