    
      Study design : 3 dose levels

      Step 1 : 25 mg once daily Step 2 : 37.5 mg once daily Step 3 : 50 mg once daily

      3-6 patients will be included at each of the sunitinib dose levels, depending on the number
      of DLTs (dose limiting toxicity) occurring in 14 weeks after start of treatment

      DLT is defined as :

      any grade 3 or 4 musculoskeletal or cutaneous toxicity within the field of radiation any
      other toxicity > or = 4

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  to evaluate the safety with late toxicities

        -  to estimate the response rate at 6 months

        -  to estimate the progression free survival

        -  to evaluate the proportion of patients with an operable tumour after treatment

      Exploratory objectives are :

        -  to study evolution during treatment of neo-angiogenesis measured by dynamic contrast
           enhanced-ultrasonography (DCE-US)

        -  to study the correlation between clinical response and changes of tumor perfusion
           measured by DCE-US
