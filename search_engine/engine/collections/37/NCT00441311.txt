      dissemination of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening findings and guidelines to primary care
      physicians practicing in selected geographic areas in New York City. Since improving
      implementation of cancer screening guidelines also involves compliance by patients in
      completing the recommended tests or examinations, we will also seek to assess knowledge,
      attitude and screening behaviors of patients visiting primary care practitioners in our
      sample. Our long-term goal is to reduce colorectal cancer mortality among ethnic and racial
      minorities, by influencing the screening behaviors of their primary care physicians.

      The specific aims of the study are as follows:

        -  Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that an intervention, multi-component academic detailing,
           will increase the rate of physician CRC screening at 3and 6month postrandomization,
           compared to the rate observed in a serviceasusual control.

        -  Aim 2. To develop models predicting which physician offices are most and least likely to
           adopt the intervention, and to generate hypotheses about tailoring the dissemination of
           CRC screening guidelines to different physician subgroups.

        -  Aim 3. To conduct cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the incremental societal costs
           and effects (in lives saved, life-years saved, and quality-of-life-years saved) of the
           CRC intervention implemented in physicians' offices.
