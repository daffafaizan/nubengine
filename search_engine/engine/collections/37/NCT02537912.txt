      despite of the high content of phenolic compounds. Polyphenol extract from peanut skins has
      been demonstrated to inhibit α-amylase activity in vitro. Hence, the aim of this study was to
      evaluate the regulatory effects of the peanut skin extract on blood glucose and body fat by a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study. Subjects with simple obesity (body mass
      index [BMI] ≥ 27 or body fat ≥ 30%) ingested 4 Sugarlock® (n = 16) capsules or placebo (n =
      14) a day for a total of 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements (body weight, body fat, blood
      pressure) and blood biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total
      cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN), AST, ALT were examined every three weeks. Also, 5 subjects were randomly selected for
      MRI scans to examine the distribution and thickness of abdominal fat layers before and after
      the trial.
