      military service personnel coming back from Iraq with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      and a variety of co-occurring psychological problems. This study examines the effects of six
      sessions of EFT coaching on a veterans population. The sample will recruited from clients of
      practitioners who are coaching veterans. Participants will be assessed for PTSD and other
      psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. Evaluations will be made using
      well-validated instruments, the SA-45 (Symptom Assessment 45) and the PCL-M (Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder Checklist - Military). Those meeting the military's criterion for a
      PTSD-positive assessment on the PCL-M will be randomized into two groups. A wait list control
      group continues to receive Standard of Care (SOC) from their current healthcare provider. The
      experimental group receives SOC plus EFT coaching. A baseline measurement is obtained
      approximately thirty days in advance of coaching, when subjects apply to participate in the
      study, and again immediately before coaching begins. Participants are assessed after three
      sessions and six sessions, to determine symptom changes at these milestones. Followup
      assessments occur three months and six months post-coaching. Pain levels, alcohol use,
      recreational drug use, and prescription drug dosages are also tracked, in order to determine
      any correlation between participant characteristics and psychological symptom change. Data
      will also be analyzed to determine if there are outcome differences between participants
      receiving EFT from life coaches, and those whose EFT coaching is delivered by licensed
      psychologists or social workers.
