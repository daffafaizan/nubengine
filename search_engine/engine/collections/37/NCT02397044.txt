      The population was divided into 2 groups: Group A implants (n=23) were loaded immediately on
      the day of surgery and Group B implants (n=19) were loaded 3 weeks after surgery. Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans were taken preoperatively to aid in treatment planning. Bone
      density was evaluated on CBCT scans in Hounsfield units (HU) and by tactile feedback during
      surgery. Insertion torque was recorded at time of implant placement. Resonance frequency
      analysis, performed on the day of surgery, at the time of loading, and at 6, 12 and 24
      months, was used to record implant stability according to the unit's Implant Stability
      Quotient (Osstell ISQ). Standardized radiographs were taken at time of implant placement and
      at 6, 12 and 24 months to measure crestal bone stability. Bone level changes were measured by
      software (Image J, available online at: http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html; last accessed
