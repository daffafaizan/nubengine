      treatment and administration, a Follow-up visit on (Day 3+1 and Day 7±1) and a Final
      Follow-up visit (Day 35±3). Infusion of PB2452 will be initiated on Day 1 and will continue
      for approximately 16 hours for a total of 18 g.

      On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion comprised of an initial IV bolus of 6 grams (g)
      infused over 10 minutes for rapid reversal, followed immediately by a 6g IV loading infusion
      over 4 hours and then a 6 g IV maintenance infusion over 12 hours. This bentracimab (PB2452)
      regimen is expected to provide immediate reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor
      within 5 minutes of the initiation of infusion that is sustained for 20-24 hours.

      In subjects with potential drug interaction from recent concomitant use of moderate or strong
      CYP3A inhibitors with ticagrelor, an alternative regimen may be used comprising
      administration of 36 g over an active treatment period of 24 hours and 10 min. (This
      alternative regimen will be an initial 12 g bolus infusion over 10 minutes, followed
      immediately by a loading infusion of 12 g over 6 hours which will then be followed by a
      maintenance regimen of 12 g infused over 18 hours for a total infusion of 36 grams over 24
      hours and 10 minutes).

      All subjects may be discharged from the clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will
      return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already discharged, and on Day 35 (± 3 days).
