    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have had
      a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) within the first 6 months after initiation
      of therapy with cabozantinib S-malate (XL184 [cabozantinib]), nivolumab, and ipilimumab
      (CaboNivoIpi).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of objective response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and
      overall survival (OS).

      II. To assess tolerability and adverse events of CaboNivoIpi in patients with differentiated
      thyroid cancer (DTC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate treatment response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      version [v]1.1) with tumor mutation status.

      II. To correlate treatment response (RECIST v1.1) with frequency of tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes in biopsies taken pre-treatment and after 12 weeks of CaboNivoIpi therapy.

      III. To evaluate the effect of CaboNivoIpi on T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and to
      identify the frequency of shared T cell clones between tumor and peripheral blood.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of XL184 (cabozantinib) alone and of the CaboNivoIpi combination
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to correlate their frequency with treatment
      response (RECIST v1.1).

      V. To evaluate the effect of XL184 (cabozantinib) alone and of the CaboNivoIpi combination on
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and to correlate their frequency with treatment
      response (RECIST v1.1).

      VI. To correlate treatment response (RECIST v1.1) with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
      / programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the primary/metastatic tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -14 to -1 prior to
      cycle 1, days 1-42 of cycles 1-4 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 of cycles 1-4 and day 1 of
      subsequent cycles and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Treatment repeats
      every 42 days for cycles 1-4 and every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, and then every 12
      weeks for up to 2 years.
