    
      This is a phase lb/ll, multicenter, open label, single arm study to assess efficacy and
      safety of the anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody olinvacimab and capecitabine in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who failed two prior standard chemotherapies.

      The primary objective of phase lb is to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) of olinvacimab in combination with capecitabine. the primary
      objective of phase ll is to assess the efficacy of olinvacimab plus capecitabine as a salvage
      regimen in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
