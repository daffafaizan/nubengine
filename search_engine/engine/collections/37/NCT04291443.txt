      premolars extraction as part of their orthodontic treatment using specific fixed orthodontic
      appliance design with moderate anchorage were recruited for this study. Both of these
      premolars were allocated randomly to a heavy ( 225g) and light (25g) force in a split mouth
      design with a 1:1 allocation ratio. (GCF) was collected from the gingival sulcus of these
      teeth before extraction at six time intervals which are baseline, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week , 2
      weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks. Plaque and Gingival Indices were recorded for those patients at
      each timeline. Premolars will be extracted after 4weeks to be examined by stereomicroscopy
      for surface area evaluation of root resorption. Proteomic analysis will be carried out on the
      GCF sample. The proteomic analysis of the collected GCF will be obtained by using
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS).
      MS spectra will be used to search human protein sequence data bases for protein
      identification and the development of "Protein Print" specific for these biological
      conditions.
