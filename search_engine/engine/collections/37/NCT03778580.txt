      Recent research shows that diabetes has negative effects on bones and that people with
      diabetes might more likely to break a bone. The investigators don't know the reasons for
      this, but the investigators suspect that normal bone replacement is slowed down in diabetes
      and this could slow down the growth of new bone. It is possible that the normal material
      becomes weaker because sugar-related components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts") are making
      the bone more brittle. The investigators have shown in past research that people who have
      type 2 diabetes are more likely to have both weaker bone with lower "bone material strength"
      and also higher level of sugar-related components("Advanced Glycation Endproducts"). This
      study will focus on attempting to lower the sugar-related components("Advanced Glycation
      Endproducts") by treating a group of patients with type 2 diabetes with an over- the- counter
      B vitamin, known as vitamin B6 or pyridoxamine for one year. The investigators will compare
      post-menopausal women both before and after pyridoxamine use and study them in terms of
      different bone features based on blood tests, bone imaging, a bone indentation test and a
      measurement of sugar-related components in the skin. This study will help to clarify if using
      pyridoxamine helps improve bone strength in women with diabetes.
