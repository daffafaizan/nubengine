      is not only a cosmetic issue; also, the repair of cranial defects gives relief to
      psychological drawbacks and increases the social performances. Many different types of
      materials were used throughout the history of cranioplasty. With the evolving biomedical
      technology, new materials are available to be used by the surgeons. Although many different
      materials and techniques had been described, ongoing researches on both biologic and non
      biologic substitutions continue aiming to develop the ideal reconstruction material.

      Autologous bone grafts remain the best option for adult and pediatric patients with viable
      donor sites and small-to-medium defects. Large defects in the adult population can be
      reconstructed with titanium mesh and polymethylmethacrylate overlay with or without the use
      of computer-assisted design and manufacturing customization. Advances in alloplastic
      materials and custom manufacturing of implants will have an important influence on
      cranioplasty techniques in the years to come.
