    
      This observational study based on a population-based EHR database in Yinzhou district of
      Ningbo city in China is to estimate incidence rates of seizures (including febrile seizures),
      urticaria and angioedema, apnea, and fever among Chinese children after receiving Prevenar
      13. In addition, a validation study including validation of International classification of
      diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes or ICD-10 code based algorithm for identifying all
      safety outcomes of interest and a prospective cohort study in a sub-population of the main
      study will be conducted in order to offset the potential biased results from the main study
      because of potential misclassification of the safety outcomes of interest due to miscoding
      and/or undercoding of ICD-10 codes used to identify these safety outcomes in the EHR
      database.
