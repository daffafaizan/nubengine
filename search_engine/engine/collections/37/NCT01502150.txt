      treatment and treatment outcomes and store it electronically in a database. By carefully
      evaluating the data about your treatment, researchers may improve proton treatment for
      patients in the future. There will be no change to your recommended standard of care and
      follow-up studies. The treatment information and follow-up information will be stored in a
      database. The information will then be available at a later date for researchers to study.
      The database will be stored on a secure information network, and only those people who are
      involved with this research and who have prior approval from the study doctor will have
      access to it.

      Researchers will request information from the follow-up visits that you have as part of your
      standard of care yearly or more often and test results for at least 10-15 years. The tests
      may be performed at other clinics, but MD Anderson researchers will request that the results
      be sent to them at MD Anderson.

      This is an investigational study. Proton radiotherapy is FDA approved. Researchers hope to
      enroll all children who will be treated with proton radiotherapy at MD Anderson on this study
      so that as much information as possible will be gathered. Up to 1000 patients will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
