      of other psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation, which entails
      training and practice of successively more difficult cognitive exercises, has shown efficacy
      in improving cognitive function. However, the rate of improvement has not been uniform among
      patients receiving this intervention. Given the time- and cost-intensiveness of cognitive
      remediation, it is important to examine variables that will predict response to this
      treatment, as well as to examine the clinical significance of any improvement.

      The current proposal has two aims: 1) to determine which neuropsychological, demographic, and
      illness variables predict response to cognitive remediation training; and 2) to determine the
      proportion of patients whose performance returns to normal following cognitive remediation
      training. For the first part of the proposed study, 50 outpatients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders will be invited to participate in an 8-week trial of
      cognitive remediation training. Detailed neuropsychological, demographic, symptom and illness
      course variables will be collected prior to training, at the conclusion of training, and 4
      months from study intake. In order to answer the second question, additional data on the
      computerized task performance for healthy controls will be collected, and compared to patient
      data, in order to determine what constitutes normal-range performance
