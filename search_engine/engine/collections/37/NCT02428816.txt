      3Tesla MRI.

      The aim of our project is to demonstrate that our multimodal MRI method can discriminate both
      diseases with a similar clinical presentation and monitor the progress of the disease. CIC's
      expertise in recruitment and assessment of patients, and the powers of the INSERM U825 in
      terms of development and processing in neuroimaging guarantee the feasibility of the project
      and its successful completion.
