      largely because diagnostic tools are limited and clinical research uncommon. An improved
      understanding of the risk factors, etiology and clinical outcomes of CAP in Vietnam would
      contribute to improved approaches to patient diagnosis and clinical management. This will be
      achieved by following the clinical and laboratory progress and treatment outcomes of
      in-patients diagnosed with CAP from admission to discharge. Comparative analyses will be
      between subgroups including survivor and non-survivor, severe CAP and non-severe CAP, known
      etiology and unknown etiology, SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and shock septic.
