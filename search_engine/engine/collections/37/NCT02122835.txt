      failure plus type 2 diabetes prior to and following a 12-week exercise training program
      (5d/wk, 30 min/d, 60-75% VO2max) to determine whether improvements in exercise capacity in
      response to exercise training are mitigated in patients with combined heart failure plus type
      2 diabetes.
