      Trophectoderm biopsy will be performed on all blastocysts however biopsy samples will not be
      analyzed till the clinical outcome has been determined. The single, morphologically best
      embryo available will be selected for transfer. All clinical and laboratory care is identical
      to that of which subjects would receive if they were not participating in the study. This
      includes all pretreatment screening, in-cycle treatment, embryology procedures, single embryo
      transfer, pregnancy testing, and pregnancy follow-up (if pregnancy occurs).
