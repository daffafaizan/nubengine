      trimester screening test for the detection of foetal aneuploidy, in order to ascertain
      whether this can also be used for the detection of patients at-risk for gestational diabetes
      mellitus. For this purpose the investigators will include a combination of new markers in a
      multiplex bio-array manner in conjunction with an early oral glucose tolerance test. A nested
      case-control proteomic analysis will be performed in a retrospective manner at the completion
      of this study in order to develop more specific biomarker panels.

      The primary outcome will be development of gestational diabetes mellitus in the second or
      third trimester.

      The secondary endpoints are the delivery outcome, neonatal morbidity, neonatal mortality,
      maternal morbidity and costs.
