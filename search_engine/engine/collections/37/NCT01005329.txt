      I. To assess the treatment-related, grade 3+, non-hematologic adverse-event rate within 90
      days from the start of treatment with concurrent intensity-modulated radiotherapy, cisplatin,
      and bevacizumab followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with high-risk endometrial
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate treatment-related adverse events occurring within 1 year from the start of
      treatment.

      II. To evaluate all treatment-related adverse events. III. To evaluate disease-free and
      overall survival. IV. To evaluate local, regional, and distant failure.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 5 weeks. Patients may also undergo optional nodal boost radiotherapy and/or vaginal
      brachytherapy boost. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1
      hour on days 1 and 29 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Beginning
      4-6 weeks after completing IMRT, cisplatin, and bevacizumab, patients receive carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
