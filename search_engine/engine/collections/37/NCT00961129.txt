      design will be used in this study. The cross-sectional survey is to examine the current
      status of supportive care needs perceived by different stage of colorectal cancer inpatients
      and outpatients including survivors. The 1-year longitudinal design is to explore the change
      of supportive care needs perceived by patients within one year after newly diagnosed with
      colorectal cancer.
