      while also characterizing the genes associated with that risk. Furthermore it will attempt to
      better understand which patients may have an optimal response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation
      allowing for possible predictive metagenomics evaluation, investigators may be able to
      augment treatments as well as provide recommendations for the success and cost effectiveness
      of cancer care.
