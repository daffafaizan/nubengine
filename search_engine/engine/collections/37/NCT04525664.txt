      district. This district was selected because in a preliminary study, the prevalence of
      dyspeptic symptoms in this district was found to be 57%. Namutumba District has a population
      of slightly over 210,000 people. The prevalence of chronic dyspepsia and their associated
      symptoms will be determined using a questionnaire administered to all willing participants.
      All participants, regardless of symptoms, will also be offered fecal Hp antigen testing.
      Participants found to be infected with Hp will be given a 14-day course of antibiotics, per
      the current Ugandan standards of care, and assessed one month following completion of
      treatment. Participants with chronic dyspepsia who are negative for Hp will be given daily
      omeprazole for one month, and their symptoms will be assessed after one month.
