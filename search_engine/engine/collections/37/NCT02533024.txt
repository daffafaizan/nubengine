      relating to ulnar nerve dysfunction. Following this the investigators will do a focused
      physical exam looking for decrement of sensation in the distribution of the ulnar nerve and
      muscle strength of the hand muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve. After this the subjects will
      undergo an EMG exam to measure the conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve. Basically the
      nerve will be stimulated with a small current and the resultant muscle activity of the hand
      muscle will be picked up using an EKG like patch applied to the skin over the hand. If a
      subject is diagnosed to have ulnar neuropathy preoperatively the investigators would study
      the EMG based nerve conduction during surgery at 30-60 minute intervals for the duration of
      surgery. For purposes of comparison the investigators would measure the ulnar nerve
      conduction during surgery in age and sex matched controls.
