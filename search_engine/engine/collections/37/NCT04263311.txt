      community and clinical sites in Georgia for implementation of culturally tailored,
      evidenced-based CHW programs to improve HTN and diabetes management for South Asians. In
      addition, the use a multi-theoretical framework to test the effectiveness of a CHW-led
      intervention compared to usual care among South Asian individuals with diabetes and
      uncontrolled HTN in Atlanta. The primary outcome is blood pressure control, defined as 130/80
      mmHg. It is hypothesized that, compared to usual care, individuals receiving the CHW
      intervention will be 20% more likely to achieve blood pressure control at 6 months.

      And to apply RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks to delineate factors influencing appropriateness,
      fidelity, adoption, and maintenance of the intervention within clinical and community
      settings to optimize intervention replication.

      In addition, this study will serve as a national information and dissemination resource in
      the adaptation of evidence-based strategies to reduce geographic disparities in HTN and
      diabetes across Asian American groups.
