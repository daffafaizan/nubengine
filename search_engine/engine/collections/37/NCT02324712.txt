      condition following low back pain. According to the NIDCR, TMD affects 5%-12% of the
      population at an annual cost estimated at 4 billion dollars in the US. Recent studies that
      have investigated acupuncture as a treatment for musculoskeletal pain have reported various
      results. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials suggest
      that acupuncture treatment improves TMD-related pain. Its mechanism of action in improving
      TMD pain, however, is largely unclear.

      Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., MCP-1 and IL-8 have been found in
      circulating blood of patients with TMD. Upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have
      been correlated with greater sensitivity to pain evoking stimuli. Abnormalities in levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines are often accompanied by alterations in levels of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1ra, which are associated with reductions in pain and
      inflammation. The effects of acupuncture on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth
      factors, and clinical pain and function have not been reported in a prospective cohort of TMD
      patients at multiple time points in the clinical setting. The proposed mechanistic study
      seeks to ascertain if acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture produces measurable changes in
      circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in a manner that is
      associated with patient self-reports of pain and function over a 4-week treatment period.
      Cytokine and growth factor levels will be measured in blood and saliva; saliva will be used
      to measure cytokine levels only.
