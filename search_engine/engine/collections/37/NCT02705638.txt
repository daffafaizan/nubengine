      fibroinflammatory condition. Various manifestations of IgG4-RD were previously recognized in
      individual organ systems, but these entities (including autoimmune pancreatitis, orbital
      pseudotumor, Reidel's thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, idiopathic sialadenitis and
      dacryoadenitis, etc) are now recognized as manifestations of a common disease process that
      can affect any organ system. IgG4-RD is characterized by distinctive histologic findings of
      tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells together with storiform fibrosis and
      obliterative phlebitis. Both clinical and pathologic consensus diagnostic criteria have been
      defined. Serum IgG4 concentration is a biomarker for IgG4-RD and is elevated in 70% to 90% of
      patients with active disease.
