      morbidities were retrospectively reviewed. All study patients received dexmedetomidine bolus
      over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion to achieve a minimum Ramsay Sedation Score of
      5. Patients were monitored for hemodynamics, total dose of dexmedetomidine received, adverse
      events experienced and sedation characteristics.
