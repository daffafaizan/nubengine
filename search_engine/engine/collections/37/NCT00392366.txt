      and prostate tumors. LITT has also tested with success by other teams for the treatment of
      liver metastasis.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine if the Visualase, MR guided, laser
      interstitial thermal therapy device can be safely and efficiently used for the treatment of
      human liver metastasis originating from the colon and rectal primary tumors.

      As secondary objectives for this clinical study is to explore the tolerance of the treatment
      and its contra indications.

      The clinical trial will include a statistical sample of 25 patients and will run over a
      period of 24 months. The inclusion period will be of 12 months and the patients will be
      followed up during a period of 7 days after the intervention.

      The clinical trial will be performed at the Cochin University Hospital of Paris and the
      patients will be coming from the oncology / surgery departments of the hospital.

      The patients recruited for this study are those who developed several liver metastasis and
      are planned for the a surgical resection for part of the liver (where metastasis are
      located). Prior to the surgical resection, a LITT procedure will be performed on one of the
      metastasis. After the surgical resection histological analysis will be elaborated to compare
      the real necrosis volume created by the LITT procedure to the expected predicted volume.
