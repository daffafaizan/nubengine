      esophagogastric junction without prior palliative therapy will be treated with 8 cycles of
      the FLOT scheme (up to 12 cycles if the response is favourable). Prior to enrolment a unique
      and detailed clinical evaluation of the dissemination of the disease will be done which
      includes a differentiated regard of the M-category in the TNM classification. A prospective
      stratification will classify the patients as having either (A) locally advanced, (B) limited
      metastatic, or (C) extensive metastatic disease. In addition, the pharmacogenetic risk
      profile of the patients will be evaluated by a combined analysis of two genetic polymorphisms
      of the metabolism of the applied substances (XPD312, GSTT1). For the assessment of the
      disease, reference regions are examined by CT or MRI scans and if applicable endoscopy prior
      to the start of the study, every 2 months during and after the end of therapy until
      progression of the disease occurs. Evaluation of quality of life (by standard forms like
      EORTC-Q30 and others) is continued after progression. Clinical examinations (blood count,
      assessment of toxicity, anamnesis) is performed every two weeks for evaluation of toxicity
      and application of chemotherapy. After informed consent is given, peripheral blood of the
      patient will be analysed for the pharmacogenetic risk profile. Representative tumor material
      will be analysed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR for the expression of several
      molecular factors.
