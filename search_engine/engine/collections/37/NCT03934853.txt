      positioning in bone, and the facilitation of a well-functioning prosthesis. Surgical
      complications from implant placement in an incorrect location can include damage to adjacent
      teeth, sinus perforations, hemorrhage, buccal plate dehiscence, and nerve damage. In implant
      therapy, dynamic surgical guidance is a new technology used to facilitate accurate and
      efficient implant placement, and to aid in communication between the restorative dentist and
      surgeon.

      The Inliant device is a dynamic surgical navigation system that is based on passive optical
      tracking technology. Passive optical tracking is accomplished by having the patient wear a
      reference body that is identified by an optical tracking system. This information allows the
      clinician to visualize the surgical drill projected onto a screen, showing its position in 3
      dimensions on a CBCT scan of the patient. Dynamic surgical guidance has additional advantages
      over traditional methods in that it allows for intra-operative changes in implant planning,
      and allows the clinician to visualize the position of the surgical drill during the
      procedure.

      The purpose of the present study is to analyze the accuracy of the Inliant device as a method
      of placing dental implants in an actual clinical setting and to confirm its safety.
