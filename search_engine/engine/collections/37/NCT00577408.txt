      of the newly adapted version of Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy for Depot Naltrexone
      (Depot-BNT). Treatment-seeking opiate-dependent patients will be admitted for inpatient
      detoxification and induction onto oral naltrexone. Those who are successfully inducted will
      be randomly assigned for a six month trial to one of two conditions: 1) Behavioral Naltrexone
      Therapy for Depot Naltrexone (Depot-BNT) (N = 30), with the first dose of depot naltrexone
      administered prior to discharge from hospital with monthly doses thereafter; or 2) Behavioral
      Naltrexone Therapy as previously developed for promoting compliance with daily oral
      naltrexone (BNT-Oral) (N = 30). All patients in both groups will be asked to attend twice
      weekly outpatient therapy sessions over a six month course. This design will provide a test
      of whether Depot-BNT produces superior treatment retention and drug use outcome in comparison
      to our established behavioral platform for oral naltrexone, while providing experience upon
      which to base revisions of Depot-BNT prior to embarking upon further Stage 2 testing.
      Treatment will take place at the same sites as for our prior studies: (1) the General
      Clinical Research Unit (GCRU) of New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) and (2) the
      Substance Treatment and Research Service (STARS) of the Division on Substance Abuse at NYSPI.
