    
      We wish to evaluate health related and vision related quality of life (HRQoL, VRQoL) in
      children age 2 to 16 years with childhood glaucoma (CG), childhood cataract (CC) and
      congenital eye defects microphthalmia, anophthalmia or coloboma (MAC).

      We will recruit children who attend the children's eye clinics at Moorfields Eye Hospital at
      City Road. We will include the following subgroups:

      A) children with primary or secondary glaucoma B) children with cataract or previously
      treated for cataract C) children with microphthalmia, anophthalmia or coloboma D) control
      group: agematched children without eye and vision problems. We will ask children and their
      carers to complete two age appropriate, validated questionnaires, the PedsQL (health related
      quality of life) and the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children. From the medical
      notes, we will record diagnosis and best corrected visual acuity with both eyes open. We will
      also record details of previous and current treatment, such as number of previous surgical
      interventions (sum of interventions right and left eye) and number of current topical
      medications (sum of eyedrop applications per day right and left eye).
