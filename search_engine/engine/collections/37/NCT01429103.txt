      perimenopause. Tests of attention, working memory, mental flexibility, processing speed, and
      retentive memory will be administered to each subject at 6 month intervals for 5 years.
      Additionally, women will be asked to fill out questionnaires about their mood, memory
      functioning, health, and quality of life. The investigators will also calculate each
      subject's Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference at each visit. Finally, serum levels
      of reproductive hormones will be taken. Measures of interest will be the percentage of women
      in each group with absolute and relative cognitive deficits, change over time in performance
      on neuropsychological tests and scores on depression and anxiety scales, and correlations
      between cognitive function, mood and hormone level.
