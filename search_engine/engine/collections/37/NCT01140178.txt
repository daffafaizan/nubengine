      with cancer of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx, including lesions of moderate to severe
      dysplasia, squamous carcinoma in situ and T1 squamous cells carcinoma. The study will employ
      a fixed HPPH dose of 4 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour, and 24 hours later light doses escalating
      from 100 J/cm2 to 125 and 140 J/cm2, respectively. The primary goal is the determination of
      the maximally tolerated PDT dose. Preliminary evidence for PDT efficacy wil also be obtained.
