        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of OTI-010 vs placebo as graft-versus-host disease
           prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HLA-identical sibling
           matched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to age (18 to 34 vs 35 to 55) and donor/recipient gender (female
      donor/male recipient vs female donor/female recipient vs male donor/female recipient vs male
      donor/male recipient).

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV once daily on days -5 and -4
           and undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 to -1 OR busulfan IV over 2
           hours every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV once daily on days -3 and
           -2.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
           and 11. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally or IV (over 1-4 hours) twice daily
           beginning on day -1 and continuing for at least 6 months followed by a taper until 1
           year after transplantation.

        -  OTI-010 therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive placebo IV 4 hours before peripheral blood stem cell
                transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive OTI-010 IV 4 hours before PBSCT on day 0.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of OTI-010 IV 4 hours before PBSCT on day
                0.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      Patients are followed at 18 weeks, at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and
      then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients (33 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 months.
