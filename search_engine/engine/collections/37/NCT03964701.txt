    
      Ability and sensitivity of metabolomics analysis to highlight biomarkers or a score of
      biomarkers that will be able to identify those pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis at
      high risk for possible peritoneal dialysis complications and mainly encapsulating peritoneal
      sclerosis. Identification of peritoneal membrane functional status changes over time, at the
      same patient (cohort study), by metabolomics, aiming in personalized medicine best practice.

      Identification of peritoneal membrane functional status changes over time in immature
      infants' peritoneal membrane.

      Identification of early and accurate markers of peritoneal membrane dysfunction when membrane
      status is possibly reversible that could predict peritoneal patients at risk for future loss
      of ultrafiltration and dialysis adequacy of small molecules examined today be PET, KT/V and
      Cr/Cl (when membrane status is not reversible).

      Improve PD survival in infants and children.
