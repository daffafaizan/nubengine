      Approach (ALTA) evaluates the effectiveness of using a quality improvement method called
      practice facilitation (PF) to implement our evidence-based systems-level intervention for
      improving medication adherence and blood pressure control.

      The ALTA intervention focuses on identifying Latinx patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      who are non-adherent to their antihypertensive medication, referring them to health coaches,
      coaching patients on medication adherence and self-management, care planning, and monitoring
      patients to improve patient outcomes.
