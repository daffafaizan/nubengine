      would be started in the early phase of the infection and would protect against both types of
      toxins and all of their variants. The chimeric anti-Shiga toxins 1 (cαStx1) and 2 (cαStx2)
      antibodies are intended to be administered as a single infusion and provide simultaneous
      protection against the two Shiga toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) by decreasing the incidence and
      severity of Shiga toxin-mediated clinical events including bloody diarrhea/hemorrhagic
      colitis and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and associated sequelae.
