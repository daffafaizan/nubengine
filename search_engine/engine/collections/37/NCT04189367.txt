      patients' clinical histories and laboratory examinations. The secondary BMS only includes
      nutritional deficiency, such as Vitamin B12, folate, iron, zinc. At first, the primary BMS
      patients are treated with 0.5~1 mg clonazepam every day before sleep for 8 weeks. The
      secondary BMS patients are treated with vitamin B12, folate, iron and zinc according to the
      patient's nutritional deficiency status. Patients with no improvement or little improvement
      after the first stage of Western medicine management will be arranged to receive traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy. All patients will receive the TCM model, including TCM
      doctor, automatic tongue diagnostic system (ATDS), and body constitutional questionnaire
      (BCQ), evaluations.

      The results of this study are expected to understand whether adjuvant TCM treatment of BMS
      can improve treatment efficacy. The investigators will understand whether the constitution
      pattern may be a predictive indicator of efficacy for western BMS. The investigators will
      find a diagnostic indicator for the TCM model and apply it to the assessment of the prognosis
      of BMS patients.
