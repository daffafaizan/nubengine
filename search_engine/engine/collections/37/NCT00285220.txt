      at the University of Rochester will be selected for study on a voluntary basis. They will
      have a BMI of >35 with at least one obesity related comorbidity or a BMI between 40 and 45.
      Subjects will undergo specific tests of vagal function and baseline metabolic evaluation at
      baseline.

      Thereafter they will undergo a laparoscopic truncal vagotomy. Over 18 months, post operative
      tests of adequate vagotomy, weight loss, change in body composition and metabolism will be
      studied.
