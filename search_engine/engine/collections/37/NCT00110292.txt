      intervention to reduce developmental delay and learning problems in young children. The goal
      is to improve home caregiving environment factors that are often suboptimal in families
      living in poverty; these families are often subject to social, economic, and medical risk
      factors. The intervention is based on a public health/primary care partnership and combines
      mailed parent-completed Ages & Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), a monthly mailed age-paced
      parenting newsletter (Building Blocks) and corresponding developmental toys (BB), and a Reach
      Out and Read (ROR) physician-based distribution of children's books.

      Families of 4- to 7-month-old children attending a participating pediatric clinic will be
      randomized to either an ASQ/BB+ROR group, an ROR-only group, or a no intervention control
      group. Outcomes measures will be obtained at 15, 24, 36, and 48 months of age and include
      measures of the home environment, parenting and parent-child interaction, child language and
      mental development measures, and rates of referral to Early Intervention programs. Baseline
      and ongoing demographic information and psychosocial and biological risk factors will also be
      gathered to see how they relate to child and family outcomes and to determine whether certain
      subgroups of families are more likely to benefit from the intervention than others.
