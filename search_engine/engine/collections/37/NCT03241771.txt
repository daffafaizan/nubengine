    
      This is a randomized study of a web-based naloxone educational resource (Naloxone Navigator
      1.0) for adults prescribed chronic opioid therapy. This study will be conducted under new
      naloxone standing order legislation passed in Colorado. The Naloxone Navigator 1.0 will
      provide online training on how to recognize an opioid overdose and respond using naloxone.
      There will be two arms: one will receive a link to the Naloxone Navigator 1.0 and the other
      will receive usual care (no link). Outcomes will include opioid risk behavior, overdose and
      naloxone knowledge, naloxone dispensings, and overdose rates.
