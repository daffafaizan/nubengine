      without solid research evidence to suport its benefits and costs. The present study is a
      random-controlled study of integrated biomedical and psychosocial treatment on a population
      of recent-onset cases.

      Comparison(s): 50 consecutive referrals with schizophrenic disorders of less than two years
      duration were allocated randomly to a comprehensive model of integrated treatment or standard
      care for two years. Main outcome measures was psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and
