      (individuals and study personnel will not know the identity of study treatments), placebo (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in
      a clinical trial)-controlled study in approximately 400 adult participants with follicular
      lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. The study will include the following phases: Screening,
      Treatment, and a Post-treatment Follow-up. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1 ratio to either treatment Arm A (background immune-chemotherapy + placebo) or treatment
      Arm B (background immune-chemotherapy + 560 milligram [mg] of ibrutinib). All participants
      will receive 6 cycles of background immune-chemotherapy with either BR or R-CHOP in
      combination with either placebo (Arm A) or ibrutinib (Arm B). Selection of background
      immune-chemotherapy will be based on prior treatment history and cardiac function. After
      completion of background immune-chemotherapy, study drug (ibrutinib or placebo) will continue
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end, whichever comes first.
      Assessment of tumor response and progression will be conducted in accordance with the Revised
      Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does
      to the body) blood samples will be collected. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
