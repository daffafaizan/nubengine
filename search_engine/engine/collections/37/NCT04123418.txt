    
      This first-in-human trial with WVT078 is a dose escalation study whose primary purpose is to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine recommended dose regimen(s) of WVT078
      alone and in combination with WHG626 in subjects with MM who have received two or more
      standard of care lines of therapy including an IMID, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38
      agent (if available) and are relapsed and/or refractory to or intolerant of each regimen. In
      addition, this study will assess preliminary anti-MM response of and characterize the
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of WVT078 alone and in combination with WHG626. The
      results of this study will inform the future development of WVT078 alone and in combination
      with WHG626 as a treatment for relapsed and/or refractory MM.
