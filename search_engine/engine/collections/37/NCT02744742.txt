      At present, the best conditioning regimen for MDS and AML secondary to MDS undergoing
      allo-HSCT remains in discussion. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative
      regimen for MDS and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have
      higher relapse rate. To reduce the relapse rate, decitabine is added in the conditioning
      regimen. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of G-CSF +
      Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML
      secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
