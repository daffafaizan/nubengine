      contrast to artificial CO2 baths and to investigate its long-term effectiveness and impact on
      drug consumption.

      Methods: Randomised double-blinded trial with 2 randomised balanced groups enrolling 134
      patients of an in-patient rehabilitative programme (a 3rd non-randomised group of 73
      consecutive patients is not reported here). Outcomes were limitations in occupational
      context/ daily living, pain, functional capacity, morning stiffness and medication measured
      before start, after end of treatment, and quarterly in the year thereafter. Repeated-measures
      analysis of covariance (RM-ANCOVA) of intent-to treat population was performed to investigate
      treatment effects. Hierarchically ordered hypotheses ensured adherence of the nominal
      significance level and allowed examining of long-term effects. Starting with all measures
      until 6 months' follow-up, significant main effects for group allocation (GME) or significant
      group x course-interactions (GxC) were regarded essential to add the next follow-up for
      analysis.

      Results: Radon treatment resulted in significantly lower limitations of daily living over at
      least 9 months whereas reference patients returned to baseline level after 6 months already
      (RM-ANCOVA until 6 months: pGME=.15, pGxC=.016/ 9 months: pGME=.11, pGxC=.025/ 12 months:
      pGME=.17, pGxC=.033). Furthermore, consumption of steroids and NSAID was remarkably reduced
      in the Radon group (RM-ANCOVA until 12 months: for steroids pGME=.064, interaction pGxC=.025,
      maximum difference after 12 months; for NSAID pGME=.035, interaction pGxC=.008, maximum
      difference after 9 months).

      Conclusion: Results suggest beneficial long-term effects of Radon baths as adjunct to a
      multimodal rehabilitative treatment of RA.
