      prospective, international project to evaluate the improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms
      and the quality of life 12 months after surgery in a large consecutive series of STN-DBS PD
      patients using novel implantable Neurostimulator Systems (Boston Scientific). The project
      will investigate if a fine tuning of the STN-DBS settings could alleviate neuropsychiatric
      fluctuations, apathy as well as DBS-induced dysarthria and global motor state. The tuning is
      performed in agreement with the instruction for use of all devices used. Further objectives
      are validation of new tools that are presently entering clinical routine in optimizing
      postoperative management like individual current sources, steering, imaging of volume of
      tissue activated, and beta-oscillations.

      The data originates from patients suffering from levodopa-responsive PD which are not
      adequately controlled by dopaminergic medication and therefore receive STN-DBS as a routine
      standard of care with routinely collected data.

      In total 110 patients who are candidates for STN-DBS will be enrolled in four participating
      sites in Switzerland and the EU.
