      survival and increases treatment complications but prospective well-designed studies are
      lacking.

      This project is an observational cohort study recording outcomes in smokers, never-smokers,
      and ex-smokers, using exhaled carbon monoxide to validate smoking status when they attend for
      further lung cancer clinics.

      This project is unique, as every patient with a clinical diagnosis of lung cancer will have
      their smoking status biologically validated by a quick and easy test, and those enrolled in
      the smoking cessation treatments or not will also complete a generic quality of life
      questionnaire at regular intervals. These appointments will coincide with other hospital
      appointments wherever possible, and survival status will reported up to 24 months after
      enrolment.
