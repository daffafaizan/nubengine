      helping abuse victims access and use elder abuse resolution services. In addition, many
      victims suffer from concurrent mental health problems that prevent them from taking the
      necessary steps to protect themselves. The proposed study will introduce a tailored
      intervention, built on an evidence-based approach (Problem Solving Therapy), to be delivered
      through a sustainable mental health program embedded in elder abuse services. The proposed
      psychotherapy is a brief 8-session weekly intervention that combines problem-solving therapy,
      anxiety management, and psycho education developed specifically for this population by this
      team.

      The objectives of the project are to: identify the mental health needs of elder abuse
      victims, provide the mental health treatment, assess the impact of the treatment, and
      facilitate conditions which will sustain the mental health program.
