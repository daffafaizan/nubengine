      receive 2 vaccine injections intradermally in the thigh given 4 weeks apart. Patients will be
      followed weekly after each vaccine injection and then monthly for 4 months. Patient follow-up
      continues with evaluations at 6 months and 1 year after receiving the first vaccine
      injection. Immunologic responses to the vaccine will be assessed from blood samples obtained
      at each visit following immunizations.
