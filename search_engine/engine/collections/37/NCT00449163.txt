      treatment followed by 1 week of rest and 2 weeks of treatment followed by one week of rest.

      the schedule. There will be no treatment delivered on weeks 3 & 6 (Days 15 and 36).

      Disease will be evaluated by CT scan at the completion of every two cycles. Patients with
      complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), will be evaluated for possible surgical
      resection. Patients who become operable will continue to be evaluated for survival and
      disease relapse. Patients with stable disease (SD), and those with less than pCR after
      surgery should continue chemotherapy until radiographic evidence of tumor progression is
      identified or unacceptable side effects.
