    
      In order to physiologically evaluate a new BC membrane protective garment for the Israeli
      police use under exercise-heat stress conditions, 12 healthy volunteers from the border guard
      will participate in this study.

      The subjects will undergo 4 experiment days: Recruitment day, one day of acclimatization to
      heat, and 2 days of performing experiment protocol, each day dressed with different
      protective garment (Protective garment in current use + NBC mask, new BC membrane protective
      garment + NBC mask).

      Core (rectal) and skin temperature and heart rate will be monitored continuously, liquid
      balance will be recorded.the physiological heat strain will be assessed and compared between
      the different protective garments.
