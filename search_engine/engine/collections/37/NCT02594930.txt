      responsible pathogens. The value of a preoperative biopsy remains controversial. We compared
      the sensitivity and specificity of two techniques of synovial biopsy of knee joint
      arthroplasties suspicious for infection and asked whether the results correlate with
      intraoperative findings at revision.
