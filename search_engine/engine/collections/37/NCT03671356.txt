      registry, clinical outcomes of interventional cardiac catheterization procedures at
      University Hospital DÃ¼sseldorf in a variety of settings (elective and emergency coronary
      procedures, structural and rhythmologic cardiac interventions etc.), will be evaluated.
      Different risk scoring models are recommended for risk stratification by cardiovascular
      societies (e.g. GRACE, CRUSADE, NCDR, ACEF, EUROScore scores) and will be evaluated for their
      applicability to contemporary and local clinical practice in interventional cardiology.
      Risk-adapted safety interventions (e.g. intensified monitoring, vascular access closure,
      renal protective measures) will be applied to all patients and will be evaluated for their
      impact on clinical outcomes.
