      own control. Satiation will be assessed using a Motivation to Eat Questionnaire. Height and
      weight will be measured at the screening visit and weight alone at each subsequent visit.
      Prior to consumption of the test meal (breakfast) and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min
      thereafter, subjects will complete a VAS Motivation to Eat Questionnaire. After subjects
      complete the first VAS motivation questionnaire, they will be given the test meal and
      instructed to eat this over a 15 minute period and fill out a palatability questionnaire. Two
      hours after the start of the test meal they will be taken to a private feeding room, where an
      ad libitum pizza lunch will be served with mineral water. Participants will be instructed to
      eat and drink as much as they desire until they are comfortably full. Subjects will be asked
      to fill out a final VAS Motivation to eat questionnaire 30 min after the start of the pizza
      meal.
