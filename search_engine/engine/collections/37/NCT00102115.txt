      subjects with persistent leaking neovascular membranes in patients with AMD who have a visual
      acuity of 20/200 or less. This is a sequential group dose escalation trial with the cohorts
      defined by increasing the light dose. Within each light-dose cohort, three (3) subjects will
      be treated at a drug dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg.
