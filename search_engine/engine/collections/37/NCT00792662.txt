      sites, UNMC and the Omaha VA Medical Center.

      The subject will be asked to take the study drug in the form of a capsule to be taken twice
      daily. Whether the subject receives methylphenidate or placebo (a pill that has a similar
      appearance to the study drug, but has no medicine) will be determined by random chance. The
      probability that the subject will receive methylphenidate is 1 in every 2 subjects or 50% of
      the time. Subjects receiving methylphenidate will be starting at 5 milligrams (mg) twice
      daily. Dosage will then be increased to 10mg twice daily at 2 weeks.

      After the initial visits, the subjects will be asked to come for follow-up every month for
      the next 4 visits (sixteen weeks total). During each visit subjects will again be asked
      questions to assess their motivation, memory, functional status and quality of life. Blood
      will be drawn and an electrocardiogram (ecg/ekg) will be taken to assess the patient's safety
      twice during the study.

      Partial Compensation may be available for participation.
