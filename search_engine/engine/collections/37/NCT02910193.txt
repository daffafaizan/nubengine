      in an existing sample (NGFNplus) of tightly endophenotyped and genome-wide genotyped alcohol
      dependent subjects (N=240) and controls (N=240); (ii) to translate the results of
      neuroimaging x genetic analyses from an adolescent risk sample (IMAGEN) to adult disease
      (NGFNplus sample) by examining related paradigms tagging the same functional systems in both
      samples; (iii) to conduct a follow-up neuroimaging study on the NGFNplus sample validating
      the neurobehavioral risk profiles predictive for harmful alcohol use in adolescents in adult
      patients with alcohol addiction (iv) to expand the NGFNplus sample by including a new set of
      healthy subjects with high genetic risk (1st degree relatives of patients with alcohol
      addiction). The investigators will do so by using imaging genetic methods that are already
      available and used in other multicenter studies by the investigator's research group (e.g.
      univariate analyses, functional and effective connectivity analyses, polygenetic scores,
      network topology) as well as by using computational algorithms and mathematical models, in
      particular advanced machine learning methods, developed in other sub projects (SPs) of the
      consortium in particular of SP4 and SP6. The investigator's approach will enable the
      researchers to characterize outcome longitudinal in patients with alcohol addiction (5 years
      following our index session) and to complement the NGFN-sample with an add-on study with 1st
      degree relatives that will allow the investigators to test the generalizability of the
      identified predictive risk profiles for early risk identification.
