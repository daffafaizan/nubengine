      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering most closely human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched adenovirus specific T cell lines generated by ex vivo expansion as therapy of
      asymptomatic adenovirus viremia or adenovirus-related disease in immunocompromised hosts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering most closely HLA-matched
      adenovirus specific T cell lines generated by ex vivo expansion as therapy of adenovirus
      viremia or adenovirus-related disease.

      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Within two weeks of enrollment, patients receive allogeneic adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes (CTLs) intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients may receive additional
      allogeneic adenovirus-specific CTL infusions at the discretion of the investigator in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
