      hospitals in Japan. Participants had received artificial nutrition between April 2012 and
      March 2013, were 20 years or older, and did not have cancer. Participants were grouped into
      two groups: those receiving parenteral nutrition and those receiving enteral nutrition. The
      investigators performed one-to-one propensity-score matching between the groups. The primary
      outcome measurements were mortality rates at 30 and 90 days after the start of the procedure.
      The secondary outcomes were post-procedural complications, pneumonia, and sepsis. The
      investigators analyzed survival length of stay after the procedure using a Cox proportional
      hazards model.
