      eligibility first. If eligible and agreed to participate, each participant will be assigned
      to either the experimental group or control group based on the electronic randomization. The
      experimental group will use the plastic ring wound retractor, while the control group will
      use a conventional surgical pad for wound protection method. Each participant will be blind
      to the randomization result because he/she will be under general anesthesia. Once the surgery
      is finished, the patient will be assessed on the surgical wound at postoperative day 1, 7,
      14, 30. Two groups will be compared for the surgical wound infection rate.
