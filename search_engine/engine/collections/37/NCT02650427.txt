      records during a weekly staff meeting. After collection of informed consent, the patients
      will undergo a biopsy of the tumor and of the not-tumoral liver and 2-4 weeks later HCC
      resection.

      The study will include a phase of 3 weeks [± 7 days] administration of sitagliptin as
      monotherapy (taken orally) after liver biopsy and before HCC resection. The window of ± 7
      days is deliberately wide to take in account the variable arrangements made for surgical
      resection. Nevertheless we will make our efforts to focus on a three weeks regimen. Three
      doses of sitagliptin will be used: 1) 100mg/day (dose recommended in the SmCP), 2) 200mg/day
      and 3) 600mg/day; with 5 patients in each group. Arrangements will be made for surgical
      resection upon standard care. Blood samples will be obtained for immunology studies at each
      visit. The study will end one week after surgery (or less if the state of health of the
      patient does not require to stay longer in the hospital). Patients will continue their
      treatment for HCC as prescribed by the clinician.
