    
      Methodology:

      Single-centre, open-label, parallel group, non-randomised multiple-dose 7-day study in 12
      healthy elderly and 12 healthy younger male subjects.

      Duration of treatment:

      Each subject participated in the study for approximately 6 weeks. Participation included a
      screening evaluation within 28 days before inpatient period, a 12 day inpatient period and an
      end of study visit (ESV) 7 to 10 days after the discharge from the Unit.

      The study design followed the recommendations of the CPMP/ICH/379/95 (ICH Topic E7) Note for
      Guidance on Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics, namely in the inclusion of
      subjects aged 65 years or older and contemplating single-dose and steady-state PK profiles.
      As the primary endpoint of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of BIA
      9-1067 and its metabolites in different parallel groups, there was no need to implement
      blinding procedures or to include a control group. Consequently, the trial was an open label
      study. Healthy subjects rather than patients with Parkinson's disease have been chosen as the
      study population, due to the lack of over-toxicity of the drug and an acceptable risk-benefit
      ratio. This allowed for a better interpretation of the study results, as there were no
      confounding factors resulting from changes in disease state and or concomitant medications.

      The subjects were given a screening number after signing the informed consent by
      chronological order of inclusion in each group (young/elderly).
