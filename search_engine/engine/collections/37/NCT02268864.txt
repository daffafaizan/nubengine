    
      This is an open-label (all people know which treatment the participants receive) study to
      investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of simeprevir and daclatasvir in chronic
      Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infected participants who are
      treatment-naive. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 40 weeks
      or approximately 52 weeks. The study will consist of 4 parts: Screening Phase (approximately
      4 weeks) and open-label treatment Phase (12 weeks), optional open label treatment phase
      extension (12 Weeks) and follow-up Phase (up to Week 40 or Week 52). Participants will
      receive simeprevir (150 milligram [mg] capsule) and daclatasvir (60 mg tablet) orally once
      daily for 12 or 24 weeks. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of participants
      with SVR12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
