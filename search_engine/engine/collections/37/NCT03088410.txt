      -uninfected (HIV-) pregnant woman/child dyads in Botswana which will take place in Gaborone,
      Botswana at Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership's (BHPs) clinical research
      facilities. A total of 300 HIV+ pregnant woman/fetus dyads on cART and 150 HIV- pregnant
      woman/fetus dyads will be evaluated for insulin sensitivity and followed through the child's
      3rd birthday. Amongst HEU infants, participants will be randomized at birth 1:1 with 150 to
      receive neonatal AZT prophylaxis and 150 to receive neonatal NVP prophylaxis. Targeted
      metabolomics will be used to assess the role intermediary metabolites in insulin resistance
      and directly assess mitochondrial function using Seahorse XF96e technology. At the time of
      study enrollment, all women must be willing to exclusively breastfeed for the infant's first
      6 months of life. If in utero and neonatal HIV/ARV exposures are found to be associated with
      derangements in intermediary metabolism such that HEU infants are at increased risk for
      insulin resistance by 3 years of age, this would impact screening and prevention strategies
      for diabetes in this vulnerable population and argue for further research to identify
      prenatal and neonatal ARV regimens with superior PMTCT efficacy but minimal adverse metabolic
      consequences.
