    
      Study design: this study used a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      Sixty patients scheduled for a spine surgery will be randomly assigned to two groups.
      Lidocaine group will receive an intravenous bolus injection of lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg before
      intubation, followed by 2 mg/kg/h continuous infusion during the operation. Placebo group
      will receive the same dosage of saline at the same time. Analgesic requirement will be
      monitored using patient-controlled Analgesia (PCA protocol: demand dose is 2 mg of morphine,
      lockout 5 min, maximum dose 15 mg per hour). Forty-eight hours after surgery, we will check
      the morphine consumption in two groups. Quality of recovery after surgery will be assessed
      using Q0R15 questionnaire.
