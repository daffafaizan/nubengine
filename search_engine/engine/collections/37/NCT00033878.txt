      of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practices that draw on Asian and Pacific
      Island cultural traditions of healing to control cancer and its related symptoms. Noni,
      extracted from Morinda citifolia or the Indian mulberry plant, is included in the traditional
      pharmacopoeias of Native Hawaiians, other Pacific Islanders and Asian populations, and has
      been used to treat various diseases for hundreds of years. It is now commonly taken by cancer
      patients based on purported usefulness in the disease although there is little scientific
      evidence to either support or refute these claims. A large marketing enterprise and at least
      eleven different suppliers supports the food supplement's popularity. The broad long range
      objectives which this study will initiate are to define the usefulness of noni extracts for
      cancer patients. The hypothesis to be tested is that noni at a specified dosing provides
      cancer patients with a sufficient benefit to toxicity profile to be useful as a therapeutic.
      Specific aims of this study are: 1. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capsules
      containing 500mg of freeze-dried noni fruit extract. 2. Define toxicities associated with the
      ingestion of noni. 3. Collect preliminary information on the efficacy of noni in respect to
      anti-tumor and symptom control properties to help select specific patients for subsequent
      Phase II studies. 4. Identify chemical constituents of the extract that can be used to
      characterize the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of noni food supplement.
