      functional improvement in patients with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCTs) after
      the administration of a single injection of adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) into
      the partial-thickness rotator cuff tear compared to the administration of a single
      corticosteroid injection into the associated subacromial space.

      The ADRC mixture is generated from the TransposeÂ® RT System, a point-of-care solution for
      extraction of an autologous regenerative cell mixture from the adipose tissue after a
      same-day limited liposuction procedure. A pilot clinical study was recently completed using
      an injection of ADRC compared to a corticosteroid injection for treatment of PTRCTs. Results
      support the initiation of a pivotal study to study the same.
