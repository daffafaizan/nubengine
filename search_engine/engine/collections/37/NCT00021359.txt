      myeloma treated with dexamethasone and isotretinoin. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the changes in serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-6R, and
      C-reactive and IL-6R expression on plasma cells in the bone marrow with response in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 and oral
      isotretinoin daily. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression, insufficient response, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving
      adequate response continue treatment for 2 courses after achieving a plateau of monoclonal
      protein, for a minimum of 6 courses total.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
