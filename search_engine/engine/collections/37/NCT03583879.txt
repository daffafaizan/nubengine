      increases risk of falls. Many people with PD also experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and some progress to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Non-pharmacologic treatments such as
      physical activity and exercise are known to be neuroprotective and may improve cognition,
      mood and overall functioning in PD, but such interventions can be challenging for individuals
      with PD and cognitive impairment to fully participate in. Robotic over-ground exoskeletons
      have the potential to overcome this barrier; however there are no scientific data yet to
      support the use robotic exoskeletons in the PD population or those with mood disorder and/or
      declining cognitive function.

      This therapeutic exploratory trial will fill this gap in knowledge and provide critical data
      for understanding how to integrate exoskeletons into clinical practice for age-related
      movement disorders when cognitive decline is present. Specifically we will test if an 8-week
      functional exercise program (gait, balance, aerobic exercise) using the KEEOGO Rehab(tm)
      exoskeleton can improve mood and cognition, as well as gait and balance, compared to the same
      functional exercise without using the exoskeleton, and a wait-list control (no treatment).
