    
      ISIR is an observational, multicentric registry designed to collect implant and follow-up
      data of consecutive patients implanted with Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (S-ICD).

      A number of about 10 enrolling centers is estimated with an overall number of 400 patients.

      A minimal follow-up of 6 months is required before analyzing clinical outcomes. The data
      analysis will focus on implant outcomes and early, mid and long-term effectiveness of S-ICD
      therapies and safety.
