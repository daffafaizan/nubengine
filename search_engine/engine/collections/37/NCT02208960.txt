      been made on overall under 5 mortality over the past decade, minimal progress has been made
      in reducing neonatal deaths and these now represent about 40% of all deaths in children under
      the age of 5. The majority of neonatal deaths occur in rural areas of developing countries
      and approximately two thirds are due to infection and complications relating to low birth
      weight (LBW) and prematurity. Additionally, more than 200 million children under 5 years old,
      almost all in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), are not fulfilling their developmental
      potential. To date, most neonatal intervention trials in LMIC have focused on reducing
      mortality and little research has been performed on the consequences of severe but non-fatal
      neonatal insults on neurodevelopment (ND). Subsequently, little is known about interventions
      that may reduce the risk of long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

      The first month of life is a critical period in ND in which there is significant
      neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and myelination. Stimulation of the infant's brain during this
      period may have significant downstream positive effects. Development of the growing brain can
      be affected through multiple mechanisms including the same insults that are major causes of
      mortality, namely hypothermia and infection. Reducing the incidence of these insults during
      this period may not only save lives but also save brains and improve ND outcomes.
