      than children born at term. Early experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can
      influence developmental outcomes. Sensorimotor interventions as well as parental engagement
      have been designed with the aim of improving the development of children born preterm.
      Substantial evidence supports the benefits of each intervention on improving developmental
      outcomes. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature on the efficacy of a
      parent administered sensorimotor intervention (PASI) program in the NICU on infant's
      development. The proposed study is designed to evaluate the potential benefits of such a
      program on infant's development. A randomized block clinical trial will be performed.

      A total of 84 preterm infants (< 34 weeks gestation) will be recruited and randomized.
      Infants in the experimental group will receive the sensorimotor program,consisting of tactile
      (whole body) and oral input for 15 minutes, one time per day, for 10 days. Infants in the
      control group will receive standard care. The following outcomes will be monitored time to
      attainment of complete oral feeds (primary outcome), rate of weight gain, length of
      hospitalization, and developmental outcomes at 36 weeks corrected gestational age and at 4,
      8, 12, 18 and 24 months corrected age. Results from this study will provide us with further
      knowledge on the impact of sensorimotor intervention on infants' developmental outcome as
      well as the effect of active parental involvement on infants' development. Provision of a
      PASI program is a safe and low cost effective intervention that may increase the development
      and quality of life of preterm born children and their family.
