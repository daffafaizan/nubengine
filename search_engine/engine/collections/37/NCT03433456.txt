      their children (0-4yo at baseline) enrolled in our home visitation partner in central
      Alabama. Home visitors will be randomly assigned to deliver the home visitation curriculum
      with or without HABITS (an obesity prevention program targeting key eating and activity
      behaviors) as part of their monthly home visits for 12 months. Treatment sessions for
      standard of care or standard + HABITS arms will be facilitated by trained home visitors. If a
      mother or primary caregiver and her child are randomized to participate in the HABITS +
      Standard home visitation curriculum, they will receive ~15 minutes of information,
      activities, and assistance regarding the development of key behaviors relating to obesity
      prevention, which will be imbedded within the existing home visitation curriculum. The HABITS
      program will address habit-formation of four behaviors relevant to mothers or primary
      caregivers and children: (1) limit fried foods; (2) limit sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB);
      (3) increase daily steps; (4) increase fruits and vegetables. Additionally, mothers or
      primary caregivers will also practice habit formation focused on self-monitoring of weight
      and the four behaviors previously mentioned. Skill training will focus on habit formation and
      home environment modification conducive to the four behaviors.

      Mothers or primary caregivers in the intervention group will be provided the HABITS +
      standard home visitation program for 12 months, while those in the control group will be
      provided the standard home visitation program during this time. Treatment in the control arm
      includes the content and services typically provided by the home visitation partner, which is
      focused on promoting caregiver and child health by providing screenings and referrals,
      encouraging smoking cessation, promoting safe sleep practices, and strengthening children's
      school readiness and achievement, social/emotional and physical development.
