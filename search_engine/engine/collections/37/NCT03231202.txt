      trauma patients with Organ Injury Scale (OIS) grade 4 or 5 blunt splenic injuries, undergoing
      SAE or observation only until day 7 post injury. Only hemodynamically normal patients will be
      considered for enrolment into the study, and written informed consent from the patient is
      required.

      CONTROL The control arm in this randomized controlled trial will include only NOM patients
      diagnosed with splenic injuries OIS grade 4 or 5 and suitable for observation alone, and will
      comprise clinical observation according to local routines and protocols. The patients will be
      observed with special focus on delayed bleeding and failure of NOM. A contrast enhanced US or
      CT scan with arterial phase will be performed on day 3-5 to exclude PSA. On day 7, the
      decision to perform SAE, splenectomy or continue NOM is left to the discretion of each
      participating institution, and registered in the case report form (CRF).

      INTERVENTION The intervention arm will perform SAE as a central embolization of the splenic
      artery.

      Additional peripheral embolization is left to the discretion of the interventional
      radiologist.

      Each institution decides whether patients in the SAE group are to undergo immunization or
      not. The study does not interfere with local diagnostic work-up and treatment protocols.

      We hypothesize that the use of pre-emptive SAE will decrease the delayed bleeding rate and
      increase the success rate of NOM leading to fewer splenectomies in this group of patients
      without concomitant increased complication rates. Additionally, we want to explore the
      effects of pre-emptive SAE vs observation alone on all cause failure rate, operative
      procedures, repeat angiography rate, complications, critical care stay, and mortality.
