      receive guideline-recommended screening for cervical, breast, and colon cancer. Family
      physicians can play a critical role in successfully increasing screening rates. A recent
      evaluation by members of our team suggests that Screening Activity Report (SAR) use is
      associated with improved cancer screening, but there remains substantial room for
      improvement. For the SAR to reach its full potential to decrease cancer-related death by
      improving screening rates, family physicians must regularly access it and take the
      appropriate actions. Currently, family physicians receive monthly email reminders, which
      state that new data are available, but do not describe the benefits of the SAR for physicians
      or their patients. It is easy to imagine how a busy doctor would fail to act upon such
      emails, resulting in suboptimal use of the SAR and leading to avoidable delays in cancer
      screening, and management. Indeed, CCO data show that less than half of recipients attend to
      this email and <7% click through to the SAR. The objectives for this trial are to compare
      different versions of the reminders in a randomized trial to identify the features that most
      increase use of the SAR. This is a pragmatic, 2^3 factorial trial, comparing behaviour change
      techniques incorporated within email reminders to doctors increase their use of the SAR.
      Participants are those who are already sent monthly emails by CCO regarding the SAR. The
      trial will randomly assign participants to one of eight modified emails to determine which
      content is most effective at driving SAR-use over 4 months. With an expected sample size of
      over 5700 family physicians, we anticipate power to see differences of 3% across experimental
      conditions.
