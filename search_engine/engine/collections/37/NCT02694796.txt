      tools to assist chronic patients in their disease's management. they are also considering as
      promising tools to help patients to change their lifestyle behavior.

      balneotherapy, to increase or maintain their physical activity level in the long term to
      reach the national recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.

      Patients will be randomized either in the intervention group or in the control group.

      The intervention group will participate in a workshop during the balneotherapy providing them
      informations about physical activity and also about the way to use the web and
      smartphone-based physical activity program along with the use of the connected devices (scale
      and pedometer). After the end of the balneotherapy, the intervention group will have access
      to the web and smartphone-based physical activity program during 12 months.

      The control group will receive a booklet including informations about physical activity
