      used in the treatment of ALL. This formulation of the drug can be given intrathecally (into
      the spinal fluid), and is released slowly over a longer period, about two weeks. This allows
      a longer exposure of the drug to the central nervous system, and requires fewer intrathecal
      injections for the patient.
