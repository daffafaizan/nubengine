      potentiate and broaden the spectrum of activity of azole antifungal agents in vitro,
      especially fluconazole. MGCD290 taken together with fluconazole was observed to be safe in
      healthy volunteer studies. The current study is evaluating both the efficacy and safety of
      the combination treatment in subjects with moderate to severe vulvovaginal candidiasis.
