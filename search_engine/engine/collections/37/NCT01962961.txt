      malondialdehyde (MDA), circulating levels of F2-isoprostanes, and flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD) of the brachial artery in older HIV-infected adults already receiving virologically
      suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) who are then randomized to either NAC 900 mg twice
      daily, NAC 1800 mg twice daily, or placebo. The relative efficacy and safety of these two
      doses of NAC will be assessed.
