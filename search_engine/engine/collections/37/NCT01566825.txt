      memory - the memory of skills and habits. Many antidepressants strongly suppress REM sleep,
      however, and procedural memory consolidation has been shown to be impaired in depressed
      patients on antidepressant therapy. As a result, it is important to determine whether
      antidepressive therapy can lead to amnestic impairment. We thus investigate the effects of
      the anticholinergic antidepressant amitriptyline on sleep-dependent memory consolidation in
      32 healthy men in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel-group study.
