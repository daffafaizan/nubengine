        -  Compare the effect of isoflavones vs lycopene prior to radical prostatectomy on
           intermediate biomarkers (e.g., indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis) in patients
           with localized prostate cancer.

        -  Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on increases in plasma levels and
           tissue levels of these agents in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in surrogate markers of
           disease progression (e.g., prostate-specific antigen levels) in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in serum steroid
           hormones, estradiol, and free testosterone in these patients.

        -  Compare the magnitude of these changes in patients treated with these nutritional
           supplements vs patients in the control group.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia. Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
