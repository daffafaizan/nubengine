      II-III obese parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean
      delivery under spinal anesthesia. The study subjects will be assigned to 2 equal groups. In
      the ultrasonography group, lumbar spinal ultrasonography will be performed before
      administration of spinal anesthesia. In the palpation group, conventional palpation of the
      anatomical landmarks will be performed.
