        -  To obtain epidemiological information and biological material on a population-based
           series of prostate cancer cases.

        -  To identify novel cancer susceptibility genes by comparison of genotype frequencies in
           cases with the corresponding frequencies in large control series.

        -  To estimate the age and sex-specific risks associated with variants in predisposition
           genes.

        -  To evaluate interactions between polymorphisms in predisposition genes and potential
           lifestyle risk factors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete a detailed epidemiological questionnaire, including information on
      education, occupation, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, height, weight, family history of
      cancer, and past medical history.

      Blood samples are collected from patients. DNA is extracted from these blood samples and from
      samples collected from cancer-free control participants in MREC-SEARCH-CONTROL as well as
      from additional controls through the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)
      study (a population based study of diet and health based in Norfolk, East Anglia). DNA
      samples are analyzed for polymorphisms of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes.

      In addition to the prostate cancer patients recruited for this study, patients with breast,
      ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, brain and esophageal cancer,
      malignant melanoma, and lymphoma cancer are recruited in the following related clinical
      trials: MREC-SEARCH-BREAST, MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN, MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL,
      MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL, and MREC-SEARCH-CANCER.
