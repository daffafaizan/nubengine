      practice under a wide range of treatment parameters variability including RF energy, laser
      fluence, and laser pulse duration for treating each of the vascular disorders. This will be
      conducted by documenting the physician selected treatment parameters, as well as the
      subjects' clinical clearing response, perception of improvement and sensations, through the
      study treatments and post-treatment(s) follow-up visits.

      Optional exploratory objectives: Collection of safety and efficacy data of the Velos with DCD
      cooling and Velos with contact cooling. The investigator may opt to include in this study
      noninvasive measurements of erythema, melanin and texture (which may be performed by eg.
      Chromameter, Mexameter or 3D imaging), and measurements of linear vessel diameters and lesion
      size.
