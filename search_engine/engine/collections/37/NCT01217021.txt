    
      This is a phase 0, open-label, single-center, non-randomized single dose study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of MNI-558 PET imaging in detecting amyloid beta plaque in the brain in
      patients with probable AD compared to HVs. All aspects related to image acquisition,
      processing and visual as well as quantitative evaluation will be developed, optimized and
      validated (where required).

      Each subject will be required to visit the study center during the screening phase, on the
      MNI-558 PET imaging day (baseline), and for 1 follow-up visit on the next day. A telephone
      follow-up visit will be performed 7 days after MNI-558 PET administration.

      At the screening visit, each subject and the caregiver will be asked to provide written
      informed consent or assent. During the screening phase (maximum duration - 28 days) subject
      medical, neurological and surgical history, clinical assessments and a neuro-psychiatric
      evaluation will be performed on all eligible subjects. Subjects will be allowed to leave the
      center after all evaluations have been completed. During this period an MRI of the brain must
      be performed. During the MNI-558 PET imaging day, all subjects will receive a single IV
      injection of IMP and scanning will be performed from 0-60 min, 75-135 min, and 150-210 min
      (p.i). Each subject will be asked to return to the site for a follow-up visit (20 to 28 hours
      after IMP administration) and a telephone follow-up will occur 7 days thereafter. Safety will
      be assessed during both follow-up visits.
