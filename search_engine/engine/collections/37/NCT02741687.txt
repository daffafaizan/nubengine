      in response to surgery or illness). High glucose is linked to an increased risk of hospital
      complications including wound infection, kidney failure and death. Patients with high glucose
      are treated with insulin given through an arm vein or by frequent insulin injections under
      the skin. Recent studies have found that inpatient therapy with oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4
      inhibitor (DPP4-I) is an effective alternative to insulin in improving glycemic control with
      low risk of hypoglycemia in general medicine and surgical patients.

      Sitagliptin is an oral medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients with diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine whether treatment with
      sitagliptin once daily can prevent the development of stress hyperglycemia during the
      postoperative period in non-diabetic patients undergoing general surgery.
