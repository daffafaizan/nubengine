      received total hip replacement or total knee replacement two to four weeks before. The
      participants will be randomly assigned to the isokinetic training group or the isotonic
      training group. Outcome measures including isometric peak torque of hip/knee at 90 degree of
      flexion, peak torque of hip/knee at angular velocity of 60 degree/s and 120 degree/s, Short
      Form 36 (SF-36), the Timed Up and Go test, the Oxford Hip/knee Score, the plasma
      concentration of hsCRP, and the level of substance P in saliva will be collected at the
      beginning and 4 weeks after the training program. Statistical significant differences will be
      determined between the
