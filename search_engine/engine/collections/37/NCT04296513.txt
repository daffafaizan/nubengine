      post-processing of the reflection afterwards creates images yielding the virtual
      chromoendoscopic image. Emission of white light alone causes a potential limitation for the
      current I-SCAN™ technology to obtain high-quality images of microvascular patterns on the
      mucosal surface compared to narrow band imaging (NBI) with optical magnification.

      Pentax Medical (HOYA, Tokyo, Japan) developed the Optical Enhancement™ (OE) System, which
      combines bandwidth-limited light with an endoscopy video system. The OE System combines
      digital signal processing with optical filters that limit the spectral characteristics of the
      illuminating light, connecting the peaks of the hemoglobin absorption spectrum (415 nm, 540
      nm, and 570 nm) to create a continuous wavelength spectrum. This system has two modes that
      use different filters to optimize the visualization of specific features. Mode 1 is designed
      to improve visualization of microvessels with enough light. Mode 2 is designed to improve
      contrast of white-light observation by bringing the color tone of the overall image closer to
      that of natural color (white color tone) with more light than Mode 1 filter.

      In addition, high definition optical magnification endoscopes have been developed and can
      combine high-definition imaging with optical magnification to produce detailed images with
      magnification of up to 136×. This imaging technique facilitates the evaluation of the
      superficial vascular aspects of the mucosa, enabling the identification of early signs of
      inflammation or lesions not previously seen with conventional endoscopy.
