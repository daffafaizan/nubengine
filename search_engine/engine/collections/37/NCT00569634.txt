      status, reducing the need for frequent invasive arterial sampling. The objective of this
      study is to examine the agreement between ABG and VBG samples for all commonly used
      parameters (pH, pCO2 and bicarbonate) in a pathologically diverse ICU patient population,
      specifically analyzing multiple paired arterial and venous samples from each patient.
