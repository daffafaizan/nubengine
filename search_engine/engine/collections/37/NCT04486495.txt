      patients, who are treated with NST (chemotherapy and Â± immunotherapy), in order to gain
      insight in the oncologic safety and impact on QoL of less and more invasive axillary staging
      and treatment strategies.

      Patients who are included in this study will complete Patient Reported Outcome Measures
      (PROMs) at baseline (time of diagnosis), and 1 and 5 years after diagnosis to assess impact
      on QoL.

      A database will be built by the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Data on patient-, tumor-,
      pre-NST staging-, post-NST staging- and treatment-characteristics will be retrieved from
      patients' records by trained data registrars of the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer
      Organisation (IKNL) using electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Five-year survival and
      recurrence will be evaluated to determine oncologic safety.

      The results will be incorporated in the national guidelines. In case of an equilibrium
      between less and more invasive strategies, the data of this study will at least be extremely
      suitable to be used in the shared decision making process.
