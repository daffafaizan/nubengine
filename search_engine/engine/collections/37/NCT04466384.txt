      evaluate the relationship between BIS™ and anesthetic regimens. The subjects will receive two
      regimens of anesthesia with different drug combinations, with at least a 1-week washout
      period between regimens. Subjects will be sequentially assigned to start with either Propofol
      (P) or Propofol with 4 ng/ml of Remifentanil (R) regimens while BIS™ bilateral sensor placed
      on the subject's forehead. The Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S)
      scale, refer to Appendix A, will be used to measure the level of alertness in sedated
      subjects with Tetanic Electrical Stimulation (TES) being used once subjects reach a MOAA/S
      score <2.
