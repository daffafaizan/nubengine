    
      This is an observational and prospective study in which patients aged 18-50 years classified
      as ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) I and II, body mass index below 35 and who
      will undergo cholecystectomy will be included. Patients will be allocated to two groups based
      on the neuromuscular blocker used by the anesthesiologist who participates in the surgery, ie
      in group C patients will participate in the administration of cisatracurium and the group R
      will consist of the patients in whom rocuronium was administered. General anesthesia and
      assessment of muscle function will be performed by measuring the four-stimulus sequence (SQE)
      / train of four (TOF) at pre-established times. A residual neuromuscular block is considered
      to be the patient presenting the value of the four-stimulus sequence of T4 / T1 of less than
      0.9.
