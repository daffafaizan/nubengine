      developed countries. In the choice of antibacterial agents used to treat CAP,
      fluoroquinolones have received considerable attention because of their wide spectrum of
      bactericidal activity. TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin), a non-fluorinated quinolone (NFQ), is a
      selective bacterial topoisomerase inhibitor. This study will test the safety and efficacy of
      TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin) compared with Levofloxacin in adult patients with Community-Aquired
      Pneumonia (CAP).

      Besides,the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of nemonoxacin in adult patients with CAP after
      continuous oral administration and determine the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD).
