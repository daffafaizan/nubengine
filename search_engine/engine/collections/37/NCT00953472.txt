      an endocrine organ as well as a pump. The heart synthesizes and secretes two peptide hormones
      - atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) - that are endogenous
      ligands for a particulate guanylyl cyclase receptor (NPR-A). Following receptor binding and
      generation of its second messenger cGMP, the natriuretic peptides (NPs) mediate biological
      actions which include natriuresis, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and
      vasodilatation with local autocrine and paracrine actions in the heart to include inhibition
      of fibrosis and enhancement of diastolic function.

      Hypertension remains a global burden in cardiovascular disease leading to stroke, myocardial
      infarction and heart failure. Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical
      load on the heart. Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting
      myocardial stretch, ANP and BNP synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of
      optimal cardiorenal and blood pressure homeostasis.
