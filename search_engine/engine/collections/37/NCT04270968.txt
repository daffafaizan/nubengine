      of neck pain, loss of sensation, and decreased range of motion. Extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy (ESWT) is one of the treatment options used for patients with myofascial pain
      syndrome through elimination of ischemia and modulation of vasoneuroactive substance (two
      major causes of trigger pathophysiology) and mechanical transduction as a cellular response
      to external stimulation. the aim of this study was to investigate efficacy of extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy (ESWT) on cervical myofascial pain following neck dissection surgery.
