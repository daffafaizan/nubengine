    
      This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, single-center, phase II trial. A total
      of 30 patients will be included during a period of 2 years.

      The study will be initiated with a non-randomized, feasibility stage including ten patients
      who will be treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel, in order to determine the safety of
      metastatic tumor biopsies during therapy with bevacizumab.

      In the second phase, patients will be randomized (1:1) between two treatment arms: A.
      Bevacizumab + paclitaxel and B. Paclitaxel
