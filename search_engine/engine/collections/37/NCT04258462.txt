    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To investigate the correlation between hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate-to-lactate
           conversion, as measured by lactate/pyruvate ratio, and renal tumor histology (benign
           renal tumors versus renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)) and grade (low versus high grade in
           cases of RCCs).

        2. To investigate the correlation between HP 13C pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, as
           measured by the apparent rate constant kPL, and renal tumor histology (benign renal
           tumors versus renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)) and grade (low versus high grade in cases of
           RCCs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the reproducibility of HP 13C pyruvate MRI in patients who undergo an
           optional second HP 13C pyruvate MRI.

        2. To investigate the association between HP markers (peak lactate/pyruvate, lactate
           /pyruvate AUC, kPL, ADClac) and tissue-based markers including LDHA expression and LDH
           activity, and Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expression on tumor tissues from
           surgical specimen or from biopsy.

        3. To determine the safety of HP 13C pyruvate in renal tumor patients

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HP 13C pyruvate intravenously (IV) and then undergo 13C MRI scan 1-2 minutes
      post HP 13C pyruvate injection. Patients may receive an optional second HP 13C pyruvate
      injection and undergo 13C pyruvate MRI scan 15 to 60 minutes following completion of the
      first scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 minutes.
