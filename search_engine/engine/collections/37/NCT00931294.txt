      a psychosomatic condition (Irritable Bowel syndrome - IBS). A group of IBS patients were
      randomized to choir singing or an information group were followed during one year with
      biological and psychosocial assessments. The choir group participated in various relaxation,
      breathing and vocal exercises with the choir leader, and received the material "To live with
      IBS" for home studies. At the same time a comparison group with IBS patients meet in groups,
      studying and discussing on the same materials under the direction of a group leader. Both
      groups meet once per week.
