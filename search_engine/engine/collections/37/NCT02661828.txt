      and not limited to worsened mood, irritability/agitation, anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and
      headache), the aim of this study is to compare the tolerance of two tapering regimens with
      the hypothesis that tapering the antidepressant dose over the course of two weeks will yield
      less discontinuation symptoms than a one week taper regimen. Additionally, it is suspected
      that discontinuing medications that inhibit the serotonin transporter , such as selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)
      will have a greater difference in the frequency of discontinuation symptoms between the two
      and one-week tapering regimens versus antidepressants that don't inhibit serotonin
      transporter.

      Demographic and clinical features will also be identified that may predict discontinuation
      symptoms with the hypothesis that patients on SSRIs and SNRIs may experience more
      discontinuation symptoms versus patients on non-SSRI/SNRI medications. Whether or not the
      treatment duration is positively associated with the number of discontinuation symptoms will
      also be determined.
