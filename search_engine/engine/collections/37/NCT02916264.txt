      patients scheduled to have a Mayfield head-holder insertion for supratentorial craniotomy
      Intervention is a scalp block prior to a Mayfield head holder insertion. Comparison is 'no
      scalp block' Outcome is surgical plethysmographic index (SPI) responses during/after a
      Mayfield head holder insertion Sample size includes 30 cases (15 cases per arm)

      The eligible neurosurgical patients will be randomly allocated, by a concealed randomization
      process, to receive or not to receive a scalp block after induction and intubation with
      propofol/fentanyl and cisatracurium. Surgical plethysmographic index, direct arterial blood
      pressure, heart rate (EEG), End tidal Carbondioxide, Bispectral/entropy (40-60) will be
      recorded every one minute before/after induction and intubation, before/after the scalp
      block, and before/after the Mayfield head-holder insertion. The Mayfield head-holder
      insertion will be performed by a neurosurgeon who will be blinded to the allocated groups.

      Data analysis is performed to compare the change of SPI during and after the Mayfield
      head-holder insertion from the baseline in both groups by using repeated measure ANOVA at the
      significant level of 0.05.
