      for safety purposes against the risk of tissue hypoxia that may develop during surgery due to
      CPB use. At the level of hyperoxemia, there are opinions that the ischemia-reperfusion damage
      increases with the follow-up of CABG surgery, microcirculation is impaired and tissue
      oxygenation is impaired due to the resulting hyperoxemic vasoconstriction. Recent research
      has focused on evaluating optimal oxygen levels in CPB during cardiac surgery. However, the
      potential of tightly regulated intraoperative normoxia to improve POCD following cardiac
      surgery has not been studied prospectively.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who underwent CPB and CABG, which
      were preserved under normoxic conditions during the intraoperative period, would have a lower
      incidence of early and late POCD than those exposed to hyperoxia.
