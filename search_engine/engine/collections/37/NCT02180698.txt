      I. To evaluate the safety of weekly injections of GLA-SE (TLR4 agonist GLA-SE) in combination
      with palliative radiation in patients with metastatic sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To look for preliminary evidence of efficacy at distant tumor sites following the
      combination of radiation and intra-tumor injection of GLA-SE.

      II. To analyze changes in tumor-immune infiltrates following radiation and intra-tumor
      injection of GLA-SE.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TLR4 agonist GLA-SE.

      Patients receive TLR4 agonist GLA-SE intratumorally once weekly for 8 weeks. Within 2 weeks
      of starting treatment, patients also undergo radiation therapy over 2 weeks for a total of
      5-6 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 6 months and
      then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
