      MAT adherence by first refining and piloting CM and BMI+SFAS adherence approaches, then
      conducting a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to assess sequential,
      individual, and combined effects across MAT initiation and maintenance.

      In order to tailor treatment to individual's needs, we propose the following sequential
      multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART): In stage 1, participants are individually
      randomized (1:1) to BMI+SFAS or CM. Adherent buprenorphine-naloxone participants complete
      treatment in the arm they were originally assigned to, but non-adherent participants are
      re-randomized (1:1) to either switch to the other intervention or add the other intervention
      in this part-factorial SMART.
