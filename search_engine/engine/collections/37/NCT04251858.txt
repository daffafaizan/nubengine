      treatment on individuals who practice physical activities through physical parameters of
      strength, speed and resistance. According to an initial survey, about 120 individuals should
      be examined. Clinical parameters such as decayed, lost and / or filled dental index and
      periodontal parameters such as probing depth (PS), clinical level of insertion (NCI), plaque
      index (IP) and bleeding index (IS) will be evaluated . Physical tests of strength, speed and
      resistance should be performed and periodontal therapy should be performed according to the
      needs presented by each individual. After 90 days, new clinical examinations and physical
      tests should be performed. The results obtained should be tabulated and analyzed. The
      investigators believe that individuals with oral inflammation / infection, the physical
      performance should be higher after performing periodontal therapy. Pro inflammatory cytokines
      present in high concentrations in the presence of periodontal disease can influence fatigue
      and difficulty in recovering from injuries, variables so important in an athlete's life.
