      surgeons, especially given that more and more patients with ground glass nodules are being
      detected recently. One of the most significant current discussion concerning wedge resection
      is nodule localization. At present, a commonly used localization method is the CT-guided
      percutaneous lung puncture methylene blue staining marker localization, but this method has
      two main disadvantages: 1. the methylene blue dye is easy to spread, affecting the
      intraoperative judgment of nodule position by surgeon; 2. patients often suffer additional CT
      radiation. Mixed reality (MR) technique aims to enhance the simple self-visual effect and
      facilitate visualization of the surrounding environment in any situation. The
      three-dimensional model can be visualized by MR technique through MR glasses. Investigators
      project a three-dimensional reconstructed image of the patient's chest through MR glasses,
      then overlay the virtual chest with the actual chest, and then use this as a guide for
      percutaneous lung puncture localization. At the same time, investigators design an
      three-dimensional printing navigational template based on the 3D reconstruction model and
      place it on the surface of the body to help to guide the localization. This study is designed
      to evaluates the viability and accuracy of preoperative mixed reality technique combined with
      3D printing navigational template guided localizing pulmonary nodules.
