      neurologic changes treated at the Armenia Republican Medical Center. Male and Female patients
      over the age of 18 will be eligible for enrollment into the study. Eligible patients or their
      legally authorized representative (LAR) will be approached for consent to participate in the
      study. An initial recording session using the HeadSense HS-1000 device will be obtained upon
      admission to the hospital. During the admission, 2-4 additional recording sessions with the
      HS-1000 will be completed.

      The end-point of the study is to collect up to 30-minute recording with up to 5 sessions of
      adequate quality for analysis from up to 200 subjects. This data will be correlated with
      clinical findings obtained during the patient's diagnosis and treatment course. An
      ease-of-use questionnaire will be administered to the HS-1000 device operator(s) to obtain
      information regarding the function and workflow aspects of using the HS-1000 in an acute
      setting to improve assessment, diagnosis and treatment after stroke. The data obtained from
      the HS-1000 recordings will be analyzed to establish specific waveform patterns correlated
      with brain physiology after stroke.
