      where people meet new sexual partners is probably more effective in reducing the transmission
      rate of HIV than targeting interventions just at perceived high risk groups. A survey
      conducted in 2005 in places where people met new sexual partners in Livingstone found that
      guests socializing there were engaging in high risk sex, but condoms were not always
      available in the venues. In this intervention study, youth peer educators will distribute
      condoms and demonstrate condom use in venues where people meet new sexual partners. After the
      intervention has run for a year, condom use among guests socializing in such venues in the
      intervention township will be compared with condom use among people socializing in similar
      venues in a comparison township.
