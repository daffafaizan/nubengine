      our understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the adverse effects of cocaine is
      far from complete. Our previous studies in cocaine-naive human subjects have demonstrated
      that intranasal cocaine acutely stimulates the human cardiovascular system by a novel central
      mechanism of action.We are currently investigating a central sympatholytic
      drug,dexmedetomidine, in reversing the sympathomimetic effects (increase in blood pressure,
      heart rate and coronary vasoconstriction) of intranasal cocaine.This drug may be a new
      pharmacologic agent in the treatment of acute cocaine intoxication in humans.
