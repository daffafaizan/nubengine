      provider where a DNA sample has been collected; the medical history and medications at the
      time the DNA sample was collected; the date of the DNA pathway testing and the results. The
      study will collect and assess the patient data where the healthcare provider has explained
      the results of the DNA testing to the patient and made applicable changes in the healthcare
      plan based on the DNA pathway results. Patients will have returned to the healthcare provider
      after a minimum of ninety (90) days for follow-up to assess the outcome of the care plan
      changes started after the DNA results provided. This study will collect the healthcare
      provider will provide the outcomes of the healthcare plan changes.
