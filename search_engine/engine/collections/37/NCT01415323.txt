      The Br√∏set Violence Checklist) measuring agitation at admittance and day three thus providing
      a measurement of the differences during three days of in-patient stay. Therapeutic measures
      and interventions taken are assessed daily with a 18-item checklist. Threatening and violent
      incidents are recorded with The SOAS-R.

      Blood samples for immunological parameters are taken at admittance and discharge giving
      opportunity to assess changes through the acute psychiatric condition. Urine and blood
      samples are taken at admittance to assess substance use and medications.

      The patients are assess with two self-rating VAS-scales at discharge assessing the suicidal
      intentions they have had during the stay, aspects of clinical history and assessment for
      personality disorders.
