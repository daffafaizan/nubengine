      Network (DPBRN) dentist used to diagnose and treat caries lesions. The aims of the
      "Assessment of caries diagnosis and caries treatment" study were to: (1) quantify the
      percentages of DPBRN dentists who reported using selected methods for caries diagnosis; (2)
      quantify the percentage of DPBRN dentists who reported using a caries-risk assessment
      protocol of any variety; (3) quantify the percentages of DPBRN dentists who reported
      intervening surgically at carious states E1, E2, D1, D2, or D3; and (4) test the hypothesis
      that reported use of a caries-risk assessment protocol was associated with a higher
      likelihood of reporting use of a preventive program.

      The aims were met by enrolling at least 200 DPBRN practitioner-investigators in the study,
      each of whom completed a 10-page questionnaire about caries diagnosis and treatment
      assessment. Findings from "Assessment of Caries diagnosis and caries treatment" study will be
      related to treatment that is actually delivered as determined in "Reasons for placing the
      first restoration on permanent tooth surfaces" study and "Reasons for replacement or repair
      of dental restorations" study. This group of three studies will lay a critical foundation for
      subsequent intervention studies designed to move the latest scientific advances about caries
      diagnosis and treatment into daily clinical practice.
