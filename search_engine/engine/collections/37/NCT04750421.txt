      intravascular injection. For the purpose of randomization, patients were asked to choose a
      sealed envelope. Inside the envelope was a piece of paper indicating on which side of the
      face (right or left) the transillumination would be used.

      For each filler injection, transillumination was used on one side; on the other side of the
      face, the injection was administered without the use of any vascular exploration method.
      After the vessels had been located on the side chosen for the transillumination technique, a
      skin-marker pencil was used to draw the vascular mapping of the upper part of the face, which
      in our opinion represented the area most at risk of complications, the middle and the lower
      parts of the face.

      Then ice was applied on both sides of the face for 15 s before to proceed with the injections
      in order to cause vasoconstriction and to further decrease the risk of an intravascular
      injection.Transillumination sensitivity for locating the vessels of the face was assessed.
