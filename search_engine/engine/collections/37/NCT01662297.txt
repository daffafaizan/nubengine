      study based on their prescription of quetiapine. Potentially eligible subjects will be
      contacted by the research team. Subjects will answer a brief questionnaire about their
      experience with the medication quetiapine as used for insomnia. If subjects are interested in
      participated in part II, the clinical trial portion of the study, they will be further
      screened for eligibility.

      Part II consists of a 4 week clinical trial in which subjects are randomized to stay on
      quetiapine or switch to trazodone, all of which will be open-label. Subjects will be
      evaluated for symptoms of sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. subjects will also
      be assessed for changes in mood, and alcohol/drug use. After the initial 4 week treatment
      period, subjects on trazodone can choose to switch back to quetiapine or continue on
      trazodone. Subjects will also be evaluated after an additional 4 weeks (8weeks from start of
      the study) on outcome measures.
