      psychological/emotional well being, and social functioning in ovarian germ cell cancer
      survivors vs a matched healthy control group. II. Predict quality of life in these patients
      through the additive effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, sociodemographic
      characteristics, other stressors, and social network variables.

      OUTLINE: Patients identify up to 3 healthy acquaintance controls within 3 years of the same
      age. Patients and controls complete a written questionnaire, which takes about 30 minutes,
      and a telephone interview, which takes about 1 hour, to assess quality of life.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 190 patients and 190 healthy controls will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
