    
      Worldwide, the incidence of heart valve disease is increasing. Improved surgical techniques,
      rising age and possibility for re-operation leads to a rising number of patients having heart
      valve surgery. The gap between hospital discharge and returning to normal life is obvious.
      Integrated rehabilitation could probably reduce hospital readmissions, increase physical
      capacity and increase self-rated mental health and quality of life. Therefore the aim of this
      study is to explore if patients after heart valve surgery will benefit from an integrated
      rehabilitation programme consisting of physical exercise and psycho-educational intervention.

      A randomized clinical trial is conducted to investigate the effect and meaning of an
      integrated rehabilitation programme on the physical and psychosocial functioning of patients
      after heart valve surgery. The trial is a parallel arm design.

      A mixed methods embedded experimental design is chosen to include both quantitative and
      qualitative data to evaluate the intervention. The intervention consists of five
      psycho-educational consultations provided by specialized nurses and a twelve week
      individualized exercise training programme provided by physiotherapists. A qualitative
      post-intervention study will explore rehabilitation participation experiences.

      Along with the above stated hypothesis, it will be observed whether integrated rehabilitation
      can reduce anxiety, depression, health care utilisation, mortality and work cessation.

      210 patients will be included.

      Validated questionnaires (e.g. SF-36), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6 minute walking
      test, echocardiography, cardiac-specific biomarkers and qualitative interviews will be used
      to evaluate the effect and meaning of the programme.
