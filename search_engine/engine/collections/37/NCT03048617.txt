    
      An observational study of patients with presumed Primary Mitochondrial Disease designed to
      better characterize and correlate symptoms and signs of myopathy and genetic test results and
      the use of commonly prescribed treatments. The study will help define and identify a subject
      population for a future trial of an investigational product to treat primary mitochondrial
      disease associated with signs and symptoms of myopathy.
