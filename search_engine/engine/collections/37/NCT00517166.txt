      with subgroup analyses. This project meets the criteria of research with its intent to
      publish. No data is generated and only existing data are used. No interventions are made and
      the comparisons will be with within subgroups in the cohort.

      Aim 1. Describe the number of tourniquets which were appropriately used (wound required a
      tourniquet and tourniquet was placed properly) as assessed by treating physician

      Aim 2 &3. Describe if limbs wounds with tourniquets were bleeding upon admission,
      resuscitation, and following tourniquet removal

      Aim 4. Describe if mortality for the cohort of patients with tourniquets is different than
      the mortality predicted by various injury scoring systems

      Aim 5. Compare patient outcomes between those in which a tourniquet was indicated but not
      used and those for whom a tourniquet was indicated and used

      Aim 6. Determine if patients that received tourniquets for an extended time period exhibit
      any known tourniquet complications
