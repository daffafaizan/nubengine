      the safety, efficacy, and PK of daptomycin in pediatric participants ages 1 to 17 years,
      inclusive, with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Participants will be enrolled into
      age groups and given age-dependent doses over a period of up to 14 days. Participants will be
      stratified by age group to receive either daptomycin or SOC (recommended as vancomycin,
      clindamycin or semisynthetic penicillin) in a ratio of 2:1, respectively. Participants may
      continue on oral therapy following completion of IV study drug administration and provided
      that the participant meets all criteria for conversion to oral therapy, including clear
      clinical improvement and availability of an oral agent to which the pathogen is susceptible.
      The choice of oral therapy will be left to the discretion of the Investigator. February 11,
      2015 released from post marketing requirement to include subjects aged 3 months - < 1 year.
