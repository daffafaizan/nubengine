    
      Two genetions of a Chinese family with ARS were recruited to Aier Eye Hospital of Changsha.

      Clinical evaluations: We performed full ophthalmologic examinations of all subjects,
      including: visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurements (Goldman), slit lamp, anterior
      segment photography, visual field test (Humphrey 750, Carl Zeiss, Germany), Anterior segment
      OCT (Carl Zeiss, Germany). If the refractive medium is clear, we also performed funduscopy,
      gonioscopic and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements (Carl Zeiss,
      Germany).

      Mutation analysis: About 2 ml of venous blood sampled from each subject and collected in
      Vacutainer tubes (Sanjiu Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Liuyang, China) containing EDTA.
      Genomic DNA was extracted from each blood using a genomic DNA mini kit for blood (Life
      Technologies), All coding exons, with flanking intronic regions, of FOXC1 and PITX2 were
      amplified using PCR with primers. The amplifed DNA was purifed by agarose gel electrophoresis
      and sequenced on a 3730/3700xl automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
