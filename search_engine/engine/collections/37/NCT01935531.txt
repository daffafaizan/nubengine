      high lactate concentrations. There is also data for several tumor entities that high levels
      of lactate in the tumor are associated with tumor progression, metastasis and poor clinical
      outcome. Kreutz et al. demonstrated that diclofenac inhibits tumor cell proliferation in
      vitro and tumor growth in vivo via COX-independent effects on glucose metabolism. Diclofenac
      is taken up by tumor cells and inhibits tumor cell proliferation through inhibition of the
      oncogene MYC and subsequently glycolysis and block of lactate transport. MYC regulates genes
      involved in glycolysis and is upregulated in neoplastic cells, which is in line with the
      metabolic switch to glycolysis, the so called "Warburg effect", that cancer cells show.
      Although these results were found in vitro using human melanoma cells and in vivo in a mouse
      model, a similar mechanism of action is assumed to be relevant for the treatment of actinic
      keratoses with topical diclofenac. However tumor metabolism in diclofenac-treated actinic
      keratoses has never been investigated. To investigate the mechanism of action of diclofenac
      in the treatment of actinic keratoses, a clinical study analyzing particularly lactate
      levels, glycolysis and inflammatory infiltrate is needed.
