      standard-of-care approach, including initial surgical resection followed by systemic
      chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy for optimal local control, and targeted hormonal or
      biologic therapy for a period of time to reduce the ongoing risk of systemic disease
      recurrence. These approaches have reduced recurrence rates and improved overall survival in
      the adjuvant setting in breast cancer; however, the treatment of men with PSA recurrence
      following radical prostatectomy has generally been unsatisfying, given the high rates of
      persistent or recurrent disease despite salvage radiotherapy.

      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the rate of biochemical (PSA) progression
      free survival (bPFS) in men with PSA recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer following
      radical prostatectomy, who receive multimodality therapy consisting of local salvage external
      beam radiotherapy and systemic docetaxel-based chemotherapy plus the targeted anti-VEGF
      biologic therapy sunitinib. Biochemical PFS will be defined as the proportion of subjects at
      24 months, post-registration, with one of the following: 1) a serum PSA value of 0.2 ng/ml or
      more above the post-radiotherapy PSA nadir and confirmed 4 weeks later by a second PSA
      measurement that was higher than the first by any amount, 2) a continued rise in the PSA
      level following study treatment if no nadir is experienced, defined as 2 rising values
      greater than the baseline PSA and separated by at least 4 weeks, 3) evidence of clinical
      progression or initiation of systemic therapy for progressive disease, or 4) death. Secondary
      objectives include finding the rate of biochemical (PSA) disease free survival over time,
      Two-, three-, five-, and six- year risk of local recurrence (proportion), two-, three-,
      five-, and six-year risk of metastases and metastasis-free survival, two-, three-, five-, and
      six-year risk of metastases and metastasis-free survival, Safety, feasibility, and
      tolerability as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Scales (v3.0), quality of life questionnaire
      (EPIC-short form surveys), achievement of accrual goals. Finally, a comparison of RNA
      expression profiles from original prostate radical prostatectomy specimen among those with
      PSA relapse at 2 and 5 years as compared to those without PSA relapse at the primary
      endpoint.
