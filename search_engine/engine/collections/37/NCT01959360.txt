      the patient, but also restoration of hip joint biomechanics resulting in a minimal functional
      deficit and maximal longevity of the implant. It is not exceptional that these patients still
      experience mild to moderate long-term impairments postoperatively. These impairments include
      pain, muscle weakness of the hip abductors, contracture of the hip, gait disorders, as well
      as weakness of hip extensors and flexors. These problems may in turn lead to complications
      such as joint instability and loosening of the implant. When the lateral surgical approach is
      used, major concerns after total hip replacement surgery are muscle abductor
      weakness/atrophy, tendon defects of the gluteus minimus muscle, and unsuccessful reattachment
      or denervation of the anterior gluteal flap.

      Minimal incision/invasive surgery (MIS) is defined as a surgical approach performed through a
      short skin and muscle incision to avoid injury to muscles and tendons. Following minimally
      invasive approach reduced muscle trauma has been found. Moreover clinical outcome improved,
      as the gluteus medius muscle can be spared more successfully. However, it is debated whether
      or not the overall results of MIS are superior, or even as good as the traditional hip
      replacement surgery in terms of component placing and time to revision of the prosthesis.
