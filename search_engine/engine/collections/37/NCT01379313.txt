      disturbance of pulmonary gas exchange frequently occurs due to high intra-abdominal pressure.
      During the laparoscopic surgery with abdominal gas insufflation, gas exchange disturbance
      such as CO2 retention, hypoxemia occurs in addition to high plateau airway pressure. The
      usual strategy against these kinds of problem is pressure-controlled ventilation. However,
      the gas exchange problem especially CO2 retention can not be solved in some cases. The
      inverse-ratio ventilation (IRV), which prolongs the inspiratory time greater than expiratory
      time, can be applied for adult respiratory distress syndrome. The efficacy of IRV is to
      improve gas-exchange status by increasing mean airway pressure and alveolar recruitment.
      There have been several clinical investigations which applied IRV during general anesthesia.
      However, there have been debates about the effect of IRV during general anesthesia.
      Therefore, we tried to apply the IRV for subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery, and
      evaluate the effect of different I:E ratio on the pulmonary gas exchange and respiratory
      mechanics.
