      biopsy blocks from the 3115A1-303 study that were to be used for this study need to be
      retained and accessible in case of a regulatory inspection of the 303 protocol. Additionally,
      the Brazilian sites were not likely not to receive national IRB (CONEP) approval, and
      enrollment could not be met without the inclusion of these subjects. The study was not
      terminated due to safety concerns.
