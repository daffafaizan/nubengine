      to prove that they had TOS and no other nerve abnormality. They subsequently had ultrasound
      imaging of the shoulder (infraclavicular region) at rest and during arm abduction stress
      testing. Two control subjects had similar clinical exams and nerve testing to prove they did
      not have TOS, and then underwent similar ultrasound stress testing. The TOS patients
      demonstrated brachial plexus compression and pectoralis minor muscle distortion during the
      stress tests, and the normal subjects showed no plexus compression or muscle distortion.
