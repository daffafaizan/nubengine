      bioavailability of two formulations of 80 mg furosemide tablets under fasted conditions. The
      study was conducted with 44 (39 completing) healthy adults in accordance with protocol. In
      each study period, a single 80 mg dose was administered to the subjects following an
      overnight fast. The test formulation was furosemide 80 mg tablet (Ohm Laboratories, Inc.),
      and the reference formulation was LasixÂ® (furosemide) 80 mg tablet (Aventis Pharmaceuticals
      NJ). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in
      the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization
      schedule. There was a 7-day interval between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 12 hours after each dose. The
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to BA
      Research, 10550 Rockley Road, Suite 150, Houston, Texas 77099, Telephone: 281-495-6996, Fax
      281-575-6996 for determination of furosemide plasma concentration.

      Statistical analysis was performed at Ba Research, 2591 Sam Bass Road, Round Rock, TX 78681,
      Telephone 512-388-4554, Fax 512-388-4550.

      A total of 44 subjects were randomized to receive single oral dose of 80 mg furosemide
      tablets and 39 subjects completed both the periods of the study.
