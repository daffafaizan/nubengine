      complete. Your name or medical record number will not appear on the questionnaires. You will
      be assigned a study subject code number. The study chair will keep a file that links your
      name to the code.

      The first questionnaire will ask for basic demographic information (such as gender,
      ethnicity, and education) and your current chemotherapy and pain medications. If you cannot
      remember the names of these medications, researchers will locate them in your M. D. Anderson
      medical record.

      The second questionnaire asks you to rate your pain and a variety of symptoms (for example,
      fatigue and nausea).

      The last questionnaire includes 3 sections. The first section asks about your beliefs about
      pain and its treatment. The second part asks for your opinion about your pain management and
      about the education you have received about pain management. On the last page, you will be
      asked to use a picture of the outline of a body to show the researchers where you have pain.

      Once you have completed these questionnaires, you will be considered off-study.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 125 patients will take part in this study. Up to 35
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
