      cognitive functioning, along with anthropometric measures such as height, weight, and body
      composition. Those who complete baseline assessments will be enrolled in one of two groups of
      family-based treatment on after-school evenings (8 pairs in each group; total of 16
      child-caregiver pairs). A total of 24 weekly treatment sessions lasting up to 90 minutes each
      will be held over 6 months. Family-based behavioral treatment is a manualized, group
      intervention for children with obesity and their caregivers that incorporate
      participant-driven goal-based changes in diet and physical activity, and a variety of
      interactive educational session topics and behavioral support for reaching goals. A private
      weigh-in for children and caregivers will be conducted at each session. Sessions will begin
      with check-in with each family about weekly goal progress, after which the caregivers and
      children will split into separate groups for session-specific content including educational
      material tailored to nutrition, eating, and activity. The final portion of group session will
      involve children and caregivers merging in one group to share learning experiences and engage
      in collaborative goal-setting for the upcoming week(s). After the six month family-based
      behavioral intervention, baseline measures will be reassessed as well as overall program
      adherence. Program adherence will be evaluated using weekly program attendance and the number
      of days dietary/physical activity self-monitoring logs were completed.
