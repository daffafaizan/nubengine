      and non-menthol (n=35) to participate in five experimental sessions. During the experimental
      session, subjects will be given an IV infusion of either saline or 1 mg nicotine at rapid,
      moderate or slow infusion rates (nicotine at 0.24,0.096, 0.048 and 0.024, mcg per kg body
      weight per sec). The infusion conditions for each experimental session will be determined in
      random order. Aim 1 is to establish a dose-effect curve for positive subjective effects (drug
      liking and good drug effects) and alleviation of smoking urges, as a function of nicotine
      delivery rate in menthol and non-menthol cigarette preferring smokers Aim 2 is to establish a
      dose-effect curve positive subjective effects and alleviation of smoking urges as a function
      of nicotine delivery rate. Aim 3 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine's effect to
      alleviate symptoms of nicotine withdrawal in abstinent smokers as a function of nicotine
      delivery rate. Aim 4 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine's acute cardiovascular
      health effects. Data from this project will help to establish benchmark values for nicotine's
      threshold effects that will guide policies on the nicotine yield of tobacco products.
