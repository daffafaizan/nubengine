    
      This is a multi-center single and multiple ascending dose study (SAD and MAD) planned in 96
      participants. Part A (SAD) will include 6 cohorts (8 healthy volunteers in each cohort) and
      will randomize to AZD3427 or placebo, in a 6:2 ratio. One cohort will entirely include
      participants of Japanese descent. Part B (MAD) will include 6 cohorts (8 heart failure
      patients in each cohort) and will randomize to AZD3427 or placebo in a 6:2 ratio. Of these, 3
      cohorts will contain participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]
      and the other 3 cohorts will comprise of participants with heart failure with preserved
      ejection fraction [HFpEF]. There will be a maximum screening period of 27 days. Participants
      in part A and B will undergo study drug administration on Day 1. In addition, participants in
      part B will return for 4 additional doses on Days 8, 15, 22, and 29. Participants will be
      followed for at least 50 days after the last dose of study drug.
