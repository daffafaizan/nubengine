      weakness ('dynapenia'). A common characteristic of dynapenia is lowered mitochondrial content
      and metabolic function, causing reduced aerobic capacity, increased sensations of effort and
      impaired lipid oxidation (with resultant glucose intolerance). Exercise training improves
      mitochondrial and muscle function in ageing populations, however such adaptations remain
      below that of young counterparts, suggesting alternative approaches are required.
      Pre-clinical studies show that dietary supplementation with precursors of nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) restore mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in ageing
      rodents and diabetic humans. However, whether NAD+ precursors rejuvenate mitochondrial
      capacity and, ultimately, muscle function in older humans is unknown. This pilot project will
      therefore investigate the efficacy of NAD+ precursor supplementation for increasing muscle
      performance in normally active older men, combined with examination of the molecular and
      metabolic mechanisms regulating physiological responses.
