      I. To test for the equivalency of the two aspirin schedules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of aspirin treatments on:

      Ia. The ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/apoptosis (TUNEL) in rectal biopsies.

      Ib. The ratio of cell proliferation (Ki-67)/necroptosis (MLKL) in rectal biopsies.

      Ic. Fecal occult blood test (measures of adverse events) as measured by stool samples.

      Id. Methylation biomarkers in genes (i.e. CDKN2A [cell cycle regulation], MGMT
      [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair], DAPK1 [apoptosis], CDH1 [cell invasion], WNT16 [Wnt
      pathway] and RASSF1 [RAS signaling]) involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, as measured in
      rectal biopsies.

      Ie. Abundance of Escherichia (E.) coli and Fusobacterium in rectal swabs. II. To evaluate if
      the effects of aspirin arms may be modified by dietary intake of calcium as measured by the
      Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive aspirin PO daily at weeks 1-3 and 7-9 and placebo PO daily at weeks
      4-6 and 10-12 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.
