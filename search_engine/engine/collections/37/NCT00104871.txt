      I. Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of tumor response rate, in patients with
      metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer unresponsive to prior radioiodine therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this drug, in terms of progression-free survival, in
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5
      seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed periodically.
