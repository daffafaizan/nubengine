      recruitment plans (ADAPT-SCR and ADAPT-BX) followed by an off-line read of the images and
      data collected (ADAPT-BIE). This study involves the comparison of two devices that can
      identify abnormalities in routine breast screening and diagnostic mammography. Mammography is
      usually done with full-field digital mammography (FFDM), which takes flat, two-dimensional
      X-ray images of the breast. Doctors use the two-dimensional images to look for cancers and
      other abnormal tissue. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the accuracy of
      full-field digital mammography devices and a new mammography device called digital breast
      tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is similar to full-field digital mammography, but can also move
      around the breast to get X-ray images from different angles, which provides a
      three-dimensional view that doctors can use to look for cancers and abnormal tissue. Subjects
      will be recruited from an initially asymptomatic population that have been referred for
      clinically indicated breast biopsy based on suspicious DBT screening breast imaging results.
      Subjects will undergo a DBT mammogram prior to biopsy. If FFDM was not performed within 30
      days, subjects will also undergo FFDM prior to biopsy. Results of biopsy(ies) and
      histopathology, including lesion characteristics, will be recorded and considered as truth if
      positive for cancer status. Subjects with negative or benign histological findings will be
      followed for approximately one year (10-16 months) by FFDM and any additional standard of
      care practice.
