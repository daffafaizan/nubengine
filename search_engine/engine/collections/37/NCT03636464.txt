      adult patients/antibiotic dose/modality to a total number of 180-240 patients, admitted to
      the acute care levels or intensive care unit at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi receiving RRT and
      prescribed these seven antibiotics as recommended by their treating physicians. The
      collection of blood, ultrafiltrate or effluent fluids depending on RRT modality (HD or CRRT),
      and urine samples will begin after participants are administered first dose to determine if a
      loading dose will be required then after at least three doses (as prescribed by the treating
      physician) once these drugs will be at steady-state concentration. The study intervention
      duration will depend on dialysis modality expected to be 3 to 5 days depending on RRT
      modality and patients will be followed for outcomes (death or cure). Collected blood,
      effluent and urine samples will be assayed for drug concentration. The concentration data
      will be modeled by a computer program to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters used to
      predict future dosing in the case of RRT. Linear/logistic regression will be used as a
      component of statistical analysis to model the relationship between CRRT machine settings and
      the amount of the study drugs that will be removed by the filter. Information related to
      adverse events , clinical and microbiological cure will be collected in case report forms.
