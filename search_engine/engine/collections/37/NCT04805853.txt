      suggest early cardiomyopathy, it is not clear whether type 2 diabetes combined with PCOS will
      lead to earlier and more progressive changes in cardiomyopathy, and whether there is a
      difference with type 2 diabetes alone and early cardiomyopathy in patients with simple
      PCOS.Compared with women with type 2 diabetes who did not combine polycystic Ovary
      Syndrome(PCOS) or PCOS did not combine with type 2 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes
      who combined PCOS had the characteristics of lower age of onset, longer exposure to high risk
      factors of CVD, and higher risk of cardiovascular disease on the basis of the dual
      pathophysiology of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism.The purpose of this study is to
      find early cardiovascular disease of women with type 2 diabetes and PCOS and conduct early
      clinical intervention.
