      Visit 2 and Visit 3 consisted of 2 consecutive EEC Visits (3 hours in the EEC followed by 7
      hours in the Clinic, 10 hours total, each visit) followed by 7 days of wash-out. Visit 2 and
      Visit 3 occurred prior to dispense and the measures obtained during these visits were used as
      baseline. At Visit 4 patients were randomized and dispensed the assigned study medication for
      7 days of at-home dosing. Visit 5 (Day 8 of treatment) and Visit 6 (Day 9 of treatment)
      consisted of 2 additional consecutive EEC Visits (3 hours in the EEC followed by 7 hours in
      the clinic, 10 hours total, each visit). During each EEC visit, patients were exposed to
      either ragweed or cat allergen, depending on their skin prick test results. Of the 180
      participants enrolled, 170 received at least one dose of study treatment and were randomized
      to one of the three study treatments.
