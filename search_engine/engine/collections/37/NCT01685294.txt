      in criminal justice settings by conducting a fully-powered randomized effectiveness study
      that collects pilot implementation data, including cost-effectiveness data. Group IPT will be
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in a sample of 90 male and 90 female prisoners with MDD
      from 4 institutions, allowing us to explore gender effects.
