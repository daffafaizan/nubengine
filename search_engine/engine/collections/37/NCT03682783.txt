      detection and early intervention can be performed to control the development of the disease,
      it can greatly reduce the blindness rate of glaucoma, improve the life quality and
      physiological and mental health of patients, and alleviate the social burden. Therefore,
      screening and early diagnosis of glaucoma is the focus of glaucoma prevention.

      China has a population of 1.3 billion, which greatly increase the difficulty of disease
      screening. In recent years, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and
      modern medicine has made efficient and rapid disease screening possible.
