      inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity, resulting in functional impairment in
      multiple settings. The prevalence in China is estimated to be 6.26%. From the point of
      Chinese Traditional Medicine (TCM), ADHD can be divided into 4 categories according to the
      symptom differentiation in TCM.

      Aerobic exercise is known to improve executive function (EF) performance, which is known as
      the core deficit of ADHD, therefore reduce ADHD symptoms. Aerobic exercise with the component
      of self-control and development of character is reported to improve EF.

      Baduanjin is one of the aerobic exercises that has been handed down since the northern song
      dynasty, serving as Chinese physical and breathing exercises. The eight movements of
      Baduanjin are required to be gentle, slow, elastic and appropriate which not only require the
      practitioner to control physical activity but also require a combination of cognitive
      activities. Researchers found that Baduanjin has a positive protective effect on cognitive
      function such as selective attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment adults.

      Therefore, investigators designed the Baduanjin training system. This is a combination of a
      physical and cognitive training program and a video game with a motivation system,
      interesting and engaging for children with ADHD to practice on.
