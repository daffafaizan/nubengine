      Expanded Access Protocol in order for one named subject with Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD)
      with the hope of slowing or preventing the progression of renal dysfunction and eliminating
      the need for dialysis. This was a first-in-human study of ACP-501 (rhLCAT) in a subject with
      FLD. The safety and tolerability of rhLCAT, was assessed after multiple infusions. The
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of rhLCAT and its effect on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of HDL-C and HDL
      subpopulations was also be assessed. The duration of the PK and PD parameters will inform
      future multiple dose studies with respect to dose (mg/kg) and dosing interval. The current
      protocol completed the primary objection and has shifted to the secondary analysis of samples
      that were collected. FLD is an extremely rare generic disorders and there are too few
      subjects to design additional phase 1 trials and these longitudinal samples demonstrating the
      appearance of normal HDL along with possible biomarkers will be helpful and can help guide
      the design of a small definitive phase II/II trial.
