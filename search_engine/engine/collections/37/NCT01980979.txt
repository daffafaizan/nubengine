      efficacy of Remodulin in adults with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.
      Subjects will be enrolled at UCLA and Ohio State University (PI: Curt Daniels, MD). The study
      will involve a six month trial of continuous subcutaneous Remodulin therapy, with assessments
      conducted prior to initiation of therapy and at 1 and 6 months following initiation of
      therapy. A separate initiation visit will be scheduled after the baseline visit in order to
      provide subjects with comprehensive training in the use and care of the Remodulin drug
      delivery system.

      Baseline and post-treatment (6 month) assessments will include a history and physical
      examination, cardiopulmonary exercise test, six minute walking distance, serum brain
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), a Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)
      quality of life survey, and subjective assessment of functional capacity (New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) scale). The interim (1 month) follow-up visit will include a thorough
      review of adverse events associated with Remodulin therapy, functional class assessment, six
      minute walk distance, and serum BNP.

      Remodulin will be initiated at 1.25 ng/kg/min and increased by 2-6 ng/kg/min weekly to a
      target dose of 40 ng/kg/min. If the initial infusion rate cannot be tolerated it will be
      reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min. Changes in drug dose will be at the discretion of the
      investigators following review of interim events. If necessary, the dose may be decreased by
      2 ng/kg/min every two days as tolerated.
