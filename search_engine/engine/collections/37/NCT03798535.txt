    
      This is a non-interventional/observational study including NSCLC unresectable Stage III
      patients treated with durvalumab. Patient selection and retrospective data collection will be
      from participating countries: Australia, Belgium, Israel, Netherlands, Norway France,
      Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain

      Chart abstractions will occur at specified intervals up to five years after the patient had
      the first dose of durvalumab. A target of four (maximum five) chart extractions is
      anticipated for each participant. Dates may be adjusted based on local market ethics
      processes or patient enrolment.

        -  First chart extraction will be used to determine which patients meet the
           inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study and will retrospectively collect all data
           from diagnosis of stage III unresectable NSCLC and the durvalumab start date (index
           date).

        -  The second chart extraction will be triggered at time of estimated maturity of PFS data
           to provide an accurate measure of the PFS outcome.

        -  The third chart extraction will be triggered at time of estimated maturity of OS data to
           provide an accurate measure of the OS outcomeâ€¢ The fourth and fifth chart extractions
           will occur approximately 3-years and 5-years after enrolment

        -  The dates for the second through fifth chart abstractions may be adjusted, pending data
           availability. The estimated PFS and OS maturity will be calculated from the actual
           patient index dates (date of first dose of durvalumab) and any available data on PFS and
           OS observed in the first extraction together with the distribution of PFS and OS
           observed in the PACIFIC trial.
