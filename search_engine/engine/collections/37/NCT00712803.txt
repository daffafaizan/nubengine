      syndrome. More than 2 billion people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world
      are at risk of dengue virus infection, which is the leading cause of hospitalization and
      death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine called rDEN3-3'D4delta30. This
      vaccine is derived from rDEN4delta30, another dengue virus vaccine candidate that has been
      shown to be safe and immunogenic in Phase I and II trials in healthy adults.

      There will be two groups in this study. Participants in Group 1 will be randomly assigned to
      receive rDEN3-3'D4delta30 vaccine or placebo at study entry. The dosing for Group 2 will be
      determined by a safety review of all participants in Group 1. If less than 90 % of the Group
      1 participants seroconvert to DEN3 participants in Group 2 will receive a higher dose of
      rDEN3-3'D4delta30. If at least 90 % of Group 1 participants seroconvert to DEN3, participants
      in Group 2 will receive a lower dose of rDEN3-3'D4delta30.

      All participants will be required to monitor their temperature three times each day for the
      first 16 days following each vaccination. Study visits will occur 30 minutes following each
      vaccination and every other day after vaccination until Day 16, followed by four additional
      visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection, vital signs measurement, and a
      targeted physical exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants will be asked to
      undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
