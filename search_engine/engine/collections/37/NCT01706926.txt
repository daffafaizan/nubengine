      arthritis, there is still significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with
      this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. The aim of the study is to explore the optimum dose of mavrilimumab for further
      clinical development and more fully investigate the efficacy and safety profile of
      mavrilimumab after longer drug exposure (that is, 24 weeks). The results of this study will
      form the basis for future clinical studies with mavrilimumab.
