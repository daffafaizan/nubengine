      I. Define the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of topotecan (TOPO) administered with
      daily high-dose thoracic radiotherapy to a total of 60 Gy in patients with solid tumor or
      lymphoma.

      II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative nature of the toxic effects encountered in this
      treatment.

      III. Estimate the tissue and tumor TOPO concentrations during radiotherapy by evaluating
      plasma TOPO levels.

      IV. Evaluate, using Western blot and immunohistochemical stain, the effects of
      TOPO/radiotherapy on topoisomerase I levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).

      V. Determine whether TOPO induces apoptosis in PBL from this patient population.

      VI. Examine tumor tissue pre- and post-treatment (if available) for topoisomerase I levels,
      DNA damage, topoisomerase I/DNA complexes, and apoptotic events.

      OUTLINE:

      Radiosensitization plus Radiotherapy. Topotecan, TOPO, NSC-609699; plus external-beam
      irradiation using linear accelerators with photon energies between 4 and 10 MV (electrons
      acceptable for the boost field).
