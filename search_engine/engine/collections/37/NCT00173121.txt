      include patients who were suspected of having enterovirus illnesses, such as HFMD and
      herpangina. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Hospital for this study
      and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents. (2) Questionnaire.
      questionnaire based interviews were used to collect information about the family members,
      including demographic data, the number of bedrooms in the house, amount of contact time with
      the patient, presence and pattern of current or recent signs and symptoms. (3) Patient and
      culture samples. Laboratory evidence of enterovirus infection was defined as the isolation of
      enterovirus from a throat , and rectal swab sample. (4) Environmental Sampling. (a) Air
      sampling. For the filter/real-time qPCR assay, the air in each ward was filtered through a
      37-mm-diameter Nuclepore filter (Costar, Cambridge, MA), which is a track-etched
      polycarbonate filter consisting of a polycarbonate membrane with straight-through pores of
      uniform size (0.4 Î¼m). The filters were supported by cellulose pads and loaded into open-face
      three-piece plastic cassettes. The pump and filter apparatus were placed within 1 m from the
      patient's bed on an adjacent nightstand. (b) Surface sampling Regarding surface sampling,
      surfaces of environment and equipment were sampled with moistened sterile cotton swabs.
