      and children for transfusion or inotropics infusion. The trendelenburg position is usually
      applied to increase the cross-sectional area of the IJV.

      However, trendelenburg position requires a tilt table to place the head in the down position.
      Trendelenburg position could also increase intracranial pressure. Passive leg elevation
      redistributes more blood from the lower extremity into the central veins and is proved to
      increase the cross-sectional area of IJV in adults. However, the effect of leg elevation on
      the cross-sectional area of IJV in small infants and children has not been evaluated.
      Furthermore, the children undergoing open heart surgery due to cardiac anomaly have an
      altered hemodynamics and often congested right heart. Therefore, the response of passive leg
      elevation may be different from that of normal heart physiology. Therefore, we evaluated the
      effect of passive leg elevation on the cross-sectional area of IJV in subjects undergoing
      open heart surgery for congenital anomaly.
