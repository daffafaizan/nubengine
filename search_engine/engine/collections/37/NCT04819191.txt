      Dementias (ADRD) because of the important role assumed in medical decision-making, especially
      at the end of life. The investigators, study seeks to improve communication in primary care
      through methods to proactively engage family in ongoing interactions with primary care and
      stimulate and support Advance Care Planning (ACP) for all older adults and attention to ADRD
      in primary care throughout the ADRD disease trajectory. The investigators' premise is that
      individuals and families appreciate primary care involvement in ACP and information and
      referrals for ADRD needs, but that individual, family, and system factors including time,
      knowledge, and resources often inhibit these conversations from occurring.

      SHARING Choices integrates communication strategies that have been individually found to be
      effective but have thus far been deployed in isolation of one another. The investigators
      focus on all older primary care patients because of the importance of addressing ACP early,
      the under-diagnosis of ADRD and the greater implementation potential of a protocol with broad
      applicability.

      Components of SHARING Choices include:

        1. A letter from the clinic introducing an initiative to prepare persons and families for
           Advance Care Planning (ACP);

        2. Access to a facilitator trained to lead ACP discussions;

        3. Patient-family agenda-setting to align perspectives about the role of family and
           stimulate discussion about ACP;

        4. Facilitated registration to the patient portal (for patient and family) as desired;

        5. Education & resources about ADRD for clinic staff.
