    
      The proposed phase II study is a single-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel-arm,
      vehicle-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Recombinant Human
      Nerve Growth Factor (rhNGF) eye drops at 20 Î¼g/ml concentration administered six times daily
      for 8 weeks in patients with dry eye. After confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria
      all eligible patients will be randomized at 2:1 ratio to rhNGF or vehicle control treatment
      with 8 weeks of study treatments administration with 4 weeks Follow-up.
