    
      Physiological evaluation of two modes of mechanical ventilation: Neurally Adjusted
      Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) vs Pressure Support Ventilation, at different levels of ventilator
      assistance.

      Evaluation in term of physiological parameters: Tidal volume, Respiratory rate, Inspiratory
      effort, PaCO2, evaluation of subject-ventilator synchrony.

      Evaluation of physiological response to varying levels of ventilator assistance.
