      bypass (CPB). Only a few studies however have evaluated the effects of volatile anesthetics
      during coronary artery bypass grafting on a beating heart (OPCABG) with conflicting results
      as far as cardiac biomarker release is concerned.

      Because CPB is known to have a profound impact on cardiac function, studies performed on
      patients scheduled for OPCABG could evaluate more specifically the effects of the anesthetic
      agents themselves. Patients undergoing OPCABG have a predictable and predefined ischemic zone
      during surgery and represent an extremely interesting and safe model for the study of
      ischemia and cardiac damage in humans.

      Presently, there is still no consensus on the method of administration of volatile
      anesthetics, including the time to begin administration, its duration, the dosage and
      selection of volatile anesthetics.
