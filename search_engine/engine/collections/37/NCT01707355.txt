      educational campaign regarding dental trauma targeting on primary and secondary school
      teachers was implemented before.

      Lists of Primary and secondary schools were requested from the Education Bereau. Schools were
      invited to join the study from 1.3.2011 and then randomized to the intervention group and the
      control group in the unit of school using computer generated numbers.

      All teachers filled in the first questionnaire and send it back to the investigator in 1
      week. 3 copies of the same educational poster were given to the intervention schools, these
      schools were requested to display them in 1. the medical room 2. staff common room and 3
      anywhere that information was usually placed for the teachers. No poster was given to the
      control group. After 2 weeks, the posters were removed by the teacher in charge. The same
      questionnaire was filled in by all the teachers in both groups and sent back in 1 week. The
      data were processed to show whether the poster was effective to improve the knowledge of the
      teachers. The study was complied with Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP guidelines

      Primary outcome measures the score of the questionnaire
