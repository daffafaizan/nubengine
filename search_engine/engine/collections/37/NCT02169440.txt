      female volunteers. The study was to consist of 2 treatment periods separated by a washout
      period of 14 days or more. In one period, subjects were to receive a single-dose of 25 mg BIA
      9-1067 with a single-dose of racemic 25 mg warfarin. In the other period, a 25 mg warfarin
      single-dose was to be administered alone.
