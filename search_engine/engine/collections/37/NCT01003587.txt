      best way to promote evidence uptake in policy formulation and implementation is unclear.
      Information on disease control priorities based on India's disease burden and health system
      capacity has been produced to help focus government efforts during a period of increased
      spending and decentralization.

      This study tests the impact of sending information on comparative performance (using district
      report cards) and actionable messages (on how to reduce disease burden) to district-level
      decision-makers on uptake of disease control priority recommendations in India. Using a
      cluster-randomized design, districts will be randomized to receive either the mailed
      information package or no intervention. The sample includes all 594 Indian districts in
      existence in 2001. The intervention will target key district level decision-makers:
      parliamentarians (Members of Parliament, Members of Legislative Assembly), bureaucrats
      (District Collectors), technocrats (District Health Officers), and local government officials
      (Zilla Parishad CEOs).

      Study outcome data will be collected using sequential national surveys of health service
      availability and utilization, including relevant rounds of the District Level Health and
      Facility Surveys and the Annual Health Surveys. This study tests an inexpensive, pragmatic
      strategy on a large scale and will provide information on effective methods of knowledge
      translation to policy-makers.
