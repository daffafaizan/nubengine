      start and continue surgical operations. Endotracheal intubation has many important reasons
      such as ensuring airway control safely during surgical procedure, increasing the depth of
      anesthesia, need interventions for surgical or anesthetic complications, reduction of dead
      space, reduction of respiratory effort and prevention of aspiration risk. Videolaryngoscope,
      developed in recent years and beginning to take place in the algorithms, facilitate difficult
      airway management and hence intubation.

      The use of videolaryngoscope in patients with intubation such as double lumen tube, has been
      frequently reported in the literature. McGrath videolaryngoscope has a high-resolution video
      camera, a length-adjustable angle blade, and a light source at the tip of the blade. At the
      same time, the C-MAC videolaryngoscope is another advanced videolaryngoscope with a better
      quality video and camera system and improves the performance of videolaryngoscope with some
      technological changes. In this prospective controlled clinical study, the purpose is to
      compare C-MAC videolaryngoscope with D blade and McGrath MAC videolaryngoscope with X3 blade
      in respect to duration of intubation, haemodynamic response, and adverse events associated
      with intubation of patients undergoing lung surgery.
