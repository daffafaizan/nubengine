      novel scoring system to evaluate differences in visibility of different nerves.

      VIS(visibility) 1 easy identification and instant visualisation of all structures VIS 2
      identification and visualisation of all structures after some corrections VIS 3
      identification and visualisation of structures only unsure VIS 4 identification and
      visualisation of all structures impossible VIS 5 no structures seen. We amended a sub-project
      in which assessed the visibility in protective nerve stimulated nerve blocks in 46 patients.
