      actively performed at Vanderbilt University Hospital. Questions have been raised concerning
      the effect of deep brain stimulation on the depression commonly seen in Parkinson's patients.
      Through this study, we plan to evaluate and compare the incidence and severity of depression
      in Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulation to those who did not complete the
      surgery. Primary literature has indicated a general increase in quality of life of those
      patients receiving DBS, but no studies have compared these two specific patient populations.
