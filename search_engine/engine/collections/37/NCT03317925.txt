      by Ang-converting enzyme (ACE)/Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor. The Ang-converting enzyme 2
      (ACE2)/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway counteracts this damage. The balance, or ratio, between levels
      of the ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) pathways may be clinically important because Ang-(1-7)
      counteracts Ang II-mediated injury. An increase in ACE and Ang II expression and a decrease
      in ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) expression on tubular cells may promote renal injury. Tubular damage
      may increase urinary loss of protective ACE2 and Ang-(1-7), propagating renal damage by
      allowing ACE and Ang II to stimulate inflammation and fibrosis unopposed. The investigators
      hypothesis is that a shift in the urinary ACE-to-ACE2 and Ang II-to-Ang-(1-7) ratios towards
      ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) predicts acute graft injury diagnosed on renal biopsy and predicts chronic
      graft damage on renal biopsy.
