      the hospitalization areas of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital. All research data will be collected
      by the hospital's vascular access nursing team. Complications related to peripheral venous
      access (phlebitis, thrombosis, pain, erythema, extravasation) and the time of catheter
      replacement are the focus outcomes of the present study and possible differences between the
      control group and the sample population of the T2DM will be analyzed. General clinical and
      anthropometric data (age, sex, BMI, toxic habits,...), cause of admission, co-morbidities,
      and all variables related to diabetes (time of evolution, degree of glycemic control,
      treatment, and presence of chronic complications) will also be collected. If there are any
      significant differences, they will be related to the different risk factors associated with
      T2DM through association of different epidemiological variables. Furthermore in this
      hypothetical case, the research team would intend to develop and carry out molecular studies
      through analysis of blood and urine components, proteinomics and genetic studies.

      Hypothesis:

        -  T2DM is an independent risk factor for catheter-related complications.

        -  The use of new vascular access devices (Midline, PICC) in patients with T2DM would be
           associated with a lower risk of catheter-related complications.

      Main objective:

      - To assess the influence of T2DM on complications related to peripheral vascular catheters
      in hospitalized patients.

      It is expected to colect information of N=500 samples, 250 control group (noT2DM subjects)
      and 250 study group (T2DM subjects). Due to previous experience, the sample proposed is
      totally acceptable
