      the most invasive surgical procedures. Even with progress made in surgical technique and
      postoperative management the rate of short- and long term complications remains high. The
      surgical trauma invariably causes liberation and activation of inflammatory mediators and
      danger associated molecular patterns, which in turn result in a pronounced systemic
      inflammatory reaction, leading to multiorgan dysfunction including adult respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) in many patients. The subsequent counter regulation of the immune system
      induces immune paralysis, which is followed by infectious complications and increases the
      probability of severe sepsis. Moreover, severe systemic inflammation causes capillary
      leakage, resulting in impaired wound healing and endangered anastomoses.

      Therefore, it seems that early and effective measures against the excessive production of
      mediators and cytokines are indicated without impairment of the innate and adaptive immune
      response as it would be expected with the administration of e.g. steroids. Instead, the
      removal of an excessive amount of circulating cytokines might be a desirable method having
      shown its effectivity in the therapy of septic shock in the past.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of extracorporeal cytokine removal
      to dampen the systemic inflammatory response following abdominal-thoracic esophagectomy.
