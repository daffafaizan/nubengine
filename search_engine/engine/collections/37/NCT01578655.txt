      retreatment, mitoxantrone, or other chemotherapies, without proven clinical benefit. In 2010,
      a Phase 3 second-line chemotherapy trial (TROPIC) showed a survival advantage for
      cabazitaxel, a semi-synthetic taxane selected to overcome the emergence of taxane resistance,
      when compared to mitoxantrone.

      Clusterin is a stress-activated cytoprotective chaperone up-regulated by a variety of
      anti-cancer therapies that confers treatment resistance when over-expressed. Inhibition of
      clusterin expression using custirsen has been shown to enhance tumor cell death following
      treatment with chemotherapy.

      The clinical activity of custirsen in combination with the taxane docetaxel has been shown in
      two Phase 2 studies. Given the results observed using a taxane as either first-line or
      second-line chemotherapy in CRPC, combination with custirsen may decrease taxane resistance
      and enhance the survival benefit of taxane therapy. Thus, a combination of custirsen with
      cabazitaxel may further enhance survival in second-line taxane chemotherapy for CRPC.
