      volume of body fluids due to principal illness and some therapeutic interventions. One of its
      manifestations is pleural effusion (PE) formation.

      Patients on mechanical ventilation indicated by treating physician to pleural fluid
      evacuation will be monitored throughout the procedure by electrical impedance tomography
      (EIT) and concurrently end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) will be measured. The purpose of the
      study is to better understand impact of PE evacuation on aeration and ventilation of the
      lungs.
