      for the dyslipidemia of insulin resistance, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The efficacy
      of Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin has not been formally examined in this setting.

      Methods: Forty-four dyslipidemic men and women (LDL-C >130mg/dL and below average HDL-C (<55
      in women and <45 in men) were randomized to a 3 month course of atorvastatin 10 mg or
      Slo-Niacin increased monthly at doses of 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/day. The alternate drug was
      added in the second 3-month segment. Lipid profiles and transaminase measurements were
      obtained monthly and full lipoprotein quantifications, apoproteins, remnant like lipoproteins
      (RLP), LDL buoyancy, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein were measured at the end of
      each 3-month sequence. Results: Mean entry lipids were (mg/dL) TG 187, LDL-C 171, HDL-C 39.
      Mean BMI was 32.6 Kg/M2. When Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin were given alone, respective
      decreases in triglyceride (TG) were 18% and 10%, LDL-C 12% and 36% and non-HDL-C 15% and 36%.
      HDL-C increased 8% and 6%, respectively. Combined therapy decreased median TG 33% and mean
      LDL-C 43% and increased mean HDL-C 10%. Mean hs CRP decreased 23% and RLP 44.5% in the
      combined groups. Conclusions: Slo-Niacin with atorvastatin improves all lipoprotein
      fractions, RLP and hsCRP in combined hyperlipidemia. The reduction of LDL with the drug
      combination is equivalent to that obtained with 20-80 mg of atorvastatin alone.
