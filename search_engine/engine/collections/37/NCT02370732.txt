      severity of cognitive impairment and driving performance changes following alcohol
      consumption in a group of patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)
      bariatric surgery and 2) to investigate differential reinforcing properties of alcohol in
      patients before and after they undergo RYGB. Both of these objectives stem from observations
      from the investigators work and previous empirical studies suggesting that the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of alcohol are substantially altered following bariatric surgery. This
      may lead to alterations in the time-course and severity of alcohol-related cognitive and
      driving impairment, as well as alter the reinforcing effects of drinking alcohol.
      Particularly relevant to these objectives, PK data have shown higher peak alcohol
      concentrations and a shorter time to achieve them in bariatric surgery patients. Therefore
      the third objective of this application is to better characterize the PK profile of alcohol
      following RYGB. Finally, investigators will explore whether changes in impairment,
      reinforcement, and PKs are moderated by gender, age, smoking, and alcohol use.

      In this study investigators propose to prospectively investigate approximately 50-60 RYGB
      patients. Participants will be assessed at baseline (pre-surgery) and one year after surgery
      (to approximate their weight nadir) in an acute alcohol dosing laboratory paradigm.
