    
      This is a non-interventional, observational and prospective study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of trabectedin in routine practice. Patients are assigned to a therapeutic strategy
      within current practice, not according to a trial protocol. The prescription of the medicine
      is separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. Diagnostic or monitoring
      procedures are only those ordinarily applied to the therapeutic strategy.

      There are no dose regimens or medical procedures defined within this study plan. Every
      medical decision and course of treatment with trabectedin will reflect exclusively the
      decision of the Investigator in a routine clinical situation according to SmPC. The concept
      of this non-interventional study and its documentation procedure will not affect in any way
      the routine treatment situation.
