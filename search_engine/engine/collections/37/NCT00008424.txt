        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in children with refractory or
           advanced solid tumors receiving anticonvulsants.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      type of concurrent anticonvulsant (enzyme activating anticonvulsants vs valproic acid vs
      other anticonvulsants).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
