      incidence of TB increased in recent years. The failure of control implies the necessity to
      reevaluate the epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is widely thought that most
      cases of TB are caused by reactivation of a latent infection. Treatment programs have
      therefore focused on cure rates rather than tracking of additional cases. But recent studies
      showed that exogenous reinfection plays an important role in the development of TB. In
      addition, it seems that the higher the local incidence, the more important exogenous
      reinfection is. The question of exogenous reinfection versus endogenous reactivation has an
      impact on the distribution of resources for the prevention and treatment of TB. Based on
      these evidences, we hypothesize that exogenous reinfection is very important in the Taiwan
      endemic. Therefore, we design a series of studies to evaluate the individual contribution of
      exogenous reinfection and endogenous reactivation in the Taiwan endemic, and to realize the
      impact of exogenous reinfection. First, we will identify the patients with TB relapse after
      complete treatment. The M. tuberculosis isolates responsible for their initial and recurrent
      episodes will then be genotyped to clarify the percentage of exogenous reinfection and
      endogenous reinfection.
