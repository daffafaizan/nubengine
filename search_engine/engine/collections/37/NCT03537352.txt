    
      During a pilot cross-sectional study, the 9- Item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire
      (9SDMQ) will be administered in two groups of participants, one (N=60) suffering from
      surgical diseases and one (N=60) from non-surgical medical diseases. Patients hospitalized in
      four acute wards (2 surgical and 2 non-surgical wards) or visiting the relevant outpatient
      departments of the Triassion General Hospital of Elefsina, Greece will be recruited. The
      primary outcome will be the difference on the 9SDMQ scores (transformed in a 1-100% scale) in
      patients suffering from surgical versus non-surgical disorders. Secondary outcome measures
      will include the effect of patients' demographic and clinical variables, of physicians'
      demographic variables and of the score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment on the 9SDMQ
      scores. Additionally the relationship of patients' satisfaction on the 9SDMQ scores will also
      be investigated.
