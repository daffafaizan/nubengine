      CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes mediate a more intense id-specific immunity than
      non id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes. The secondary objectives of this
      study is to demonstrate that doses of 1 times 10e10 Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 autologous
      lymphocytes can be infused safely and effectively in more than 80 percent of eligible
      patients, to determine whether Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes and to
      determine if the presence of Id-specific immunity correlates with disease response.
