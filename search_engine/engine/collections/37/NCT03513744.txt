      five different human milk oligosaccharides to support normal physical growth of term infants
      (evaluated per weight gain, body length and head circumference), in comparison with infant
      formula without human milk oligosaccharides, when the formula is fed exclusivly in the first
      four month of life. Additionally, a comparison of the two formula fed groups against a
      reference group with breastfed infants as well as the WHO growth standard reference tables
      will be performed. An assessment of safety and tolerability will be performed as well.

      As a secondary out come of the study, we will examine the effect of the formula on the infant
      microbiome, as well as the HMO status of the mother's milk towards the microbial composition
      of the infant microbiome.
