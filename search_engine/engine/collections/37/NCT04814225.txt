      products, dairy products, baked goods, snacks, beverages, and infant formula. Its widespread
      use is due to its advantageous effects on health, economics, and high nutritional value by
      containing lactose, minerals, vitamins, and soluble proteins. Due to allergies, dietary
      restrictions and/or personal dietary choices there is a need for an alternative protein
      source(s), and plant-based protein options are in demand for these reasons. Roquette produces
      the NUTRALYSÂ® Pea Protein family of ingredients, supplying the widest range of pea protein
      ingredients to the food industry suitable for use in a plethora of plant-based foods. Few
      studies have examined the equivalence between pea protein and whey on muscle performance in
      sedentary adults. The objective of this randomized, triple-blind, comparator controlled,
      parallel clinical trial is to investigate the functional equivalence of three test products
      compared to whey protein on muscular performance in a healthy, sedentary adult population.
