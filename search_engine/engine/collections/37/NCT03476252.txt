      C-reactive protein showed a positive correlation with the risk of coronary artery disease in
      both healthy individuals and those at high risk .

      Pentraxin 3 is expressed in atherosclerotic plaques, mainly in macrophages and neutrophils,
      suggesting that pentraxin 3 may be involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque.

        -  A number of studies demonstrated that increased levels of Pentraxin 3 were associated
           with the presence and increased severity of coronary artery disease in clinically stable
           patients undergoing elective coronary angiography .

        -  Pentraxin 3 levels peak at about 7 h after acute MI, which is substantially earlier than
           CRP, and thus PTX3 could be a better independent predictor of CHD than CRP .

        -  Recently, it was shown that the number of the involved vessels, MI type, stent length,
           culprit lesion, and the need for PCI all had a significant relation with abnormal
           Pentraxin 3 levels , however, it was not studied with respect of its relation with
           postprocedural angiographic and clinical outcomes.

      We thought to evaluate the role of pentraxin-3 on the preprocedural determinants (Grace
      score, type of MI, culprit lesion, lesion length, pre-procedural TIMI flow, thrombus burden,
      severity and complexity of CAD as determined by Syntax score and procedural outcome
      (post-procedural TIMI flow, no reflow and myocardial perfusion assessed by myocardial blush
      grade as well as the inhospital clinical outcome of primary Percutaneous coronary
      intervention in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.
