    
      Experienced dual cannabis-tobacco smokers will participate in a within-subject crossover
      study with three blocks: smoked cannabis (purchased by participants from a local dispensary),
      dry herb cannabis vaporizer, and usual brand tobacco cigarette. Each block will consist of 2
      consecutive days on an inpatient research ward. The first inpatient day of each block will
      comprise of two sessions: (1) The first session will be a standardized bout to compare
      pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and subjective effects of cannabis and tobacco use; (2) after 6
      hours of abstinence, the second session will be ad libitum access to the assigned product for
      2 hours to compare subjective effects (reward, satisfaction, craving reduction) and use
      patterns. The second inpatient day will consist of ad libitum use of the assigned product
      from 8:00 in the morning to midnight. An abstinence day will be added after the second day of
      the last block to assess exposure and effects biomarkers during a period of abstinence from
      cannabis (smoked/vaped) or tobacco.
