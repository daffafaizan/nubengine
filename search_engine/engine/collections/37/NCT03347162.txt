      is demanding and associated with severe deconditioning potentially leading to worse
      prognostic outcomes. To what extend patients body composition at the point of diagnoses, as
      well as changes in body composition throughout the cancer continuum is associated with cancer
      outcomes is currently not well-described, specifically if this should be part of standard
      clinical evaluation in order to optimize therapy-efficacy. Recent findings suggest that
      pathophysiological alterations in skeletal muscle mass and function can have significant
      implications for the risk of disease progression and long-term prognosis.
