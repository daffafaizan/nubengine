      traumatised front teeth in children attending the department of paediatric dentistry.

      The vitality/sensibility of traumatised teeth will be assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry,
      electrical pulp testing and ethyl chloride. Measurements will be performed by a single
      operator (chief investigator) and will be carried out at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      follow up period.
