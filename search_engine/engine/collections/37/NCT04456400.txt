      Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) technology for the non-invasive assessment of intestinal
      inflammation in patients. EUPHORIA will enable commercialization of the technology by
      finalizing technical improvements that will increase diagnostic outcome beyond what has been
      shown in a first feasibility study, will improve usability, prepare CE marking for the new
      device and validate clinical results in a large clinical investigation.

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition, posing significant burden to
      patients and health care systems. Patients suffer from a relapsing course of intestinal
      inflammation, and to date, there is no satisfying noninvasive diagnostic modality for
      monitoring disease activity. In a recent clinical study conducted by University Hospital
      Erlangen, MSOT, a technology developed by iThera Medical (ITM), has proven to be superior in
      diagnostic performance to other procedures.
