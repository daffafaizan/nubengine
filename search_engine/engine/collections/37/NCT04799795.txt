      the care for epilepsy patients. The established terminology of "ictal" versus "interictal" is
      deceptive because it suggests that during the "interictal" phase epileptic activity is absent
      and detrimental mechanisms of the disease are only active during seizures. But evidence
      exists that cognitive impairment extends to states traditionally considered interictal. The
      development of an objective, ideally ambulatory test assessing cognitive impairment would not
      only provide a deeper understanding of the pathology but induce a change in clinical
      practice: if cognitive impairment could be demonstrated "interictally", this fact would help
      to weigh treatment effects against potential side-effects.

      In this project the investigators will set out to

        1. identify EEG markers in healthy volunteers, which reflect the changes in spatial and
           temporal dynamics of neuronal activity during states of reduced conscious awareness
           using sleep as an example of a state of reduced conscious awareness;

        2. assess with neuropsychological testing reductions in interictal conscious awareness in
           patients with epilepsy;

        3. test, whether markers established under (1) are valid in individuals with epilepsy and
           interictally reduced conscious awareness (see (2)).
