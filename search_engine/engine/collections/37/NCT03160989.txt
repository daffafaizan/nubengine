    
      Before starting the training program, all the volunteers will sign the Free and Informed
      Consent Form (TCLE) and must present a medical certificate releasing the participation. In
      addition, the volunteers will respond to an anamnesis questionnaire and will undergo an
      anthropometric evaluation before the experimental sessions. The physical exercise program
      will be held three times a week for 10 weeks, containing aerobic exercise (exercise
      treadmill) and resistance exercises (bodybuilding). Initially, a familiarization of the
      ergometers used will be performed, followed by a session to evaluate the intensity of
      resistance exercise through a maximal repetition test (1RM), and a session to evaluate
      aerobic fitness through an incremental treadmill test.

      Before starting the training, volunteers will perform a single exercise session, following
      the same exercise protocol. All the volunteers will be submitted to the evaluation of the
      blood pressure during 24 hours through the measurement of ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) in
      three moments:

        -  PR: pre-training rest - the volunteers will arrive at the laboratory, will be in rest
           for 15 minutes and after that they will place the ABPM, without having done any
           exercise.

        -  PE: post exercise - upon arriving at the laboratory, the volunteers will be submitted to
           a single combined exercise session, will have a maximum interval of 20 minutes for the
           bath and will place the MAP device.

        -  CR: rest after chronic training - after the end of the 10 weeks of training, the
           volunteers will be submitted to ABPM, again at rest, with a maximum interval of 72
           hours, between the end of the training and the placement of the device.
