      of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or cholecystectomy (gallbladder
      removal). The bile and brushings will be used to generate and perpetuate bile-derived
      organoids using an established matrigel-based protocol. These organoids will then be used in
      downstream experiments to better understand disease-specific alterations to biological
      pathways informative of disease pathogenesis
