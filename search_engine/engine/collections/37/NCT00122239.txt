      permit RT dose escalation to be tested as a means of improving disease control in many tumour
      sites. With delivery innovations, life-threatening toxicity occurs rarely, but significant
      clinical toxicity is common. In previous work the investigators have studied a cohort of 98
      prostate patients who received dose-escalated 3D-CRT and have obtained evidence of genetic
      and dosimetric factors underlying rectal/bladder toxicity. They posit that the late radiation
      toxicity disease state has significant genetic determinants in other malignancies. These
      determinants are neither understood nor accounted for in selection of treatment, and the
      investigators propose to study additional well-characterized cohorts, who are clinically well
      from a disease control perspective, given that comprehensive dosimetric and outcome
      information is available on all.

      For a thorough understanding of the molecular processes underlying tissue responses to
      radiation damage, the investigators propose a genomic analysis. Their working hypothesis is
      that normal organ toxicity will be associated with patient genetics as measured by single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a select group of genes. The criteria for selecting SNPs
      will be based on a candidate gene approach, choosing genes implicated or demonstrated in DNA
      repair pathways and radiation-induced tissue damage/tissue homeostasis. Analysis of these
      data will use both statistically based bioinformatics approaches.
