      psychotherapy for PTSD. It is considered a first line treatment and has ample evidence
      supporting it's effectiveness (ISTSS and VA/DOD clinical practice guidelines). This therapy
      is manualized and a framework is provided to ensure consistent delivery. Additionally, the VA
      Office of Mental Health Operations sponsors training and dissemination of CPT throughout the
      VA system and the PI of this study is a trainer and consultant of this therapy. Flexibility
      exists in the protocol and CPT can be delivered in unorthodox modalities such as telehealth
      (Moreland et al, 2015) and on compressed time schedules (Held et al, 2020; Bryan et al,
      2018). While the literature supports the effectiveness of these interventions in unique
      settings, no known studies have looked at outcome data of real-world outpatient clinics. The
      PTSD Clinical Team provides CPT as part of it's standard care with a variety of adaptations.
      The team practices measurement based care and routinely collects self-report symptom
      inventories to track patient progress. This study aims to use data collected as part of
      standard care in this clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatment adaptations in
      this setting.

      Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of how CPT for PTSD
      is delivered. Initial areas of review will include in person vs. telehealth delivery and
      timing (daily vs. weekly).
