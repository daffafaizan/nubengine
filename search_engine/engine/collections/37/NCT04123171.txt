      the increasing burden of cognitive decline and dementia in rural Ecuador. Before the study,
      our Executive Committee met with community leaders to explain the aims of the study and to
      learn about the culture and traditions of villagers. Field personnel were trained to assure
      uniformity in data collection. With the aid of satellite view (Google Earth, Google Inc.,
      Mountain View, CA), updated sketches of the villages were performed to identify blocks and
      houses.

      The study initially will follow a 3-Phase cross-sectional design. During Phase I, Atahualpa,
      El Tambo, and Prosperidad residents aged 60 years or more will be identified by means of a
      door-to-door survey and interviewed with validated questionnaires to identify those with
      relevant risk factors and suspected conditions of interest. In Phase II, certified
      neurologists will examine suspected cases as well as random samples of negative individuals,
      to assess reliability of field instruments and to determine prevalence of the investigated
      conditions. In Phase III, enrolled individuals will be invited to undergo complementary
      tests. Thereafter, incoming residents will be recruited and followed-up by means of yearly
      door-to-door surveys and other overlapping sources to estimate incidence of the disorders of
      interest.
