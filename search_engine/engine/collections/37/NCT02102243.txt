      improved after removal of aldosterone-producing adenoma. In patients with essential
      hypertension, plasma aldosterone levels have been also shown to positively correlate with
      indices of insulin resistance.

      Mechanism underlying aldosterone-induced insulin resistance is unknown. Aldosterone has been
      shown to interfere with insulin signaling the vascular cells by increasing production of
      reactive oxygen species via activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in decreased availability
      of nitric oxide (NO), the key mediator for insulin-mediated vasodilation. Treatment with
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Aldosterone has also been shown to increase resting
      sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity to the peripheral circulation. However, effects of
      aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin-mediated skeletal muscle
      vasodilation, sympathetic activation, and vascular oxidative stress have not been assessed in
      humans.

      The investigators will collect venous endothelial cells, and measure skeletal muscle
      microvascular perfusion using Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agents, and measure
      sympathetic nerve activity in normotensive controls (NT), stage 1 essential hypertensive
      subjects (ET), and patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) during hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp.
