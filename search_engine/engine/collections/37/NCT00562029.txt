      unknown at this time. Evidence of this hypothesis comes from accumulated data in bariatric
      surgery patients who underwent Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass or Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD)
      with or without a Duodenal Switch. Current evidence strongly supports this hypothesis with a
      long term (over 10 years) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus(T2DM) resolution rate of 84-86% following
      the gastric bypass and over 95% for the duodenal switch.

      The clinical resolution of T2DM is defined as independence of all anti-diabetic medications
      and maintaining a HbA1c less than 6.0. Recent rodent experiments by Francesco Rubino and
      subsequent human case reports by Cohen et al. supports the validity of this hypothesis. The
      modified procedure involved a roux-en-y bypass of the duodenum and 30-50cm of proximal
      jejunum, unaltering the stomach and pylorus resulted in resolution of T2DM with no weight
      loss in all subjects.
