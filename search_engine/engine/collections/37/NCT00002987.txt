      stage Hodgkin's disease given vincristine/doxorubicin/prednisolone/
      etoposide/cyclophosphamide/bleomycin (VAPEC-B) chemotherapy and involved field radiation vs
      mantle radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive either
      vincristine/doxorubicin/prednisolone/etoposide/cyclophosphamide/ bleomycin (VAPEC-B)
      chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy or mantle radiotherapy only. Patients receiving
      VAPEC-B are given prednisolone daily on weeks 1-6, doxorubicin IV along with cyclophosphamide
      IV on week 1, doxorubicin IV and etoposide orally for 5 days on week 3, and vincristine and
      bleomycin IV on weeks 2 and 4. Involved field radiotherapy is commenced at week 6, within 14
      to 21 days of the last chemotherapy treatment. Patients randomized to receive mantle
      radiotherapy only are given treatments daily for 4 weeks. Patients are followed every 3
      months for the first two years, every 4 months for the third year, every 6 months for the
      fourth and fifth years and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 400 patients will be accrued over 4-5 years.
