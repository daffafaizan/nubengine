      cell lung cancer treated with one of three different combined modality regimens of
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy. II. Compare the safety and toxicity of these
      treatment regimens in these patients. III. Compare the relapse free survival rate in these
      patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks for 2 courses, followed by radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7
      weeks beginning on day 42. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I
      followed by radiotherapy 5 times a week, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes weekly for 7 weeks beginning on day 42. Arm III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes weekly and radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7
      weeks beginning on day 1, followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes every 3 weeks for 2 courses beginning 3 weeks after concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 264 patients (88 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 20 months.
