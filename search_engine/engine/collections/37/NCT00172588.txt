      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).

      Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done to measure
      the degree of apoptosis in ESC. On the other hand, another half of ESC are cultured for 24h,
      and also Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done.
