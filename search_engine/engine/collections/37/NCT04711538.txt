      hearing loss. Patients who are refractory to conventional hearing augmentation .

      (CI) is a surgically implanted device consisting of external and internal components. An
      external microphone and speech processor worn behind the ear and convert sound into an
      electrical signal. A magnet held external transmitter sends the signal via electromagnetic
      induction through the skin to an internal receiver- stimulator which converts the signal into
      rapid electrical impulses which distributed to multiple electrodes on an electrode array
      implanted within the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the spiral ganglion cells
      along the cochlear turns, which then travel along the auditory nerve axons to the brain for
      sound perception .

      Imaging provides essential information about many of the anatomical variations that could be
      risky and should be considered by cochlear implant surgeon to avoid complications.

      Some variations are potential surgical hazards that may lead to problems during the surgery
      and may alert the surgeon regarding potential surgical dangers and complications .

      Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) are complementary to each
      other. They detect cochlear, middle ear anatomy and the anatomical variants .

      The strength of CT is visualization of the bony structures of the middle and inner ear and
      the strength of MRI is visualization of the fluid content of the membranous labyrinth,
      visualization of the vestibule-cochlear nerve in the fluid filled internal auditory canal and
      the cerebello-pontine angle .
