    
      Tarceva® (erlotinib) is a drug that blocks a receptor called the Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) on certain cells including tumor cells. Blocking this receptor has been shown
      to shrink tumors in some patients. Tarceva®(erlotinib) is approved for commercial use by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after
      failure of at least one chemotherapy treatment. However, it is not approved for the first
      treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which is the treatment used in this study.

      Patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer will receive daily Tarceva® (erlotinib)
      at 150 mg/day for 3 weeks followed by surgical resection at week 4. High resolution CT scans
      for tumor response assessment will be obtained at baseline and after 3 weeks of treatment
      with Tarceva® (erlotinib). Post-operative 2-year treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib) will be
      offered to patients who had at least a 50% (half) decrease in size of their tumor after
      treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib)and/or patients with tumors that were found to have the
      receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), on their tumor cells at the time of their
      surgery.

      Post-operative chemotherapy will be administered at the discretion of the treating physician
      to patients with stages IB and II. Patients who receive post-operative chemotherapy will
      begin Tarceva (erlotinib)no sooner than 3 weeks from Day 1 of the last chemotherapy cycle and
      no longer than 6 months after surgery. Follow-up for recurrence and survival will continue
      for 2 years.
