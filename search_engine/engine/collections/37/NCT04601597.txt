      center included patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and fully informed
      about the content of the study, possible benefits and risks. After obtaining informed
      consent, the patients were included in the method of continuous sampling and convenient
      sampling. According to the method of random control, the patients were grouped. In the
      control group, the length of catheter insertion is measured from the pre-puncture point to
      the shoulder or armpit. In the experimental group 1, the catheter insertion length is
      measured from the pre-puncture point to the midpoint of the clavicle, and in the experimental
      group 2 catheter insertion length is measured from the pre-puncture point to the
      sternoclavicular joint. With a single blind design, patients do not know the enrollment
      situation. The catheter was inserted by a full-time specialist nurse of intravenous therapy
      under ultrasound guidance combined with the modified Seedinger technique. The catheter was
      inserted according to the length of different measurement methods in different groups. After
      the catheter was inserted, X-ray examination was performed to determine the catheter tip
      position again. Data collection and follow-up observation will be conducted by researchers
      who have been uniformly trained. Record the baseline data of the patients in the group before
      catheterization, record the insertion status during catheterization, record the patient's
      catheter use and catheter sealing frequency every day during catheter placement, and evaluate
      catheter function and complications until extubation daily. Within 24 hours after extubation,
      the sonographer performed vascular ultrasound to check the endometrial condition of the
      catheter indwelling path.
