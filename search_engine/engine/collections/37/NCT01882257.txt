    
      Eligible subjects will sign informed consent, followed by:

      a 4 month period of maintaining a daily log of symptoms and medical events (such as
      hospitalization, starting antibiotics).

      An overnight sleep study will be performed in the subject's home Based on the results of the
      sleep study, noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) will be prescribed, according to standard
      medical practice. A clinical assessment, pulmonary function tests, and blood tests (blood
      glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and blood lipid profile) will be performed at the same time.

      Quality of life surveys will be performed at months 0, 3, 6, and 12. The daily symptom logs
      will be continued for 12 months. Data from the BiPAP units will be downloaded and repeat
      overnight monitoring to measure blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels will be performed
      periodically for 12 months after BiPAP is started.

      Subjects without sleep-disordered breathing will have the same clinical assessments and blood
      tests as subjects for whom BiPAP has been described.
