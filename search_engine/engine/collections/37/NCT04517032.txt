      afford or are unable to comply with a treatment plan for colorectal cancer.

      Aims:

        1. To identify the proportion of CRC patients suffering catastrophic expenditure due to
           out-of-pocket payments for cancer treatment.

        2. To determine the proportion of patients who are unable to comply with the treatment plan
           for CRC, at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after diagnosis.

        3. To identify barriers and solutions to CRC treatment compliance. Design: A mixed-methods
           study comprising quantitative pilot data from 3 tertiary cancer centres and qualitative
           work from interviews with patients and healthcare professionals.

      Participants: Patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcome:

      â€¢ Incidence of catastrophic expenditure due to out-of-pocket payments for cancer care at 3
      timepoints: 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after CRC diagnosis.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Compliance to the initial treatment plan at three timepoints: 6 weeks, 3 months and 6
           months after CRC diagnosis.

        -  Patients and healthcare professionals perspectives on patient compliance to CRC
           treatment.

        -  Identify the 5 main drivers (items charged to the patient) of CRC treatment cost.

        -  Colorectal cancer stage at the time of diagnosis.
