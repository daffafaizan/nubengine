      to the Cancer Assessment Clinic for their initial visit with a risk factor for prostate
      cancer (e.g. abnormal digital rectal exam [DRE] or elevated prostate serum antigen [PSA]
      level). Performing an mp-MRI in a man with risk factors for prostate cancer prior to an
      initial biopsy has become the standard of care for diagnosis of prostate cancer based on two
      large multi-center randomized control trials.

      At the second visit, which is standard of care, the Urologist (or delegate [Resident,
      Fellow]) will discuss targeted biopsy and will introduce the trial design obtaining informed
      consent to participate. If consent is obtained, the patient will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the standard transrectal (TR) ultrasound guided targeted fusion biopsy or the
      novel transperineal (TP) targeted fusion biopsy system which has also been preliminarily
      validated as being accurate for detection of significant prostate cancers at targeted biopsy.

      Patients will be notified regarding which method of targeted biopsy will be employed at time
      of scheduling.

      Both the TR and TP biopsies will be conducted in existing biopsy rooms in The Ottawa Hospital
      (TOH) and will employ a brief 30-minute post-procedural observation period at which point the
      patient is required to urinate prior to discharge. Level of pain will be recorded by the
      ultrasound technologists during the 30 minutes observation period as well.

      This study aims to compare ultrasound guided transrectal and transperineal targeted fusion
      biopsy for diagnosis of prostate cancer in abnormalities detected on MRI for the purpose of
      reducing or completely eliminating the risk of serious infection associated with the
      transrectal approach.
