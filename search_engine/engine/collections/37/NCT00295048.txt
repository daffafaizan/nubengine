      lack of independence, and poor functioning in social, occupational and other desired and
      expected community roles. The personal, social and economic costs of this illness are
      enormous. Neurocognitive deficits (e.g., slowed thinking, poor attention and memory,
      inadequate problem solving) are now recognized as core features of the illness, and primary
      contributors to functional impairment among patients (Bellack, Gold & Buchanan; 1999; Green,
      1996). While standard antipsychotic medications improve psychotic symptomatology in many
      patients, their impact on neurocognition is modest, at best, and dramatic functional deficits
      remain even after adequate pharmacological treatment (Keefe et al., 1999). Hence, there is
      growing interest in alternative treatment strategies to address cognitive deficits, including
      computer-assisted cognitive remediation.

      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive
      remediation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Fifty
      individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders will be recruited and randomly assigned
      to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer
      control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on behavioral performance in
      three dimensions: (1) on the trained learning exercises, (2) on neuropsychological measures,
      and (3) on role play based assessments of everyday problem solving. We hypothesize that CACR
      will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain.
