        -  Determine the confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with flavopiridol.

        -  Determine the 6-month time to treatment failure rate and overall survival rate of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient
           population.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the association of tumor response with pretreatment
           tumor proliferative and apoptotic rates in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
