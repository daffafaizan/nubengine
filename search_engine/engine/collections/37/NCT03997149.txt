      particularly among certain racial/ethnic groups including African-Americans. This disparity
      is partially attributable to greater exposure to psychological stress reported in this group
      (relative to non-Latino whites). Chronic psychological stress leads to weight gain directly
      through prolonged exposure to biological stress mediators such as cortisol and indirectly
      through behavioral pathways involving cortisol-induced increases in food consumption. An
      exciting arena of scientific advancements is focusing on identifying the specific pathways
      through which chronic stress influences eating behavior with emerging evidence to suggest
      that food intake, which is commonly increased during periods of stress, may serve as one key
      mechanism linking stress and obesity, particularly in African-American youth who are
      disproportionately exposed to chronic stress and have greater access to, and consumption of,
      energy-dense palatable foods. It is critical to advance understanding of the interplay
      between stress and food intake in understanding racial/ethnic disparities in pediatric
      obesity because stress eating represents a modifiable health behavior. That is, increased
      food intake during periods of elevated stress can be targeted for intervention in ways that
      may ameliorate the deleterious effects of stress on obesity risk. This project investigated
      the role of stress eating as a pathway linking chronic stress and obesity in African-American
      and non-Latino white adolescents.
