      a pH probe can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to the medication that
      is prescribed for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). The current treatment given to individuals
      who are diagnosed with LPR is a course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication. This
      medication reduces the amount of gastric acid that is produced and generally leads to symptom
      relief. In order to study whether the pH probe can help physicians predict if the patient
      will respond to PPI therapy, the physicians will measure the pH level of patients' throats
      before they start PPI medication. Subjects who agree to participate in this study will have a
      small flexible tube (about the width of a piece of uncooked spaghetti) placed in their
      throat. The physician will place the tube through the nose until the tip is in the back of
      the throat, high enough so that the patient will not feel it when they talk, eat, drink, or
      swallow. This tube measures the pH in the throat over a period of 24 hours and helps
      physicians study the relationship between pH level, LPR symptoms, and the effectiveness of
      PPI therapy. This study may help physicians find out if certain symptoms or characteristics
      can help them predict if the PPI medication will be effective for each patient. After probe
      removal, subjects will receive compensation. They will return to the clinic at their
      regularly scheduled follow-up visit with the physician, 8 to 12 weeks after starting the PPI
      medication. At that time, subjects can choose to participate in an optional probe placement.
