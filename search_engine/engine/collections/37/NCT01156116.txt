      diabetes, it remains unclear whether OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) has metabolic benefits. To determine the effect of 8-hour nightly CPAP treatment on
      glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes and OSA. In a randomized, controlled
      parallel group study, 39 participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either 8-hour nightly
      CPAP (n=26) or oral placebo (n=13). Sleep was polysomnographically recorded in the laboratory
      on each night. CPAP adherence was ensured by continuous supervision. Participants continued
      their daily daytime routine activities outside the laboratory. Glucose metabolism was
      assessed at baseline and after 2-weeks of assigned treatment using both the oral and
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests (OGTT and ivGTT, respectively). The primary outcome was
      the overall glucose response as quantified by the area under the curve for glucose during
      2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing.
