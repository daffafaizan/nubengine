      Coordination services in 2018 will be randomized to immediate or delayed implementation of
      the revised CCP model, with delayed implementers continuing to provide services under the
      original model until their assigned start date 9 months later, so that we can rigorously and
      contemporaneously compare effects of the original and revised CCP for the outcome of timely
      VS. The outcome measure will be derived from the New York City HIV surveillance registry, a
      population-based data source of longitudinal laboratory (VL, CD4) testing records on all
      diagnosed NYC PLWH, regardless of medical provider within NYC, and for periods extending
      before and after program enrollment or discontinuation.
