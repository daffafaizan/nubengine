      arm (Arm 1) versus the active surveillance arm (Arm 2).

      In study Arm 1, 6 doses of the vaccine will be administered intradermally at weeks 1, 2, 3,
      7, 11, and 15, followed by maintenance booster injections once every month which will
      alternate between low dose IL-2 alone (at weeks 19, 27 and 35) and Proscavax vaccine (at
      weeks 23, 31, 39) for 6 months.

      In study Arm 2, patients will undergo active surveillance and will not receive any Proscavax
      vaccine treatment.
