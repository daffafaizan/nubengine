    
      Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), who
      are either untreated or poorly controlled with existing ADHD therapy, will be recruited for a
      single, four-hour session.

      Each subject will be tested for lidocaine effectiveness using the application of lidocaine
      gel to the tongue and assessment by taste.

      The subjects will then be assigned to two arms, (1) lidocaine sensitive (effective) or (2)
      lidocaine insensitive (ineffective), and then randomized as to an intervention of potassium
      supplementation or a placebo.

      Each subject will:

        -  Complete questionnaires about their history of certain symptoms and a food diary.

        -  Get an ECG to exclude those with arrhythmias.

        -  Have their baseline serum potassium tested

        -  Have measures of ADHD symptoms performed.

      Then each subject will receive the intervention of a single dose of the potassium or placebo.

      After the wait of one hour, a repeat serum potassium and measurement of symptoms will be
      performed.

      Note; The FDA also requires a Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for all ADHD
      trials
