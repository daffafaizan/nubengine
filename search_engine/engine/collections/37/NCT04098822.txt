      This study is a multicenter prospective, non-interventional (i.e. naturalistic)
      post-marketing clinical follow up of men with urinary incontinence implanted with Virtue®
      Male Sling System by urologists who are experienced in the device. The patient will be
      followed for 12 months in routine real world clinical practice except for administration of
      subject questionnaire(s). Routine visits will be performed approximately at baseline
      (preoperative and implantation period), between 1 and 3 months (immediate post-operative
      period) and 12 months. Then questionnaires will be mailed annually during 2 additional years.
