    
      Patients will be preselected for inclusion in this study at the pain management center of
      Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale (EOC) Lugano, and will be
      informed about study-details by a study clinician. After informed consent signature, the
      participants with chronic intractable back or back and leg pain will be implanted with the
      stimulation lead(s). The leads are initially connected to an external trial neurostimulator.
      Patients will be implanted with two epidural leads and two subcutaneous leads. A three weeks
      trial phase will follow. The first two days after the leads implant will be without
      stimulation and thereafter alternating stimulation every week will start, randomly ordering
      the treatments using a Williams design balanced for first-order carryover effects (i.e.
      incorporating 6 different treatment orders), from:

        -  1) CON-SCS with Subcutaneous stimulation

        -  2) HF-SCS

        -  3) Combination Therapy A patient's favored SCS mode, providing that there is at least
           50% reduction in pain intensity on the NRS in the trial phase, will then be implanted
           and patients will be followed up for 12 months.

      Pain intensity and pain medication will be assessed with a pain diary at baseline and during
      the trial phase and will be furthermore measured after 3, 6, and 12 months after the
      implantation. Physical functioning, Pain Extent, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC),
      and Satisfaction with stimulation treatment (SST) will be assessed during the trial phase and
      will be furthermore measured after 3, 6, and 12 months after the Implantable Nerve Stimulator
      (INS) implantation. The other secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, and after 3, 6
      and 12 months.
