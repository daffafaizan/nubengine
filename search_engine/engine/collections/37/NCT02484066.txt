      (TBLB) and bronchial brushing by using virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) combined with
      endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and a Guide Sheath (GS) as a guide for diagnosing peripheral
      pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without radiographic fluoroscopy.The study is designed as a three
      centers prospective randomized controlled trial.The participating centers are Department of
      endoscopy , Shanghai chest Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, China. Department of
      endoscopy, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,
      China. Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical
      University, China. Patients are divided into two groups, VBN-EBUS-GS-X-ray group and
      VBN-EBUS-GS group. Each subject will be randomized to each group. The study is expected to
      enroll 436 patients at 3 centers.
