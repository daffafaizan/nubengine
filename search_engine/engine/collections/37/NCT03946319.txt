      psychiatric disorders and mental health issues once manifested to a preventative care model
      for integrative mental health in a way that is cost-effective and scalable. One of the
      principal areas of struggle in preventative mental health is self-report adherence and the
      ability for primary care physicians and non-psychiatrists to perform mental health
      surveillance with their patients. This study specifically examines the relationship between
      individuals and a novel self-report assessment tool. To do this, the investigators are
      performing a randomized controlled trial with two classes of users (the general public and
      patients undergoing treatment for mental health issues) for a six week trial comparing the
      novel self-report assessment tool to the standard of care assessment tools available to
      clinicians. Participants will be randomized to one of the two daily assessment regiments
      within the internet-delivered assessment tool: one that is representative of standard of care
      monitoring and one that is personalized both in terms of content and timing based on the
      participant's intake as well as ongoing participation. Neither the participants nor
      researcher will be aware of which arm the individual is randomized. After using the software
      for six weeks, the data will be analyzed specifically targeting self-adherence and assessment
      completion metrics to evaluate the potential benefits of a transdiagnostic assessment system
      over the standard-of-care monotopic assessment system. Assessment scoring is handled by an
      automated scoring engine, using the rules set forth by the standards in the assessment
      protocols. The study does not test the efficacy of the personalized assessments as a
      diagnostic instrument, there is no clinical decision support provided to clinicians during
      this study, and there is no treatment provided during this study.
