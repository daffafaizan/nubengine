    
      TAK-079 is being tested in a study population with moderate to severe SLE. This study will
      evaluate the safety and biologic activity of TAK-079 or matching placebo in combination with
      stable SLE background therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants across 3 sequentially enrolling cohorts.
      Each cohort will enroll 8 participants, where 6 participants will be assigned to TAK-079
      injection, and 2 participants will be assigned to Placebo. Participants will receive TAK-079
      or matching placebo in combination with principal investigator directed background therapy
      for SLE.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be followed up for the safety assessment for the
      additional 12 weeks up to Week 24 after receiving their last dose of study drug. Based on the
      clinical assessments, participants may complete or may advance to long-term safety follow up
      period for an additional 12-week safety monitoring period up to Week 36.
