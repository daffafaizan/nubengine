      Subjects were divided in two groups: a control group and an experimental group. Before the
      intervention of a physical exercise program, subjects performed a Finger Tapping Sequence to
      measure baseline performance. After the intervention, the assessment of the impact of
      exercise on motor memory consolidation was held in three stages: Training; 1 hour after
      training and 24 hours after training.
