      childhood. Ophthalmologist are trying to seek other more safe and effective treatment
      modalities to well control the tumor and preserve the visual function. Photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) is a potentially therapeutic approach for retinoblastoma which has been underestimated.
      In this study, we are gonging to investigate the the effectiveness and safety profiles of
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of human retinoblastoma.
