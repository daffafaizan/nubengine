      insulin versus placebo in people with HAND (n = 20) on stable ART medication. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 40 IU IN insulin R twice daily, or
      matched-volume placebo, which will be administered twice daily, taken after breakfast and
      again after dinner using a nasal delivery device. Serum glucose will be tested for
      hypoglycemia one hour after the initial administration of IN insulin or placebo and after
      administration at Weeks 1, 2, and 3. If the dose is tolerated and no side effects are
      reported the participant will continue in the study. If the dose is not tolerated due to
      hypoglycemia then the participant will be withdrawn from the study.

      The objectives of this study are as follows:

      Primary: Determine if IN insulin treatment administered twice daily for 4 months reduces
      overall neurocognitive deficits (based on the global z-score in people with HAND).

      Secondary: Measure effects of IN insulin on individual neuropsychological domains (e.g.,
      memory, processing speed, executive functions, motor functions) and on HAND disease
      progression; Define impacts of IN insulin on quality of life and mood in people with HAND;
      Investigate IN insulin's effects on HAND biomarker profiles in urine and blood.
