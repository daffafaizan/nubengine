      effectiveness of different decision support strategies for patients making treatment
      decisions about hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA). Eligible patient subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of two decision aids before their upcoming clinic visit with a
      participating orthopedic specialist. Participating providers are randomly assigned to either
      usual care or an intervention (a report that includes patients' goals and treatment
      preferences). Patient participants will complete three surveys at different time points:
      before their orthopedic visit, one week after the clinic visit, and 12 months later.
      Providers will complete a short survey for a subset of patient participants. The study is
      titled the DECIDE-OA study.
