    
      This is a mixed-method study, involving both surveys and ethnographic fieldwork. The research
      team will utilize the Collaboration and Satisfaction About Care Decisions (CSACD) survey
      instrument at regular intervals to assess nurse-physician collaboration. The instrument is
      validated and reliable and has been extensively tested. Permission was obtained to use the
      instrument. The ethnographic investigation will run concurrently and be performed by a
      doctoral student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). No part of the study will
      involve patient intervention. The study will be conducted in the surgical intensive care unit
      (SICU).

      The survey-based portion of the study is a prospective, randomized, crossover-controlled
      trial; it will generate ordinal data regarding nurse-physician collaboration and
      satisfaction. The ethnographic portion of the study will involve observation and interviews.
      The MIT student will engage in unobtrusive observational shadowing of APs and nurses
      throughout the study, and will formally interview each observed AP and nurse twice during the
      entire length of the study: once at the onset of the study, and once as the study draws to
      conclusion. This observational shadowing will include visits to the SICU. All participants
      will be consented for the study. Consent for and implementation of these methods will be
      undertaken in a manner consistent with current best research practice; extensive measures
      will be taken to protect staff confidentiality.
