      continuing care (intervention) or standard continuing care as usual (control). Participants
      will be recruited from the treatment programs in Los Angeles County, including Matrix
      Institute on Addictions, Tarzana Treatment, Twin Town, Phoenix House, and Cri-Help. During
      the 12-week active program, participants will be monitored monthly via telephone data
      collection. Both groups will be followed for 10-months using repeated assessments
      (self-report and urine specimens) at baseline (month 0) and at follow-up points (months 3, 6,
      and 9).
