      strengthening exercise, and customized arch support insoles on foot posture, balance and
      plantar pressure variables in individuals with flexible pes planus. Forty-two individuals
      with flexible pes planus will be recruited into the study according to the inclusion
      criteria. Participants will be randomly divided into three groups: (1) Exercise, (2) Insole,
      (3) Exercise plus Insole. Exercises will be performed three times per week for six weeks,
      also custom-made insoles will be worn for six weeks. Foot posture will be assessed using the
      Navicular drop, Valgus index and Foot posture index-6. Balance performance will be assessed
      by the Balance Master System (NeuroComÂ® International Inc., USA). Plantar pressure variables
      will be recorded by the pressure sensitive mat (Tekscan, USA) mounted in the middle of the
      6-meter walkway in three sessions: (1) Upright standing, (2) Walking at different speeds:
      self-selected slow, normal and fast speeds, (3) Walking just after the heel-rise test for
      endurance. The assessments will be made pre/post intervention and at 6-weeks follow-up.
