      but also patient education by the nurses and medical staff. The settings are generally
      adjusted during the daytime in awake patients. The appropriateness of these settings is
      generally not optimal during sleep as many respiratory events (hypopnoea, apnea, leaks,
      desynchronization, and glottic closure) may occur under NIV then reducing the effectiveness
      of treatment. These nocturnal abnormalities are routinely evaluated by measuring their
      consequences, i.e. oxygen desaturation and the level of PaCO2 after wake up. Some teams are
      now proposing to better characterize what happens when using NIV during sleep using
      polysomnography (PSG). The precise characterization of residual events under treatment may
      allow optimizing ventilator settings.
