      total hip arthroplasty (THA) at UPMC Shadyside. The safety and efficacy of this technique has
      been demonstrated by multiple studies. Ropivacaine 0.2% was used for many years at UPMC
      Shadyside and throughout the UPMC system and this concentration of ropivacaine is the
      standard local anesthetic utilized by multiple other studies. However, this concentration of
      ropivacaine was later decreased to 0.1% in our institution in order to decrease patient's
      motor weakness and promote postoperative physical therapy. Patients were clinically observed
      to continue to have adequate postoperative analgesia while demonstrating improved motor
      function. A randomized, double blinded clinical trial has never compared 0.1 and 0.2%
      ropivacaine.
