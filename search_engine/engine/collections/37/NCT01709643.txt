      insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease. Little is known about the dietary
      determinants and the time course of this ectopic fat accumulation. Therefore the general aim
      of this project is to develop and validate methodology to follow postprandial hepatic and
      muscular lipid retention. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a
      well-established tool for noninvasive quantification of intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and
      intramyocellular lipids (IMCL). Previous studies have suggested a relatively rapid regulation
      of IHL and IMCL levels, indicated by changes in these total lipid pools after high fat diets
      of 3 or 4 days. Although IHL and IMCL levels seem to change rapidly, data on IHL and IMCL
      levels after a single meal are lacking.
