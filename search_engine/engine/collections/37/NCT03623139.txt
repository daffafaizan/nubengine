      (a 6-month intervention period and a 6-month follow-up period). A total of 226 patients will
      be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) Standard
      medical and dietary care (control group) or 2) Structured training and education in the BCC
      concept in addition to standard medical and dietary care.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the six months effect of structured training and
      education in the BCC concept compared to standard dietary care on glycaemic control as
      assessed by HbA1c or MAGE (mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions).
