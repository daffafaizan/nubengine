      incidence of sustained obstetric anal sphincter injuries is increasing.

      When the tear extend beyond the external anal sphincter its called 'OASIS' that might lead to
      either immediate of delayed anal incontinence. Anal incontinence is associated with
      significant medical, hygiene and social problems. Use of perineal ultrasound as a bedside
      test immediately after vaginal delivery could improve the diagnosis and determining the
      degree of these perineal traumas. This increased detection could lead to improved primary
      repair of the external and internal anal sphincter resulting in reduced rates of anal
      incontinence and improved quality of life for women
