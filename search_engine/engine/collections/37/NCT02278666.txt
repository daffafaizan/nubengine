      undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement due to symptomatic aortic stenosis who consented
      to the use of their personal data. After surgery patients will be followed up to a minimum of
      12 months. In-hospital and follow-up outcomes of the different surgical approaches will be
      analysed.
