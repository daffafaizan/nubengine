      for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. However, these drugs may
      cause nail pigmentation which reduces quality of life in patients. We conducted this study to
      investigate nail pigmentation and other skin changes associated with anthracyclines in
      combination with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens in breast cancer patients who
      received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Besides, we aim to evaluate the effect of ice
      water immersion of hands on nail pigmentation caused by chemotherapy.

      The first phase is an observational study. Breast cancer patients who received anthracyclines
      combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens for adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy were followed up until six months after the last course of chemotherapy. The
      second phase is a prospective phase II study. Early breast cancer patients who plan to
      receive anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens for
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are treated with ice water immersion of the left hands
      while their right hands serve as control. The primary end point is the degree of nail
      pigmentation. The other end points are the incidence of nail pigmentation in both hands, the
      degree and the incidence of onycholysis, the time from the first chemotherapy to the
      occurrence of nail pigmentation/onycholysis, the recovery of nail pigmentation/onycholysis,
      and patient comfort.
