      derived mesenchymal stromal cells, the study will determine the systemic inflammatory
      potential of cell therapy measured by C-reactive protein levels (CRP), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and complete blood count in peripheral blood. Finally, the study
      will aim at determining if other markers of inflammatory response and remodeling are
      modulated by this therapy.
