      market.The newly developed C-Leg 4 aims to provide improved standing function while in the
      same time offering technology of kneeÂ´s previous version (C-Leg 3). Since added functional
      benefit of a knee joint cannot be anticipated just due to the fact that the knee is
      controlled by the microprocessor, the aim of this post-market study is to evaluate the
      safety, functional mobility and satisfaction of the microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee
      components C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4 in comparison to mechanical knee joints. Additional goal is to
      improve the methodological quality of research conducted in the field.
