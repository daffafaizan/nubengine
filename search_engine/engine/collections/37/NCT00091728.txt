      possible increased risk of Chlamydial and Gonococcal sexually transmitted infections, and to
      determine if any increased risk appeared to be mediated by the extent of cervical ectopy.

      Eight hundred and nineteen women, ages 15 to 45 years, were recruited from an inner city
      clinic and from a nearby suburban clinic. The women were classified into three groups based
      on type of contraceptive used. One group used oral contraceptives; the second used injectable
      depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA); and the third group used non-hormonal contraceptive
      methods. Women from each group were followed at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment to
      determine if a new infection with Chlamydia or Gonorrhea had occurred and to evaluate the
      extent of cervical ectopy present.
