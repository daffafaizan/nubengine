      even though over 90% patients can recover 12 months after operation. Many urologists are
      trying to improve the surgery, but these new technics mainly help locally advanced prostate
      cancer by better preserving Neurovascular Bundles, urethra, external sphincter or other
      periurethral supporting structures. Sustainable functional urethral reconstruction (SFUR) is
      a novel technic which can improve early urinary incontinence for both locally and locally
      advanced prostate cancer, and even for those with high volume prostate by providing adequate
      urethral length with bladder neck tubularization and sustainable periurethral support with
      peritoneal flap. The purpose of this study is to compare early continence recovery, oncologic
      outcomes and postoperative complications after RARP with or without this new technic.
