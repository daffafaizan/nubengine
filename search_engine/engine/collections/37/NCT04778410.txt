    
      This study consists of 3 safety run-in cohorts;

        -  Safety Run-in Cohort 1 (Mag + Ven + Aza)

        -  Safety Run-in Cohort 2 (Mag + MEC)

        -  Safety Run-in Cohort 3 (Mag + CC-486)

      Participants will receive treatment at the assigned dose level for at least 4 cycles in the
      Safety Run-in cohorts, after which they may continue at the assigned dose level or switch to
      the RP2D upon agreement between the investigator and the sponsor. After completion of each
      safety run-in cohort and identification of the RP2D for that cohort, participants will be
      enrolled into the corresponding Phase 2 cohorts;

        -  Phase 2 Cohort 1 (Mag + Ven + Aza)

        -  Phase 2 Cohort 2 (Mag + MEC)

        -  Phase 2 Cohort 3 (Mag + CC-486)

      Cycle length is 28 days for both the Safety Run-in and Phase 2 cohorts.
