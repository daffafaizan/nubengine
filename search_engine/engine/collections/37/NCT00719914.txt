      eptifibatide added to an upstream double-bolus and infusion regimen of eptifibatide
      administered intravenously and initiated early in the ER will result in significant
      additional clot resolution in vivo when compared with an IC injection of placebo (saline).
      The primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is the improvement in percent
      diameter stenosis of the culprit artery following the IC bolus administration of eptifibatide
      vs. IC placebo (saline) as assessed with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).
