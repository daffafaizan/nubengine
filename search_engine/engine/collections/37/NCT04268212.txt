      physical activity on postprandial glucose responses in type 2 diabetic patients.

      Methods: A total of 8 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to two sequences
      (AB, BA) with two treatments (A or B) using a 2 x 2 randomized cross-over design: A) 100 ml
      of bitter melon juice administered 15 minutes prior to the 75-g oral glucose load; B) 30
      minutes walking at moderate-intensity performed 15 minutes after the oral glucose load.
