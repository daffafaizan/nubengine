    
      Family Lifestyle Overweight Prevention Program (FLOW) is an intensive, multi-component
      obesity intervention designed to take place during physical education class. This
      intervention has established efficacy at improving standardized BMI among low income,
      Hispanic middle school students with overweight classification or obesity. However, the
      efficacy of individual components of the intervention have not been investigated. The purpose
      of this study was to compare only the physical activity component of FLOW to a physical
      education class as usual. The primary outcome of the study is time spent in moderate-vigorous
      physical activity. Secondarily the study evaluated the impact of the intervention on
      standardized BMI.
