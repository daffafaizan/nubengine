      given BKM120 and panitumumab and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have
      and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then
      more patients are asked to join the study and are given higher doses of BKM120. If severe
      toxicity is seen, doses of BKM120 and/or panitumumab doses may be lowered in subsequent
      patients. Patients joining the study later on will normally get higher doses of BKM120 than
      patients who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but
      temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
