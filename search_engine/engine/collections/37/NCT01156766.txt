      which the fractures of the lower extremity of the radius (16 % of fractures seen in
      emergencies) is going to increase. Several surgical techniques exist of which in particular
      locking plates and intrafocal pinning.

      The availability of new materials (locking plates with angular stability) seems to reduce the
      risks of osteosynthesis failure and seems to give more constant results: hawever, the price
      to pay is a more invasive technique and a superior cost. The rehabilitation seems also
      faster, allowing the possibility to get back the maximum of autonomy.

      These clinical facts need of course to be validated.
