      UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 are reported to increase CPT-11-related toxicity in Asian patients.
      Moreover, the area under concentration curve (AUC) ratio of SN-38G to SN-38 is decreased in
      Asian patients having UGT1A1 *28 or UGT1A1*6. This implicated that the current standard dose
      of CPT-11 would be overdosing for homozygous UGT1A1*28/*28, *6/*6 or *28/*6 patients.

      The study is designed to investigate the role of prospectively dose reduction of CPT-11 in
      toxicity, tumor response and pharmacokinetics for homozygous UGT1A1 patients, and compare
      these parameters to standard dose of CPT-11 for wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous UGT1A1
      patients.
