      Intratissue Percutaneous Electrolysis (IPE) in patients with chronic PT. For this purpose a
      randomized clinical trial will be carried out, with a sample of patients diagnosed of chronic
      PT based on signs, symptoms and clinical examination. Subjects will be randomly allocated to
      four different groups: group E1, IPE will be applied, participants will believe they are
      receiving IPE; group E2, IPE will be applied, participants will believe they are receiving
      placebo; group P1, IPE will not be applied, participants will believe they are receiving IPE;
      and group P2, IPE will not be applied, participants will believe they are receiving placebo.

      IPE treatment will consist of a total of 3 sessions, with a time interval of one week between
      the 1st and 2nd sessions and 2 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd sessions.

      To evaluate the effect of intervention, the subjects will be assessed at baseline (V0), one
      week after the end of the intervention (V1) and 3 weeks after the intervention (V2).

      In V0, sociodemographic (sex, age, profession, height, body mass index (BMI), sport activity,
      hours of sport per week) and clinical data (associated pathologies, affected lower limb,
      dominant lower limb, duration of symptoms) will be registered. In each assessment time
      information regarding BMI, sports activity, hours of sport per week and location of pain will
      be obtained. Moreover, in all assessments participants were evaluated for four physical
      performance tests, pain and functional scales, ultrasound examination, pressure pain
      thresholds, conditioned pain modulation, and expectations questionnaires.
