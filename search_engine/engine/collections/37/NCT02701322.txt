      regurgitation. VPI is more common in patients who previously underwent cleft palate repair,
      in craniofacial syndromes such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, or in neuromuscular diseases.
      Part of the work-up sometimes includes videofluoroscopic examination of the palate's movement
      during speech. This procedure involves ionizing radiation and requires adequate collaboration
      by the examinee. The examination set-up is foreign to the child and can cause stres and
      anxiety which can hinder the examination's accuracy and completion. Medical clowns
      professionalise in stress relieve.

      In this prospective controlled study, the study group will be accompanied by a medical clown
      from the arrival to the premise, through the actual examination and after exiting the exam
      room. The medical clown will explain about the upcoming examination and will induce a less
      stressed atmosphere. After the examination the clown will close the session for the patient.

      The control group will do the same procedure but without a medical clown. Factors such as
      pulse, total time in the examination room, net time of exposure to radiation and quality of
      data will be collected for each patient. The patient (if 7 year old and up) and his
      caregivers will fill up after completion of the examination a short questionnaire about their
      experience.

      The data will be collected and summarized and then a statistical analysis will be made in
      order to compare the study group and the control group.
