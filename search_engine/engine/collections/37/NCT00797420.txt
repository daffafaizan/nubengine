      loading dose in infants and toddlers < 2 years of age with suspected sepsis. There will be
      two treatment groups: single fluconazole loading dose 25 mg/kg; fluconazole loading dose
      25mg/kg followed by 12 mg/kg daily for total of 5 days. There will be three age cohorts
      within each group: pre-term < 30 week EGA infants > 48 hours and < 31 days; > 30 weeks EGA
      infants > 48 hours and < 31 days; infants ≥ 31 days and < 2 years of age. The study requires
      administration of fluconazole over 1-5 days depending on treatment group followed by 1 week
      of safety monitoring. Six to eight 100 µL PK samples will be obtained over the 5 days of drug
      administration. The risks are reasonable vs. the benefits and have been minimized
      appropriately. There may be benefit to the subjects (administration of empirical antifungal
      therapy), and information from the study may benefit a large number of other infants and
      toddlers with suspected or proven fungal sepsis. There is a data analysis plan.
