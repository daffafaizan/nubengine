    
      Within this trial 50 postmenopausal women receive a vaginal estrogen therapy as treatment for
      symptomatic vaginal atrophy. The sustainability of vaginal estrogen therapy after the end of
      therapy has not yet been investigated.

      All participants will be asked to come for the following 7 visits.

        -  Visit 1: Standard Gynecological examination; Inclusion and exclusion criteria check

        -  Visit 2: Handing out of Gynoflor (estrogen) for a 6 weeks treatment.

        -  Visit 3 (Study Start): After using the vaginal estrogen for 6 weeks, a vaginal swap will
           be done to measure the vaginal maturation index (VMI). The participants will also
           receive a questionnaire to define some subjective parameters. The parameters measured at
           visit 1 will count as reference. The estrogen therapy will now be sustained.

        -  Visit 4-6: Measuring of the VMI and handing out the questionnaires to define subjective
           parameters.
