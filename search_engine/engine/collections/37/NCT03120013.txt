      in which progressive ataxia of gait, limb dysmetria, oculomotor deficits, dysarthria and
      kinetic tremor are the prominent clinical manifestations. Both the hereditary and sporadic
      forms usually present in young adulthood, and are characterized by atrophy of cerebellar or
      brainstem structures. Currently, cerebellar ataxia lack effective disease-modifying
      therapies.

      Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique, which
      has been demonstrated to modulate cerebellar excitability and improve symptoms in patients
      with cerebellar ataxias. The present randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study will
      investigate whether a two-weeks' treatment with cerebellar anodal tDCS and spinal cathodal
      tDCS can improve symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and can
      modulate cerebello-motor connectivity, at short and long term.

      Subjects will be randomized in two groups, one receiving a 10 day (5 days/week for 2 weeks)
      treatment with anodal cerebellar and cathodal spinal tDCS and the other receiving sham
      stimulation with identical parameters. After the intervention, patients will be reassessed
      with a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation at 2 weeks, 1 months and 3 month after
      treatment.
