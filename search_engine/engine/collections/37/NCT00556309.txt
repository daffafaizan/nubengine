      are being treated using endovascular coiling. The researcher can use Optical Coherence
      Tomography image at the rime of initial angiography with unruptured aneurysms, and at the
      three month follow up catheter angiogram.

      Optical Coherence Tomography image can follow the therapeutic coiling of the aneurysm, the 6F
      endocatheter and the microcatheter used for the coiling procedure place in the internal
      carotid artery and parent artery lumen follow with Optical Coherence Tomography fiber insert
      through the lumen of the tube on which the image can obtain.
