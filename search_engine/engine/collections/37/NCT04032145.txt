      and socially active is possible. During the past decade, museums have become involved in the
      care of patients by using art to improve their quality of life and well-being. Museums have,
      thus, emerged as new partners in public health. Very few programs developed by museums have
      focused on elders. Only one focused on elders in situation of early frailty and demonstrated
      that it was possible, through participatory visual art-based activities, to improve the
      health status of elders living at home.
