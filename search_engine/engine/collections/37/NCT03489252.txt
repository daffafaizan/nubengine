      I. Determine compliance with remote activity monitoring (RAM) in patients receiving
      radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate feasibility of recruitment to the Remote Activity Monitoring Pilot (RAMP).

      II. Investigate patient acceptability of RAM. III. Evaluate compliance with electronic
      patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this patient population.

      IV. Estimate the change in average daily steps associated with a one-unit change in health
      score as collected on ePRO analysis (analyze associations between RAM data and ePROs).

      V. Investigate correlations among step data, quality of life (QOL), and emergency room (ER)
      visits/hospitalizations.
