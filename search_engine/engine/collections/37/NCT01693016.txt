      need of blood transfusion. The standard for monitoring hemoglobin (Hb) is the measurement of
      blood samples. The novel technique of non-invasive continuous measurement of Hb using Pulse
      CO-Oximetry may allow measuring Hb without obtaining blood samples.

      This new technique has not been tested yet in children undergoing anesthesia for elective
      surgical procedures. In this study the investigators compare the non-invasive Hb measurement
      with MasimoÂ® technology (SpHb) with the standard Hb measurement using ABL-800 Flex (BGA) and
      Siemens Advia (labHb, reference method) before the children undergo the surgical procedure.
