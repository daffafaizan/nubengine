      written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry
      (inclusion criteria). At baseline, the participants will provide biological samples and they
      will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner (investigator and participant) to one of
      the intervention groups, i.e. consumption of the novel biscuit (biscuit enriched with
      mushroom powder containing 3g of Î²-glucans) or consumption of the placebo biscuit for 3
      months,. After a washout period of 2 months, the subjects will consume the novel biscuit or
      the placebo biscuit in a cross-over design for 3 more months. Throughout the interventional
      period subjects' dietary intake, anthropometrical data and gastrointestinal symptoms will be
      monitored. Meanwhile at baseline and at the end of each trimester physical activity, mental
      health and sleep habits will be evaluated with the use of questionnaires and biological
      samples will be provided for further analysis.
