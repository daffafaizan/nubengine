      colonoscopy (or mammography in breast cancer screening) there is currently no formalised
      program to help ensure Radiologists interpret CTC accurately. Colonoscopists are highly
      regulated, must be accredited and have ongoing quality assurance metrics, based on evidence
      linking these to clinical outcomes. Conversely, for CTC in the United Kingdom, there is no
      accreditation process, little regulatory oversight and no universally-accepted metrics to
      monitor quality or diagnostic performance.

      Radiologists who interpret CTC images are often inexperienced; one-third have interpreted
      <300 cases in total and 20% report <100 cases per annum (the minimum recommendation).
      Futhermore, in clinical practice across the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHS BCSP)
      CTC may have up to a 50% lower cancer and polyp detection rate than colonoscopy. Missed
      abnormalities at CTC are likely to underpin this difference, as centres with highly
      experienced radiologists (>1000 cases) using 3-dimensional interpretation have significantly
      higher detection rates.

      There is a Quality Assurance (QA) framework for the NHS BCSP (with an overseeing QA Committee
      for Radiology) but recommendations are largely based on opinion rather than evidence and any
      radiologist can report CTC, without accreditation; a fact which our patient representatives
      find extremely disappointing.

      Prior to wide-scale implementation of a possible accreditation programme and to justify both
      financial and human resource, Public Health England and the British Society of
      Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists have mandated that such a program is
      scientifically proven to improve Radiologist performance. Consequently, this project will
      investigate training and assessment methods to improve diagnostic accuracy and elucidate the
      factors associated with higher Radiologist sensitivity.
