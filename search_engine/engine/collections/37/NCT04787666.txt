      non-invasive mask ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula (high-flow
      nasal oxygenation) and non-invasive ventilation with a helmet in patients with mild and
      moderate respiratory failure in the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery. It
      assumes 90 randomized patients:30 patients in three study groups male and female aged 30 to
