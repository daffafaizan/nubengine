      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients with previously untreated CD20-positive bulky
           stage II, or stage III or IV follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with a lower-
           or high-dose of ofatumumab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To establish whether the therapeutic effect of single-agent ofatumumab is sufficiently
           promising to warrant evaluation in subsequent randomized, ofatumumab-based, biologic
           doublet trials.

        -  To evaluate the two ofatumumab doses by independent comparison of response, PFS, and
           toxicity to a historical control in previously untreated patients with follicular NHL.

        -  To prospectively validate the FLIPI2 prognostic index in low- and intermediate-risk
           patients and compare to low- and intermediate-risk stratified patients by standard FLIPI
           scoring to determine a more reliable indicator of response and PFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive high-dose ofatumumab IV over 2-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
           and then once monthly in months 3-9.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a lower dose of ofatumumab IV over 2-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15,
           and 22 and then once monthly in months 3-9.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients may undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 8 years.
