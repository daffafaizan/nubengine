      methylation patterns in urine that are associated with bladder cancer. It is intended for use
      as a noninvasive method for monitoring for tumor recurrence in conjunction with cystoscopy
      inpatients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer This is a, multicenter, prospective,
      blinded study to evaluate the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of a novel methylation
      test for the detection of recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma in patients with a history of
      bladder cancer undergoing surveillance.
