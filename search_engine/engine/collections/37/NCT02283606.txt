      elasticity.these changes may affect success or failure in induction of labor.The elasticity
      of the uterine cervix is usually evaluated clinically and subjectively by vaginal examination
      (bishop's score) which is not very predictive.We aim to measure the elasticity quantitatively
      and objectively.The difference in strain, in the area of the internal os , is often
      illustrated by a color map, where low stiffness (soft tissue) is indicated in red, middle
      stiffness is in green and high stiffness (hard tissue) is in blue.The color maps will be
      compared between patients with successful and failed inductions.
