    
      An estimated 380 patients will be included

      Four patient categories will be included enabling to study patients with different stages of
      AF progression;

        1. Patients without history of atrial fibrillation, without new onset atrial fibrillation
           detected by continuous rhythm monitoring after surgery (control group),

        2. Patients without history of atrial fibrillation, with new onset atrial fibrillation
           detected by continuous rhythm monitoring,

        3. Patients with self-terminating atrial fibrillation at inclusion, and

        4. Patients with non-self-terminating atrial fibrillation at inclusion. At baseline
           in-depth phenotyping and genotyping will be performed. Continuous rhythm monitoring will
           also be performed in all patients. The combination of extensive phenotyping, genotyping
           and atrial fibrillation burden follow-up offers the unique opportunity to study the
           atrial tissue alterations and atrial gene expression changes in different stages of
           atrial fibrillation progression and to correlate these data to the phenotype of the
           patients.
