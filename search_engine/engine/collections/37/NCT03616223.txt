      study will assess the safety of FX-322 given as a single intratympanic injection in subjects
      with a medical history of sensorineural hearing loss that is associated with noise exposure
      or sudden hearing loss. Safety will be evaluated both systemically (lab and clinical
      monitoring) and locally (otoscopy and audiometry) in 24 subjects, and a blood PK profile of
      FX-322 will also be determined.
