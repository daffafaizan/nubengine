      for the patient. The conventional methods of repair available today have disappointing
      results with high recurrence rates and serious complications. Some of the complications can
      be related to the introduction of foreign material into the abdominal wall. The investigators
      hypothesis is that the use of autologous full-thickness skin graft as reinforcement material
      can offer an alternative with fewer complications and recurrences.

      Patients with symptomatic parastomal hernia will be included in a prospective randomized
      multicenter study comparing reinforcement with conventional synthetic mesh (with the best
      available technique today), to full thickness skin grafts placed in an intraperitoneal
      position. The intervention will be blinded to the participants, nursing staff and the
      follow-up staff. The participants will be followed up at 3, 12 and 36 months monitoring
      complications, recurrences, quality of life, strength of the abdomino-lumbar girdle and
      calculations will be done on the health economics.
