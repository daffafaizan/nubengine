      after infection. Despite advances in intensive care technologies sepsis remains an important
      and life-threatening problem. Sepsis is the most common cause of death in the intensive care
      unit.

      Local or systemic release of bacteria-derived compounds, leading to the production of
      proinflammatory cytokines, induce systemic inflammatory reactions in septic patients.
      Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) such as hemodialysis (CVVHD), hemofiltration
      (CVVH) or hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with conventional high-flux membranes allow to control
      fluid and electrolyte balance, and to improve the hemodynamic status of the patients.
      However, conventional high flux membranes have a limited permeability for sepsis-associated
      mediators with molecular weights in the range of 15.000 to 60.000 Da.

      A promising approach to enhance the mediator removal is to use membranes having larger pores
      and permeability characteristics than those currently used in CRRT.

      For that purpose a High Cut-Off (HCO) membrane has been developed and is manufactured by
      Gambro Research.After demonstrating the safety as well as the cytokine removal effectiveness
      in a clinical pilot study this study will assess the influence of the HCO treatment on the
      disease progression in septic patients.
