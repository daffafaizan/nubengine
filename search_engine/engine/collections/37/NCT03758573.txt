      Care Unit of the University Hospital of UNIVASF. Will be included individuals of both sexes,
      aged 18 years or older, who are on invasive mechanical ventilation and who obtain the Free
      and Informed Consent Form, signed by the responsible family member. Subjects will be
      randomized into two groups (training and control). The inspiratory (MIP), expiratory (MEP)
      and peak expiratory flow pressures will be evaluated. The training group will perform
      respiratory muscle training, using the Powerbreath equipment, with initial loading of 40% of
      MIP, 7 days a week, 2 times a day. Morbidities that have repercussions on diaphragmatic
      contraction and end-stage disease will be used as exclusion criteria. The sample data will be
      analyzed through the SPSS 22.0 program. The significance level of the study will be set at 5%
      (p <0.05).
