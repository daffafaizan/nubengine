      essential in there treatment. Minimal invasive surgery with video assisted thoracic surgery
      is more and more used in pediatric population, but his evaluation for resection of thoracic
      neurogenic tumors is little studied.

      Thoracotomy has specific long terms post operative complications including scoliosis,
      shoulder elevation, winged scapula and asymmetric nipples. When compared to thoracotomy,
      thoracoscopy shows less operative blood loss, shorter duration of chest tube and length of
      stay.

      Recently, the indications of thoracoscopic approach have been assessed according to the
      presence or absence of image-defined risk factors (IDRF) at diagnosis and after preoperative
      chemotherapy in a monocentric retrospective study. The authors concluded that thoracoscopy
      could be used for all paravertebral locations without IDRF except the IDRF of T9-T12 location
      and the presence of an intraspinal component but should be avoided for perivascular locations
      due to tight adherences of the tumour to the vessels and hence the risk of important
      bleeding.

      The investigators aimed to conduct a multicentric retrospective study to assess the role of
      thoracoscopy in neurogenic thoracic tumours according to the presence or absence of IDRF at
      diagnosis, the surgical complications and outcome.
