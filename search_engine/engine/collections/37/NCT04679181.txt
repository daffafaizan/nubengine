      dependence, with sometimes serious consequences resulting in an admission in Nursing Home.
      While the low require a medical doctor in each Nursing Home, one third of the Nursing Home
      does not have. Some Nursing Homes can be in a tricky situation with no medical doctor
      coordinator and the difficulty of access to a medical doctor who covered a wide territory. In
      this context, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence coupled with Telemedicine is a new
      opportunity to find solution in healthcare organization and to develop advanced geriatric
      medical practice in medical desert territory. The goal of this study is to quantify and
      characterize the acceptability of Artificial Intelligence and Telemedicine in Nursing Home
      located in medical desert for patients, nurses, and medical doctor.

      All the patients were examined by a nurse. The symptoms filled by the nurse in the Artificial
      Intelligence/Telemedicine device are sent and then analyzed by a distant medical doctor to
      purpose a care. The nurse also solicited the attending medical doctor as usual care.

      The recommendations of the both medical doctors could be (i) Vital emergency, (ii) non-vital
      emergency necessitate medication or hospitalization, and (iii) non-emergency with medical
      appointment.
