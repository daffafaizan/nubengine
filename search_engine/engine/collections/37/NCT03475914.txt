    
      Twelve individuals with guttate psoriasis and 12 individuals with vulgaris psoriasis have
      been enrolled at Dermatological Unit of IRCCS Galeazzi Institute, Milan.

      Patients selected for the psoriasis vulgaris group had a course of disease stable for at
      least 1 month before collection. The second group presented guttate psoriasis, defined as
      "eruptive", that is characterized by a rapid appearance and worsening of the clinical
      presentation within the month preceding the visit.

      From each participant, a punch was used to obtain a cutaneous sample from both a lesion and
      healthy skin area of 2 mm2 belonging to the left gluteus, for a total of 48 biological
      samples. Participants were selected and included in the study according to the following
      criteria: i) over 18 years of age; ii) use of a free-preservatives soap with moisturizing
      function; iii) no use of probiotics; iv) no use of antibiotics; v) no treatment with
      corticosteroids, biological drugs, methotrexate or retinoids in the month prior the sampling;
      vi) no use of topical corticosteroids, vitamin D derivatives or phototherapy; vi) no chronic
      or systemic infections; vii) no cutaneous acute infections; viii) no allergy to pollen, food
      and drugs ix) no pets. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

      A metagenomics approach, performed by the use of Ion torrent Personal machine, were used to
      investigate the bacterial composition of the skin microbiota associated to each samples
      collected.

      After sequencing, the data analysis were focused on the bacterial biodiversity and microbial
      networks existing in the skin microbiota to evaluate a hypothetical role of bacteria in the
      complex pathophysiological mechanisms involved in psoriasis.
