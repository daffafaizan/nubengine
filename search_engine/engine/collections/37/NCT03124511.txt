      to neural damage. A lesion to the somatosensory nervous system caused by mechanical trauma,
      metabolic disease, neurotoxic chemicals, infection or tumor invasion may give rise to
      neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain affects around 8% of the population and may negatively
      impact the individual's quality of life; moreover, the condition leads to significant costs
      to the healthcare system and society. Not all subjects with such a lesion develop neuropathic
      pain, and those who do develop neuropathic pain have varying degrees of symptom severity,
      impact and outcomes and may respond unpredictably to treatment.

      The interaction between genetics and environmental and clinical factors in a susceptible
      individual most likely contribute to the variation in pain prevalence and severity. A better
      understanding of the exact nature of these risk factors and their interactions will
      ultimately improve the patients' health, both in terms of recognizing patients at risk and
      identifying new treatment modalities.

      Genetic, neurophysiological and psychological factors all influence the risk of developing
      persistent pain. It is therefore possible to describe a genetic, neurophysiological and
      psychological profile, in particular in patients experiencing neuropathic pain after surgery
      and/or neurotoxic chemotherapy.
