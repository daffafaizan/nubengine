      and commitment to the study. Those still interested and eligible will be randomized to two
      groups described below and will continue the study for 3 more weeks. There will be follow up
      surveys at various time points while wearing the wristband (1 week, 2 week, 3 weeks) and a
      final survey at T=3 months.

      The intervention group will continue to wear the wristband and the wristband will deliver a
      slight electric stimulus every time it is pressed.

      The placebo group will wear continue to press the button on the wristband but it will not
      give a slight electric stimulus when pressed. Both groups will wear the device for a total of
      4 weeks.
