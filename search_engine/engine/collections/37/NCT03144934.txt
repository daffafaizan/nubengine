      assigned to four cohorts (five if necessary) and administered a single dose of GX-I7 solution
      or placebo drug for intravaginal injection at the visit 3 (Day0) and 7 (Day28). After
      completing scheduled tests at the visit 6 (Day 14), safety-related data of each cohort will
      be evaluated by Independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Dose escalation will proceed
      under the principal investigator, medical monitor, and the sponsor's mutual approval,
      referring to SMC's evaluation.
