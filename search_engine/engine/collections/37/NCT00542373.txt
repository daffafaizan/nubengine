      I. To compare images of oral mucosa, obtained at various wavelength combinations including
      350 nm, 380 nm, 400 nm, and 450 nm excitation, to standard white light images, pathologic
      analysis of any biopsied tissue when available, and carcinogenic progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants' oral cavities are inspected by a clinician using a standard white light
      headlamp. Participants then undergo oral mucosa examination using wide-field reflectance and
      fluorescence imaging, and/or fluorescence spectroscopy imaging. Standard oral brush biopsies
      are also performed and examined microscopically. Participants may undergo repeated imaging
      procedures and biopsy during subsequent follow up visits.
