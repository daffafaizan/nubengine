      characteristics, clinical severity indicators, and genomic tests to aid in personalizing
      treatment. The proposed registry would also allow future comparisons of the gene expression
      used in other competing commercial test. The addition of the suggested genomic classifier and
      its associations with other patient and clinical characteristics will enhance the ability of
      future studies, analogous to CEASAR, to accurately predict the risk of tumor aggressiveness
      in prostate cancer.
