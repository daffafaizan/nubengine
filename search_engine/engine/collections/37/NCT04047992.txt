      voluntary control of arm, trunk and leg muscles, resulting in an inability to sit with
      stability, stand and/or walk. Because of poor trunk control during sitting, it may be
      challenging to reach for objects, dress or transfer independently, and the risk of a fall
      from their wheelchair is increased. Exoskeleton-assisted walking (EAW) provides upright, over
      ground mobility and has been demonstrated to be beneficial to improve patient-reported
      quality of life and some health-related outcomes. However, present day exoskeletons are not
      ready to replace the wheelchair. Our preliminary findings suggest that while walking in an
      exoskeleton, people with SCI are challenged to maintain upright balance by using their trunk
      muscles in a way that is rarely done from a wheelchair. Stimulation of the trunk muscles from
      upright postural challenges during EAW appears to benefit overall seated trunk control.

      Summary of Goals and Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine whether EAW can
      improve the primary outcomes of: seated balance, seated activities of daily living, and trunk
      muscle use. Additional secondary outcomes for body composition will be studied. Twenty people
      with SCI (T4 and below) who are wheelchair users will be recruited to participate.

      Impact: The investigators believe that EAW training will significantly improve seated balance
      to improve wheelchair safety, stability and quality of life, thus, empowering people with SCI
      who use a wheelchair to live more independently. If EAW is demonstrated to have a significant
      benefit on seated balance, then use of these devices in the clinical and home environments
      may be further justified.
