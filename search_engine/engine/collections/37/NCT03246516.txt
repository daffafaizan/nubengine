      consultation with a doctor (patient delay) is essential to improve the vital prognosis and
      quality of life of patients. Recent data suggest that some sociocognitive and emotional
      determinants may explain patient delay from a complementary point of view. The main objective
      of this study is to assess whether, in oeso-gastric cancer, patient delay is linked to these
      sociocognitive and emotional factors, in addition to previously known factors.

      We intend to include in this study 300 patients with a not yet treated oeso-gastric cancer
      diagnosed in one of 10 health centres in the North of France region. The collected data will
      be analysed to underline the differences between patients who consulted a doctor earlier
      versus those who consulted later with a cut off at 8 weeks.
