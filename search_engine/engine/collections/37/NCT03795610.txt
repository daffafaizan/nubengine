      cancer. A key objective is to provide the first proof that macrophage phenotype switching can
      be accomplished in humans and lay the groundwork for future trials of this novel approach to
      immune therapy. Patients who are candidates for surgical resection will be enrolled and
      treated with 3 weeks of IPI-549, a specific PI3KÎ³ inhibitor. Tumor tissue for research
      purposes through core biopsies will be obtained prior to initiation of IPI-549 and at
      surgery.

      The study team hypothesizes that mRNA signatures of immune response will be increased in
      IPI-549-treated patients. For the efficacy endpoints, RECISTv1.1 will be used.
