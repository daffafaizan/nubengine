      cross-over design. Three interventions are planned and participants will be invited to
      consume a test meal with added rapeseed protein isolate, a test meal with added soy protein
      isolate and a test meal without additional protein. The evening before, the subjects will
      receive a standardized dinner. After a 12-hour fasting overnight, a cannula will be placed.
      Blood samples will be taken before and after eating the test meal rich in carbohydrate and
      fat. The test meal consists of pasta with oily tomato sauce with either 25 g of rapeseed
      protein, 25 g of soy protein or no additional protein. A total of 11 blood samples will be
      collected over a period of 6 hours. In the meantime, the blood pressure and pulse will be
      measured repeatedly and information on satiety will be recorded. The interventions will be
      interrupted by a period of, at least, 2 weeks.
