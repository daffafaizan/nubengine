      myocardium, is a key element to determine post infarction left ventricular remodeling (LVR).

      The metalloproteinases (MMPs), an enzymatic system secreted in the extracellular medium by
      macrophages, has been shown to be able to degrade the most important extracellular matrix
      components.

      Various animal experimental models have demonstrated that MMP specific inhibition in the
      first phase of myocardial infarction is able to contrast LVR. Doxycycline, a member of the
      tetracyclines, has been shown to block various inflammation mediators and to attenuate MMP-2
      and MMP-9 expression and activity at a sub-antimicrobial dosage. Some experimental studies on
      rat models have suggested an anti-remodeling effect of doxycycline in myocardial infarction.

      In the present study we want to evaluate if a treatment with doxycycline (100 mg b.i.d.) in
      the first seven days after a reperfused large (ejection fraction less than 40%) acute
      myocardial infarction, is effective in preventing six-month LVR.
