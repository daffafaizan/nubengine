    
      Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a role in migraine pathophysiology. Infusions of
      CGRP can trigger migraine-like attacks in migraine patients and antibodies against CGRP or
      the CGRP receptor significantly reduces the number of migraine days per month when
      administered regularly. Some patients however, do not experience migraine attack after CGRP
      infusion, and some do not experience migraine reduction with antibodies. The underlying
      mechanisms of these effects are largely unknown.

      The purpose of this study is to examine CGRP-induced migraine in patients who have evaluated
      the efficacy of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment for migraine using a
      purpose-developed standardized interview. The investigators will use a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study design to examine migraine susceptibility to CGRP in these
      patients.
