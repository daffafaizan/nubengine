      "bed-side" methods TEG (Thrombelastography) and MEA (Multiple Electrode Aggregometry), the
      thrombogenic properties of 220 patients with proximal femur fracture will be measured at time
      of hospital admission and 4 times over a period of 6 months postoperatively, and the patients
      will be followed in a total length of 2 years to register thrombotic events.
