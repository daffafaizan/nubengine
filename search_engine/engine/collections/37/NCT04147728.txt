      Anlotinib is safe, effective in the treatment of limited brain metastases with perilesional
      edema in non-small cell lung cancer. The sample size is 50. Patients start to take Anlotinib
      1 week before the MRI-based simulation，12mg/d QD，day1~14, day22~36.Edema index will be used
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Anlotinib. The "Edema index (EI)" is calculated per the
      equation of "edema index= (peri-tumoral edema volume+ tumor volume)/tumor volume.
