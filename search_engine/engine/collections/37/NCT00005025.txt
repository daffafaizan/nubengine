        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of in vivo gene therapy with herpes simplex thymidine
           kinase (HSVtk) vector producer cells (VPC) followed by ganciclovir in women with
           refractory or relapsed ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma, fallopian tube cancer, or
           peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine any development of systemic immunity to this regimen or tumor in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of intraperitoneal HSVtk VPC in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive an intraperitoneal catheter prior to infusion.

      Patients receive herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSVtk) vector producer cells (VPC) IP over
      15-60 minutes on day 0, followed by ganciclovir IV 2 times daily on days 28-41. Treatment
      repeats for up to 3 courses in patients with stable or responsive disease.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
