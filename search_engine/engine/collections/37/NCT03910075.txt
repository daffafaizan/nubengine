      of I-ACQUIRE for children 8 to 36 months old with PAS and hemiparesis. The design is a
      prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in which 240 children will be randomly assigned
      to one of 3 treatment groups (N=80 per group): 1) Moderate Dose I-ACQUIRE (3 hrs/day, 5
      day/wk X 4 wks), 2) High Dose I-ACQUIRE (6hrs/day, 5 days/wk X 4 wks), or 3) Usual and
      Customary Treatment (U&CT). I-ACQUIRE will be delivered by protocol-trained therapists and
      monitored weekly for dosage and treatment fidelity; U&CT will be provided by community
      therapists with dosage and approaches documented weekly. All primary and secondary efficacy
      outcomes rely on blinded assessments at baseline, end of treatment, and 6 mos post-treatment.
      Exploratory outcomes and supplemental clinical measures may provide valuable additional data
      about development and health in this sample of children with PAS.
