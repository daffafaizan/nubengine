      comparing 4 doses of GEn (XP13512) with placebo given once daily to subjects with RLS.
      Eligible subjects were randomized in equal numbers into 1 of 5 treatment groups (GEn 600 mg,
      1200 mg, 1800 mg, or 2400 mg or placebo) for 12 weeks of treatment. Data from this study will
      be utilized as part of a larger pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis of data
      from several studies (XP084/RXP111495) that are part of the GEn RLS clinical development
      program. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
