    
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group
      study to assess the efficacy and safety of elagolix at two dose levels administered once
      daily for up to 6 months. Participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following
      treatment groups for the first 12 weeks of dosing: 150 mg elagolix once daily (QD); 250 mg
      elagolix QD or placebo QD. Following 12 weeks of dosing, participants will continue in the
      study for an additional 12 weeks; participants randomized to elagolix will continue to
      receive their assigned dose and participants randomized to placebo will be re-randomized to
      receive one of the two doses of elagolix for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Six weeks
      after the last dose of study drug at the end of Week 24, a follow-up visit will be performed
      (end of Week 30).
