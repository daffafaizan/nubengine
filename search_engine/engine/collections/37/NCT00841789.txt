    
      Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a potentially life threatening acute vasculitis in children with a
      predilection for involvement of the coronary arteries. Aspirin and Intravenous gamma globulin
      (IVIG) are principally used for the treatment of the symptoms of Kawasaki Disease. Aspirin
      reduces inflammation and platelet formation, but has no effect in attenuating the development
      of coronary abnormalities. Although IVIG reduces inflammation and the prevalence of coronary
      artery abnormalities, it has a relatively high failure rate of 23-30%, warranting new
      treatment methods for Kawasaki Disease. We propose a placebo controlled double blinded
      randomized study to determine if etanercept 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (max 25 mg) given three
      times at weekly intervals starting at initial diagnosis is safe in this patient population
      and if it is a successful adjunct therapy with IVIG in reducing the incidence of persistent
      or recurrent fever.
