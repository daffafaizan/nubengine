      disability worldwide. As of recent, therapies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (e.g.
      erenumab) have been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. This study aims to
      investigate the effect of erenumab on efficacy outcomes, tolerability outcomes, and
      patient-reported outcomes in individuals with migraine. Furthermore, the study aims to
      identify clinical predictors of erenumab response.
