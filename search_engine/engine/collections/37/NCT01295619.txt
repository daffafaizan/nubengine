      and exclusion criteria underwent screening prior to surgical treatment. After dural suturing,
      if patients met the intra operative inclusion and exclusion criteria, they received I-020805.
      If necessary, autologous grafts were to be used to augment dural closure.

      I-020805 was delivered from a double syringe applicator that creates a fine layer over the
      dura. This layer quickly sets within seconds to form a watertight seal.
