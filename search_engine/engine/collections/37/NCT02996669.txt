    
      The specified aims of this study are to accelerate the development of effective treatments
      for social impairment in ASD by validating outcome measures that will be sensitive and
      reliable assessments of response to treatment and electroencephalography (EEG) and
      eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers. These hypothesized outcomes could then be used to reduce the
      heterogeneity of samples via stratification, could possibly indicate early efficacy, and/or
      demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study
      of preschool and school-aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with
      intelligence quotient(s) (IQ) ranging from 50-150. Children will be assessed across three
      time points (Baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB)
      measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks
      and independent ratings of clinical status.
