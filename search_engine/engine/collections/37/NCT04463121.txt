    
      Subjects indicated for a dual chamber pacemaker implant or replacement who are not 100%
      dependent on right ventricular pacing may be eligible to participate in the study.

      This investigation will evaluate the effect of RV pacing lead position on cardiac function
      and the modulation of the autonomic nervous system using Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy
      (CNT) pacing signals at different positions of the RV pacing lead.

      A standard conductance catheter will be introduced through the femoral artery and advanced
      into the left ventricle to measure cardiac volumes and pressure.

      Arterial blood pressure will be measured either from the femoral artery sheath through which
      the conductance catheter is introduced, or from a radial arterial line.

      The ModeratoÂ® IPG will be used to generate Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy (CNT) signals and
      deliver them to the patient through the cable and leads. A range of CNT signal parameters
      will be used to assess the effect on sympathetic activity at different positions of the RV
      pacing lead. Ventricular pressure and volume readings from the conductance catheter and
      arterial pressure readings will be recorded and analyzed to assess the effect of CNT signals
      on cardiac function, sympathetic activity and blood pressure.

      The effects of CNT signal over a range of parameter settings will be studied for the
      different RV lead positions.
