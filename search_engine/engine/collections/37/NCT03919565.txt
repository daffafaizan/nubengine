      therapeutic efficacy in hepatitis B surface antigen or e antigen seroconversion and
      anti-tumor occurrence in chronic hepatitis b patients. But there still lacks of studies on
      peginterferon alfa 2a or 2b treatment in patients with HBV related liver fibrosis. We design
      this study to investigate optimized treatment of peginterferon alfa 2a/2b, comparing to
      nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, in anti-virus treatment naive patients with HBV related
      liver fibrosis.
