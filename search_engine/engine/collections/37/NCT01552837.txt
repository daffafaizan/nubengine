      2005). Animal studies showed that the expression of neurotrophins and the subsequent
      modulation of the neuroplastic processes, including neurogenesis in the hippocampus, play a
      key role in the mechanism of mood stabilizing (Kim et al., 2004) and antidepressant
      (Santarelli et al., 2003). Since atypical antipsychotics also have antidepressant and mood
      stabilizing effect, it is hypothesized that the common mechanism of action in all three
      pharmacological classes is neurogenesis and synaptic sprouting in the hippocampal region.
      Thus, the aim of this study was to test this hypothesis.

      Quetiapine was associated with antidepressant and mood stabilizing effects in patients with
      bipolar disorder (Vieta, 2005). The evidence based on animal studies shows that
      administration of quetiapine attenuates the decrease in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor in the hippocampi. This may explain the improved cognitive symptoms in patients with
      schizophrenia and depression (Luo et al., 2005, Park et al, 2006).

      The aim of the study was to determine the pharmacological induced equivalents of neurogenesis
      and synaptic sprouting in the hippocampus, localized volume changes, changes in water content
      and neurochemical changes in the medial temporal regions.
