      one of the main part of this treatment is methotrexate. Methotrexate can cause acute,
      subacute, and long-term neurotoxicity. Clinical symptoms of neurotoxicity, such as seizures,
      aphasia, are often associated with leukoencephalopathy. However, leukoencephalopathy may
      develop asymptomatically in children receiving methotrexate.

      The effect of chemotherapy on the neurological status of patients is widely covered in the
      literature. There are very few studies devoted to the quantitative assessment of MRI
      parameters, especially in children. MRI is a non-invasive method that does not harm the
      patient and can be used to assess absolutely all structures of the brain.
