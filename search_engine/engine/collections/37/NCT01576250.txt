      diabetes mellitus is rising steadily. It is well established that obesity predisposes
      individuals to accumulation of excessive fat in non-adipose tissues such as the liver, the
      heart and skeletal muscle (called steatosis or ectopic fat accumulation). Furthermore, in
      sedentary humans ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is strongly associated with
      insulin resistance. However, paradoxically, IntraMyoCellular Lipid (IMCL) content is also
      increased in highly insulin sensitive endurance trained subjects (known as the athlete's
      paradox). This is suggesting that IMCL per se is not causative in skeletal muscle insulin
      resistance. The increased IMCL storage following endurance training serves to match
      training-induced increase in oxidative capacity and reliance on fat as a substrate during
      exercise, whereas in obesogenic/diabetogenic conditions the high fat availability is not
      matched by improved oxidative capacity. It is therefore speculated that under the latter
      conditions, the lipid intermediates of IMCL metabolism such as diacylglycerol (DAG),
      ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs will accumulate and impede cellular insulin signalling. The
      rate of oxidative capacity is regulated by mitochondria, which are cellular organelles
      responsible for cellular energy production and cellular metabolism. Therefore, the overall
      hypothesis of this project is that a low muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity can lead to
      muscle fat accumulation and/or accumulation of lipid intermediates when fatty acid
      availability is high, and this may result in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
