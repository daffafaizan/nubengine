    
      This is a single center, open-label, fixed-sequence, drug interaction study to evaluate the
      effect of BCX7353 on the pharmacokinetics of the P-gp substrate digoxin and the BCRP
      substrate rosuvastatin, as well as the effect of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine on the
      pharmacokinetics of BCX7353.

      It is planned that 54 subjects will be enrolled into 3 cohorts of 18 subjects each. Cohort 1
      will evaluate the effects of multiple doses of BCX7353 on single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      digoxin. Cohort 2 will evaluate the effect of multiple doses of BCX7353 on the
      pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. Cohort 3 will evaluate the effect of a single dose of
      cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of BCX7353. Cohorts may be dosed in parallel or in any
      order.
