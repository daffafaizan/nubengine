    
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is an inflammatory skin condition that affects
      children and adults and causes skin redness, dryness and itching. Dilute bleach baths are
      standard of care for treatment of AD and work to decrease skin inflammation and modulate the
      skin microbiome. Dilute vinegar (acetic acid) has been reported to have similar effects on
      the skin. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in skin barrier function and
      skin microbial composition following baths or gauze soaks with dilute bleach and dilute
      vinegar.
