    
      This is an open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled phase II clinical trial.To
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib combined with anlotinib versus gefitinib alone
      in advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients whose EGFRm was not cleared in plasma ctDNA after 8
      weeks of gefitinib first-line treatment, so as to provide clinical basis for a new and
      tolerable treatment that can prolong the survival time of patients with advanced NSCLC. Study
      therapy continued until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event, or withdrawal of
      consent. The efficacy and adverse reactions of the trial regimen will be evaluated according
      to RECIST criteria and NCI-CTC AE V3.0.
