      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of entinostat when given in combination with
      imatinib (matinib mesylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of complete response (CR) for patients greater ≥ 18 years of age with
      relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL treated with a combination of entinostat and imatinib.

      II. To estimate the 1 year progression free survival (PFS) for patients greater ≥ 18 years of
      age with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL treated with a combination of entinostat and imatinib
      III. To describe the comparative pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      entinostat when administered alone vs. in combination with imatinib.

      IV. To assess the predictive value of levels of flow cytometric minimal residual disease
      (MRD) on duration of progression free survival for the study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of entinostat followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and imatinib mesylate
      PO twice daily on days 1-28 (days 4-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
