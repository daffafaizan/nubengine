      that last long after cash incentives are removed (Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Acland and Levy,
      2013). the investigators' research will examine what kind of incentive programs build
      long-lasting habits most effectively. Specifically, the investigators will compare the
      long-term effects (based on step counts in the one month after the conclusion of the
      investigators' intervention) of three different interventions: (1) incentives for taking
      steps that remain stable over the course of a month (stable incentives); (2) incentives (of
      equal net value) for taking steps that start low and grow larger over the course of the month
      (increasing incentives); and (3) incentives (of equal net value) for taking steps that start
      high and decrease over the course of the month (decreasing incentives). For example, during
      the month-long intervention, users in group (1) will receive 6x their usual points every day
      for each step they take; users in group (2) will receive 2x the usual points for several
      days, then 3x the usual points, and so on up to 10x the usual number of points; finally,
      group (3) will have the same incentive schedule as group (2) but in reverse - starting with a
      10x multiplier and declining. The question is this: Is it better to ease people into exercise
      when trying to help them form a lasting habit, to start them off intensively and then ease up
      the pressure, or to maintain steady, constant incentives to exercise? By examining the steps
      taken by members of the investigators' three experimental groups in the month following the
      investigators' intervention, the investigators will be able to assess whether increasing,
      decreasing, or stable incentives are ideal for creating lasting habits after incentives are
      removed. The anticipated output of this project is a published research paper.

      The time frame of observation will be 8 months.
