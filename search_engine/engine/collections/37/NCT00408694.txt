    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab and chemoradiotherapy comprising
      cisplatin and radiotherapy followed by adjuvant therapy comprising cisplatin, fluorouracil,
      and bevacizumab in patients with stage IIB-IVB nasopharyngeal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 1- and 2-year rates of locoregional progression-free in patients treated
      with this regimen.

      II. Determine the 1- and 2-year rates of distant metastases-free in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      III. Determine the 1- and 2-year rates of progression-free and overall survival of patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      BEVACIZUMAB AND CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in week 1, patients
      also undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      once daily 5 days a week for a total of 33 fractions.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning in week 10, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 96
      hours on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1 OR days 1 and 2, and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
