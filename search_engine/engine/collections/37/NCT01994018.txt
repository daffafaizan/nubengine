      effects vitamin D has on the immune system. Published data also shows a synergistic effect of
      vitamin D in conjunction with Glatiramer acetate (GA), an already approved FDA
      immunomodulating drug, in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Further correlation of vitamin
      D and GA or Interferon Beta needs to be tested.

      This is a retrospective pilot study in which 100 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting
      MS (RR-MS) according to the McDonald criteria and treated with either GA or interferon with
      and without vitamin D supplementation for at least 2 years were included. Only RR-MS patients
      who received FDA approved immuno-modulatory drugs for MS are included in this review.

      Relapses before and during treatment will be analyzed and a subgroup analysis will be done on
      those who received vitamin D and those who did not. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) of the
      brain and cervical spine of these MS patients will also be reviewed to see if there is any
      correlation between radiologic changes, relapses and vitamin D level.

      The 100 MS patients involved the chart review will be invited to participate in a one time
      blood draw to measure vitamin D levels. Additionally, the MS patients will be asked about
      their relapse status and medication history.

      Twenty (20) healthy individuals not on vitamin D supplementation will be used as controls to
      get a baseline vitamin D level.
