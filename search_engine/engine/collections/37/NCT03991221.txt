    
      Dental malocclusion is defined as an incorrect position of the teeth in the bone base, as
      well as the incoordination of the teeth of the opposite arches or the displacement of the
      maxillary and mandibular skeletal bases.

      When a malocclusion is detected during clinical examination, patients are referred to an
      orthodontic specialist. The interception in orthodontics is carried out during a growing
      period; it consists of correcting or reducing malocclusions in evolution and eliminating the
      functional causes to prevent aggravation of skeletal and dental abnormalities. Early
      intervention is critical for specific dental malocclusions and skeletal disorders, such as
      lateral and anterior crossbite in order to avoid aggravation of the occlusion disorder and
      induction of craniofacial growth disorders. Unfortunately these discrepancies are not always
      detected by the caregivers (pediatrician, general dentist, pediatric dentist).
