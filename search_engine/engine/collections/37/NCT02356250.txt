      between HVPG result and PEF result in a way that the result of the PEF test will be able to
      predict if a patient has CSPH (yes of no). By this, to try and develop a portable
      office-based device that can produce immediate results in a non-invasive manner in cirrhotic
      patients and help in evaluating prognosis in these patients in a noninvasive manner
