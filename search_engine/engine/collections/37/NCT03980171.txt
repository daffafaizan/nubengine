    
      This is a phase Ib/II (dose escalation/dose expansion), single-arm multi-centre clinical
      trial of venetoclax plus obinutuzumab and lenalinomide in patients with treatment-na√Øve
      follicular lymphoma. The trial involves an initial dose escalation phase followed by an
      expansion phase. Patients in both the dose escalation and expansion phases will receive 6
      cycles of induction treatment. After patients finish induction treatment, they will undergo
      PET-CT scan, the results of which will determine further therapy. Patients in CR or SD/PR
      from the PET-CT scan result will receive up to 2 years of maintenance therapy. Patients in PD
      from the PET-CT result will not receive any further study treatment. All patients will be
      followed up for 3 years after the last patient has completed induction treatment.
