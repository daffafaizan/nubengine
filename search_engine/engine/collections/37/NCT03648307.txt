    
      A list was made of patients who had gone through trauma splenectomy or bowel resection due to
      bowel obstruction in our center between July 2008 and July 2013. Patients were divided into
      two groups: trauma splenectomy (exposed group) and bowel resection (unexposed group).

      All patients were followed up for 5-10 years. Of the 243 splenectomized patients, 90 patients
      who met our study criteria were willing to participate. Of 152 patients with bowel resection,
      64 were willing to participate. Records of patients at the time of surgery were retrieved
      from hospital archive of patients' records. Patients were invited to an office meeting for
      assessment of blood pressure, BMI and a general physical examination and history taking. An
      appointment was made for drawing blood samples for measurement of lipid profile, Hb A1C and
      fasting blood sugar.

      Exclusion criteria:

      1. Disturbed lipid profile at the time of surgery, 2. Disturbed blood glucose levels at the
      time of surgery, 3. History of high blood pressure prior to surgery, 4. Use of any
      hyperglycemogenic agent during the follow up period, 5. BMI>= 25 at the time of surgery, 6.
      History of diseases potentially affecting blood glucose, e.g. hyperthyroidism, Cushing
      syndrome, 7. Accidental pancreatic damage during surgery, 8. Resection of >10 cm of small
      bowel and 9. History of malignancy or radiotherapy (criteria 8 and 9 were specific to
      unexposed group).
