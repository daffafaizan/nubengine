        1. Tonic (i.e., non-cue-provoked) craving levels would be lower in participants receiving
           varenicline versus placebo.

        2. Cue-provoked cravings (self-report and physiological responding) would be lower in
           participants receiving varenicline versus placebo. (Secondary indices of craving include
           heart rate and skin conductance.)

        3. The two primary indices of nicotine reward/reinforcement (mCEQ and choice index) would
           be lower in participants receiving varenicline versus placebo. (Secondary indices of
           nicotine reinforcement include smoking topography variables.)

      A final sample of 100 non-treatment seeking daily smokers were recruited from the Tampa-St.
      Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Area via paid advertisements in, and press releases to,
      local newspapers, as well as targeted outdoor advertising via flyers (e.g., on public
      transportation).

      Following the screening session, participants were randomly assigned to receive either
      varenicline or placebo medication.
