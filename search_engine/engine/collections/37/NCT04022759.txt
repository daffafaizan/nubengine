      will be recruiting 50 participants experiencing mild to moderate depression who are deemed
      suitable for 'behavioural activation' low intensity guided self-help intervention. Following
      telephone screening for intervention, clinicians will ask clients if they wish to hear more
      about participating in a research study. If participants say yes, their contact details will
      be passed on to the researcher who will send them the study information sheet and consent
      form in the post. If the participant consents to taking part in the research, they will be
      randomised to receive either treatment as usual (low-intensity guided self-help utilising
      behavioural activation for depression) or treatment with security priming intervention
      (treatment as usual with an additional security priming task). They will have between 6-8
      sessions as routinely delivered within the service and will be asked to complete measures of
      depression, anxiety and impaired functioning on a sessional basis. The principal investigator
      at the study site will collect information regarding attendance to therapy, dropout rates,
      and 'stepping' clients up to higher-intensity therapies as primary outcomes.
