    
      S2S has many innovations that are designed to utilize the power of peers and social networks
      for dissemination. These include: Peer recruitment: Tools to facilitate smokers' recruiting
      their peers to increase Decide2Quit access; and a recommender computer tailored health
      communication (recommender CTHC): a Complex machine learning algorithm (recommender systems)
      that uses smokers' feedback (explicit and implicit) in the current and prior studies to adapt
      its selection of messages to smokers.

      Using a 2Ã—2 factorial design, the study will compare individually and collectively the
      enhancements (recruitment, use, and effectiveness) offered by the S2S functions over the
      standard version of Decide2Quit (online recruitment and standard CTHC), an active comparison
      group.
