      most influential biological and environmental factors that affect weight gain during infancy.
      Parental feeding practices have a strong impact on children's food availability, eating
      behaviors, and weight. The Institute of Medicine's(IOM) recent report (2011) on early
      childhood obesity prevention policies recommends five approaches to preventing obesity:
      assess, monitor, and track growth from birth to age 5; increase physical activity and
      decrease sedentary behavior in young children; support breastfeeding and be responsive to
      children's feeding cues; limit screen time; and promote age-appropriate sleep for young
      children. Based on the previous work by this research team, and in collaboration with a major
      urban health department, we propose to test an intervention that incorporates all the IOM's
      recommendations to prevent the development of obesity in at-risk infants. The intervention
      will be guided by health professionals and delivered through home visits by community health
      workers (CHWs), supervised by public health nurses (PHN), to Mexican American women and
      children who are clients of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
      and Children (WIC) Program in Houston, TX. The intervention will occur for 2 years with 1
      year of follow-up, for a total of 3 years of measures.
