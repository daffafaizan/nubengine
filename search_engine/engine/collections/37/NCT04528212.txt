      1- Approval will be obtained from Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour
      University. 2- All participants agreed to take part in this clinical study and provide
      informed consent. 3- (60) Patients with DM type 2 who's taking Glimepiride will be enrolled
      from Internal Medicine Department, Tanta University Hospital. 4- Serum samples will be
      collected for measuring the biomarkers. 5- All enrolled patients will be mentioned as two
      groups; Group I are patients who will be prescribed glimepiride plus fenofibrate. Group II
      are patients who will be prescribed glimepiride plus curcumin. 6- All patients will be
      followed up during 3 months' period. 7- At the end of 3 months on the new regimen, steps 4
      will be repeated. 8- Statistical tests appropriate to the study design will be conducted to
      evaluate the significance of the results. 9- Measuring outcome: The primary outcome is the
      change of serum levels of the measured markers after 3 months and lipid profile. 10- Results,
      conclusion, discussion and recommendations will be given.

      Methodology Serum levels of fetuin-A, and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) will be measured ELISA. Lipid
      profile. Fasting Blood glucose and 2 hrs postprandial Blood Glucose. Hb A1C will be measured.
      BMI of the patients will be measured before and after the study. High sensitivity C-reactive
