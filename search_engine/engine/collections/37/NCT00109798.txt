      Primary

        -  Determine the complete radiologic response rate in patients with primary CNS lymphoma
           treated with salvage chemotherapy comprising temozolomide and topotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median and failure-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes
      once daily on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
