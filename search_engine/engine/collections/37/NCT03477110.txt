    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of combination chemoradiotherapy with NovoTTF-200A
      device (Optune) treatment in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide plus Optune.

      II. To evaluate the median overall survival, 1-year overall survival, and event-free
      survival.

      III. Collect tumor O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status and
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status.

      IV. To evaluate the level of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in glioblastoma
      patient serum during treatment.

      V. To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and
      adjuvant temozolomide plus Optune.
