      I. To examine the effects of stimulation duration (stimulation days) and intensity (pulses
      per day) on outcomes among smokers (sample size [n]=258) motivated to quit.

      II. To identify the most promising dosing strategy by balancing effect sizes and undesirable
      effects.

      III. To examine the effects of 16 20Hz rTMS sessions combined with intensive cognitive
      behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement on smoking cessation, developmental disability
      (DD rates), cognitive behavioral skill acquisition, and nicotine patch adherence among lung
      cancer (LC) patients (n=30). (Study 1 and Study 2) IV. To examine the feasibility and
      potential efficacy of 20Hz rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for
      concurrent smoking abstinence and reductions in alcohol use among smokers who are heavy
      drinkers (n=20). (Study 1 and Study 2)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo rTMS once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) over 16 minutes for 8, 12,
      or 16 days.

      ARM II: Patients undergo sham rTMS QD or BID over 16 minutes for 8, 12, or 16 days.
