      cognitive, psychological and motor functions. One of the most well-known symptoms is a
      hemiplegia, causing the patient to lose muscle force and sensibility on one body side. Mostly
      unknown, is that the trunk is affected bilaterally, causing the patient to have problems with
      sitting or standing balance and being unable to execute simple tasks in daily life. As trunk
      function is a strong prognostic factor for independence in daily life, it is a key component
      in rehabilitation after stroke.

      Additional trunk therapy is proven to be effective for improving trunk function and sitting
      balance. However, conventional trunk therapy is limited by the needed supervision of a
      therapist and when using unstable surfaces, only a small patient group can profit from this
      training. Rehabilitation technologies are considered an effective add-on to conventional
      therapy in order to improve semi-independent training at a high-intensity for a broad type of
      patients. For the trunk, only few devices exist, mainly used for research purposes and not
      adapted to clinical needs.

      Therefore, a prototype to train the trunk of the patient was developed (T-Chair), in order to
      train trunk control and sitting balance. The feasibility of the first prototype was tested in
      a previous study. Outcomes have been used to improve the prototype in order to produce the
      final prototype: the T-Chair 2.0. In order to know if this final device suits the needs of
      patients and therapist and has an effect on trunk and lower extremity function after stroke a
      feasibility study combined with a pilot randomised controlled trial will be performed.
