      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 (veliparib) in combination with
      bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, or
      multiple myeloma. (Phase Ib) II. To establish the safety of ABT-888 in combination with
      bendamustine and rituximab in an expansion cohort of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL). (Phase Ib) III. To assess the toxicity profile of this regimen in the above patients.
      (Phase Ib) IV. To determine the complete response (CR) rate in patients with indolent NHL or
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) treated with ABT-888 + bendamustine + rituximab. (Phase IIa)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rates and survival parameters of patients treated with ABT-888 +
      bendamustine +/- rituximab. (Phase Ib) II. To assess pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888 in
      this regimen. (Phase Ib) III. To assess progression-free survival, overall survival, and
      duration of remission of patients with indolent NHL and MCL treated with ABT-888 +
      bendamustine + rituximab. (Phase IIa)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and bendamustine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Once the maximum-tolerated dose is determined, a cohort of patients receives veliparib and
      bendamustine hydrochloride as above and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
