    
      A pilot three group gender-balanced randomized clinical trial (RCT) among adult burn patients
      (18 years old or above) at OSU Medical Center Inpatient Burn Program. The intervention group
      will receive VR-PAT as a distraction tool during the dressing change procedure (active VR
      group) while the comparison groups will receive either a comparable passive VR distraction
      tool that uses the same hardware and visual/audio features, but requires no active
      interaction (Control Group 1), or no distraction at all (Control Group 2).
