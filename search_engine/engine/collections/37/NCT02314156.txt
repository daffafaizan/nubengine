      I. To demonstrate that mean levels of telapristone (telapristone acetate) in breast tissue
      following gel application will result in levels that are not more than 50% lower than those
      following oral administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether plasma concentrations of telapristone are significantly lower with
      transdermal than oral therapy.

      II. To compare within-breast variation of breast tissue concentration in transdermal and oral
      groups.

      III. To measure changes in cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [Ki67] labeling
      index) and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate [dUTP]
      nick end labeling [TUNEL]) in breast cancer samples obtained at diagnostic core needle biopsy
      (of cancer) or research core needle biopsy (of unaffected breast) with tissue samples
      obtained at mastectomy. Measure protein expression of related targets in the following order
      of priority: progesterone receptor isoforms (progesterone receptor [PR]A and PRB), and
      estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and TUNEL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) at baseline and
      after treatment.

      IV. Explore changes in gene expression in breast tissue related to telapristone therapy.

      V. Assess change in serum progesterone associated with telapristone therapy. VI. Assess the
      safety and tolerability of oral and transdermal administration.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (TRANSDERMAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive telapristone acetate transdermally
      and placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks.

      ARM II (ORAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive placebo transdermally and telapristone
      acetate PO QD for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 60.
