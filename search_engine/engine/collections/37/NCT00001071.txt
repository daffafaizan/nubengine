      of drug administration, patients have peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested by
      leukapheresis. HIV-positive patients are stratified into three cohorts based on CD4 count and
      presence of symptoms. If no increase in number of harvested stem cells and no grade 4 bone
      pain toxicity occur in two of the first three patients in a cohort, then the last three
      patients in that cohort will receive a dose escalation. Patients are followed for 24 weeks.
