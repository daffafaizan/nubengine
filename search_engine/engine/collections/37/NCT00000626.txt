      chemotherapy, allowing more timely administration of chemotherapy and improved response.

      Study drugs are administered in 28-day cycles to twenty-seven HIV-infected patients with
      Hodgkin's disease. ABVD (doxorubicin / bleomycin / vinblastine / dacarbazine) is administered
      on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, and G-CSF is given on days 2 through 14 and 16 through 28 of
      each cycle. All patients receive four cycles of treatment and are then restaged. Patients
      with a complete response (CR) following the initial four cycles receive two additional cycles
      of ABVD / G-CSF. Patients with a partial response following the initial four cycles receive
      two additional cycles of ABVD / G-CSF and are again restaged; those who have achieved a CR at
      that point then receive two more cycles, while those without CR discontinue study therapy.
      Patients with disease progression following the initial four cycles of therapy discontinue
      treatment on the study. Concomitant PCP prophylaxis is administered.
