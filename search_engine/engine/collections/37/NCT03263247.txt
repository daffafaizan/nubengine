      multiple domain clinical diagnostic, over 60 years old, recruited through the Cognitive and
      Behavioral Neurology Group ambulatory of University of Sao Paulo General Hospital. We will
      also include 30 healthy subjects, over 60 years old, recruited in the community. All the
      participants will be evaluated by neurologists specialized in cognitive neurology and
      subjected to a neuropsychological assessment. The 30 participants with MCI and 30 healthy
      subjects will be divided in 6 groups: the G1 MCI group (N=10) will receive 4 sessions of
      visual imaging training; the G2 control group (N=10) will receive 4 sessions of visual
      imaging training; the G3 MCI group (N=10) will receive psychoeducation intervention; the G4
      control group (N=20) will receive psychoeducation intervention; the G5 MCI group (N=10) will
      receive cognitive training with alphabet search training and the G6 control group will
      receive cognitive training with alphabet search training. This will be a longitudinal,
      randomized, double blind study. MCI patients will be grouped according to biomarkers (PET
      PIB, PET FDG and liquor).
