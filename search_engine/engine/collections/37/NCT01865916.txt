    
      All adults (â‰¥ 19 yrs of age) who are referred to St. Paul's Hospital for outpatient
      colonoscopy will be included in our study. Exclusion criteria included those with
      constipation, suspected or known small bowel obstruction, severe inflammatory bowel disease,
      and any history of colonic resection. 278 consecutive eligible patients will be randomized to
      one of two bowel preparations through the use of concealed allocation by a scheduling
      assistant (blinded) in a one-to-one allocation ratio. Bowel preparations included: (i) 2 L of
      MoviPrep (2 L PEG 3350 electrolyte solution + ascorbic acid) or (ii) Bi-Peglyte (2 L PEG 3350
      electrolyte solution and 15mg bisacodyl). Patients in both arms will be instructed to adhere
      to a clear liquid diet commensing 24 hours prior to scheduled colonoscopy in addition to
      their remaining bowel preparation.

      The investigators will not have access to the randomization envelopes and the randomized
      bowel preparation will be stored within the medical record that will not be accessible by the
      endoscopist. The endoscopists can break blinding and access the bowel prep given when
      medically necessary.

      At the time of their procedure check-in, written consent will be confirmed and patients will
      respond to a brief survey assessing patient tolerance. All colonoscopies will be performed
      under conscious sedation by an experienced endoscopist. Endoscopists will be blinded to the
      bowel preparation until the completion of the study. We will use the Boston Bowel Preparation
      Scale (BBPS) and Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) to assess efficacy in bowel
      preparation.
