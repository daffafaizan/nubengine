      mechanisms behind headache in general and migrane in particular. Previous studies have used
      various techniques to study the cerebral haemodynamics as a basis for the headache
      pathophysiology. We wish to use a 3-Tesa MRI so study the cerebral haemodynamics after
      application of various pharmacological substances.

      The most used experimental headache model is the glyceryl trinitrate model (GTN). Where
      infusion of the NO donor GTN induces headache and changes in the cerebral arteries. On the
      other hand injection of Diamox (Acetazolamide) apparently causes increase of the cerebral
      blod flow with out dilation of the arteries. We wish to study the precise effect of GTN and
      diamox on the cerebral haemodynamics such as Cerebral blod flow (CBF) and Cerebral blod
      volume (CBV) via a 3-Tesla MRI.
