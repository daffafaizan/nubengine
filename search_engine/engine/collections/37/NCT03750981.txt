    
      A 12-week pilot intervention study introducing a high-intensity functional training program
      to 100 cancer survivors and evaluate the effects of this program on patient quality of life,
      functional capacity, and body composition. Response rates will be determined using various
      recruitment methods and estimate differences in response rates by patient characteristics
      including race, gender and age. Barriers to participation in the program in contacted
      patients who do not enroll as well as patients who enroll and do not complete the program
      will be described, as will participant satisfaction with enrolled participants who complete
      the program. The goal of this pilot study is to help refine the recruitment and program
      methods for a larger intervention study to test the superiority of a high-intensity interval
      functional training program compared with current American Cancer Society guidelines in
      improving functional capacity, body composition and patient reported quality of life.

      Surveys will be completed by each participant weekly and physical assessments will be
      completed monthly.
