    
      Patients admitted to Grenoble University Hospital between 2006 and 2011 for severe
      legionellosis were retrospectively included in the study.

      Clinical, epidemiological, diagnostic and prognostic data of these patients were recorded
      retrospectively.

      Lower respiratory samples collected from these patients on a routine basis for
      microbiological analysis, especially Legionella culture, were tested using traditional
      microbiological methods. The remaining part of these samples was stored at -80Â°C fur further
      molecular analyses.

      The molecular tools developed by our bacteriology laboratory included the following: a
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test allowing detection and differentiation of L.
      pneumophila and other Legionella species; a qPCR test allowing determination of the
      Legionella DNA load in lower respiratory samples; a qPCR allowing detection of gyrA (the gene
      encoding subunit A of DNA gyrase) mutations that the investigators previously determined to
      be correlated with fluoroquinolones resistance in L. pneumophila; a high-throughput
      sequencing approach allowing confirmation of gyrA mutations and determination of the
      percentage of mutated alleles.

      The microbiological data, especially those obtained with the developped molecular tools, were
      tentatively correlated with the severity and outcome of infection in our patients' cohort.
