    
      BACKGROUND:

        -  Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGVHD) is a major late complication of allogeneic
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  The oral cavity is the second most commonly affected area in cGVHD and is a major cause
           of morbidity.

        -  Clobetasol is a high-potency topical corticosteroid widely used for a variety of
           inflammatory disorders of the skin and oral mucosa.

        -  Treatment of oral cGVHD by topical agents is an attractive strategy to potentially avoid
           adverse effects associated with systemic immunosuppression.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - To investigate efficacy of topical clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse for oral chronic graft
      versus-host disease (cGVHD)

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Patients age 12-99 years with clinically significant oral cGVHD.

      DESIGN:

        -  This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study of clobetasol 0.05%
           topical oral rinse with an open label extension period.

        -  Patients will rinse oral cavity with 10cc of clobetasol 0.05% or placebo oral rinse for
           2 minutes 3 times a day.

        -  Treatment duration will be for 2 weeks in the randomized phase and 2-4 weeks in the open
           label phase.

        -  Up to 40 patients will be enrolled on this pilot trial until 34 evaluable patients are
           assessed.
