      selectively affects speech production due to involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles. SD
      often extends beyond the impairment of vocal communication causing significant occupational
      disability and life-long social isolation. SD becomes even more incapacitating when it is
      associated with dystonic voice tremor (VT), which is present in about 1/3 of SD patients and
      is characterized by the inability to sustain a vowel for more than a few seconds. Current
      treatment of these disorders is limited to the temporary management of voice symptoms with
      repeated injections of botulinum toxin into the laryngeal muscles. These injections, however,
      are not fully effective in all SD patients and even less so in combined SD and VT cases.
      There is, therefore, a critical need to identify alternative therapeutic options that
      specifically target the pathophysiology of these disorders. On the other hand, the design and
      the use of such novel therapeutic approaches will be largely unattainable if their central
      mechanisms of action remain unknown. The objective of this study is to elucidate the primary
      determinants of clinical response to a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate (XyremÂ®), in
      alcohol-responsive SD and VT patients. Using a comprehensive approach of clinico-behavioral
      testing, neuroimaging and pharmacogenetics, we aim to determine the clinical response of SD
      and VT symptoms to sodium oxybate and identify the primary markers of its clinical benefits.
      This study will use a controlled experimental design that focuses on detailed
      characterization of primary effects of a novel oral medication, sodium oxybate, for treatment
      of SD and VT symptoms.
