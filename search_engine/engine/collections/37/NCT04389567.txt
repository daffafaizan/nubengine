      safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of doses from 20mg
      once daily to 160mg four times daily. In computer-based simulations, Famotidine has been
      identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). In a
      propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or
      intubation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.88) was identified for
      patients with COVID-19 who were taking Famotidine before or at the point of hospital
      admission. Some individuals have self-medicated with Famotidine while being outpatients with
      COVID-19. This study is aimed at collecting patient reported outcome measures from such
      individuals.
