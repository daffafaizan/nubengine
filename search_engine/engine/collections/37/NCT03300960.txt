      allows GnRH analogue administration, resulting in greater comfort for patients as well as a
      reduction in cost. Obtained results are similar to those from conventional protocols in terms
      of: early luteinization, number of oocytes, embryos number and rate of implantation and
      gestation or appearance of congenital malformations. Another advantage is the lower incidence
      of OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome).

      From a scientific point of view, it would allow a better understanding of folliculogenesis,
      of progesterone mechanism of action on blocking LH secretion and its effect on ovarian and
      later embryonic level.

      From a clinical point of view, it would simplify COS (Controlled Ovarian Stimulation) by
      reducing the number of medication administered subcutaneously and their possible side effects
      on both systemic and local levels. It would be of special interest in 2 groups of patients,
      for example, oocyte donors and patients undergoing preservation of fertility. To date, there
      is a lack of studies along these lines.
