      adult patients with recurrent extensive small cell lung cancer sensitive to first-line
      platinum-based therapy. The primary objective of the study is to determine the objective
      overall response rate. Secondary objectives include evaluating the treatment-related
      toxicities in this patient population and determining the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      INNO-206 in a minimum of 12 patients.
