      ROMA therapy( Reminiscence, Reality Orientation, Music, and Art) on improving cognitive
      function, behavioral and psychological symptoms in demented population. A total of 60
      patients with mild to moderate dementia will be recruited and randomly assigned to two
      groups: experimental group and control group. The experimental group will undergo ROMA
      therapy with a 60 minute per week for eight weeks. The control group will receive three times
      ROMA therapy after completing outcome measurements. Two groups will receive questionnaire
      interview at pre-test, post-test, and at 4 weeks after intervention. The measurements
      comprises: Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire(SPMSQ), Cornell Scale for Depression in
      Dementia(CSDD),and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire(NPI-Q). By identifying the
      effectiveness of ROMA therapy, suitable intervention can be suggested for those demented
      population to improve cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms.
