      unit of banked plasma obtained from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus
      SARS-C0V-2 infection with high titers of IgG antibody to this virus transfused into patients
      with severe or at high risk of progressing to severe coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19).

      The research hypothesis is that COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion improves
      outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

      The use of CCP to treat serious and life threatening COVID-19 has a sound biological as well
      as clinical rationale to provide virus-specific immune protection in patients unable to
      produce and/or maintain antiviral antibodies. This treatment protocol is designed primarily
      to offer a rescue therapy in patients with severe and life threatening disease and explore
      use in patients for whom a progression to serious disease is likely. Examining the specific
      antibody responses to the virus in transfused patients if/when they show signs of recovery
      and comparing these values with those obtained before the transfusion may provide information
      to design more extensive trials aimed at identifying the best patient population for future
      use of CCP.
