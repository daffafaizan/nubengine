      method used to treat hallux valgus. The main aim of this study was to find the initial
      effects of kinesiotaping on pain and joint alignment used in the conservative treatment of
      hallux valgus.

      22 female patients diagnosed with 13 bilateral, 7 right, 2 left totally 35 with hallux valgus
      participated in this study. Kinesiotaping was implemented after the first assessment and
      renewed in the 3rd, 7th and 10th days. The main outcome measures were the change in pain was
      assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and hallux adduction angle was measured by the
      universal goniometry. Secondary outcome measures were Patients' functional status was
      measured by Foot Function Index (FFI) and AOFAS. The plain radiographic results were also
      measured before and after 1-month of treatment.

      Pain and disability was controlled by KinesioTapeÂ® implementation in patients with hallux
      valgus. Kinesiotaping may be an effective treatment option in decreasing pain and deformity
      in hallux valgus deformity who are conservatively treated. In future studies this method
      might be shown in larger sample groups at longer periods of treatment comparing with
      alternative treatment approaches like exercise or orthotics.
