      with schizophrenia, increasing hospitalization rates, hospitalization days, and
      hospitalization costs. Among hospitalized adults, schizophrenia is the fourth most commonly
      diagnosed illness and has the seventh longest mean duration of hospital stay in the US.
      Frequent relapses and hospitalization can affect quality of life in these patients.
      Long-acting injections (intramuscular depot) antipsychotic medication is a means to treatment
      adherence and increased quality of life for patients with schizophrenia.
