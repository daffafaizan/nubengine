      function in older men (60-80 years of age). The Framingham reactive hyperemia index (fRHI)
      will be used as a measure of microvascular function, and will be measured using peripheral
      arterial tonometry (PAT; EndoPAT200). Secondary outcomes will assess circulating levels of
      nitrate and nitrite, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), inflammatory cytokines, NADPH oxidase,
      platelet aggregation, plasma lipids and blood pressure. This suite of markers will provide
      insight on physiological outcomes and risk factors associated with CVD development, and the
      metabolic and signaling pathways that influence them. To accomplish the above, after a 4 week
      run in period of no powder intake, twenty men (60-80 years of age) will be randomly assigned
      to consume 39 g of FDSP or a control powder for four weeks in a randomized, double-blind,
      controlled crossover study. This study design will compare the short-term (four week)
      response of FDSP intake to an isocaloric control powder that provides no polyphenols, as well
      as to their habitual diet where no powder was consumed.
