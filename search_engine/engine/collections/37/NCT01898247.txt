      3% of hospitalized patients, simulation-based mastery learning should be applied to
      procedures done in all medical centers. In academic hospitals, bedside procedures such as
      thoracentesis procedures are often performed by unsupervised medical trainees. Traditionally,
      medical trainees learn procedures relying on the historic "see one, do one, teach one"
      mentality. Unfortunately, this approach subjects patients to procedures before trainees are
      competent.

      Through the use of medical simulation, medical educators can increase the essential knowledge
      and skills of trainees while assuring procedural competence and reducing patient exposure to
      undue risk. Medical simulation training using the mastery learning model improves clinical
      skills and reduces the risk of procedure-associated injury. Our research group pioneered the
      use of this evidence-based approach for teaching medical trainees. Mastery learning requires
      that all trainees demonstrate a uniformly high level of skill before training completion.
      This ensures competence on a medical simulator before actual patient encounters.
