      mHealth therapeutic intervention designed to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      through an app on a phone or other mobile device. The evaluation will include a randomized
      trial among 40 adolescents diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety and will assess if CBot-A
      is usable by teens and likely to provide benefit, and acceptable to adolescents.

      The primary outcome of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents will be assessed at 1
      month and 3 months to check for any changes.
