      using block randomization and chosen based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Before
      the study, all participants will be informed of the potential risks and benefits of the
      study. During the study period, participants will be instructed to avoid any form of physical
      activity besides the study protocol. Both groups will perform SIT protocol on a
      electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer three times per week for 6 weeks. Every session,
      participants start with a 5 minutes warm up at 50- 60% of heart rate maximum (HRmax) and
      follow by four 30-s all out bouts intersperse with 4 minutes of recovery (passive or no load
      cycling). For confirmation of all-out effort, participant are required to maintain his or her
      cycling cadence at least 60 rpm or above. Intervention will end with a 5 minutes cool down at
      50- 60% of HRmax. Total duration for each session will be 28 minutes. If a participant misses
      fewer than three sessions per week non- consecutively, the sessions missed will be replace at
      the end of period. However, if participants misses three or more sessions, he or she will be
      excluded from the study. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at end of 6 weeks
      of intervention.
