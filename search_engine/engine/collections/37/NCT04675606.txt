    
      The proposed study is a prospective randomized study to compare two post-operative diets

        1. Low fiber diet

        2. Regular diet in patients undergoing elective or urgent colorectal surgery resulting in a
           loop or end ileostomy. The primary outcome measure is rate of post-operative ileus or
           obstruction in patients with ileostomies. The secondary objectives of this study are to
           compare the length of stay, 30-day and 90-day readmission rates, rate of high stoma
           output requiring antidiarrheal medication, nausea score, pain score, and overall quality
           of life amongst the patients studied.

      All groups will be counseled and asked to consent for the study at the time of their
      preoperative clinic visit and copy of the protocol will be provided to them. Patients
      undergoing urgent surgery will be counseled and consented at the time decision for surgery is
      made. All groups will be started on either low fiber diet or regular diet on postoperative
      day 1. Of note, it is important to note that at our institution, a "low fiber diet" is
      equivalent to a "low residue diet" in our electronic medical records system. All groups will
      be assessed and examined daily, where nausea score and pain score will be recorded. Prior to
      discharge, both groups will receive consultation with a wound-ostomy care nurse who will
      perform ostomy teaching as well as diet/nutritional counseling. Patients in the low fiber
      diet arm will receive nutritional counseling advising that they follow a low fiber diet.
      Patients in the regular diet arm will receive nutritional counseling advising that they
      continue to follow a regular diet.
