      therapists. Although lumbar traction is frequently used by physical therapists in the
      treatment of patients with LBP. We will use Manual Lumber Spinal Traction on patients with
      acute vs chronic lumber radiculopathy. The current study will determine the effect of
      decompression in relieving pain, increase range of motion and improving function in patients
      of acute and chronic lumbar radiculopathy. Lumbar traction (LT) is routinely used on its own
      or in conjunction with other treatments for the management of lumbar sciatica. We will use
      Manual lumbar traction along with hot pack, tens, mobilization and exercise therapy.
      Intervention duration of 4 weeks, 3 sessions in a week. Decompression of lumbar spine will be
      given once in a week.
