      45 hospitals in Germany, all part of a German hospital network. From January 1st till
      November 17th, 2020, all hospitalized patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) will be included. Demographical data and outcomes will be
      assessed in the entire study cohort. In a subgroup, consisting of 7 hospitals, further
      detailed data (e.g. baseline characteristics, laboratory values, medication, clinical events)
      will be assessed. Additionally, there will be subgroups of patients with cardiovascular
      events and prior or preexisting oncological diseases. There are two primary endpoints: 1.
      Combination of all-cause death and/or need for mechanical ventilation and/or allocation to
      intensive care unit (ICU). 2. Occurrence of a clinical manifest cardiovascular events. The
      aim of the study is the development of a prediction model for the primary endpoints, whereas
      the secondary endpoint is a comparison of mortality rates between the 1st (01/01/20-09/15/20)
      and 2nd (15/09/20) infection wave. All endpoints will be verified by an Endpoint Review
      Committee. A Steering Committee, consisting of representatives of the 45 hospitals, the trial
      statistician and members of the scientific department, takes responsibility of the study
      design and results.
