      function and perfusion in patients on haemodialysis (HD) using magnetic imaging techniques.
      The Primary objectives are to investigate the difference in cardiac perfusion, structure and
      function between standard HD and thermocontrolled HD using magnetic imaging techniques, to
      observe the the changes in renal perfusion and oxygenation within one dialysis session and
      the changes to cerebral perfusion within one dialysis session.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the difference in cerebral perfusion, structure,
      oedema and function between standard HD and thermocontrolled HD, the difference in renal
      perfusion and oxygenation between standard HD and thermocontrolled HD and the differences in
      visual acuity and cognitive assessment across a dialysis session and over a dialysis
      treatment course.
