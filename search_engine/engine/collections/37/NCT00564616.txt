      resuscitation (CPR) significantly improves survival. Dispatch assistance increases the chance
      of bystander CPR but the quality of dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR) remains unsatisfactory.
      This study is conducted to assess the effect of adding interactive video communication to
      dispatch instruction on the quality of bystander CPR, including chest compressions and rescue
      breathing, in simulated cardiac arrests.
