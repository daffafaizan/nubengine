      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of talotrexin in patients in patients with advanced
           or recurrent solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug or patient characteristics with
           drug-related toxicity in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive talotrexin IV over 5 minutes on day 1 OR days 1 and 8 OR days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of talotrexin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-10 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12
      months.
