      diagnosed with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee and are undergoing knee replacement
      surgery at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Data regarding patient activity and
      functional recovery will be collected using two methods. First, data will be collected
      through the extraction of three-axis accelerometer data, collected via a wrist-worn (and
      hip-worn for a subset of patients) physical activity monitor. This data will be collected in
      three intervals: pre-operatively, immediately postoperatively, and at 6 months
      postoperatively. Secondly, data will be collected by standard clinical assessment and patient
      reported outcome measures. These assessments will again take place pre-operatively, at 6
      weeks postoperatively, and at 6 months postoperatively. Additional data will be collected
      through a simple activity diary, which asks the participants to log their monitor wear-time
      along with the times that they took bicycle rides or extended walks.

      The expected duration of patient involvement is up to a total of 8 to 8.5 weeks over the
      course of up to 7 months. There are no clinical visits within this protocol beyond what is
      already within normal patient care. Patients will be asked to post their monitor back to the
      research centre for data collection and data processing twice during the study period.

      The aim of this study is to assess the trajectory of recovery in terms of physical activity
      in the post-operative knee replacement population, and subsequently to define the expected
      path of early recovery.
