    
      This study will establish a prospective cohort of pre-treatment tumor specimens with
      correlated de-identified clinical and demographic data and tissue histology from cancer
      patients who are undergoing treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Patients who have undergone
      pre-anti-PD-1/PD-L1-treatment tumor biopsy or who are scheduled for tumor biopsy prior to
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment will be enrolled.

      The study will not require a study-specific tumor biopsy; any biopsies taken prior to
      treatment as part of standard of care are eligible for this study. Biopsies must not have
      been taken after immunotherapy treatment began.

      Participants will be asked to provide their consent for the potential use of their
      biospecimens in subsequent studies for the development and validation of a diagnostic test.
