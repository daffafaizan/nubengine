      will sign an informed consent and be included in the study. Urine sample will be collected
      specifically for the study. Eye's anterior chamber fluid will also be collected during the
      surgery as it is the usual practice (the sample is used for the neopterin dosage instead of
      being thrown away).

      These samples will be centrifuged, frozen in a -80Â° C freezer. At the end of the study, all
      the samples will be sent to the central Lab for the neopterin dosage analysis. Results will
      be communicated to the principal investigator afterward.
