      literacy that some features of this pedagogical model are positively associated to the
      development and attributes of physical literacy. However, there is no further supplement on
      the curriculum and pedagogical method for physical educators to develop students as
      physically literate individuals. Compared to primary school students and adolescents,
      university students are at the stage of transition from compulsory physical education in
      secondary school to more self-initiated physical lifestyle in adulthood. It is therefore
      important that they develop physical literacy as well as a positive attitude towards physical
      activity. Unfortunately, despite its importance, physical literacy among university students
      is insufficiently investigated. In view of the above, this study employs a cluster randomized
      trial design to examine the effectiveness of sport education model delivered in the required
      physical education lessons at the university level to eligible students. The investigation
      focuses on the pre- and post-test and follow-up difference to see whether there are
      differences on perceived motivational climate, situational motivation, and their
      corresponding outcome of perceived PL, PA enjoyment and, self-report and objective PA levels.
      Also, this study investigates the fitness instruction time by videotaping and coding during
      every PE lesson from both groups. This study would be significant that the findings could
      establish the importance on physical literacy development through sport education model as
      well as develop students' physical literacy and positive attitude towards physical activity.
