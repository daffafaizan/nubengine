      intervention. 36 veterans with advanced cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention
      groups and complete a brief battery of pre-test measures. Subjects in the first group
      ("treatment") will meet with a facilitator three times for a period of 45 min-1 hour. In the
      first session, subjects will be asked to discuss issues related to life review. In the second
      session, participants will be asked to speak in more depth about issues such as regret,
      forgiveness and things left undone, In the final session, subjects will focus on heritage and
      legacy. The subjects in the second group ("attention control") will meet with a facilitator
      three times for a period of 45 min- 1 hour and listen to a non-guided relaxation compact disk
      (CD). The third group of participants ("true control") will be exposed to no intervention or
      attention control. One week and two weeks later, participants in all groups will receive
      post-test measures administered by a blinded interviewer.
