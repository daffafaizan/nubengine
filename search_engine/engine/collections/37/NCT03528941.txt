      previous HBV exposure (HBsAg negative, anti HBc positive with or without anti-HBs) treated
      with Ibrutinib single agent according to the IWCLL criteria 2008. Patients will be divided in
      two cohorts one encompassing patients receiving lamivudine and the second one including
      patients who will not be given any prophylaxis. Each patient will be observed for one year
      from the first administration of Ibrutinib.

      The aim of the Study is to evaluate the incidence of HBV reactivation cases in patients
      affected by CLL treated with Ibrutinib.
