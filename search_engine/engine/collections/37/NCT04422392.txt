      proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration PD-1
      antibody plus chemotherapy in patients resectable stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC. Data obtained in this
      study will provide valuable information for planning further phase III clinical trials of
      anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease
      setting.
