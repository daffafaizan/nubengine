      diabetic macular oedema in patients suffering diabetic retinopathy by exerting a positive
      beneficial effect at retinal cellular level.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of vision and the most common cause of
      blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries.Swelling
      of the central retina or "macular oedema". Patients will be treated in an office clinic,three
      times a week for a treatment duration of 2 minutes per session, a total of 12 times over the
      duration of 4 weeks and will be assessed at 8 weeks to establish any change induced in
      retinal oedema. Safety follow up will be assessed at 3 and 6 months post treatment.
