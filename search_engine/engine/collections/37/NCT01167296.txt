      effectively treat most IUA. In order to prevent adhesion reformation after surgery, most
      gynecologists will prescribe high-dose estrogen to stimulate endometrial growth, and leave an
      IUD or a Foley catheter in uterus for 1-3 months. But neither IUD nor Foley catheter conform
      to the uterine cavity. The Cook balloon uterine stent was designed to fit into the uterine
      cavity. But it was designed to tamponade the uterus to prevent post-operative uterine
      bleeding. It's not known if it can be left in the uterus for 30 days.

      Study Design：Uterine culture was done before hysteroscopic surgery, and 30 days later. The
      study group comprise patients with uterine stent; the control group comprise patients who
      undergo hysteroscopic surgeries but without uterine stent.

      Method：Immediately before hysteroscopic surgery, a culture tip is inserted into the uterine
      cavity and sent for culture. Another culture was done 30 days later, and a second-look
      hysteroscope is done to evaluate the healing of uterine cavity. The removed uterine stent was
      sent for bacterial culture too. The same procedures are done for patients with and without
      uterine stent. The bacterial counts will be compared before and after hysterosocpic
      surgeries, and between the two groups of patients.

      Effect：If leaving the uterine stent in the uterus up to 30 days does not cause bacteria to
      grow, we can be confident to leave the stent for 30 days.
