      a challenging management. Its incidence and healthcare costs have increased over the decades.
      One of the most important features of this arrhythmia is its stroke risk, which can be
      reduced with the use of anticoagulants. Deciding about anticoagulation therapy is complicated
      due to frequent competing comorbidities and potential harms of the therapy itself. To achieve
      better outcomes in preventing stroke, it is paramount that decisions about atrial
      fibrillation treatment be shared between providers and patients.

      Mobile health is empowering individuals to assume a more active role in monitoring and
      managing their chronic conditions and therapeutic regimens. Also, health professionals are
      being provided with fast and point-of-care information, which can facilitate decision-making.

      Therefore, this study will investigate the effects of an mHealth application idealized to aid
      shared decision and improve anticoagulation care in atrial fibrillation.

      Adults with atrial fibrillation will be recruited from anticoagulation outpatient clinics and
      Basic Health Units and randomized to either (1) an intervention group in which the mHealth
      application will be used during the consultations or (2) a control group receiving the usual
      care with anticoagulation.

      It is hypothesized that the intervention group will achieve better anticoagulation outcomes.
