      Institute is to be used to measure various physiological parameters. Since mitochondria
      produce most of the energy necessary for cellular function, their efficacy is most important
      for systems with a high energy demand like the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver,
      and endocrine tissues. As a result, mitochondria diseases usually manifest as complex,
      multi-organ disorders, requiring multispecialty investigations.
