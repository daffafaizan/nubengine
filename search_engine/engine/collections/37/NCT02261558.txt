      resiliency of adults undergoing infusion therapy. This research study is being undertaken to
      learn about how creative music therapy modalities can affect the infusion therapy process.
      Infusion therapy often includes side effects which impact quality of life. Symptoms include
      pain, nausea and anxiety. For newly diagnosed patients anxiety accompanies adjustment to
      scheduling treatments and side effects. Typically patients receiving infusion therapy have no
      alternative focus for their mind and or body aside from the Infusion itself. Since the
      relationship between pain and anxiety is inter-related, altering one modality through a live
      music intervention may modify the impact of the other modality thus shifting the cycle and
      overall impact of pain and anxiety providing relief which leads to self soothing control
      measures. The current research will enroll patients newly diagnosed with either Lung, Breast,
      or Gastrointestinal Cancer that are treated in the Infusion Suite of SLRHC. 100 patients will
      be randomly assigned to three groups: clinical instrumental improvisation, clinical vocal
      improvisation or control. All enrolled participants will complete a survey which indicates
      their music preference, Resiliency Test , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Body Pain Scale - Color Analysis Scale (CAS).
