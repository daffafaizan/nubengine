      overall survival rate, retaining pulmonary function and the rates of loco-regional and
      systemic recurrence ) of patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2 cm) non-small cell lung
      cancer undergoing anatomic segmentectomy vs lobectomy. And to evaluate whether the anatomic
      segmentectomy is an optimal type of surgery for the patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2cm)
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Outline: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study of anatomic
      segmentectomy vs lobectomy for the patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2cm) non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). According to completely random block design, the patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo anatomic segmentectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or
           thoracoscopy/VATS.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo lobectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.

      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for
      the subsequent 2 years and annually for 5 years postoperatively.
