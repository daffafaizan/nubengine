      disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. More than 85% of all stroke-related deaths
      occur in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries. In a study from our center in Pakistan, the
      all-cause mortality due to stroke was 12.9% in the first year. Vascular causes in general and
      recurrent stroke in particular accounted for the bulk of the mortality cases. Recurrence of a
      stroke in Pakistan is documented to be as high as 53% in the first year, as opposed to
      international rates of approximately 30% in the first month. Evidence based guidelines
      recommend risk factor control with antiplatelet agents, anti-hypertensive medications, lipid
      lowering drugs and appropriate anti-diabetic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence.
      When taken together, the combination of an antihypertensive, statin and antiplatelet agent
      can reduce total stroke risk by 80%.

      However, the impact of drugs used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient
      adherence. Adherence is defined as "the extent to which a person's behavior - taking
      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed
      recommendations from a health care provider." It is said that optimal adherence to
      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.

      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage
      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS (Short Text
      Messages) reminders. These SMS reminders will support and assist stroke patients to take
      medications as prescribed and on time. We hypothesise that SMS will improve the adherence of
      patients to stroke medications by 2 points on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.
