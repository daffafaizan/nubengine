      determine AKI risk in patients without underlying kidney disease are lacking. Renal
      functional reserve (RFR) can be used to measure the capacity of the kidney to increase
      glomerular filtration rate under conditions of physiological stress and may serve as a
      functional marker that assesses susceptibility to injury.

      The investigators seek to determine whether a reduced preoperative RFR predicts postoperative
      AKI in patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rates undergoing elective cardiac
      surgery. All centres will measure RFR with creatinine clearance, except University Hospital
      Giessen where in addition iohexol plasma-clearance will be used.
