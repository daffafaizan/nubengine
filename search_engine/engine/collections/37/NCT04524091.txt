      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) during the transition phase of passive ventilation to partial
      ventilatory support. A high respiratory drive and consequently, a strong inspiratory effort,
      may produce large transpulmonary pressure (TP) swings mainly in dependent lung regions closer
      to the diaphragm and cause alveolar rupture and inflammatory mediators release.

      The application of high Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during SB has shown to
      ameliorate the progression of lung injury by decreasing the TP and esophageal pressure (EP)
      swings and the stress / strain applied to the lung. The mechanisms proposed to be responsible
      for these effects are the activation of Hering Breuer reflex caused by a greater stretch of
      the lung parenchyma at the end of inspiration; the recruitment of previously collapsed
      tissue, the homogenization of lung ("fluid like behavior") and the improvement of respiratory
      system compliance (Crs); and the impairment in the length - tension relationship of the
      diaphragm which produces mechanical disadvantage to generate force due to a higher lung
      volume. However, it is uncertain which patient will respond adequately to the application of
      high PEEP and consequently will reduce the inspiratory effort.

      If all the previously explained mechanisms have an effect on the control of inspiratory
      effort, in patients who will respond to high PEEP application, a decrease in inspiratory
      effort is expected during an end-inspiratory occlusion. At end-inspiration lung parenchyma is
      more homogeneous, the lung volume is higher and the diaphragmic dome is flatter compared to
      the physiological condition end of expiration, where the lung volume is lower, the parenchyma
      is more heterogeneous and the diaphragmatic neuromechanical coupling is better. Based on this
      rationale, the investigators developed an index called "Inspiratory Ratio" (IR) to predict
      the response of patient's inspiratory effort to the application of high PEEP without having
      to measure esophageal pressure.

      The IR will be calculated using the following formula: (IPSexp - IPSinsp ) / (IPSexp) x 100

      IPSexp = negative deflection in airway pressure expiratory pause; IPSinsp = negative
      deflection in airway pressure end inspiratory pause
