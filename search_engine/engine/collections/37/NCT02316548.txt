      I. To evaluate the ability of postcystectomy adjuvant radiotherapy to safely reduce pelvic
      tumor recurrence, defined as pelvic recurrence-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate increase in disease-free survival. II. Evaluate toxicity of adjuvant pelvic
      radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients are stratified by
      neoadjuvant preoperative or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.
