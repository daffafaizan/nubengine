      melanoma risk-reduction, including opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and practices related to
      ultraviolet radiation exposure, melanoma prevention, and melanoma detection.

      Participants in Part 2 of the study will be asked to complete a written questionnaire on
      melanoma risk-reduction and then be interviewed to obtain feedback on how the questionnaire
      may be refined.

      Participants in Part 3 of the study will be asked to be interviewed by telephone.
      Participants then will receive educational material in the form of a newsletter tailored to
      their interview responses. Participants then will be asked to be interviewed to obtain
      feedback for refining the educational material. In each part of the study, the patient/family
      member will receive a letter describing the study and the Consent Statement for Questionnaire
      and Interview Studies.

      Prior to the start of the interview, the Consent Statement will be read to the patient/family
      member. Patients/family members may or may not choose to have the interview tape-recorded.
      Participants may stop the interview or questionnaire at any time and may refuse to answer any
      questions. At any time, the patient/family member may refuse to have the interview
      tape-recorded. There is no treatment associated with this study.
