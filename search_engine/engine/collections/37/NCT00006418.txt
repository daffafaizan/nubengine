      ascertainment strategies and assessment procedures in order to maximize the number collected.
      Subjects thought to have schizophrenia will be assessed by personal and family interviews and
      a review of medical records. Diagnoses will be made by consensus best-estimate procedures.
      Blood specimens will be obtained from all individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder plus their available parents and also the control individuals. A clinical
      self-assessment will be administered to each control subject. The assessment will include
      validated self-assessments of lifetime major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance
      use, and self-reported history of bipolar or psychotic symptoms. Permanent cell lines will be
      created and DNA extracted at the NIMH-sponsored Center for Genetic Studies. At the end of the
      four-year project period, biological materials and blinded pedigree and clinical data will be
      made available to the scientific community for genetic studies of schizophrenia and related
      disorders. The control sample will, however, be released in a staggered fashion, twice during
      each fiscal year, to start during the 2nd year of recruitment. The informed consent for
      controls includes consent for specimens to be used in research on the genetics of any medical
      disorder. In years 3 and 4, we will undertake association analyses. Power analyses suggest
      that this study will have excellent power to detect loci associated with genes with
      relatively small etiologic effects. Data derived from this study will potentially have
      applications for the treatment and prevention of schizophrenia.
