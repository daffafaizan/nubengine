           the Effects on Atrial and Ventricular Refractoriness of an Intravenous Infusion of
           AZD2927 in Patients Undergoing an Invasive Electrophysiological Procedure.

        -  The study has an adaptive design. In the 1st dose group the planned number of randomised
           patients is 24. The tentative number of randomised patients in the optional 2nd dose
           group is 12, 24 or 36 and thus a total maximum of 60 patients will be randomised in the
           study.
