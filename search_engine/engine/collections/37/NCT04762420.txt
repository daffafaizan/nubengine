      After obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee, a prospective 3-month study in
      patients aged 18-75 years who underwent general anesthesia with rocuronium (initial dose 0.6
      mg/kg) NMB and subsequent reversal with sugammadex, was carried out. American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA ) physical status V, emergency surgery, patients with hypersensitivity
      history to rocuronium or sugammadex, severe renal impairment/dialysis, neuromuscular
      diseases, severe hepatic disease, pre-existing coagulopathies and pregnancy were excluded.
      Monitoring included ASA standard monitoring, bispectral index and NMB monitoring using
      TOFscan® monitor. The senior anaesthesiologist was blinded to the TOFscan®, which was only
      available to the author.

      At the time of pharmacologic reversal of NMB, both the sugammadex dose proposed by the
      anaesthesiologist (SSD) and the dose suggested by TOFscan® (QSD) according to the Portuguese
      recommendations for the management of NMB were recorded. Afterwards the QSD was administered
      to overcome ethical issues. When train-of-four (TOF) count was 0, the author performed the
      post tetanic count (PTC) stimulus to determine the recommended dose. The SSD was considered
      appropriate if it was within 10% of the QSD for the depth of NMB. All patients were extubated
      with a TOF ratio > 0.9 (TOFr) and both the rocuronium and sugammadex dose were calculated
      based on the real patient weight. Data regarding anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia and
      dosing pattern of rocuronium were also noted. The results were analysed descriptively.
