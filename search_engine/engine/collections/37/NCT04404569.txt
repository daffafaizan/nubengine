    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, rollover study to allow continued treatment access for
      participants enrolled in studies of BXQ-350. This study is intended for subjects who have
      completed the required study observation period or are still on treatment upon the closure of
      their respective BXQ-350 clinical study, and who are judged by the Investigator to benefit
      from continued treatment with BXQ-350. The additional treatment is optional and voluntary.
