      collected include age, sex, height and weight (at age 20, current age, and heaviest ever),
      history of cancer (own and partner). Questions about recreational physical activity, smoking
      history and alcohol consumption, acid reflux, heartburn, denture use and tonsillectomy,
      frequency of use of paracetamol, antihistamine and NSAIDS.

      The questionnaires also ask participants some detailed questions about sexual behaviour and
      history if they are comfortable to give this information.
