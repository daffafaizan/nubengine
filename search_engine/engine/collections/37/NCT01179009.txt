    
      This experiment is a pilot study involving up to 20 healthy males or females between the ages
      of 18-65 to test whether a 100-hour ketamine infusion plus clonidine would be more effective,
      with longer lasting results, then the standard 40-minute ketamine infusion (plus clonidine).
      Each of the 2 arms, will be evaluated using a between subject, double-blind, randomized
      design. An additional subset of 20 non-randomized patients, separate from the original
      randomized clinical trial (RTC), will receive an MRI pre and post ketamine infusion.

        1. a. Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion

        2. a. Controlled 40-minute IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion
           c. 100-hour(+/-)IV placebo (saline) infusion

        3. a. Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion c.
           MRI pre and post ketamine infusion

      In both conditions and the neuroimaging subset, participants will be admitted to the
      Washington University School of Medicine Clinical Research Unit at Barnes-Jewish Hospital for
      approximately 108-hours (Monday morning-Friday evening). Pulse, blood pressure,
      pulse-oximetry, and an electrocardiogram strip will be routinely monitored. Serial labs and
      clinical/safety ratings will be done pre-, during, and post-infusion, with the last
      assessments being used to assure that subjects have returned to their "baseline" prior to
      discharge from the research unit. Participants will continue to see their primary
      psychiatrist throughout the study.
