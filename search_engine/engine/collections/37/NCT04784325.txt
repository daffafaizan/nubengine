      clinically meaningful in-clinic testing is limited by physician availability and patient
      willingness to undergo testing in-clinic. Meanwhile, at-home hormonal bloodwork relies on the
      use of an ADx card, and is not widely accepted as clinically reliable by the medical
      community. The Sponsor is developing a comprehensive home fertility assessment to enable
      couples to proactively estimate and manage their fertility and family building options.
      Accurate and reliable at-home AMH testing is necessary to reach this goal.

      This study aims to validate the clinical excellence and medical accuracy of blood drawn via
      the TAP II device relative to a standard in-clinic venipuncture draw and other options
      available on the market to support emerging telemedicine care models. In doing so, the
      Sponsor may receive CLIA validation for the TAP II in AMH testing and commercialize a Lab
      Developed Test.
