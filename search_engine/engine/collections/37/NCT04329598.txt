      low back pain and radiculopathy that spreads to the lower extremities. The prevalence of
      lumbar disc herniation reported in individuals with low back pain; It ranges from 0% to 47%.
      It has been reported that the highest prevalence of LDH is in adults between the ages of
      30-50. Disc herniation at the L4-5 and L5 - S1 spinal levels is more common in adults over
      the age of 55. The most important complaint in LDH is pain, and patients often complain of a
      blunt pain in the lumbar region. Weakness in the muscles surrounding the vertebra can cause
      balance and walking problems. For Lumbar Disc Hernia, sedentary life, gender, high body mass
      index, occupation, smoking, psychosocial factors and people exposed to vibration for a long
      time are among the risk factors. Lack of time is reported to be the biggest obstacle to
      exercising. In addition, kinesiophobia, that is the fear of pain due to movement, is very
      common in this group. Physical activity and exercise are arguably the most comprehensive
      therapeutic agent for a long-term and fundamentally established society. There is a consensus
      on the review of the current literature that it positively affects the risk of exercise
      disease, but not all, risk factors, diseases, and disability between middle and advanced age.
      Whole Body Electromyostimulation (WB-EMS), a technology that addresses nine (main) muscle
      groups, may be a good option. Given the low training intensity of 1-2 sessions per week for
      20 sessions, it may be of interest to people who are close to traditional exercise programs,
      with low volunteer intensity and a high degree of oversight and individualization of existing
      WB-EMS settings.
