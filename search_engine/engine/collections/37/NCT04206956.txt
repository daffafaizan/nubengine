      vulnerable subjects.

      For children, there is few data about predictive factors of postoperative pain after
      ambulatory surgery.

      The objective of this study is to collect preoperative data (preoperative children's anxiety
      and parental anxiety) and postoperative data (postoperative pain measure: the day of surgery
      and 3 months after surgery) for children undergoing abdominal ou urologic ambulatory surgery,
      and to determine if there is a relationship between these data (Odds Ratio)
