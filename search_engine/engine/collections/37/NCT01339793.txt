      survey approach to understand the superintendents and employees' perceptions of CSR, and to
      explore the effects of CSR on organizational commitment of employees and organizational
      performance. The samples are taken from the senior managers (such as the superintendent and
      vice superintendent) and employees in the hospitals of which the number of beds are more than
      200. The structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied to confirm the research framework and
      to test the hypotheses. The results will provide a reference for the management and
      regulators of hospitals to set up the CSR policies, and contribute to senior managers on the
      CSR strategy and human resource development with regard to hospitals.
