      the treatment of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma; however, melanoma often develops resistance
      to these drugs over time, and the tumors start to re-grow. Investigators will use the
      participant's LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) levels obtained from routine blood work, along with
      CT scans to decide when to hold or resume their study treatment. Investigators hypothesize
      that this type of dosing schedule with vemurafenib and cobimetinib may potentially delay the
      time to progression and re-growth of their melanoma.
