      pain in their hand joints, they also appear to have increased signals in their brain pain
      processing pathways. At St George's, University of London, the investigators have been
      conducting studies to find out which brain regions are activated in subjects with hand
      osteoarthritis. The investigators have found that certain brain regions (thalamus, insula,
      cingulate and somatosensory cortex) are activated during painful tasks in patients with hand
      osteoarthritis but not in healthy people. In this study the investigators will establish
      whether drugs that inhibit pain processing pathways in the brain can help. Patients who are
      still having pain despite their usual painkillers will be randomly divided into 3 groups: one
      group will receive a placebo, the other 2 groups will receive one of two different drugs,
      duloxetine or pregabalin. Participants will be assessed using questionnaires and a brain scan
      (functional MRI) before and after 13 weeks of taking the tablets. This study will help us to
      understand the ways in which people feel pain in osteoarthritis. If our trial proves
      successful,drugs that dampen central pain pathways could be used in combination with local
      pain-relieving drugs to improve treatment and reduce disability in patients with hand
      osteoarthritis.
