      brolucizumab and consent is given.

      The baseline visit will be used to assess eligibility and collect baseline characteristics
      information. The study eye will be defined as the first eye treated during the study; the
      other eye will be considered as fellow eye. If both eyes are treated at baseline, the eye
      with the worse visual acuity will be chosen as the study eye (if the visual acuity is
      measured equal, the treating ophthalmologist defines the study eye upon his discretion). The
      follow-up visits will take place at a frequency defined as per investigator's discretion.
      Patients that have not received an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection or visited an eye
      specialist for at least 6 months will be discontinued from the observation.

      Retrospective data will be collected for switch patients starting treatment with brolucizumab
      for up to three months before baseline. Patients, already being treated with brolucizumab may
      also be included. Here, retrospective data will be collected since the first brolucizumab
      injection.
