      safety of ustekinumab in the treatment of relapsing or chronic antibiotic refractory
      pouchitis during a 48-week treatment period. Twenty subjects with a RPC and IPAA for UC who
      have developed relapsing or chronic antibiotic refractory pouchitis will be enrolled.

      All patients will receive intravenously (IV) ustekinumab ~6mg/kg at baseline and
      subcutaneously (SC) ustekinumab 90mg every 8 weeks thereafter until Week 48. All subjects
      will receive concomitant antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin or metronidazole from
      baseline through Week 4. Intravenous induction doses will be 260mg for patients <55kg, 390mg
      for patients between 55 and 85kg, and 520mg for patients with a body weight >85 kg.

      Clinical and biochemical evaluation will be planned every 8 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed
      at Week 16 and Week 48 using mPDAI and PDAI scores, therefor a pouchoscopy with biopsy
      sampling will be performed. Patients who do not achieve partial response (reduction of mPDAI
      score by â‰¥2 points from baseline) at Week 16 will be discontinued.
