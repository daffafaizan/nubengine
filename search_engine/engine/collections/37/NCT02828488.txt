        -  Frailty is common among the elderly patient population who have a TIA. Compared to
           control groups of literature.

        -  Patients with high fragility score ABCD2 also have a high score.

        -  Patients with a high score of fragility also have a significant number of vascular risk
           factors (including atrial fibrillation)

        -  Patients with a high score of fragility also have an average length of stay (ALOS)
           higher than the others. So underlying the question is: can we learn to better identify
           patients who are going to need a bigger structure their output at home.

      objectives:

        -  Assess the feasibility of placing a fragile test in acute phase of AIT in USINV.

        -  To evaluate the frequency of frailty among the population of elderly patients who have a
           TIA.

        -  Compare in AIT over 70 years those with fragile high score to those with low scores,
           especially for ABCD2 score, vascular risk factors and the DMS.

        -  Statements parameters:

           o The fragility score:

        -  Choice of fragility score: among the fragility of scores, the most used in international
           literature is the score of Linda Fried. Moreover, the stress of the study is related to
           the environment of the USINV (shortly, short DMS, often tired patients). It is therefore
           important to use this study for a test only, but quick handover. The score Fried also
           has the advantage (J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2001, 56 (3): M146-56) The first 4
           items are simple clinical evaluation. The 5th (grip test) will be performed with a
           device (single gauge measuring the fingers bending strength) loan from the geriatric
           ward.
