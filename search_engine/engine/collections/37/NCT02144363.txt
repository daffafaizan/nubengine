      mechanical ventilation in first 24 hour of life will be recruited. A size appropriate
      nasogastric tube with multiple array of electrodes (Edi catheter) will be inserted in each
      eligible infant. The average EdI (Edi_avg) will be measured during mechanical ventilation
      just before extubation. All infants will be extubated to non-invasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV or CPAP) delivered through nasal cannula

      The specific aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between Edi_avg before
      extubation and the extubation success in a sample of preterm infants with respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS). We hypothesize that Edi-avg of infants with successful extubation
      will be significantly different from the infants who fail extubation
