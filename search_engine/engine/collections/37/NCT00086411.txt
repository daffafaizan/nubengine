      one of two types of FDA approved smoking cessation products (bupropion or the nicotine
      patch)used to achieve long term abstinence among lighter smokers. Each participant received
      both products under blinded conditions meaning that neither the participant nor the counselor
      knew which product was real or a placebo. The primary goal was to determine the combination
      or combinations of high or low intensity counseling and pharmacotherapy (either bupropion or
      the nicotine patch) that were most effective for lighter smokers. The main hypothesis was
      that higher level counseling would contribute to improved outcomes meaning that more
      counseling would be associated higher abstinence rates following the completion of treatment
      and at longer term follow-up.
