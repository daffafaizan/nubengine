      as measured by Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Tinnitus Primary Function (TPF) scores; 2)
      Etanercept improves hearing; and 3) Etanercept reduces tinnitus distress by restoring
      abnormal functional connectivity between auditory and limbic brain structures to
      physiological levels, as revealed by resting-state fMRI.

      In addition, the investigators will test if: 1) Etanercept treatment leads to sustained
      therapeutic effects over time; 2) Etanercept-induced tinnitus relief is accompanied by
      restored abnormal functional connectivity between brain centers, extending past cessation of
      treatment; 3) Etanercept will further improve microvasculature-related neural plasticity
      after treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to test if: 1) Etanercept reduces tinnitus loudness measured by
      visual numeric scale (VNS) rating; 2) Etanercept decreases TNF-Î± concentration in blood
      serum; 3) Etanercept reduces tinnitus distress and/or loudness by improving maladaptive,
      microvasculature-related neural plasticity.
