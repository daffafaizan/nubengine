      used in all patients. Patients with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure at rest or during
      exercise (estimated by echocardiography), or with decreased exercise capacity (as a potential
      sign of pulmonary hypertension) are advised to undergo right heart catheterisation.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and six-minute walk distance measurement are performed to
      measure exercise capacity. The described work-up of patients allows precise and objective
      hemodynamic and clinical evaluation.
