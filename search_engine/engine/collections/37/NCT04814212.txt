      intervention (PCI) during the last two decades. However there are still significant drawbacks
      in using DES as a permanent coronary implant. Most importantly, bleeding remains a
      significant complication of PCI, especially in elderly patients. The number of PCI patients
      having OAC:s is already significant, and will grow in the future, as the volume of PCIs in
      octogenarians increases, and so does the incidence of atrial fibrillation by age. After
      stenting at least one month lasting dual antiplatlet treatment (DAPT) is mandatory, and it
      cannot be safely terminated in case of a bleed. The optimal duration of DAPT on patients at
      bleeding risk is not known.

      Balloon coated with paclitaxel and iopromide (drug-coated balloon, DCB) was originally
      developed for the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but later its potential for the treatment
      of de-novo coronary artery leasons has become clear in large registry trials. So far, the
      randomized controlled studies have shown the non-inferiority of PCI using DCB in comparison
      to DES in de novo leasons in small vessels. Also the non-inferiority of PCI using DCB in
      comparison to BMS was shown in the DEBUT trial in large vessels on patients at high bleeding
      risk. These results need to be confirmed in comparison of DCB to DES as the use of BMS is
      diminishing.

      Our hypothesis in the DEBATE trial is that DCB and shorter DAPT regimen is superior to the
      treatment using DES and longer DAPT duration in the treatment of stable CAD or in ACS (UAP or
      NSTEMI) in patients on anticoagulation medication or otherwise on high bleeding risk.
