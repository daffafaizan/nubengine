    
      Patients with easily accessible tumors (generally, metastatic deposits involving skin,
      subcutaneous tissues, or peripheral lymph node whose excision would not require general
      anaesthesia or the invasion of a body cavity) at the screening visit for participation in
      Study CP-MGA271-01 (the main study) will be asked to participate in this substudy. After
      providing appropriate informed consent, patients will undergo excisional biopsy, punch
      biopsy, or core needle biopsy of the accessible tumor prior to receiving study drug in the
      main study and then again after the first cycle of study drug is completed.

      Some of the biopsy tissue will be sent to a central laboratory for research purposes. The
      central lab will analyze the tissue to see what effects that the study drug might have on
      tumors.
