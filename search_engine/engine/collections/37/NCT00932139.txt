      stress are decreased by EA; (2) The mechanisms of EA that reduces elevated blood pressure. EA
      inhibits the sympathetic nervous system, decreases blood pressure and reduces the oxygen
      demand. Our prior data in animals shows that improvements in cardiovascular function during
      myocardial ischemia, reflex hypertension and sustained hypertension are mediated by an
      EA-induced sensory neural reflex originating in somatic nerves to reduce sympathetic nerve
      activity. The specific aims of the present study will allow us to better understand and
      modulate the sympathetic nervous discharge activity that can cause hypertension during normal
      activity and stress in humans. The potential clinical application is the therapeutic value of
      EA in patients with hypertension.

      Furthermore, the study will also investigate gender differences in the blood pressure
      lowering effect of EA. In particular in middle-aged hypertensive women and men.
