    
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to evaluate the health and economic
      effects of a community-based intensive lifestyle intervention for adult primary care patients
      with elevated body mass index and dysglycemia (either type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes). The
      study will use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess reach, effectiveness, costs,
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a clinical-community partnership to offer
      intensive lifestyle intervention resources to eligible adult primary care patients.
