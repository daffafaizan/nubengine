    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if IV albumin administration improves short-term
      survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis (serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dl, serum sodium ≤
      130 mEq/l -milliequivalents per liter- and/or serum bilirubin ≥4 mg/dl) and bacterial
      infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (urinary infection, pneumonia,
      spontaneous or secondary bacteremia, skin/soft tissue infection, acute cholangitis or
      suspected bacterial infection).

      Primary goals of the study:

      • Effect of albumin administration on hospital survival

      Secondary goals of the study:

        -  Effect of albumin administration on 28-day and 90-day survival.

        -  Effect of albumin administration on the incidence of renal dysfunction, AKI, type-1 and
           2 Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) during hospitalization.

        -  Effect of albumin on circulatory function estimated by changes in plasma levels of renin
           and noradrenaline and in serum levels of lactate among infection diagnosis, day 3 and
           infection resolution.

        -  Effect of albumin on serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha
           (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NOX) and on plasma levels of von Willebrand factor
           (vWF:Ag) at diagnosis and resolution of infection.

        -  Effect of albumin on blood leukocyte count and serum C-reactive protein levels (CRP)
           during infection.

        -  Effect of albumin on the development of other individual organ failures (renal, liver,
           cerebral, circulatory, coagulation and respiratory), acute-on-chronic liver failure
           (ACLF type 1, 2 and 3 according to the Canonic Study), CLIF-SOFA score, CLIF-Consortium
           score, Child-Pugh score and MELD score during hospitalization.

        -  Evaluation of predictive factors of HRS and ACLF development in non-SBP infections.

        -  Samples (blood, plasma, serum and urine) will be obtained and stored for genomic,
           proteomic and standard biochemical investigations in future ancillary studies related to
           the aim of the study.
