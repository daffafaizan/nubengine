      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin in patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme who are receiving or not receiving anticonvulsants known to be
      metabolized by P450.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety profile of this drug in this patient
      population.

      III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this drug on this schedule and determine the effects of
      P450-inducing anticonvulsants on the pharmacokinetics in these patients.

      IV. Determine the radiographic response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      V. Determine survival and drug toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin followed by a phase II study.
      Patients are stratified according to whether concurrent anticonvulsant drugs induce P450 (yes
      vs modest/no or no drugs).

      Phase I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14
      days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per stratum) receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients receive oxaliplatin as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months until disease progression, and then monthly
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients (12 per stratum) will be accrued for the phase I
      part of this study within 8-12 months. A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for the
      phase II part of this study within 5-12 months.
