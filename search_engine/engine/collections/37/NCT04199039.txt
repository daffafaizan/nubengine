      workers was used to fill out the "Patient Information Form".

      When the study started, the first 43 patients were assigned to the control group and the
      following 43 patients were assigned to the study group in the CVS ICU. ET fixation in the
      control group was performed with plasters, which are routinely used in the ICU where the
      study was conducted. ET fixation of the patients in the study group was performed with an ET
      holder (AnchorFast Oral Endotracheal Tube Fastener, Hollister, Liberlyville, USA) when they
      arrived at the CVS ICU.

      When the findings of patients' suction needs were observed (increase in respiratory rate, HR
      increase, arterial BP increase, high pressure alarm in ventilator, mucus in ET, cyanosis,
      dyspnea, restlessness, sweating, disturbance of blood gas parameters, wheezing, etc.),
      endotracheal suction was performed according to the application standards. The patients' SBP,
      DBP, HR and SpO2 values, which were displayed on the bedside monitor (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo),
      were recorded on the "Hemodynamic Parameters Form" just before, during, and at the end of
      endotracheal suction, and in the following 5th and 15th minutes.

      During the suction process, it was ensured that the patients were in the supine position in
      which the head of the bed was lifted by 30 degree Before the intra-arterial BP was measured,
      the transducer was reset at the level of the right atrial (plebostatic axis) and the position
      was not changed during all the measurements.
