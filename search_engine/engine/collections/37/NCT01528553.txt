      paediatric orthopaedics. Epiphysiodesis is the technique by which unilateral bone growth is
      stopped. Traditionally this has been performed with staple technique. The 8-plate technique
      is new and advocated because it is believed to reduce the risk of premature closure of the
      growth plate compared to stapling. The benefit of the 8-plate technique has not yet been
      proven in experimental or randomised clinical studies.
