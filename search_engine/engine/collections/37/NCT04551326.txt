      muscle stretching in patients presenting chronic low back pain. The secondary objectives are:
      (1) to evaluate intra- and interrater reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of
      the hamstring flexibility measurements (Active Knee Extension [AKE], Straight Leg Rise [SLR])
      realised with digital inclinometer, (2) to evaluate factors that potentially could influence
      immediate effect of the hamstring stretching, specifically psycho-social factors Fear
      Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD),
      neuropathic pain presence (DN4).
