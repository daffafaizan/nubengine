      approx. 15 % of all intensive care patients. A sustained and prolonged filter running time is
      required to deliver an effective dialysis dose. This requires effective anticoagulation.
      Today, regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is preferred over systemic anticoagulation
      because of prolonged filter lifetimes and less adverse effects.

      We here study prospectively patients with AKI who are treated with continuous veno-venous
      haemofiltration using an RCA protocol.

      We will evaluate all parameters of CRRT including filter running times, delivered dialysis
      dose, causes for treatment interruption and control of pH and electrolytes.
