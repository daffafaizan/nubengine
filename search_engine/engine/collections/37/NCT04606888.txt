      stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients who were
      diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumor and received radical resection of gastrointestinal
      tumors under general anesthesia and to determine the relationship among perioperative TEAS,
      inflammatory response, postoperative pain, and POCD preliminarily.
