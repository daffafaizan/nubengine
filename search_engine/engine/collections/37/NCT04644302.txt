      with COVID and non-COVID sepsis by comparison of microcirculation (sublingual area video
      recordings and biochemical parameters of endothelial cells activation and damage) endothelial
      glycocalyx (sublingual area video recordings and biochemical parameter of glycocalyx
      degradation), and clinical course.
