      the twentieth century and is of particular concern as it primarily affects young men. Though
      the tumor is relatively infrequent in the population as a whole, TGCT is the most common
      cancer among U.S. males in the age group 15-34 years. Despite the increases in TGCT rates,
      the etiology is still poorly understood. The only well described risk factors for TGCT are
      cryptorchism, family history of TGCT and personal history of TGCT. Therefore, in order to
      understand better the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control
      study will be conducted among members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The study will include men
      who have donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between
      the years 1989 and 2003. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR
      donors who have not developed TGCT.

      A total of 1682 servicemen were enrolled in the study; 754 cases and 928 controls. Of these
      participants, 1303 men (77%, 590 cases, 713 controls) donated buccal cell samples. In
      addition to the servicemen, a total of 1090 mothers of servicemen were enrolled and 952 (87%)
      provided a buccal specimen. The DoDSR serum samples have been assayed for levels of
      organochlorines pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, insulin-like growth factors
      and gonadotropins and steroid hormones. DNA isolated from the buccal cell specimens have thus
      far been genotyped for polymorphysms in the hormone metabolism and immune function pathway,
      immune function pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway and for single nucleotide
      polymorphisms in the 8q24 locus. In addition, a genome-wide association study has completed.
      Statistical analyses of the questionnaire data are continuing.
