      preliminary efficacy of unilateral subretinal transplantation of HuRPE cells in subjects with
      Macular degeneration caused by high myopia. The investigators will recruit and enroll 9
      patients based on specific inclusive/exclusive criteria. Experimental and self-controlled eye
      will be determined based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The eye with BCVA between 5
      and 60 ETDRS letters will be determined as experimental eye, which will be divided into 3
      groups and undergo subretinal injection of 3 different dosages of HuRPE cells (300.000,
      500,000 or 1,000,000) respectively, while the other one as control eye, will not receive the
      surgery.

      HuRPE cells will be obtained from Eyecure Therapeutics, Inc.(Jiangsu) located in WuXi,
      Jiangsu Province. The obtained HuRPE cells will meet its quality standards and conform to
      Good manufacturing practices (GMP). HuRPE cells will be transplanted by a board-certified
      vitreoretinal surgeon, which will be administered into the subretinal space of experimental
      eye through a standard surgical approach.

      Immunosuppressive agents will be administered orally to all subjects after transplantation.
      Dosage and time duration of immunosuppressive agents will be regulated strictly relying on
      the condition of immune rejection. Subjects will be monitored with ophthalmologic and
      systemic examinations frequently at regular post-transplant intervals after HuRPE cells
      transplantation.
