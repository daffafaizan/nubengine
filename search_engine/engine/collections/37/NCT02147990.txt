    
      This is a Phase 2, single arm, open-label, dual cohort, multicenter study evaluating the
      safety and efficacy of rociletinib administered orally to patients with previously treated
      mutant EGFR NSCLC.

      Patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts. Cohort A will enroll approximately 125 eligible
      patients who are centrally confirmed T790M-positive. Cohort B will be a continuation of the
      study and will enroll up to approximately 100 eligible patients who will be either centrally
      confirmed T790M-positive or T790M-negative.

      All patients (for Cohort A and B) should have experienced disease progression while on
      treatment with the first single-agent EGFR-directed TKI (EGFR-TKI) for advanced/metastatic
      NSCLC. One line of chemotherapy prior to the EGFR-TKI treatment is permissible.

      The study (Cohorts A and B) will consist of a screening phase to establish study eligibility
      and document baseline measurements, an open-label treatment phase, in which the patient will
      receive rociletinib to ascertain safety and efficacy until disease progression as defined by
      RECIST Version 1.1, clinical tumor progression, or unacceptable toxicity as assessed by the
      investigator. For patients with clinical progression, radiographic assessment should be
      performed to document evidence of radiographic progression.
