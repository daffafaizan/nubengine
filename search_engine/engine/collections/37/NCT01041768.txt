      at least 50 bariatric surgeries performed during the time window January 2007 and September
      2008 will be allowed to participate in the study.

      Each Collaborating Center participating in the study will perform only one type of surgical
      procedure (GBP or BPD), depending on which one it is more familiar with.

      Patients will be randomly assigned with a 2 to 1 ratio to receive either bariatric surgery
      (BS) (either GBP or BPD) or standard antidiabetic care (AC). The randomization will be
      centralized in the Coordinating Center. Patients assigned to BS will undergo GBP or BPD,
      depending on each Collaborating Center. Recruitment will continue, independently of the
      number of recruited patients per center, until the target of 200 GBP+BPD patients, and 100 AC
      patients will be attained.

      After one year since enrollment, patients in AC group will be offered the choice to undergo
      one of the two surgical procedures, and then will follow the same protocol study as the other
      surgical patients. In addition, each Collaborating Center will be responsible for selecting
      one diabetic subject for each operated patient, matched as closely as possible with the
      patients assigned to surgical therapy, from the local population in medical treatment. These
      patients will serve as controls for long term mortality and morbidity.
