      believed to develop slowly through progressive accumulation of genetic mutations, hence the
      disease allows time for diagnosis and curative surgical treatment. Five year survival rates
      for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) can range from 57-61% when detected in the early
      stages of disease. This is compared with a survival rate of approximately 6% once distant
      metastases are present. However, disease diagnosis typically occurs when it has progressed to
      an advanced stage when patients present with signs and symptoms. Therefore, technologies
      capable of asymptomatic disease detection will significantly impact lung cancer specific
      mortality. Metabolomic profiling of cancer measures compounds produced as a result of
      cellular activity including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. Infrared
      spectroscopy is a proven technique for breath analysis that can measure chemical
      concentrations in the parts per trillion range for certain VOCs. When coupled with machine
      learning techniques, this has the potential to be a novel approach for disease detection
      using exhaled breath.
