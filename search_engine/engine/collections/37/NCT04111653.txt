      interviewed the Directorate General of Health (DGS); the latter seized the National Academy
      of Medicine (June 2016) which reported in February 2017.

      In this report it was stated that there was no argument in favor of toxic phenomena related
      to the presence of barium but that it was appropriate, in particular, to evaluate a possible
      passage of barium in the skin in subjects who are treated with thermal mud

        -  by observing, where appropriate, an increase in serum and urinary barium levels in the
           subjects concerned and

        -  by measuring a possible depletion of barium in the sludge used. The DGS validated the
           various recommendations of the Academy and asked, in January 2018, the National Council
           of Thermal Establishments (CNETH) to implement the recommendations of the Academy.

      It will therefore be a prospective before-after interventional study, implementing 15 daily
      applications of 6 mud poultices made with a clay used as thermal clay and containing
      appreciable barium levels.

      A surveillance will be put in place with the event of suspected event, the volunteer can then
      be seen by a doctor.
