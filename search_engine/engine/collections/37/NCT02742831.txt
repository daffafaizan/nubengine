      special health care needs who have been reported to the child protection team at Boston
      Medical Center with concern for neglect that was ultimately not substantiated. Half of the
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the 6-session, one-on-one, in-person,
      behavioral intervention focused on problem solving, emotional regulation, and distress
      tolerance. The other half will be randomly assigned to the control group and will receive
      periodic check-ins and referrals to community resources as needed. Both groups will be
      followed for 12 months after randomization.

      Children who have previously experienced neglect, or other forms of maltreatment, will not
      included in the study. Children will be defined as having special health care needs if they
      have a chronic physical, emotional, or behavioral condition.

      With this pilot, the investigators aim to field-test study mechanics, including enrollment,
      randomization, and the collection of baseline and follow-up data; and obtain empiric
      estimates of study parameters to inform a subsequent fully-powered randomized controlled
      trial.
