      unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies.
      Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30,BCMA,CD123, etc. may be potential in
      developing the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors expressing those
      markers. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T
      targeting CD123 in patients with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety
      assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition,
      disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
