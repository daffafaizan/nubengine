    
      Patients scheduled for osseous surgery of their foot or ankle with general anaesthesia and
      popliteal+saphenous nerve blocks will be randomised to dexamethasone (12 mg) versus
      dexamethasone (12mg) + dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg) versus placebo in order to assess the
      beneficial and harmful effects of combining dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to
      peripheral nerve blocks. Patients will be centrally allocated according to a
      computer-generated random allocation sequence with random, permuted blocks. The trial
      medication will be prepared by an un-masked nurse not otherwise involved in the trial.
      Participants, personnel, care givers, investigators, outcome assessors, and data analysts
      will be masked to treatment allocation.
