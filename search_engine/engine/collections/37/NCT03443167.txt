      impact topic in public health: with an appropriate training anyone can save life (Böttiger,
      2015). Primary school students are willing to learn CPR and they are also Carriers of
      knowledge among their surroundings like family or friends (Martínez, 2015).

      The authors propose a clinical trial to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and skills in
      primary education students of various schools, before and after a CPR formation.

      The schools will be previously randomized in intervention group and control group. Once the
      intervention has been completed and the results obtained, training equal to the intervention
      will be offered to the control schools. In the bibliographic search no validated
      questionnaires in CPR learning among primary education students has been found.
