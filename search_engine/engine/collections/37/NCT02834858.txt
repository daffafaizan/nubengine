      still lacking effective treatments.

      Stem cell therapy has been a new and effective therapy in recent years for diabetic foot.
      Combined with the previous studies of the investigators research group, this study intends to
      transform part of the results of this research, establish an optimal clinical research
      program, and attempts to break the technical bottleneck in the stem cell therapy for treating
      diabetes related vascular complications.
