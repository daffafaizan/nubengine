      genome sequencing into clinical care at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Healthcare providers
      may refer any patients who they think might benefit from diagnostic whole genome or exome
      sequencing. Providers will briefly discuss genome sequencing and the pilot study with
      potentially eligible patients. If a patient is interested, the provider will refer him/her to
      the study by contacting the study staff and providing the reason (clinical question) why the
      provider thinks genome sequencing might be beneficial for the patient. The study staff will
      meet with the patient to conduct a baseline interview and survey, obtain informed consent for
      sequencing, and obtain a blood specimen for sequencing. A clinical laboratory will perform
      exome or whole-genome sequencing and issue an interpreted genome report including any variant
      possibly explaining the patient's condition, in addition to secondary monogenic, carrier, and
      pharmacogenomic results. This report will be sent to the referring provider, who will
      document the results and associated decision-making in the medical record. Approximately 3
      months later, study staff will conduct a follow-up interview and survey with the
      participating patient.
