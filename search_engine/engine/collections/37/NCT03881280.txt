      family doctors or nurses at well-child care visits as overweight/obese for age.

      Participant's eligibility will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to: 1) control
      group; 2) intervention group. The control group will receive treatment as usual. Parents in
      the intervention group will be provided with the app and invited to use it for 4 weeks.
      During the 4 weeks, the administrator monitors the app usage and call once to parents to
      improve it, if needed.

      Both groups will perform a pre- and post-test, evaluating parent's perceptions and attitudes
      regarding children's weight status and food intake; eating behaviors and parental
      child-feeding practices.
