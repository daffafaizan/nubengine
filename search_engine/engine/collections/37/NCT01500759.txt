      continues to cause debilitating symptoms, frequent hospital admissions and a high mortality.
      Despite of therapy with beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors many patients have persistent
      symptoms and most will eventually die of cardiovascular causes, often from progressive heart
      failure.

      Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is known to cause consequences, which have negative effects
      on heart failure.

      Objective target of the registry is to investigate the prevalence of SDB, clinical
      characteristics, symptoms and the degree and type of SDB in patients with chronic HF.

      For this purpose data from patients with chronic heart failure will be collected
      prospectively.In the registry several cardiologists in private practice or hospital and
      cooperating sleep laboratories shall participate.

      Cardiologists screen patients with Chronic Heart Failure (chronic HF) prospectively. In case
      of suffering from chronic HF for at least 12 weeks since diagnosis, with NYHA III-IV or NYHA
      class II with at least one hospitalisation for HF in the last 12 months. Written informed
      consent for data privacy aspects must be obtained before screening for SDB. Patients who
      satisfy to all inclusion- and exclusion criteria will be included consecutively into the
      registry.
