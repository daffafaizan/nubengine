    
      Comparison of efficacy

        -  Number of patients: N=40

        -  Arms: Two equal arms (20 patients each)

        -  Inclusion criteria: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin proven with biopsy

        -  Exclusion criteria: (1) Size of the tumors >5cm; (2) Distance from the eyelid <0,5cm;
           (3)Number of tumors >5

        -  Interim analysis: When at least 10 patients are included in each arm or at the end of
           the first year of the study

      The patients will be randomized in 2 groups Group 1 (Immunocryosurgery) and Group 2
      (Cryoimmunotherapy)

      Treatment protocols:

      Group 1 (Immunocryosurgery): Patients will apply imiquimod daily for 14 days on the tumor and
      a rim of 2mm around the tumor. On day 14 a session of mild cryosurgery (2 cycles of 15
      seconds, with open spray liquid nitrogen) will be applied and the patients will continue
      application of imiquimod for another 3 weeks before being evaluated again.

      Group 2 (Cryoimmunotherapy): Patients will be submitted into cryosurgery (2 cycles of 15
      seconds, with open spray liquid nitrogen) and subsequently will apply imiquimod on the tumor
      and a rim of 2mm around the tumor for 5 weeks in total. They will be evaluated in week 2 and
      5.

      Patients from both groups will be evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after termination of
      imiquimod treatment. In case of clinical relapse, it will be confirmed by biopsy and all the
      patients will treated with immunocrysurgery.
