      associated with increased mortality risk. The Clinical Practice Guidelines suggest lowering
      elevated phosphate levels towards the normal range (level 2C suggestion). However, trial data
      demonstrating that treatments that lower serum phosphate will improve patient-centred
      outcomes are lacking.

      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that compared to a liberal serum phosphate
      concentration target of 2.0 to 2.5 mmol/L, intensive lowering of serum phosphate towards the
      normal level (≤1.50 mmol/L) with phosphate binders reduces the risk of fatal or non-fatal
      major cardiovascular events in ESKD patients receiving dialysis. The secondary objectives are
      to test the hypothesis that intensive lowering of serum phosphate towards the normal level
      with phosphate binders would improve physical health, fatigue, health-related quality of
      life, patient satisfaction, and pruritus; and be cost-effective.

      In this pragmatic, multinational, randomised controlled large simple trial, a total of 3600
      adult ESKD patients receiving dialysis will be randomised either to intensive (≤1.50 mmol/L)
      or liberalized (2.0-2.5 mmol/L) serum phosphate target. The choice and dose of phosphate
      binders will be at the treating physician's discretion and local practice to achieve and
      maintain serum phosphate concentration within the required target range according to
      randomisation. The primary endpoint is the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death,
      non-fatal major cardiovascular or peripheral arterial events. The secondary outcome measures
      will be individual components of the primary composite endpoint, all-cause death, and
      utility-based quality of life EQ5D-5L.
