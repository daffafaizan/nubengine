      troponin in patients with renal dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery. Electrical medical
      records of patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 2004 and 2015 will be assessed.
      Perioperative laboratory data including troponin and glomerular filtration rate, type of
      surgery, and outcome variables including mortality will be analysed to determine the
      prognostic value of postoperative value of postoperative troponin in patients with renal
      dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery.
