      propranolol monotherapy in angiosarcoma. The study consists of a single arm. Propranolol will
      be administred as monotherapy in a dose of 40-80 mg 2-3 times a day, if tolerated. When
      patients are diagnosed, standard anti-cancer treatment will be scheduled in 6 weeks while
      propranolol treatment can start immediately after diagnosis and will be continued until the
      day the standard anti-cancer treatment is started. The duration of treatment will therefore
      be 3-6 weeks.
