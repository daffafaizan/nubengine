      I. Assess diffusion-weighted MRI as an early predictor for tumor response in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. Establish the potential of individualized radiotherapy targeting of radioresistant tumor
      sub-volumes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo diffusion-weighted MRI within 4 weeks of radiation start (baseline), during
      the second week of radiation therapy, during the fourth week of radiation therapy, and at 3
      months after radiation therapy (post-treatment). Patients also undergo standard of care
      4-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) at the same time points.
