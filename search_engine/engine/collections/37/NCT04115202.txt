      age. It is also the leading cause of work stoppage and reported occupational illnesses. Thus,
      the degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine can be at the origin of a severe handicap
      resistant to well-conducted medical treatment. This is particularly the case for degenerative
      disc disease, osteoarthritic spondylolisthesis and scoliotic dislocations in adults.

      If lumbar arthrodesis is a recognised solution in the surgical treatment of degenerative
      diseases of the lumbar spine when they become disabling despite medical treatment, the choice
      of the operative technique and approach used to achieve it is more dependent of the training
      that the practitioner benefited from than the guidelines derived from published prospective
      comparative scientific studies comparing the results of different surgical solutions.

      Our hypothesis is that the functional and radiographic results of anterior lumbar arthrodesis
      techniques by minimally invasive approach may differ from those of conventional
      posterolateral arthrodesis.

      We propose to compare the results of these two surgical techniques within the orthopedic and
      neurosurgeon team of the Institut Parisien du Dos, mastering these two approaches optimally
      by leaving them free to use them as they do daily without modifying their procedures. This
      should allow us to judge, in a well-defined population, whether one of the two techniques is
      superior to the other when performed by surgeons who are experienced in this surgery.
