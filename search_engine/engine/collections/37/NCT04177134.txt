    
      As secondary objectives, the study aims:

        -  to estimate the frequencies of patients with SMA 5q types 1 through 4 who have being
           treated in the reference centers between September 1 2016 and August 31 2024;

        -  to describe overall demographic, familial, clinical, biological, and genetic
           characteristics of SMA 5q patients treated in all regions of France, by the type of SMA
           (type 1,2,3, and 4);

        -  to study the impact of proactive and symptomatic medical interventions (bracing, IPPB
           devices) and medications (vaccinations, anti-infectious, digestive, nutritional
           supplements) in the evolution of patients;

        -  to study the long-term evolution (survival, motor and respiratory functions, spinal
           shape, growth and nutritional function) of SMA 5q in treated and untreated populations,
           by new available therapies, throughout the register;

        -  to study mortality rate of SMA 5q in treated and untreated populations, by new available
           therapies, throughout the register;

        -  to identify and document the different therapeutic strategies by sub-populations and by
           discontinuation or follow-up of treatments;

        -  to evaluate prognostic factors of responses to therapies;

        -  to study the tolerance of treatments by type of treatments, by type of SMA and overall
           tolerance (including adverse events);

        -  to estimate the costs of care for SMA 5q patients in different groups (types, ages);

        -  to provide needful elements to evaluate the health care costs for the disease;

        -  to study the autonomy and the quality of life of patients depending on different
           therapeutic strategies;

        -  to study the impact of the disease on caregivers;

        -  to facilitate development of scientific research on SMA in the conduct of trials on new
           therapeutic strategies.
