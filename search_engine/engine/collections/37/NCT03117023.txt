      group) or sufentanil 0.05ug/kg/h + saline (control group) for 48h. The primary outcome was
      the total sleep time during the first three days after surgery. The secondary outcomes
      included pain score, daily sufentanil consumption, time to functional recovery, length of
      hospital stay and side effects.
