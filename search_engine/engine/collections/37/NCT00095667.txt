      I. To determine the antitumor activity of GW572016 in hormone na√Øve, recurrent and/or
      metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer using PSA response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective tumor response in patients with measurable disease. II. To determine
      the duration of PSA response, rate and duration of stable disease, progression-free, median
      and overall survival rates of GW572016 in recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer.

      III. To document the safety and tolerability of GW572016 in these patient populations.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate if differences in baseline levels of EGFR and/or erbB2 expression, and
      receptor phosphorylation status in tumor specimens predict outcome to therapy.

      II. To investigate if the inhibitory effects of GW572016 on EGFR and/or erbB2 pathway
      activation in tumor specimens correlates with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 11.7
      months.
