      involves excitability of the trigeminovascular system. Intercranial vasculature containing
      nociceptor innervation consists of unmyelinated (c-fibers) and thinly myelinated (a-delta
      fibers ) axons which hold vasoactive neuropeptides including substance P and (CGRP)
      calcitonin gene related peptide. When a migraine occurs, there is a cortical spreading
      depolarization, which on a molecular level involves a release of ATP, glutamate, potassium,
      hydrogen ions, glia or vascular cells, and CGRP and nitric oxide by activated perivascular
      nerves. These substances, including CGRP diffuse to come in contact with nociceptors causing
      neurogenic inflammation (vasodilation), thus propagating a headache.

      Electrical perineural dry needling causes the release of substance-P and CGRG predominantly
      from non-neural structures, facilitating a negative feedback loop to neural and neuroactive
      components of the target tissue. This causes a lowering of the levels of CGRP which in turn
      decreases the inflammatory component thought to play a role in migraine headaches.
