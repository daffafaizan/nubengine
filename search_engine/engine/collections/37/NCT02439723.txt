      orally, once daily is not well tolerated by patients, especially women. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if there is a correlation between lean body mass and regorafenib
      pharmacokinetics and if so, then it may be possible to exploit this relationship to better
      dose regorafenib.

      Additionally, Bayer has noted that regorafenib steady state levels were lower in
      gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) patients than in patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer. GIST patients have often had gastrectomies that would lead to an elevated pH in the
      intestinal tract. If regorafenib has a pH dependent solubility then lower regorafenib levels
      could be due to reduced acidity. The purpose of the second part of the study is to examine
      the regorafenib pharmacokinetic profile in patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor
      (pantoprazole) for 7 days, mimicking the altered intestinal environment seen in GIST
      patients.
