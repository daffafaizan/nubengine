      simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy measurements will be made during visual stimulation
      (e.g., viewing a flashing checkerboard). This is a methods development study focused on
      comparing a new method for estimating CMRO2 associated with brain activation with the
      standard fMRI approach for estimating CMRO2.
