      women are at higher risk of developing serious complications from infection with the virus.
      Animal model studies of SARS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID19 symptom
      severity may be due to protective and acute actions of the female sex hormone estrogen.
      Animal and human studies support immune modulating effects of estrogen that are acute acting
      in viral infections and wound repair processes that may reduce the damaging effects of the
      virus on the lung and symptom severity.

      Our hypothesis is that a short 7 day course of estradiol delivered in a transdermal patch
      applied to the upper buttock in COVID19+ or presumptive positive patients will be safe and
      will reduce symptom severity in adult men and older women when given prior to intubation.
      COVID19+ and presumptive positive patients not requiring intubation will be enrolled to the
      study and randomized to receive an estrogen patch or standard of care. Patients will be
      followed up at day 1, 7, 14 and 28 for clinical symptoms and disease outcomes.
