      cycles of mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI plus targeted drugs. Patients assessed by MDT that are potential
      to reach no evidence of disease (NED) were included in our trial. All included patients
      receive para-aortic lymph node dissection with or without other local treatment such as
      hepatectomy, pulmonary lobectomy, RFA and SBRT. Patients completed the six-month
      perioperative systemic therapy and are arranged to follow up.
