    
      1. Reproducibility and reference values in normal subjects: the investigators will propose
           a method for measurement of the maximal inspiratory flow rates (MIFR) and establish
           their reproducibility in normal subjects. The variability of these inspiratory flow
           rates will be compared with the variability of effort dependent and non-effort dependent
           expiratory flow rates.

           Also, reference equations will be drawn up and compared to the only existing set of
           reference values (2) (needing a revision).

        2. Reproducibility in disease: the investigators will evaluate the reproducibility of the
           MIFR in patients with neuromuscular diseases (Steinert muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic
           lateral sclerosis) and with upper airway obstruction (tracheal stenosis, thyroid
           enlargement) and compare to the reproducibility of expiratory flow rates in this
           population.

        3. Monitoring of diseases: In the neuromuscular patients MIFR will be correlated to the
           existing parameters used for monitoring of these diseases (respiratory muscle strength,
           forced vital capacity), with a longitudinal follow-up.

      In the patients with upper airway obstruction the MIFR (quantitative measurement) will be
      compared to the visual inspection (qualitative interpretation) of the maximal flow-volume
      loop and also the evolution after a therapeutic intervention (airway stenting, thyroidectomy)
      will be monitored.
