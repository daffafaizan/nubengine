      and glycemic excursions in patients with Type I Diabetes. In addition, sitagliptin will
      likely suppress indices of oxidative stress in patients. The study will investigate proposed
      mechanisms of improved glucose concentrations, including enhanced effect of endogenous GLP-1
      and suppression of glucagon.
