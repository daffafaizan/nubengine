      burns. The laser has been used at different times, close to injury or late after injury.
      Success or failure of the laser has been judged by subjective observer scales.

      In this study we will treat the seams of 1/2 of a skin graft with a pulsed-dyed laser,
      beginning about one month after surgery. We will use objective measures of color (redness on
      digital pictures), scar volume(via laser scanning), and elasticity(measured by BTC-2000) as
      well as subjective assessment by an independent observer and the patient.
