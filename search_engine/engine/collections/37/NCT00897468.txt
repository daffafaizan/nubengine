        -  To develop new in vivo models of human breast cancer.

        -  To correlate response in this model to actual treatment outcome in patients, if the in
           vivo model is proven feasible.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected breast tumor fragments are implanted into the renal capsule
      site of SCID mouse hosts (mouse with severe combined immune deficiency) to establish
      metastatic spread patterns, and both histologic and molecular tumor characteristics.

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed to obtain relevant information, including general
      demographics, smoking and alcohol use, as well as outcome data such as survival and response
      to treatment.
