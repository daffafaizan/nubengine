    
      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, cross-over and open study.

      Study population: 16 healthy, lean (BMI 20-25 kg.m-2) and obese (BMI 30-35 kg.m-2) male
      subjects will participate in the study, aged between 18-45 years.

      Intervention: On two different test days eight lean and eight obese men will be supplied with
      a sugar drink to examine intestinal permeability under normal conditions and in combination
      with an oral fat load to examine intestinal permeability under stressed conditions.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Intestinal permeability will be examined with an absorption
      test using four different sugars (sucrose, mannitol, sucralose and lactulose). New markers of
      intestinal permeability, like I-FABP, L-FABP, LPS and inflammatory markers will be measured
      as well.
