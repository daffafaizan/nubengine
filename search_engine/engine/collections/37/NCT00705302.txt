      increasing their self care ability. A recent updated systematic review concluded that
      evidence strongly supports respiratory rehabilitation as part of the spectrum of management
      of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies of pulmonary
      rehabilitation programs lasting up to 18 months show that effects are mainly maintained
      throughout the duration of the program. The long term effect, however, is mostly studied for
      programs of shorter durations. Some of the studies with shorter duration have found that the
      achieved benefit was lost or diminished during the follow up period, while others have found
      that the effect has been maintained up to 18 months. Our necessity in the rehabilitative
      field is to find strategies to maintain benefits during time.
