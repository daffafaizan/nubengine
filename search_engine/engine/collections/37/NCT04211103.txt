    
      This is a single arm phase II trial evaluating Pembrolizumab single agent as neoadjuvant
      treatment before surgical conization and/or partial or radical vulvectomy in patients with
      pre-neoplastic cervical and vulvar high grade lesions. Patients with histologically confirmed
      H-SIL and/or VIN 2-3 lesions will be treated with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every 3
      weeks for 5 cycles. Within 3 weeks from the last Pembrolizumab administration patients will
      be submitted to surgical conization or partial or radical vulvectomy.
