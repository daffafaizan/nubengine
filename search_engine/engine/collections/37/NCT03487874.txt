      plexus block spares the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes which innervate the
      posterior aspect of the shoulder. To visualize the shoulder joint space during shoulder
      arthroscopic surgery, the introduction of a posterior portal is essential. However,
      conventional interscalene brachial plexus block cannot effectively relieve the pain caused by
      its insertion due to sparing of the 8th cervical and 1st thoracic dermatomes. The addition of
      the 8th cervical nerve root block to conventional interscalene brachial plexus block
      decreases pain intensity upon the introduction of a posterior portal.
