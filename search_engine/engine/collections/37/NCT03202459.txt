      scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgeries at the Central Surgical Center of Irmandade da
      Santa Casa de Misericórdia in São Paulo. Inclusion criteria will be ASA I or II of either
      sex, in the age range of 18 to 70 years. In this study, the recruited patients will be
      allocated randomly into three groups. The group A will receive oral 600 mg gabapentin 2 h
      before surgery. The group B will receive oral 150 mg pregabalin 2 h before surgery. The Group
      C will receive oral placebo 2 h before surgery and ondansetron 8mg intravenous at the end of
      the surgery. This study is "double-blind", in which neither the doctor nor the patient knows
      what medicine is being given.
