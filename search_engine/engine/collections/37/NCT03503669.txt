      Alzheimer's disease risk. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET class for 60 minutes per
      week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and "Kirtan Kriya" meditation class for 60 minutes per week.
      Assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions at 6 and 12 weeks and
      follow-up visits at week 24 and 48 to monitor the overall benefit of the intervention.
