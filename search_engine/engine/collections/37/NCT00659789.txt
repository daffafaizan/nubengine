      the infection, making it a life-long treatment that requires sustained patient compliance and
      imposes significant individual and societal financial burdens on healthcare services.
      Furthermore,ART side effects often require medication that increases the inconveniences and
      financial burdens of HIV management. Of further concern is the emergence of viruses resistant
      to ART that can result in treatment failure.

      ART-free periods could provide substantial benefit. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV
      immunotherapy that is proposed for prolongation of ART-free periods. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether Vacc-4x immunotherapy can give safe ART-free period.
