        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of raloxifene in premenopausal women at high risk
           of developing invasive breast cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of raloxifene on blood steroid hormone levels (luteinizing hormone,
           estradiol, progesterone) and carotenoid levels during the menstrual cycle in these
           participants.

        -  Determine the effect of raloxifene on the endometrium and ovaries in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of raloxifene on biochemical markers of bone metabolism, lipid
           profiles, and fibrinogen in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of raloxifene on health-related quality of life of these
           participants.

        -  Determine the effect of raloxifene on bone mineral density in the spine and hip of these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Participants are medically evaluated, followed by an observation period of 1 to 2 menstrual
      cycles. After the observation period, participants receive oral raloxifene once daily for 2
      years.

      Quality of life is assessed 1 week prior to study drug administration and at 6, 12, 24 and 36
      months after study drug administration.

      Participants are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 participants will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
