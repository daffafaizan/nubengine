      weeks and 6 days GA.

      The effects on newborns will be assessed at physiological (primary outcome), neurobehavioral,
      and developmental levels during the intervention, at term equivalent age, and at 12- and
      24-months CA. The effect of EVC will also be assessed on maternal stress at hospital
      discharge and on the mother's presence in the NICU.

      Design A four-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the short-
      and long-term physiological and neurobehavioral effects of EVC.

      Participants Eighty preterm infants, born at 25 to 32 weeks and 6 days GA, will be recruited
      from the four centres (20 per centre).

      Recruitment will be undertaken in each centre by a trained research assistant (RA), who will
      review birth records daily. After obtaining permission from the attending physicians of both
      the mother and the infant, the RA will invite qualifying families to participate in the study
      and will obtain written informed consent from those enrolling. Infants will be then assigned
      to the EVC intervention or control group using a randomized design, stratifying infants by
      gender and GA (see Randomization). Mothers whose infants are assigned to the control group
      will be asked to spend the same amount of time as that of mothers in the intervention group,
      observing their infants' spontaneous behaviour, with the subsequent compilation of an
      observation grid developed ad hoc, according to few indicators drawn from The Neonatal
      Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS).
