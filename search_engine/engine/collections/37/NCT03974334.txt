      improvement of the Our Whole Lives for Hypertension (OWL-H) online patient education
      platform, based upon participant use and focus group feedback, to deliver information on
      self-management of hypertension and other cardiac risk factors, and to encourage
      self-monitoring of blood pressure. We piloted online OWL-H platform for 8 weeks with 26
      patients with hypertension to refine its utility for home self-monitoring. We also held a
      focus group to obtain information about: 1) the barriers and facilitators of using the OWL-H
      platform and using OWL-H to self-monitor blood pressure at home, 2) satisfaction with OWL-H,
      3) how OWL-H helped with reduction of number of cardiac risk factors
