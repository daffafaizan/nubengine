      considered such as standard these days. Children may develope a paradoxical reaction to
      benzodiazepines which is one of the adverse effect.

      The paradoxical reaction is an abnormal stimulative reaction to benzodiazepines characterized
      by hallucination, disorientation, alteration in perception and recognition as well as the
      escalation of negative emotion- uncalming crying, agitation, restlessness, and hostility.
      Risk factors for the development of the paradoxical reaction are young age, mental illness,
      genetic disposition, male sex, alcohol abuse, and higher midazolam doses.

      The incidence of paradoxical reaction is referred to be about 1-10%, in some specific groups
      even more (about 29%). The exact incidence is still not known since the accurate definition
      of paradoxical reaction is still missing.

      Primary Goal of the study is find out the incidence of the paradoxical reaction in pediatric
      patients premedicated with oral midazolam prior to general anesthesia and incidence of the
      paradoxical reactions in children of different age groups (3 months-1 year, 1 year-3 years, 3
      years-6 years, 6 years-12 years, 12 years-18 years) . The calculated file size is 500
      patients. All eligible patients should be evaluated for pre-treatment, pre-anesthesia,
      immediately prior to anesthesia and anesthesia when RASS above -2. For purpose of the study
      we have determined the definition of paradoxical reaction as an increase in pulse and/or
      blood pressure of 20% over pre-premedication , RASS increase by one point or more and raising
      PEAD to 10 or more points. The paradoxical reaction criteria are met if at least two points
      of the definition are met. Change within 45min. after premedication.
