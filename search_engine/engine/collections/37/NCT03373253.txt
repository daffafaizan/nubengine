      in Europe which will further substantiate the understanding of TRD in European clinical
      practice, with the aim of improving guidance and informing the development of better
      treatment strategies for this medically important condition. All data recorded in the case
      report form (CRF) should be documented in participants' medical records, that will be the
      primary data source of each participant. Participants who meet the diagnostic criteria for
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and the diagnostic criteria for TRD, and are initiating or
      planned to initiate a new antidepressive treatment regimen will participate in the study. The
      end of the entire study will be 6 months after enrollment of the last participant in the
      study.
