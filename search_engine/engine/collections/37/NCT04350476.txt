      monitoring in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the outpatient setting. This
      study will enroll COVID-19 positive patients previously evaluated at Mount Sinai
      Hospital/Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and affiliated hospitals deemed appropriate for
      home monitoring. Patients will be monitored remotely in the outpatient setting for 1-3 weeks
      following diagnosis and/or treatment for COVID-19 at MSH/MSHS.
