    
      This is a prospective, random assignment, double blind, parallel group study with an adaptive
      design comparing the efficacy of tDCS performed during the course of ECT to that of sham tDCS
      in patients with a major depressive episode being treated with ECT. The investigators intend
      to recruit patients who are scheduled to receive an acute course of ECT. Patients who are
      able and willing to provide written informed consent, and who meet study criteria when
      screened, will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive a course of real tDCS or sham
      tDCS. Subjects will receive a standard acute course of bifrontal ECT (3X/week) and depressive
      symptomatology will be monitored with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24)
      before each treatment.

      The primary outcome will be change in cognition from baseline to end of study. The
      investigators will monitor cognitive changes before and after each ECT treatment, at the end
      of the treatment course and two months after the last treatment.

      Secondary outcome will be the number of treatments needed to achieve remission. Remission is
      defined as two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores <= 10, and HRSD
      total score does not change > 3 points or remains < 6 at the last two consecutive treatments.
      In addition, the investigators will collect data on other treatment parameters such as
      seizure duration, electroencephalogram (EEG) morphology as well as hemodynamic changes.
