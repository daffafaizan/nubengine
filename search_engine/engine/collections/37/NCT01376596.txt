      obstacle to positive functional outcomes. Social anxiety is a treatable condition but has, in
      the context of psychosis, received only scant attention thus far. Current existing manualized
      treatment for social anxiety may not be optimal for people with schizophrenia for a number of
      reasons described above. An adapted CBT intervention for schizophrenia must target the stigma
      attached to the illness, the presence of poor social skills, the presence of delusional and
      persecutory ideas, possible limited reading abilities, and associated cognitive deficits. The
      investigators propose to develop and test an adapted group CBT for social anxiety. The main
      objective of this research proposal is to contrast the impact of a CBT intervention for the
      treatment of social anxiety in schizophrenia with standard care (care as usual) on reducing
      symptoms of social anxiety. Considering the relationship between certain characteristics of
      social anxiety (e.g. social withdrawal) with diminished quality of life and poor functional
      outcome, a secondary objective is to examine the impact of reduced social anxiety on
      functional outcome.
