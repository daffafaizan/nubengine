      a quasi-experimental pre-post trial with a non-equivalent parallel control group. The
      intervention began in January 2008 and lasted through June 2011 and was implemented
      school-wide. As out primary interest is to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in
      schools, the essential comparisons were across grade five students in differing calendar
      years. At each survey all grade five students were invited to participate. The current design
      allowed intervention effects to be assessed over time at the school-level. Surveys were
      administered in the spring of 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 in intervention schools. And in the
      spring of 2008 and 2011 in control schools.
