      technique) and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study (given below) will be
      randomized on day of surgery after obtaining informed consent to either ultrasound-guided or
      standard spinal anesthesia technique.

      A block randomization scheme with random block sizes ranging from 2-8 patients will be used.
      The outcomes will be recorded by a third party observer in the block room/operating room who
      might be a nurse or resident or clinical research fellow not directly involved with
      performing the block. The post procedure outcomes will also be recorded by a clinical
      research fellow or resident who was not directly involved with performing the block.

      No sample size estimation methodology currently exists for the right-censored count data
      models. We expect less number of attempts in the ultrasound group a 20 % difference between
      the two groups which we feel is a minimum of a clinically-relevant effect. At the 0.05 level
      of significance with a power of 0.8, we will require a minimum of 20 patients per
      group,therefore we plan to recruit 40 patients in total.

      The analysis will be conducted by a statistician who will be blinded.
