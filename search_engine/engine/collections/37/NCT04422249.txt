      which can be divided into anatomic hepatectomy and non-anatomic hepatectomy.Among them,
      anatomic hepatectomy is suitable for primary liver cancer, hepatolithiasis and other benign
      and malignant diseases;It can be divided into hepatic venous guidance and non-hepatic venous
      guidance hepatectomy (traditional ananatomical hepatectomy).The aim of this study was to
      observe and compare the perioperative period and follow-up results of the two different
      laparoscopic surgical resection methods, and to provide high-level evidence-based medicine
      evidence for the selection of surgical methods for laparoscopic anatomical hemihepatectomy.
