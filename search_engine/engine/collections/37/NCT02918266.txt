      a single oral dose of TAK-071, a novel muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 positive
      allosteric modulator, on scopolamine-induced deficits in cognitive function in healthy adult
      male participants. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 is a substudy to explore PK
      profile of TAK-071 in the presence of light meal and coadministration of scopolamine to
      determine TAK-071 dose for the next part; Part 2 is the main the study to assess the effects
      of TAK-071 on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment. The study will enroll approximately 6
      participants in Part 1 and 40 participants in Part 2. Participant will be assigned to
      received TAK-071 along with scopolamine in Part 1 and will be randomly assigned to one of the
      ten treatment sequences in Part 2-which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

      Part 2: Treatment Sequence ABDEC Part 2: Treatment Sequence BCEAD Part 2: Treatment Sequence
      CDABE Part 2: Treatment Sequence DEBCA Part 2: Treatment Sequence EACDB Part 2: Treatment
      Sequence ACBED Part 2: Treatment Sequence BDCAE Part 2: Treatment Sequence CEDBA Part 2:
      Treatment Sequence DAECB Part 2: Treatment Sequence EBADC Where A=scopolamine matching
      placebo SC + TAK-071 matching placebo oral (PO) + donepezil matching placebo PO;
      B=scopolamine 0.5 mg SC + TAK-071 matching placebo PO + donepezil matching placebo PO;
      C=scopolamine 0.5 mg SC + TAK-071 PO + donepezil matching placebo PO; D=scopolamine 0.5 mg SC
      + TAK-071 PO + donepezil 10 mg PO; and E=scopolamine 0.5 mg SC + TAK-071 matching placebo PO
      + donepezil 10 mg PO.

      The dose of TAK-071 that was well-tolerated in the TAK-071-1001 study (NCT02769065) will be
      selected, based on the safety and tolerability data from the single-rising dose (SRD) study
      for administration in Part 1. Each participant will also receive scopolamine 0.5 mg,
      injection, SC, once at the time of Screening. This single center trial will be conducted in
      the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5.7 weeks
      in Part 1 and 21 weeks in Part 2. Participants will remain confined to the clinic for 4 days
      during Part 1 and 3 days during the each intervention period in Part 2. Participants will be
      contacted by telephone on Day 12 in Part 1 and Day 9 of Period 5 in Part 2 for a follow-up
      assessment.
