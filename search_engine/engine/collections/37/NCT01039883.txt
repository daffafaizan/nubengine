    
      The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of the formulation used in earlier
      clinical studies (albaconazole capsules) with the formulation intended for use in further
      development (albaconazole tablets). The study is also designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of a single oral dose of albaconazole tablets (400 mg), and assess the
      bioequivalence of albaconazole tablets with albaconazole capsules.
