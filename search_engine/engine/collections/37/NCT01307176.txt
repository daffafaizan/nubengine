      medications systematically improve cerebellar ataxia, and little is known about the
      effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises, which are often the only treatment option. Here,
      we ask whether a person's ability to adapt (i.e. short term motor learning) predicts their
      ability to benefit from physical therapy exercises. This pilot-clinical trial will test a
      subject's ability to adaptively learn a new walking pattern in a single session, and then any
      improvement of walking and balance over a 13 week time period during which they participate
      in a specialized home exercise training program. Our prediction is that those individuals
      with some preserved adaptive learning ability will be the best rehabilitation candidates.
