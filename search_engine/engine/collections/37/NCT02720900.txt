      developing children. it has been postulated that imbalances in the gut bacteria and/or
      metabolites present in the gut may be a contributing factor to these symptoms, with
      potentially bad (toxin-producing) bacteria colonising the gut. Certain carbohydrates
      (so-called 'prebiotics') are not digested by the human gut and they provide food for
      beneficial bacteria and thus they improve the composition by preventing the growth of bad
      bacteria. Individuals could therefore benefit from these safe and effective dietary
      interventions to maintain the healthy gut bacteria and overall health. This study is being
      carried out to establish the effect of one such prebiotic, called galactooligosaccharide
      (B-GOS) on the relative balance of gut bacteria and metabolites in children with ASD. The aim
      is to enrol 42 children, ages 5-10 with formal ASD diagnosis and with signed informed consent
      from their parents, into double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel study. The trial will
      last 10 weeks in total (2 weeks run in period, 6 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow up).
      Children will be required to take food supplement daily during the treatment period and their
      parents will collect stool, saliva and urine samples. Various questionnaires will also be
      used for assessments. Children will not be required to make other extra changes to their
      diet, medication or lifestyle.
