      and streamlined lifestyle program in volunteer community settings and to provide pilot data
      to inform the design of future randomized controlled trials that may improve physical and
      mental health in older adults. The current objective is to:

        1. Adapt and pilot the previously studied 32-session, 13-month MOVE UP intervention to a
           streamlined 12-session (4-month) community-based translational behavioral weight
           management program. The pilot program will be delivered by trained Community Health
           Workers (CHWs).

        2. Implement and evaluate the program's impact on weight and healthy lifestyle changes,
           including physical performance outcomes, at 2 sites, each with at least 6 eligible obese
           adults ages 60-75 years old.
