      have resulted in a growing cohort of survivors, these survivors are at risk for a number of
      long-term health problems. This study proposes to develop and conduct feasibility testing for
      a smartphone application that would deliver a health behavior intervention to this
      population.

      A formative phase focused on intervention and software development will be followed by a
      pilot/feasibility test of the intervention. Participants in the intervention will receive a
      customized study-designed mobile phone app with a social networking component in which users
      will be able to support one another. They will also receive personal support from a health
      counselor to help set goals and discuss areas of concern.
