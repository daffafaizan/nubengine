      in human gut microbiota, 'dysbiosis', has been linked to several diseases. Manipulation of
      the microbiome, using specific strains of live micro-organisms, that confer a health benefit
      on the host (probiotics), have therefore become an exploratory treatment option in
      microbiome-associated diseases in recent years. Numerous studies have shown selected strains
      of bacteria to show statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in
      symptoms, in a number of diseases, including but not limited to infantile colic and atopic
      dermatitis.

      Bio-Kult Advanced (BKA) is a 14 strain live bacteria supplement containing a Minimum 2
      billion live microorganisms per capsule (2x109 CFU/capsule), equivalent to 10 billion live
      microorganisms per gram (1x1010 CFU/gram). A randomised controlled trial of Bio-Kult Advanced
      in the management of diarrhoea predominant IBS demonstrated significant improvement in
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and was well tolerated by participants. Another randomised
      controlled trial of Bio-Kult Advanced, in participants with episodic and chronic migraine
      sufferers, demonstrated significant improvement in frequency and severity of migraines
      compared to placebo. This clinical effectiveness across various conditions, suggest that
      bacterial strains in Bio-Kult could have an effect on the gastrointestinal flora, however
      data has yet to be collected that explores the effect of Bio-Kult on the microbiome. The aim
      of this study is to therefore investigate the effect of Bio-Kult Advanced, on the composition
      of the gut microbiota in healthy adults.
