      symptoms, cognitive deficits and intolerable side effects. Refractory schizophrenia is still
      a difficult clinical issue at present. According to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      hypothesis, many clinical trials on NMDA-enhancing agents were studied. Adjuvant
      NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids such as D-serine, and sarcosine (a
      glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive and
      negative symptoms.

      The aim of this project is to examine the effectiveness and safety of DAAOI-2 add-on
      treatment for treatment resistant schizophrenia patients in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo - controlled trial.
