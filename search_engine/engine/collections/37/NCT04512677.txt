      failure. The ventilatory weaning process should be started when the precipitating causes of
      the use of the ventilatory prosthesis are resolved. Inappropriately slow weaning exposes the
      patient to unnecessary discomfort, increases the risk of complications and increases the cost
      of hospital treatment. In this sense, indices that can predict successful weaning are of
      great value. Our study aimed to evaluate the performance of a new ventilatory weaning index,
      the timed inspiratory effort index (TIE index), as a weaning predictor in comparison with the
      traditionally used spontaneous breathing test (SBT). The study is a randomized controlled
      trial of a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients over 24 hours admitted to the ICU of
      Hospital e Clínica São Gonçalo (HCSG), located in the city of São Gonçalo, State of Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil. The TIE index is calculated as the ratio of the maximum inspiratory pressure
      developed in the last 30 seconds of a 60 second period of unidirectional airway occlusion by
      the time required to reach this value.
