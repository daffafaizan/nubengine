    
      This is post-market clinical follow-up study on 25 consecutive patients in two centers to
      evaluate the safety of a guide wire conditional for use in magnetic resonance imaging and the
      acceptability of identified risks in the clinical evaluation and to detect emerging risks on
      the basis of factorial evidence.

      The guidewire is used to access the patients central circulatory system and in particular for
      the introduction and exact placement of a pressure catheter to measure the pressure gradient
      over the aortic arch. The procedure will be done in patients with a clinical indication for
      cardiac magnetic resonance and conventional catheterisation.Patients need to have a body
      weight over 40 kg and the introduction of a 5 French catheter should be possible. The primary
      endpoint is the measurement of procedural success, defined as successful insertion,
      steerability and visibility in MRI, in the absence of device related adverse events such as
      damage to vessel wall. In addition structural integrity of the instruments is to be assessed.
