      and liver steatosis were shown by several meta-analyses for the total variety, as described
      above. Some probiotic species/strains, however, seem to be more efficacious. The lactobacilli
      used in this trial were selected for their anti-inflammatory properties and based on
      induction of defensins in enterocytes. Therefore, one may expect more pronounced effects of
      these strains on traits of the metabolic syndrome, which is driven by low grade inflammation,
      than those found in the meta-analyses for the whole variety of probiotics without
      discriminating species and strain specificity.

      The combination of these Lactobacillus strains with acacia gum is expected to enable even
      more pronounce effects, since acacia gum was shown to increase the number of lactobacilli in
      the gut and, hence, are supposed to promote their propagation and, hence their effects. The
      dosage of 10 g/day acacia gum was demonstrated to be sufficient for enhancing fecal
      lactobacilli and bifidobacterial.
