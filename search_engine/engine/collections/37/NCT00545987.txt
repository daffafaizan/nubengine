      (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). The number of new cases continues to rise at an
      alarming rate. Other infectious diseases, such as smallpox or poliomyelitis, have been
      controlled, or even eliminated, by vaccination programs. Many experts believe that an HIV
      vaccine offers the best hope for controlling the epidemic.

      Many different possible HIV vaccines are currently being developed and tested.

      The ADVAX vaccine which you will receive is one vaccine that has been tested. To date, one to
      three doses of the ADVAX vaccine have been given to 45 individuals in a study that took place
      between December 2003 and October 2005 at the Rockefeller University and the University of
      Rochester and it appears to be safe. The difference between this ADVAX study and the previous
      one is that you will only receive two doses of the vaccine or placebo by either standard
      intramuscular injection or by "electroporation."

      This study is part of a broader research effort to see if changes in the way vaccines are
      given can make vaccines more effective.

      The results of other studies suggest that using regular needles may not be the most potent
      way to inject this type of vaccine. This is why we are studying a new method of injection
      called electroporation.

      Electroporation uses a device that injects substances into muscle along with small amounts of
      electricity. This device has been used to a limited extent in human subjects and has been
      shown to be more effective than regular needles and safe when tested in animals. Devices
      similar to this have been used in many studies to deliver chemotherapy directly into
      patients' tumors.
