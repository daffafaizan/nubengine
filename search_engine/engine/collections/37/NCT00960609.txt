      rationale from the need of reducing the risk of incomplete blood outflow in the medial
      portion of the hemiliver without the middle hepatic vein (MHV) in living donor liver
      transplantation (LDLT). However, only 24% of patients seems having CVs based on the findings
      of color-Doppler intraoperative ultrasound (CD-IOUS) exploration. On the other hand the
      safety of parenchymal sparing procedure despite HV resection let suppose that CVs are
      probably more frequent than expected.

      Certainly, better in vivo knowledge of the rate of CVs and their direct detection would
      consolidate and probably further expand parenchymal sparing techniques. Taking profit from
      new advancements in ultrasound technology we have carried out the present study with the aim
      of better estimating the rate of CVs in a consecutive series of patients in whom resection of
      one HV at caval confluence was needed.
