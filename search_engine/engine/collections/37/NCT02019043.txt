      HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) attending 4 hospital-based HIV clinics in
      Toronto and Ottawa will be conducted. The objectives are to determine to what degree the
      intervention: (1) increases the detection rate of untreated syphilis; (2) increases the
      proportion of men who undergo syphilis testing at least annually (increased screening
      coverage); (3) reduces the interval between syphilis tests (increased screening frequency);
      and (4) reaches men at highest risk according to sexual behaviours. The main hypotheses are
      that the intervention will increase screening coverage to a minimum of 85% of men undergoing
      syphilis testing annually, increase screening frequency to a median of 3 tests per person per
      year, and increase the case detection rate by 75% or more.

      The design of this study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with stepped wedge design
      that will gradually introduce the intervention across clinics. This pragmatic approach
      incorporates a concurrent comparison group, allows for assessment of time trends, will be
      well-powered, and will generate more generalizable results due to its inclusion of multiple
      clinics. The intervention will be operationalized as standing orders for syphilis serology
      when there is an order for HIV viral load and/or CD4 cell count. Data sources include (1)
      syphilis tests submitted to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory; (2) a standardized clinical
      worksheet and medical chart review to validate diagnoses for screen test positives; and (3)
      data collected from a subset of patients via their participation in the ongoing Ontario HIV
      Treatment Network (OHTN) Cohort Study. The latter follows adults in HIV care and collects
      data using chart reviews and annual face-to-face interviews including measures of sexual
      behaviour.
