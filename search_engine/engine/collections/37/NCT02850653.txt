    
      The main goal of this prospective multi-centre trial is to improve the sensitivity and
      rapidity of the infectious agent's identification involved in endophthalmitis cases,
      particularly virulent species (like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae...) from
      ocular samples with the help of real-time PCR.

      This will help the ophthalmologist to be more efficient in accordance with the kind of the
      bacteria.

      Data will also enable to compare both PCR techniques used in this study. The secondary goal
      of the prospective study is to characterize the resistance of bacterial's species found
      during acute endophthalmitis with the antibiogram and by the study of resistance genes, to
      enable to correlate the resistance in vitro with the therapeutic response in vivo and get
      precious epidemiological data to adapt prophylactic antibiotic.
