      is evidence for a plausible mechanism and efficacy for UTI prevention in healthy
      premenopausal women. Limited clinical studies of cranberry products in elderly men and women
      have demonstrated reductions in bacteriuria but have not been of adequate size or quality to
      support the use of cranberry in this population or result in changes in patient care. Thus, a
      properly designed, definitive study demonstrating efficacy of cranberry in preventing UTI in
      this population is needed. However, before a large-scale, placebo-controlled trial can be
      justified, the complexities inherent to studying older nursing home residents need to be
      addressed. These include issues related to collecting uncontaminated urine samples,
      understanding the microbiology of UTI in this population, and devising an acceptable
      intervention regimen. The overall goal of this proposal is to conduct a prospective cohort
      pilot study that evaluates the feasibility of using cranberry to prevent UTI in nursing home
      residents. Each of the aims listed below is critical for the optimal design of a larger
      placebo-controlled, definitive trial of cranberry for prevention of UTI in nursing home
      residents and will provide the essential preliminary data for a future RO1 level grant
      application.
