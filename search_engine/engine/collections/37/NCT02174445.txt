    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomised phase 3b clinical trial of Imatinib 400 to 800
      mg daily versus Nilotinib 300 mg two times daily in chronic phase CML patients with confirmed
      MMR without MR4.5 (after having received Imatinib 400 to 800 mg daily for at least 18 months)
      to determine the proportion of patients with confirmed MR4 after two years. Patients in
      treatment arm A (Imatinib) who do not achieve confirmed MR4 2 years after randomisation will
      be offered cross-over from Imatinib 400 to 800 mg daily to Nilotinib 300 mg twice daily. One
      hundred thirty-two (132) patients will be included and randomised 1:1 to each treatment arm.

      The study will be stratified by duration of Imatinib treatment before screen-ing (â‰¤36 months
      / >36 months) as well as by the level of response at inclusion (MMR / MR4).
