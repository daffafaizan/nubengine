      diabetes and other chronic disease risks. Current trends among youth suggest that disparities
      in obesity between minorities and non-Hispanic whites will amplify. Reducing such health
      disparities is a priority for federal, state and local governmental bodies and communities.
      Attaining these objectives will require interventions that are culturally- and linguistically
      appropriate. U.S. healthcare providers, however, have few culturally-appropriate tools and
      inadequate numbers of bilingual, trained healthcare professionals to address these
      challenges.

      A culturally-appropriate weight-management portal, supported by bilingual Latina dietitians
      available for remote email counseling, offers an attractive mechanism for efficiently serving
      the underserved. MiDieta/MyDiet is the leading online diet, fitness and weight management
      portal for U.S. Hispanic/Latinos. MiDieta is bilingual (Spanish/English), based on Latino
      foods & habits and already available through dozens of media, hospital, and health plan
      websites. Thousands of Hispanics access MiDieta each week. Tommy Thompson recently selected
      MiDieta as one of the "20 most innovative health promotion and disease prevention
      applications" in the U.S.
