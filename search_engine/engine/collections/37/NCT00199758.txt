    
      Patients with stage IV NSCLC and measurable disease are included in a randomized phase II
      trial comparing for patients with stable disease after 2 cycles of a platin (P)-gemcitabine
      doublet (P d1: 75 mg/m2, gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 d1, d8 every three weeks) two subsequent
      cycles of this doublet (arm A) to a switch to another doublet (arm B) : paclitaxel 100 mg/m2
      d1, d8, d15, gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 d1, d8, every four weeks.Platin, gemcitabine and
      paclitaxel are administered according nadir and pre-cycle haematologic evaluations (with dose
      decrease if needed). Response criteria are assessed with RECIST classification by the
      investigator panel.
