      years, but the mortality rate has declined only slightly. Part of this increased incidence
      could be attributable to overdiagnosis. We aimed to estimate the contribution of
      overdiagnosis to the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer.

      Material and methods. - We included all subjects living in the Marne or Ardennes Departments
      of France and who were diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2014. We
      recorded socio-demographic variables, i.e. age at diagnosis and sex. Cancer characteristics
      were also recorded, namely year of diagnosis, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
      10th revision code associated with the papillary cancer, and the pTNM 2002 status. Incidence
      rates were calculated based on data from the specialised Marnes-Ardennes thyroid cancer
      registry, for cancers diagnosed between 1975 and 2014, by age category and by five-year
      period. The population was divided into two groups according to pTNM classification at
      diagnosis (i.e. localised or invasive). Overdiagnosis was defined as the difference in
      incidence rates between the invasive cancer and localised cancer groups. This rate was then
      divided by the incidence rate in the localised cancer group for the most recent period
      (2010-2014) to obtain the proportion of cancers attributable to overdiagnosis.
