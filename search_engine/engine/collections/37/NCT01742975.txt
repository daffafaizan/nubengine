    
      Breast cancer patients will be selected at their preoperative visit with the surgeon, who
      will inform them about the study and answer their questions.

      Patients who consent to participate will be randomized to one of two arms:

        1. Arm A: Applying Ifabond

        2. Arm B: Without Ifabond

      Patients will be stratified according to these two criteria:

        1. Axillary Lymph Node Dissection planned (ALND)

        2. Body Mass Index (BMI)

      The following parameters will be measured:

        -  ECOG status and Blood Pressure at day 3(day 7 in case of ALND), day 15 and day 30 post
           surgery

        -  Volume of drainage at day 3 and at (day 7 in case of ALND)post surgery

        -  Discomfort alleged by the patient at day 3(day 7 in case of ALND), day 15 and day 30
           post surgery

        -  Lymphocele volume measured by ultrasound at day 15 and day 30 post surgery

        -  If the volume is â‰¥ 100cc, a needle aspiration will be performed, and the volume of
           aspirate will be documented.

        -  Adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected throughout the study until
           30 days after the last ultrasound.
