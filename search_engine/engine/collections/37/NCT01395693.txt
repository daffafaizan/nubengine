      well as being a significant indirect cause of morbidity and mortality impacting greatly upon
      health and quality of life when left untreated. Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy is an
      effective and proven form of medical treatment for many types of SDB.

      In order for PAP therapy to be effective, patient interfaces(masks) need to be both effective
      in their delivery of this treatment and accepted by prospective and current patients for use.
      This study will investigate the ability of the Salt Lake mask system to act effectively as a
      patient interface in PAP therapy, and its ability to be accepted by patients.
