      that cod liver oil may prevent Covid-19 and complications of Covid-19. In the present study,
      the investigators will examine whether this is actually the case by randomizing volunteers to
      take cod liver oil or placebo (corn oil) during the winter months of 2020-2021. The
      investigators also aim to explore whether cod liver oil can prevent other respiratory tract
      infections, as well as explore and confirm already known health effects and possible new
      health effects, in particular rare adverse events associated with cod liver oil use.

      Cod liver oil is a traditional source of vitamin A, D, and E and omega-3 fatty acids and the
      dose administered in the study will contain 250 ug vitamin A, 10 ug vitamin D, 10 mg vitamin
      E, and 1,2 g omega-3 fatty acids.
