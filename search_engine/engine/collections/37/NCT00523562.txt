    
      The study is aimed at assessing the effects of changes in total energy, sugars, lipids, and
      protein intake on intrahepatic lipids, plasma lipids, and hepatic and whole body insulin
      resistance in

        -  lean men and women with no family history of diabetes

        -  overweight men and women

        -  lean men with a family history of type 2 diabetes

      Subjects are studied after a 6-day period of

        -  isocaloric diet with 100% calorie requirement, of which 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein,
           and 30% fat)

        -  the same isocaloric diet supplemented with 3g/kg body weight/day fructose

        -  hypercaloric high fat diet with 130% energy requirement, of which 55% carbohydrate, 15%
           protein, 60% fat

        -  hypercaloric high fat+protein diet with 145% energy requirement, of which 55%
           carbohydrate, 30% protein, 60% fat

      Measurements performed after 6 days on each diet include

        -  intrahepatic and intramyocellular lipids (1H-MRS)

        -  hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp)

        -  body weight

        -  plasma concentrations of hormones and substrates

        -  gene expression profile in skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) and adipose tissue
           (subcutaneous abdominal)
