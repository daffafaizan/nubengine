      I. To evaluate the response rate to PS-341 (bortezomib) induction in patients with high risk,
      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival. II. To explore the response rate of patients who
      relapse or progress on maintenance and then return to induction schedule.

      III. To explore duration of second response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore a possible differential response to PS-341 with previously described adverse
      prognostic indicators.

      II. To explore specific gene expression profiles (GEP) that may predict response to therapy
      to an agent or combination of agents used in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma.

      III. To explore specific post-treatment gene expression profiles (GEP) in the patients who
      have received 4 cycles of therapy and achieved a minimal response or better.

      IV. To develop relevant information about the immune system for multiple myeloma patients
      treated with PS-341.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION TREATMENT: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE TREATMENT: Patients who complete induction treatment without progressive disease
      receive bortezomib IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REINDUCTION TREATMENT: Patients who progress while on maintenance treatment receive
      bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
