      adolescents mental health service (CAMHS) need to move on, or "transition", to an adult
      mental health service (AMHS), if they still require care or treatment. We know from other
      research that this transition is not always properly managed and that improving the
      transition process can have a positive impact on the health and well-being of young people in
      this position. We want to evaluate what impact the different transition experiences have on
      young people's health and well-being, and whether the process of Managed Transition has any
      benefits as compared to usual care.

      The MILESTONE study is run in eight European countries (UK, Ireland, Belgium, Holland,
      France, Germany, Italy and Croatia). CAMHS in the study regions are selected to provide the
      young people in their care that are reaching transition age either usual care or a novel
      service called "Managed Transition", which includes the use of a new decision support tool,
      the Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure (TRAM). This should help with decision
      making and enable better transitions by identifying cases for whom transition from CAMHS to
      AMHS is advisable and appropriate, or who can be safely discharged or referred to a community
      based service. CAMHS are randomly assigned to provide the intervention of Managed Transition
      or usual care. The health and well-being of the young people attending these services is
      assessed at the start of the study and then followed-up for 24 months to see whether they
      transition to AMHS or are discharged or referred to some other service.
