      to the optic nerve head and progressive visual field defect, which is not necessarily only
      related to an increase in intraocular pressure. It has been suggested that ocular blood flow
      alterations in glaucoma are related to systemic vascular dysregulations.The hand-grip test
      has been suggested as a potential tool to unravel vascular dysregulation in the ocular
      circulation. Although applied routinely in clinical practice, a proper study testing the
      effectiveness of this test is lacking. The present study is designed to compare the response
      of choroidal blood flow to the hand-grip test in glaucoma patients with and without visual
      field progression.
