      randomize to the following three arms of intervention: Arm 1: nne capsule of isotretinoin 10
      mg plus one capsule of placebo, per day during 12 weeks; Arm 2: one capsule of isotretinoin
      20 mg plus one capsule of placebo, per day during 12 weeks; and Arm 3: one capsule of
      isotretinoin 10 mg plus one capsule of isotretinoin 20 mg, per day during 12 weeks. The
      primary endpoints will be the proportion of participants with total remission of facial flat
      warts at the end of the intervention in the three arms of the clinical trial; and the
      incidence of side effects related to oral isotretinoin treatment among the 3 arms of
      treatment.
