      at three and at six months and before each octreotide LAR administration for 12 months. MDSC
      cells will be detected by surface receptors LIN-, CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD124-IL4-Ra,
      CD184-CXCR4, CD279-PD1, HLA-DR and T-reg cells from CD3, CD4, CD8 receptors , CD25, CD39,
      CD45RA, CD45R0, CD62L, CD127, CD152-CTLA-4, CD184-CXCR4, CD278-ICOS, CD279-PD-1. Briefly, CD4
      + cells will be separated by negative selection, using the mixture of human CD4 antibodies.
      Octreotide is currently a registered drug to the FDA, EMA and AIFA with the indication for
      the treatment of well and moderately differentiated NETs functioning and not working on the
      front line. .
