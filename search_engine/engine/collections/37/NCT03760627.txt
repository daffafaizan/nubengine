      (MRTP) conducted at Collateral Repair Project (CRP) on the resilience of refugees. The study
      group and the control group will be recruited from refugees currently residing in Amman,
      Jordan who are participating in the MRTP at CRP, an ongoing program independent of our study.

      In order to assess the effect of the MRTP on participant resiliency, the three survey tools
      described above will be used:

        1. the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as a measure of the individual's
           degree of traumatization and

        2. the Child and Youth Resiliency Measure (CYRM-12) (for adolescents) or the Adult
           Resiliency Measure (ARM-12) (for adults) as a measure of resiliency
