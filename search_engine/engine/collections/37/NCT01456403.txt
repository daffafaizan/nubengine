    
      Detailed Description: Patients will undergo 3D U/S and at least one other imaging method,
      PET/CTA or MRI, preoperatively. At some sites, some patients will also have an ultrasound
      with microbubbles. Following surgery, the carotid specimens will be transported to a central
      pathology lab for microcomputed tomographic imaging and further study.

      At some sites patients will have a follow-up 3D U/S approximately 1 year after surgery to
      determine progression of plaque.

      CAIN-2 sub-studies:

      Eligible patients may be enrolled into one of the following sub-studies:

        1. CAIN-2 NaF pilot Characterizing Atherosclerotic Plaque with Sodium Fluoride Positron
           Emission Tomography- A Sub-Study of the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN
           Project 2), - patients undergo sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT with CTA instead of FDG
           PET/CT preoperatively. All other imaging and study procedures are carried out as per the
           CAIN-2 study.

           Recruitment for this pilot study is complete.

        2. CAIN-2B Atherosclerotic plaque imaging using NaF and FDG imaging: Validation and
           Evaluation of Disease Progression. A sub-study of the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging
           Network (CAIN-2) Histopathology Validation study - patients undergo both NaF and FDG
           PET/CT preoperatively. All other imaging and study procedures are carried out as per the
           CAIN-2 study.

      A total of 45 patients will be enrolled in this sub-study. Eligibility criteria for the
      sub-studies is identical to the CAIN-2 criteria.
