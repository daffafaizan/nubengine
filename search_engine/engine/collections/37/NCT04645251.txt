      multicentre, observational registry. All patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) with
      PLD or patients with Isolated (without PKD) Polycystic Liver Disease are eligible for
      inclusion (>10 liver cysts).

      Data will be collected prospectively and retrospectively including a specific validated PLD
      questionnaire (PLD-Q).

      This registry provides us insight in patient characteristics, risk factors, symptoms, quality
      of life and treatment strategies in the biggest international PLD cohort so far. Results of
      this registry will be published and shared at national and international congresses.
