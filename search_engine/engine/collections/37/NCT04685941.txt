      associated with poor prognosis. Hyperemic drugs, such as nitroprussiate and adenosine, have
      not yet demonstrated to reduce the infarct size and prognosis in patients with slow flow.
      Controlled flow-mediated hyperemia using a dedicated catheter for intracoronary saline
      infusion has been shown to stimulate microcirculatory vasodilatation in stable patients
      similarly as hyperemic drugs.

      The aims of the study are to compare the absolute microcirculatory resistance of the
      infarct-related artery presenting with slow flow after PPCI, as assessed by intracoronary
      thermo-dilution, treated with standard pharmacologic hyperemia versus flow-mediated
      hyperemia; and to compare the angiographic TIMI frame count after treatment of slow flow
      phenomena with the two investigated strategies.
