      approach for weight loss in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. The safety
      endpoints captured in the study include liver decompensation events, measured through several
      questionnaires, fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, fasting lipid profile and other
      adverse events. The tolerability of the ketogenic diet will be assessed by study compliance
      and by administering a questionnaire.

      Secondary aims include weight loss, changes in body composition via serial use of
      bioelectrical impedance via an Inbody Machine, changes in liver fat and liver stiffness using
      MRI and proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver biochemistries, changes in
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh and MELD scores measured via labs and changes in liver steatosis and
      stiffness via serial measures of VCTE by FibroScanÂ®.
