    
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor and it remains a
      lethal disease. Approximately 4 weeks post surgery for tumor resection, patients will proceed
      to standard of care treatment which currently consists of temozolomide (TMZ) with concurrent
      radiation therapy (RT) for 6 weeks. This study will add bevacizumab (BEV) to the standard of
      care regimen in newly diagnosed patients. The Bevacizumab will be added 2 weeks post start of
      RT/TMZ. Administration of bevacizumab will continue concurrently with TMZ every 2 weeks for
      12 months. Blood samples will be obtained from these patients at 3 different time points
      during this study.
