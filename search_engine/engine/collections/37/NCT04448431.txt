      followed by an 8-week Treatment Period with vortioxetine or desvenlafaxine. A Safety
      Follow-up Visit will be performed approximately 4 weeks after the Primary Outcome/Withdrawal
      Visit.

      At Baseline, patients will be equally randomised (1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment groups for an
      8-week, double-blind Treatment Period.
