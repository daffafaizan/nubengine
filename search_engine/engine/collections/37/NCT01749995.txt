      with cancer will be screened by an oncology clinical nurse specialist or study collaborator
      with the G8 questionnaire. Patients who screen positive, will be refered to the
      multi-disciplinary onco-geriatric program where a member of the geriatric oncology team will
      implement a comprehensive geriatric evaluation under supervision of an oncologist and/or
      geriatrician, who will then formulate recommendations and might suggest referral to other
      health care providers.

      Population: All consenting patients, aged â‰¥ 70, who are referred for anti-cancer treatment in
      the General Hospital Groeninge and who are in need of a CGA.
