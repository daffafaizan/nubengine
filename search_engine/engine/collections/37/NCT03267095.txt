      and social/emotional learning, which can lead to social isolation, problematic behaviors, and
      deficits in academic learning.These students have been found to respond well to the
      incorporation of music in intervention programs, in terms of both gains in communication
      skills and stronger social functioning . they respond more favorably and appropriately to
      music than other sensory stimuli
