      participation and the frequency and quality of treatment cost discussions will decrease the
      short- and longer-term burdens of financial toxicity through their influence on self-efficacy
      for managing treatment cost. The focus is on patient self-efficacy for managing treatment
      cost because it is expected that improved treatment cost education and patient-oncologist
      treatment cost discussions prompted by the DISCO App will directly improve the self-efficacy
      needed for patients to proactively manage treatment costs, thus reducing the material and
      psychological burden of financial toxicity. The DISCO App is not designed to increase
      patients' ability to pay or reduce the cost of treatment, but it may benefit patients by
      increasing: their knowledge of treatment costs, their self-efficacy for managing cost, and
      the likelihood they receive financial and psychological assistance and support. This research
      is significant because, if successful, reducing the material and psychological burden of
      financial toxicity will improve the quality of care and work toward achieving health equity.
      The DISCO App has already been tested for its feasibility and acceptability. The DISCO App
      will now be tested for its effectiveness in a diverse population of people with solid tumors
      treated with IV and oral chemotherapies.
