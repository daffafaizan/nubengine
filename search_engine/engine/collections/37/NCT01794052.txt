      support-enabled, health care delivery model for the management of hypertension and diabetes
      in the primary health care facilities of Himachal Pradesh. The study will be conducted at the
      5 Community Health Centers (CHCs) and District Hospital of Solan District, Himachal Pradesh
      using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The design and development of the model will
      be carried out in the initial six months followed by piloting the services at the CHCs and
      District Hospital. The impact of the model on quality of care will be assessed in a pre-post
      design measuring changes in both clinical and process indicators.
