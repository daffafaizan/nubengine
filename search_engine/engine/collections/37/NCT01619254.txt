      Ethiopia. A total of 216 households with at least one school-aged child (aged 6-15) will be
      randomly selected by systematic random sampling method. Different intervention packages will
      be randomised among households. Intervention activities will be implemented at household
      level, using the selected child within the household as study unit.

      If there are more than one child per randomised household all children will receive the
      intervention, but only two children, selected by simple random selection method, will be
      included in the trial. Selected children will be screened for intestinal parasitosis,
      following acquisition of signed informed consent, and will be recruited for the study after
      treatment.

      Parasite negative children in the respective households will be randomly allocated into
      intervention and control groups. Sequence allocation will be done in a central office by an
      individual who do not know and have no contact with the study sites and households.

      Each intervention and control group will have a fixed number of participants, and will be
      subjected to only one of the study interventions. Children and households in each group will
      be followed-up for 6 months by trained fieldworkers and the investigators according to a
      developed protocol throughout the study period. Parasitological, haemoglobin and
      anthropometric data will be collected at entry and after six months.
