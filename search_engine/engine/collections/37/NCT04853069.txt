      viruses, and that oestrogen may partly mediate this effect (ii) Oestrogen protects rodents
      from SARS-CoV-1 related mortality (iii) Women are relatively protected from developing or
      dying from severe COVID-19 and (iv) Postmenopausal women taking oestrogen replacement appear
      less likely to suffer Covid19-related critical illness. These effects may be mediated through
      oestrogen-related immunomodulation. In addition, however, 17Î² estradiol reduces expression of
      ACE2 (the receptor protein through which SARS-CoV-2 gains cellular entry) in tissues such as
      the kidney. As such, supplemental oestrogen may represent an effective therapy for Covid19.

      We will randomise adult men and postmenopausal women with confirmed Covid19 disease to
      receive 10 days of transdermal oestrogen (3mg/day). The primary endpoint will be evidence of
      disease progression, indicated by hospitalisation (mild cases) or need for mechanical
      ventilation or death within 28 days of randomisation for those hospiatlsied. Secondary
      outcomes will include hospital mortality, duration of hospital admission, admission to ICU/
      HDU facility, ICU/ HDU length of stay, need for renal replacement therapy, receipt and
      duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, cause-specific mortality and time to being fit
      for hospital discharge
