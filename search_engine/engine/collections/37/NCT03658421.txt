      ropivacaine for FNB can intensify analgesic effect and meanwhile reduce the possibility of
      lower limb (or quadriceps) weakness. Three groups were compared: 0.2% ropivacaine (H group),
      0.1% ropivacaine (L group) and ropivacaine 0.1% added with 2 Î¼g/kg dexmedetomidine (LD
      group).
