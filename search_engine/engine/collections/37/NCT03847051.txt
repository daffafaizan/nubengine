      in comparison to computed tomography of brain in pediatric population. Imaging quality is
      analysed with regards to artefacts and lesion conspicuity as well as its diagnostic potential
      in rendering a probable diagnosis. The primary study aim is to define feasibility and the AUC
      for diagnostic performance of minute MRI compared to computed tomography.

      Included patients are children age 4-18 with suspicion of cerebral pathology with referral to
      elective computed tomography of the brain.

      Study participants are in addition to computed tomography investigated during same day at 3T
      MR.
