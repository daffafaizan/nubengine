      activity and withdrawal of parasympathetic activity promotes progression of heart failure.
      Pharmacological blockade of sympathetic overactivity is associated with reduced mortality
      risk, but there are few data on pharmacologic augmentation of parasympathetic withdrawal.
      Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors augment parasympathetic neurotransmission by blocking the
      enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites. Pyridostigmine is a
      short-acting, reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of myasthenia gravis. Investigators propose a Phase II prospective randomized, double-blind
      trial to compare 12 weeks of treatment with ascending doses of pyridostigmine (15, 30, and 60
      mg every 8 hours) vs. matching placebo in 60 patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure
      associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
