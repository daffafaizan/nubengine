      fully understood. The Adequate Intake of fiber (14 g per 1000 kcal consumed) is based on data
      that strongly support a relationship with cardiovascular disease prevention (Slavin, 2013).
      While cereal fibers have been shown to be most effective at reducing cardiovascular disease
      risk (IOM, 2002), the components of dietary fiber (e.g. germ, bran) that exert this effect
      remain inadequately studied in cardiometabolic outcomes. Further, specific types of dietary
      fiber (natural and synthetic) have been shown to increase beneficial microbial species in the
      gastrointestinal tract, which are accompanied by improvements in inflammatory and metabolic
      disease markers. Very little is known about how isolated or intact fiber in whole grains
      solicit beneficial health effects via microbial mechanisms. Our goal is to study both changes
      in cardiometabolic outcomes and the gut microbiome after consuming different types of
      corn-based meals.

      Aim 1: To evaluate cardio-metabolic outcomes (primary outcome: LDL cholesterol) after
      consuming 48 g/d of whole grain corn flour, 50% refined corn flour + 50% corn bran derived
      from whole corn meal, and refined corn flour for 4 weeks in adult males and females with
      elevated LDL cholesterol in a crossover design.

      Aim 2: To evaluate changes in the gut microbiome after consuming 48 g/d of whole grain corn
      flour, 50% refined corn flour + 50% corn bran derived from whole corn meal, and refined corn
      flour for 4 weeks in adult males and females with elevated LDL cholesterol in a crossover
      design.
