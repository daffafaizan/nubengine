      days to assess safety and cure rates. Safety variables including adverse events (AEs) and
      serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected through Day 98. For the primary efficacy
      evaluation, the index ulcerative lesion will be assessed for clinical response by measurement
      of the length and width of area of ulceration. All other treated lesions will also be
      assessed for cure as secondary efficacy endpoints with ulcerated and non-ulcerated lesions
      being evaluated independently. An ulcerated lesion will be considered to be completely cured
      if 100% reepithelialization is observed. The length and width of non-ulcerated lesions
      (nodules, plaques) will also be measured and evaluated for cure (ie, absence of signs of an
      active lesion). The primary efficacy endpoint is the final clinical cure rate calculated by
      the number of index lesions that had 100% reepithelialization at Day 98 divided by the total
      number of index lesions that received at least one topical treatment of WR 279,396.
