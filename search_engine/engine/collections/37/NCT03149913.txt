      either receive a treatment with a conventional uncoated balloon or a balloon coated with
      paclitaxel. Only patients who require follow-up angiography after 6 months will be included
      in this study. The primary endpoint (index vessel occluded or still open) is at 6 months -
      the patients will be also followed for 24 months for clinical endpoints. In addition an MRI
      is planned at 12 months.
