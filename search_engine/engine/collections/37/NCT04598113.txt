      intermittent traction on balance disorders among patients diagnosed with common cervical
      neuropathy. The diagnosis is confirmed or made by a physical medicine and rehabilitation
      physician with 15 Y of experience treating musculoskeletal disorders especially cervical
      neuropathy. Enrolled patients are randomly assigned to one of two arms (1 or 2). Patients in
      arm 1 (Effective Traction/Sham Traction) are treated firstly with effective traction than one
      week later with sham traction. Patients in arm 2 (Sham Traction/Effective Traction) are
      treated firstly with sham traction than one week later with effective traction. At baseline
      the epidemiological parameters, the pain intensity (VAS), the grip strength, the functional
      status (NDI), the psychological distress (HAD), the Brief Best Test and the balance
      parameters (force platform) are assessed. The pain intensity, the grip strength and the
      balance parameters are assessed before and immediately after cervical traction for
      comparison.
