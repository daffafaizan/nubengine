      patients with newly diagnosed N2-3 nasopharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil or
      cisplatin and gemcitabine, work in different ways (concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by
      different adjuvant chemotherapy) to stop the growth of tumor cells.
