      they had stable or responding disease (per RECIST criteria) and wished to remain on study.

      Participants had a final follow-up visit within 4 weeks following the last dose of iniparib,
      after which time they were contacted by study staff every 3 months for the first year and
      every 6 months thereafter to assess disease status and survival.
