    
      Primary Objective

      -To demonstrate that the success rate of fexinidazole at one year follow-up in stage 1 and
      early stage 2 patients is greater than 80%. An 80 % success rate is considered as
      unacceptable.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To verify whether the success rate of fexinidazole treatment depends on the stage of the
           disease (stage 1 versus early stage 2); and, if the difference between the 2 stages is
           significant, to show that the success rate is greater than 80% and compatible with the
           historical success rate of NECT in early stage 2 patients and with the historical
           success rate of pentamidine in stage 1 patients.

        -  To verify whether the success rate of fexinidazole treatment depends on the number of
           WBCs in CSF before treatment initiation.

        -  To assess changes in the success rate over time.

        -  To evaluate the safety of fexinidazole and determine whether its safety profile is
           comparable to the historical safety profile of pentamidine.
