      treatment of PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy. Subjects will be screened
      at outpatient Nephrology Clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be
      consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline
      values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 12
      months. Daratumumab will be administered once weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 2 weeks
      for 8 additional doses. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months (6 months after
      the last infusion). A final visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be
      conducted at the end of the study.
