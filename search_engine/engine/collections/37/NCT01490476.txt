    
      This protocol is a Phase II, open-label, efficacy and safety study of single-agent RAD001 in
      patients with NF2. During the study, subjects will receive continuous daily oral treatment
      with RAD001 for up to 4 years or until tumor progression.

      Primary Objective: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the VS growth in patients
      with NF2 at a rate sufficient to submit the drug for further testing.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the volume of other
      intracranial tumors; to assess the effect of RAD001 on hearing function in patients with NF2
      (when applicable); to determine whether RAD001 modulates signaling pathways in intracranial
      NF2 tumors removed during the course of the study. And determine the long term safety.

      All patients will be treated with RAD001 10 mg p.o. daily dose (5mg if 15-17 years old with
      cutaneous surface area <1.5m2) for one year except in case of unacceptable toxicity, death,
      or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.

      At 12 months an extension for another one year of RAD001 treatment will be discussed in case
      of response.

      If the patient is stable (decrease or increase lower than 20%), treatment should be stopped
      and the patient should be kept under quarterly continuous surveillance. Resumption of
      treatment will be discussed case by case basis if tumor regrowth over 20% relative to the
      tumor volume at the end of treatment.

      All patients will have a follow-up visit (including MRI) scheduled at 24 months after
      enrollment.

      We modify the protocol to extend the treatment by RAD001 for a period of two additional years
      for stable patients still on treatment two years after enrollment.
