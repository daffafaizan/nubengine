      musculature. It is suggest that intervention programs specifically address muscle inhibition
      beyond typical strengthening exercises. To specifically address decreased muscle activation
      transcutaneous electrical neuromuscular stimulation (TENS), applied to the knee, has been
      shown to reduce pain and increase muscle activation in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.
      Interventions including joint manipulation applied at distant sites, such as the lumbopelvic
      region have also been shown to increase muscle activation following intervention in
      individuals with PFPS, but the duration of effect is unknown. It is hypothesized that
      interventions which alter spinal afferent signals may have an effect on efferent motor
      output. Since the lumbopelvic region and the knee joint share common nerve root levels it is
      possible that interventions applied to either site may influence efferent motor output to the
      quadriceps muscle. The magnitude and duration of this effect is unknown.

      Both TENS and lumbopelvic manipulation have also been shown to reduce pain during exercise in
      individuals with knee joint pathology. This study would better determine the magnitude of
      effective pain reduction between interventions applied at the knee joint and at a distant
      site, the lumbopelvic region.
