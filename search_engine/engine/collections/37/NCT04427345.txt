      The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is severely testing
      the health systems of the most advanced countries. Clinicians are faced with a new pathology
      of an emerging virus. There is therefore an urgent need to collect real-time clinical data
      that informs about outcome predictive variables. Furthermore, there are currently no
      antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, off-label therapies are
      being used with drugs already in use for other pathologies that have shown some efficacy in
      vitro, and some treatments obtained for compassionate use with other drugs that are being
      tested.

      It is more than ever necessary to collect clinical practice data both retrospectively on the
      work done so far, and in a longitudinal perspective, and analyze them quickly to optimize
      current treatments and define protocols for the future. Having a good clinical data base also
      offers the possibility of collaborating with numerous international networks on translational
      research, which aims to correlate clinical data with virological and immunological data,
      aimed at the rapid identification of possible specific viral virulence factors, or particular
      immune structures of the guests who once again define the final clinical outcome.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      All COVID19 positive patients admitted to San Gerardo Hospital will be enrolled in the study.

      After patient signs the informed consent, the following data will be collected:

        -  birth data

        -  sex

        -  demographic data

        -  comorbidity

        -  blood chemistry data at the entrance

      A series of variables will then be collected relating to the treatment procedure, the
      therapies, the team's choice to maximize the care ceiling in the individual patient and the
      entire clinical study of the patient.

      STATISTICAL ANALISYS:

      Central tendency and dispersion measurements will be used for descriptive analysis of
      continuous variables while absolute and relative frequencies will be used to describe
      categorical variables.
