      unregulated intestinal loss of water and electrolytes. The osmolality of oral supplements may
      affect these losses. In a double-blinded, active comparator, cross-over intervention study,
      the investigators test the effects of substituting 800 ml of the usual fluid intake with an
      intake of either an isoosmolar (300 mOsm/kg) or hyperosmolar (700 mOsm/kg) supplement during
      48 hours, following baseline data collection before both intervention periods. Outcome
      measures were stoma output volume, 24-hour urine and urinary sodium excretion, and intestinal
      aquaporin 3 and 8 expressions.
