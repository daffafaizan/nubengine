      chronic kidney disease (CKD), usually gets worse over time, and is known to cause problems
      for patients on dialysis. Children on dialysis can have a wide range of bone and growth
      issues, and common treatments have a chance of making these things worse by increasing serum
      calcium and serum phosphorus. Cinacalcet has been shown to be effective in controlling
      parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus in adults. The purpose of this study is to
      show that including cinacalcet in the treatment of SHPT will lower the levels of intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in a larger number of pediatric patients with CKD who are
      receiving dialysis, compared to a treatment regimen that does not include cinacalcet.
