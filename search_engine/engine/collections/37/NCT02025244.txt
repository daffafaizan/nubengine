    
      Patients with endoscopically detected submucosal tumors of Upper GUT with diameter â‰¥ 2cm are
      enrolled in the trial.

      According to randomization, the patients are allocated to either EUS-FNA by 22G needle or KHB
      consisting of forceps biopsy through mucosal incision by a needle knife, both with subsequent
      histological/cytological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the specimen. The success of
      tissue diagnostics was evaluated as well as the possibility to determine the mitotic activity
      in case of GIST. In case of failure of the initial method, the other method was performed
      (cross-over design). Patients are hospitalized and kept under observation during 24 hours
      after the biopsy.
