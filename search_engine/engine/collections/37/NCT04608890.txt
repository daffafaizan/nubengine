      diabetes. The aim of the study is to analyze alterations in the oculomotor system function as
      an early sign of diabetic neuropathy. A novel eye-tracking-based test will be employed and 5
      parameters will be analyzed through the use of a computer-based test which will record
      timeframes of eye movements towards an object, type of eye movements, time between the first
      eye movement, number of visualization required to recognize the object across the screen.
      Each of these parameter will be employed to assess whether Resistance, Wideness, Pursuit,
      Velocity of eye movements and movements related to the Optokinetic Nystagmus are altered in
      type 1 diabetes as compared to non diabetic subjects.
