      LAM is a rare multi-system disease that can affect the lungs of young women, is of uncertain
      cause, is usually progressive, and can cause debilitating lung disease which may be corrected
      with lung transplantation. Several hundred women with the disease have been identified,
      largely through a LAM Foundation in Cincinnati, Ohio.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The Data and Coordinating Center is located at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The registry
      has six major clinical centers: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Mayo Clinic-Rochester, National
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, New England
      Medical Center, and Stanford University Medical Center. Data and lung tissue collected by the
      registry will be used to characterize the clinical features and natural history of the
      disease and to determine the efficacy of lung transplantation in this disorder. Eligible
      patients are to be seen yearly for up to 4 years at the Clinical Centers or, in some cases,
      by individual referring physicians. Tissue collected by the LAM Registry will be stored at a
      central NHLBI repository. Outcome events include measures of pulmonary function (eg,
      spirometry and, when available, lung volumes and diffusing capacity), arterial blood gases or
      oximetry, walking and resting oxygen titration, cardiopulmonary stress testing,
      cause-specific mortality, functional status, and clinical events associated with lung
      transplantation.

      The Office of Research on Women's Health provided funding in FY 1997 in the amount of
      $100,000.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
