      in the proposed study will be randomly divided into two intervention groups:controlgroup and
      EDP therapy group. Before using EDP,the investigators will measure the relevant parameters of
      lung volume , diaphragm electromyogram, diaphragm activity and other basline index. Then EDP
      will be applied to investigate the effects of EDP on the above mentioned respiratory
      mechanics parameters.
