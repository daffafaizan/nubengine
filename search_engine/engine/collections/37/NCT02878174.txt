      attached on the front surface of the ultrasound (US) probe. The angle of rotation of the
      probe is delivered to the laptop and becomes the information to adjust the rotating angle of
      screen. Immediately after induction of general anesthesia, the patient's head is turned
      slightly, and the table is tilted at 10 degrees. In the US group, the investigators obtain a
      sonographic view and try a cannulation of the internal jugular vein (IJV). In the prelocation
      group, a skin marker is made on the anticipated skin puncture site where a perpendicular line
      that passes over the center of the IJV meets the skin on the rotated US screen. It is
      recorded "success" when the internal jugular vein is successfully punctured without
      complications. It is recorded "failure" if the internal jugular vein is not punctured during
      repeated needle passes. The number of tries and tile to success are recorded. The success and
      complication rates between two groups are compared.
