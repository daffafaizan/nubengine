      anti-tumor immunity.Accumulated evidences indicate that Treg cells are elevated in peripheral
      blood,however,there are also reports that decreased Treg cells are found in hepatocellular
      patients.This study focuses on the changes of Treg cells ratio in peripheral blood of
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients before and 1 week, 4 weeks after ablation ,also its
      functional cytokines,such as TGF-β,IL-10,IFN-γ,and inhibition function when co-cultured with
      CD4+CD25-、CD8+ cells. The investigators speculate that a decreased Treg ratio will be found
      in patients who receive ablation therapy,and its function cytokines,moreover,CD4+CD25-、CD8+
      cells' proliferation and function could be inhibited when co-cultured with Treg cells.
