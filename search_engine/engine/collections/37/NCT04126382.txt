      respiratory problems in premature babies. Surfactant administration involved with
      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation has proven to be a effective treatment,
      however, it is associated with a risk of barotrauma, volutrauma and bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia(BPD). In recent years, some studies have demonstrated that prophylactic INSURE did
      not lead to a higher survival without BPD, and LISA technique is recommended. However there
      is no multicenter and Large sample research about it. The aim of this multicenter trial is to
      compare the efficacy between LISA-treated and INSURE-treated premature Preterm babies with
      respiratory distress syndrome(RDS).

      Methods/Design：In this multicenter, randomized, cohort, prospective trial, 200 preterm
      infants from 18 neonatal intensive care units in AnHui province whose gestational age (GA)
      less than 32 weeks with a diagnosis of RDS will be randomized to LISA-treated group and
      INSURE-treated group.

      The primary outcomes include rate of intubation,incidence of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia(BPD).The secondary outcomes include arterial blood gas analysis,severity of RDS,the
      incidence of Patent ductus arteriosus(PDA),Pneumothorax,Abdominal Distention,Neonatal
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis(NEC,>Stage II), Retinopathy of Prematurity( ROP,≥ Stage II),
      Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH, ≥ Grade Ⅲ), Periventricular Leukomalacia(PVL) , mortality,
      days on noninvasive respiratory support,days on supplemental oxygen and days of
      hospitalization.Other secondary outcomes include scores of Gesell development Scales of
      infant development at 3 years of corrected age.
