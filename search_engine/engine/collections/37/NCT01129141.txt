      Veterans and military members with TBI has become a critical concern. The investigators'
      research has focused on developing effective, evidence-based methods of tinnitus management
      for Veterans. These efforts led to the development of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM).
      The investigators completed a pilot study to adapt PTM to meet the unique tinnitus management
      needs of Veterans and military members with TBI using a novel home-based telehealth program
      called Tele-PTM. Preliminary data analyses indicated that Tele-PTM is effective. The present
      study modified the PTM program in accordance with pilot study findings and evaluated Tele-PTM
      using a randomized clinical trial design.

      The 4-year study was based at the VA National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research
      (NCRAR). Tele-PTM was implemented and evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Qualified
      candidates were randomized to receive either Tele-PTM or Wait-List Control (WLC). All
      subjects completed questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline.
      The WLC group received Tele-PTM after completing the 6-month questionnaires. The primary
      outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

      Tele-PTM involves a series of seven telephone appointments, conducted at approximately 1, 2,
      3, 4, and 5 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after enrollment is finalized. Telephone education was
      provided by the Study Psychologist at weeks 1, 3, and 5, and month 6; and by the Study
      Audiologist at weeks 2 and 4, and month 3.

      Tele-PTM has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans and active
      military personnel across the country for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on
      individual VA hospitals.
