      however, there is room to further improve benefits. A novel agent such as M7824, a fusion
      protein which targets the tumor microenvironment where it blocks both the cell intrinsic
      PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and the immunosuppressive TGFÎ², is hypothesized to be more effective
      than agents that target only a single pathway.

      This study aims to investigate functional imaging with 89Zr-M7824 to characterize the
      biodistribution of M7824 to support its clinical development. In Part A, we will evaluate the
      biodistribution of zirconium-89 (89Zr) labelled M7824 in a small cohort of lung cancer
      patients unselected for PD-L1 status (n=3). In particular, we will examine the ability of
      89Zr-M7824 to detect and quantitate intra-tumoural PD-L1 expression and correlate this with
      PD-L1 assessment in archival tissue. Based on this, Part B will gather additional data about
      the biodistribution of 89Zr-M7824 in an additional 9 patients. The requirement for patients
      in Part B to have high levels of PD-L1 positive cells in tumours based on a fresh biopsy or
      archival tissue at study entry will be informed by the data generated in Part A. Safety will
      be formally assessed also as a secondary endpoint at the end of Part A of the study and
      addressed if necessary. After completion of 2 imaging cycles, patients who do not show
      complete response to M7824 monotherapy after 3 therapeutic doses of M7824 may be transitioned
      to M7824/chemotherapy combination
