      handbike. The time trial will be the same as in the Paralympics 2016 in Rio. The subjects
      perform three trials and receive another supplement for each trial: beetroot juice with 6mmol
      nitrate, 6mmol sodium nitrate or plain water (placebo supplement). The time to complete the
      time trial will be the main outcome parameter.
