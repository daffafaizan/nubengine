      colostomy) for ESBL producing gram negative bacteria will be obtained at hospital admission
      and discharge. Patients starting antibiotic therapy per os and/or intravenously will be
      sampled at antibiotic start (t0, within one hour) and at the following intervals: day 3 (t1),
      7 (t2), 15 (t3), 30 (t4). Patients colonized with MRSA and/or ESBL-producing gram negative
      bacteria before starting antibiotic therapy (t0 sample) will be excluded from follow-up
      cultures and analysis. All patients included in the study will be followed to determine
      whether they develop clinical infections with the target ARB. Patients will be followed
      during the hospitalization and afterwards for a total of 30-day from the inclusion in the
      study. Screening will be performed in outpatient clinics after patients' discharge from the
      hospital within 30 days of starting antibiotic (t0 sample).

      Nasal and rectal cultures will be also obtained from the ward staff at the beginning and at
      the end of the study. This group includes nurses and all staff including doctors having
      contacts with patients. These cultures will be handled in the same manner as the patients'
      cultures
