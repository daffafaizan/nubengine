    
      This is a single center, open label CHMI study. CHMI will consist of exposure to Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoites through the bites of infected mosquitoes. After the challenge,
      subjects will be evaluated daily for the development of malaria infection using a blood
      smear. Unless previously diagnosed and fully treated, subjects will be required to stay in a
      hotel for a maximum of 12 nights starting on or around the evening of Day 7 post challenge.

      All subjects diagnosed with malaria infection based on smears will be prescribed a standard
      malaria treatment regimen to begin on the day that parasitemia is detected. Subjects who do
      not become parasitemic (via smear) by Day 19 will be empirically treated for malaria.

      After the hotel phase, all challenged subjects will have a final scheduled follow-up visit on
      Day 28 (Â±7 days).
