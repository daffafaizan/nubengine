      patients in septic shock, on vasopressors, using both the NICOM and FloTrac devices. An
      increase in CI, SVI, or Pulse Pressure of >10% in response to the passive leg raise will be
      considered a positive passive leg raise test, and the same indicators will be considered a
      significant response to a fluid challenge with either crystalloids or colloids.Each device
      will be evaluated independently, but simultaneously.
