      problems patients with hypertension are facing. The information will act as a foundation for
      designing an intervention/interventions that may result in more patients achieving blood
      pressure control with maintained quality of life. Patients, who have well/not well controlled
      blood pressure, are to fill in questionnaires about their view on ability to perform
      self-care and their perceived quality of life. Individual interviews will also be made about
      for what reasons they do or do not change lifestyle as well as take their drugs to treat
      their hypertension. In focus group interviews the patients are to be asked about what they
      want and expect in the encounter with health care personnel, what other things outside the
      health care area would be helpful for the patient and how age, gender, cultural and
      psychosocial aspects affect the ability to achieve blood pressure control. The developed
      future interventions will be evaluated in clinical practice.
