      diuretic properties in healthy humans, and improves hemodynamics and symptoms in adults with
      decompensated congestive heart failure. Several retrospective case series suggest that
      nesiritide has beneficial effects on hemodynamics and urine output in adults and children
      following cardiac surgery.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to evaluate the
      effects of a continuous infusion of nesiritide on postoperative hemodynamics and urine output
      in infants with congenital heart disease who undergo cardiac surgery requiring
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients less than 1 year of age following cardiac surgery will
      be eligible for the study if they have received two conventional diuretics (furosemide and
      chlorothiazide) for at least 12 hours, yet are not effectively achieving a negative fluid
      balance, thus prohibiting sternal closure or tracheal extubation. Patients will be randomized
      to receive either a 10-hour infusion of nesiritide, a two hour washout period, followed by a
      10-hour infusion of placebo, or this study drug sequence in reverse order. During the 24-hour
      study period, serial cardiac output measurements and BNP levels will be obtained, vital signs
      and intracardiac filling pressures will be recorded, and urine output will be measured.
