      dose-selection study to compare antifibrinolytic MDCO-2010 vs tranexamic acid and placebo in
      reducing blood loss.

      This study was designed to examine a broad range of doses to fully characterize the
      dose-response relationship between MDCO-2010 dose, plasma PK, PD, and clinical effects.

      In Stage 1, 90 patients were to be enrolled into one of six treatment groups with 15 patients
      per group: four groups were to receive MDCO-2010, one group was to receive tranexamic acid,
      and one group was to receive placebo. Stage 2 was to be an expansion of Stage 1.

      The study was terminated after 49 patients were enrolled into Stage 1.
