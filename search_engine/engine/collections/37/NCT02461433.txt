      wounds, vacuum assisted closure (VAC) was developed. This innovative technique provided
      contained controlled wound irrigation without bacterial aerosolization. A newer customizable
      subset of the Prevena incision Management System TM called Prevena Peel and Place TM has been
      released a few months ago. The new model can be cut to specific wound sizes and has a
      connector that can be attached to the already widely available VAC machines. The versatility
      and the comparability to older models of Prevena Peel and Place TM have not been tested to
      this date.

      The investigators believe that a randomized clinical trial evaluating the use of the Prevena
      Incision Management System TM for homecare and the use of Prevena Peel and Place TM for
      inpatients in special populations is warranted. Obese patients (BMIâ‰¥30) undergoing open
      surgery will have decreased surgical site infection rates, improved healing time, better
      quality of life (QOL) and lower readmission rates with use of Prevena in the post-operative
      management of surgical incisions.
