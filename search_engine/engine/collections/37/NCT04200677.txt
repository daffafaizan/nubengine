    
      This is a randomized controlled trial, a crossover study, with healthy male and female
      participants. The procedures will take place in 10 distinct visits for a 7-day interval.

      The following visit in the lab will be:

        -  Familiarization session.

        -  Monophasic Current (100 Hz) with 1ms pulse width applied to the Tibial Nerve;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with pulse width 0.5ms applied to the Tibial Nerve;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with 1ms pulse width applied to the Tibial Nerve;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with 2ms pulse width applied to the Tibial Nerve;

        -  Monophasic (100 Hz) with 1ms pulse width applied to the Triceps Surae Muscle Belly;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with pulse width 0.5ms applied to the Triceps Surae muscle
           Belly;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with 1ms pulse width applied to the Triceps Surae Muscle
           Belly;

        -  Biphasic current (100 Hz) with 2ms pulse width applied to the Triceps Surae Muscle
           Belly;

        -  Biphasic current (25 Hz) with 0.5ms pulse width applied to the Triceps Surae Muscle
           Belly.

      The dependent variables will be:

        -  Muscle fatigability;

        -  Central and peripheral contribution (with H-reflex and M-wave amplitude analysis);

        -  Maximum voluntary isometric contraction;

        -  Force production for plantar flexion evoked by NMES;

        -  Perceived discomfort.
