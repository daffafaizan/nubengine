      controlled clinical trials. In clinical practice, when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) are ineffective in reducing pain due to OA, clinicians often add a second agent
      without discontinuing NSAIDs. In this study, we will investigate whether adding duloxetine to
      NSAIDs provides additional pain relief and functional improvement in patients with knee pain
      due to OA.
