    
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled intent-to-treat (ITT) clinical trial.
      Approximately eighty eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control
      condition (Information and NARCANÂ® (naloxone) Nasal Spray kit) or to the experimental
      condition (TTIP-PRO in addition to the elements provided in the control condition). All
      participants will complete a follow-up phone call approximately 3-weeks post-randomization,
      during which process measures will be completed, and in-person visits at approximately 3, 6-,
      and 12-months following enrollment.

      This is a single site study; all data will be collected at the University of Cincinnati.
      Approximately 80 participants will be randomized into this pilot efficacy trial. The
      hypotheses to be tested include that participants assigned to the TTIP-PRO intervention will:
      have a higher rate of enrollment in MAT, have a lower rate of recurring opioid overdose, and
      have greater reduction in illicit opioid use.
