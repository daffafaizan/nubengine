      attaining independent oral feeding, thus delaying the achievement of an adequate nutritional
      status and hospital discharge which - according to the American Academy of Pediatrics-
      requires the ability to feed exclusively by mouth(1-2) The development of oral feeding
      ability in pre-term infants is therefore a primary concern for neonatologists.

      Because of the immaturity of their body functions and the occurrence of co-morbidities,
      pre-term infants generally require a period of enteral feeding before they acquire the
      coordinated sucking ability that allows sufficient milk intake for growth(3) Furthermore,
      infant sucking skills differ between bottle- and breastfeeding (4), and pre-term infants have
      been reported to show a weaker and less coordinated suck (5).

      Few studies have investigated the timing and effect of co-morbidities on the achievement of
      independent oral skills. Jadcherla et al. (6) reported that infants born with a gestational
      age of < 28 weeks showed a significant delay in attaining the transition to oral feeding, but
      it has also been found that the occurrence of morbidities negatively correlates with
      postmenstrual age at the time of achieving oral feeding skills (6),(7-8).
