      learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      trial, we probe whether administration of levodopa improves learning performance as compared
      to placebo administration on neuropsychological tests and in an associative learning
      paradigm. We postulate that levodopa improves learning success and memory performance in
      healthy subjects, while the effect in patients with dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment
      might depend on other factors, including severity of memory impairment.
