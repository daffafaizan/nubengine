      carotid endarterectomy surgery (CEA) or stenting. Subjects with moderate, asymptomatic
      stenosis (50-79% narrowing) typically do not undergo intervention because the procedural
      risks outweigh the benefits. However, some of these individuals will have vulnerable plaque
      that places them at high risk of stroke, but current diagnostic techniques for vulnerable
      plaque are lacking. Recently, VPDiagnostics developed a new module - SmartRisk - that
      stratifies risk of stroke for stenotic (50-79% blockage) atherosclerotic plaque. The
      SmartRisk module uses MRI data to compute a risk assessment from a specific atherosclerotic
      plaque. A continuous risk value is generated and patients with risk values above a
      prespecified threshold are at elevated risk for cerebrovascular events arising from carotid
      artery disease. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the SmartRisk module is
      effective at stratifying risk of a carotid-related cerebrovascular event in subjects with
      asymptomatic 50-79% carotid stenosis.
