      I. Pilot a positive psychology intervention delivered to hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT) survivors and interested caregivers over an 8 week period.

      II. Determine the proportion of patients who enroll and the immediate benefit to
      participants, as measured by pre- and post-exercise measures of happiness and optimism.

      III. Pilot outcome data collection mechanisms in preparation for a randomized clinical trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants and caregivers receive a positive psychology exercise manual, complete positive
      psychology exercises every week, and participate in phone sessions over 30 minutes every week
      for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 6 months.
