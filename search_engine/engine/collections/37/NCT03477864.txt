    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability for an established effective dose of systemic
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in
      patients with locally advanced prostate cancer with or without oligometastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall pathologic response rate after radical prostatectomy. II. To
      determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free survival in men treated with
      REGN2810 and intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.

      III. To determine radiographic progression free survival in men treated with REGN2810 and
      intraprostatic ipilimumab with SBRT.

      IV. Acute and chronic adverse events (AEs).
