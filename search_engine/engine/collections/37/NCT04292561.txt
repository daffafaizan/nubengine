      postoperative delirium in general anesthesia. At present, there are two kinds of commonly
      processed quantitative EEG monitoring to evaluate the depth of anesthesia, one is bispectral
      index (BIS) and the other is patient state index (PSI). The relationship between
      intraoperative anesthetic exposure and postoperative delirium is unclear, or whether
      potential patient characteristics increase the risk of EEG suppression and postoperative
      delirium.

      Gastrointestinal surgery can lead to long-term changes in colonic flora, which can remotely
      regulate brain function through the gut brain axis. We speculated that the abnormal
      composition of intestinal flora before abdominal operation might be the influencing factor of
      POD.
