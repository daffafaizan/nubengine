      (FESS) decreases the risk of serious orbital or skull base injuries. Beta blockers are among
      several methods used to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and mucosal
      bleeding. Labetalol (mixed alpha-1-beta blocker) reduces HR and MAP; however, its alpha-1
      blockade may mitigate topical epinephrine decongestant effects. Esmolol (selective beta-1
      blocker) does not have direct antagonistic effects on topical epinephrine. This study
      compares the hemodynamic parameters (rate of blood loss, MAP control, HR) and intraoperative
      visibility during FESS between esmolol and labetalol.
