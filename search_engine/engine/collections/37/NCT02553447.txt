      I. To evaluate the 3 year progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from the time of
      study entry of watch and wait or newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) until relapse, progression, or death from any cause.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum vitamin D levels during therapy with daily oral
      vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol).

      II. To evaluate the overall survival (OS), defined as time from the time of study entry of
      watch and wait patients or newly diagnosed NHL or CLL until death from any cause.

      OUTLINE: Patients with low levels of vitamin D are randomized to 1 of 2 arms and patients
      with normal levels are assigned to Arm III.

      ARM I: Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally (PO) daily for 3 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive low-dose cholecalciferol PO daily for 3 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive no intervention.
