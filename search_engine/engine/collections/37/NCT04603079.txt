      training for infection prevention for COVID-19 is an essential step to facilitate nurse
      leadership and safety in the hospital. There is immense reliance on nurses with regard to
      patient safety, yet very little effort is made to invest in interventions for their
      leadership roles in developing countries, including Pakistan. In this study the aim is to
      deliver an intervention for COVID-19 preventive protocols to nurses and assess the impact of
      the intervention through a pre and post-test survey. A total of 200 nurses will be sampled. A
      100 nurses each will be part of the control and experiment group each.

      The data will be analyzed using SPSS. Pre and post test results will be presented using
      descriptive data and bivariate regression will be used to present higher odds of confidence
      in preventive and awareness literacy for COVID-19 in nurses after intervention delivery.
      Through this research the aim is to improve nurse leadership in maintaining minimum service
      delivery standards for hospital infection control with respect to COVID-19; but also other
      infectious disease burden management.
