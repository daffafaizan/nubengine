        -  To describe the immune reconstitution of T cell-, B cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-
           compartment in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant as part of their
           treatment for a malignancy.

      The design for this study will be a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Immune
      reconstitution will be measured in the course of autologous stem cell transplant using serial
      blood samples analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping (demonstrating the expression
      of specific receptors on the cell surface) and functional lymphocyte assays. These blood
      samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after stem cell infusion
      either while the research participant is hospitalized or during the scheduled clinic visit.

      Immune recovery from conventional chemotherapy will be measured using serial blood samples
      analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping, and NK cell functional assays. These blood
      samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after completion of courses #1
      and #4 of Induction chemotherapy while the research participant is hospitalized or during the
      scheduled clinic visit.
