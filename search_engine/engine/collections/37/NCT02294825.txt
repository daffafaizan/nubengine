      (the North-West Inter Regional Female Cohort for Patients with Endometriosis), a prospective
      cohort financed by the G4 Group (The University Hospitals of Rouen, Lille, Amiens and Caen),
      and coordinated by the principal investigator (H.R.). Information is obtained from surgical
      and histological records and from self-questionnaires completed before surgery. Standardized
      gastrointestinal questionnaires (KESS, GIQLI, WEXNER, FIQL and Bristol) are routinely used to
      assess bowel function. Data recording, patient contact and follow-up are carried out by a
      clinical research technician. Women are included in the CIRENDO database only when
      endometriosis is confirmed by both surgical exploration and biopsy. Postoperative follow-up
      is based on data from the afore-mentioned questionnaires completed at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years.
      Prospective data recording and analysis were approved by the French authorities CNIL
      (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) and CCTIRS (Comité Consultatif pour
      le Traitement de l'Information en matière de Recherche dans le domaine de la Santé).
