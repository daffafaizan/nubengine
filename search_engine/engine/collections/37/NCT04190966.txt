      postoperative complications which effect both short and long-term outcome. Despite this 1 in
      5 patients continue to smoke before their operation.

      Project MURRAY is a trial comparing the effectiveness of personalised integrated smoking
      cessation delivered by trained health-care practitioners in the thoracic surgical pathway,
      and is a three part package of behaviour interventions and pharmacotherapy as per National
      Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)/ National Centre for Smoking Cessation Training
      (NCSCT) guidance which is supported by an adjunct web-based application. This is a pilot
      study to evaluate feasibility of a substantive trial and study processes in 5 adult thoracic
      centres including the trial coordinating site at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS
      Foundation Trust. This is a multicentre feasibility study, with aim for equal weighting
      between the two arms of the integrated smoking cessation and an observation only group of
      usual care.
