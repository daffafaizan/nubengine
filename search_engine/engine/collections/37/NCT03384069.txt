      judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes and it maybe a precursor for
      Alzheimer's disease. African Americans have a higher risk of developing MCI compared with
      Whites. Unfortunately, prevention and management of MCI has been understudied among
      African-Americans. Chronic stress (such as perceived discrimination, daily environmental
      stress) in African Americans can affect cognition and also plays a role in worsening of
      unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, improper diet and physical inactivity.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a collaborative psychological approach that addresses
      the interaction between people's thoughts, feelings and behavior. Existing evidence suggests
      that CBT can be an effective strategy for dementia patients with co-morbid anxiety. However,
      none of these studies have specifically evaluated African Americans with MCI. The aim of the
      study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a six-month CBT program (group based
      and phone-based) compared with usual care, and to determine if the intervention can improve
      cognitive performance and reduce chronic stress in a randomized trial including 30 African
      American patients with MCI. The CBT program among African Americans with MCI will provide
      preliminary evidence about the efficacy and the optimal intensity of the intervention needed
      for patients at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
