      medication, invasive fungal infection signs & symptoms, concomitant medication, posaconazole
      use, tolerability, safety and therapy outcome will be collected on abstracted electronic Case
      Report Forms.

      This surveillance study was originally limited to subjects receiving posaconazole as salvage
      antifungal therapy as indicated. A subgroup of subjects at risk for invasive fungal infection
      was included for prophylactic treatment following the enlargement of the marketing
      authorization for NOXAFILÂ® (posaconazole) during the course of the study. These participants
      only contributed data for the assessment of safety.
