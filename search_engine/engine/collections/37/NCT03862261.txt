      standard-of-care and transition to the intervention at randomly assigned time points.

      In this study two strategies will be compared: i) The standard of care, offering pediatric TB
      services based on current routine approach; ii) The intervention, with pediatric TB services
      integrated into child healthcare services.

      The primary objective will be to assess the effect of the intervention compared to standard
      of care on the proportion of TB cases diagnosed among children <5 years old (that is the
      number of children who are clinically or bacteriologically diagnosed with TB over the total
      number of children attending the child healthcare services). Secondary objectives are
      detailed in the protocol.

      Study sites will include six hospital in each participating country (Cameroon and Kenya)
      along with selected attached health centers.

      The study population will be children aged less than five years of age with a presumptive
      diagnosis of TB.

      Study enrollment will start in March 2019, last enrollments until July 2020 and follow up
      will be completed by August 2021.
