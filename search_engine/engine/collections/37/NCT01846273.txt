      therapy, and ranibizumab monotherapy. Based on the results of the primary analysis at Month
      12, patients still in the ranibizumab monotherapy group at the time of the switch cut-off
      time point were switched to the ranibizumab + vPDT combination therapy group until study
      exit. A total of 168 and 154 patients were included in the ranibizumab + vPDT combined
      therapy and ranibizumab monotherapy groups, respectively for the FAS (Month 12 analysis).
      However, the safety set included 172 and 149 patients, respectively. Four patients in the
      combination therapy group never took vPDT . Among them, 1 patient actually received
      verteporfin injection but no laser injection. Thus a total of 3 patients (4-1) in the
      combination therapy group did not take the actual full vPDT treatment. Additionally, 7
      patients in the monotherapy group received vPDT and 1 patient from the monotherapy group did
      not receive ranibizumab treatment. Considering the above numbers, safety set included 172
      patients (i.e., 168-3+7) in the ranibizumab + vPDT combination therapy group and 149 patients
      (i.e., 154-7+3-1) in the ranibizumab monotherapy group for Month 12 analysis. For the Month
      24 safety analysis, the 14 patients in the ranibizumab monotherapy group who were switched to
      ranibizumab +vPDT combination therapy group were analyzed as a separate group, ie,
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg + vPDT (switched).
