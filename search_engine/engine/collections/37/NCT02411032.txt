      programs or send messages that are designed to improve customers' engagement. The
      investigators' past research has shown that certain life events and calendar events (e.g., a
      job change, a birthday, a holiday, Monday) feel like a "fresh start" to people and have the
      potential to motivate them to begin pursuing their health goals (e.g., exercising, starting a
      diet, quitting smoking). In this experiment, the investigators will test (a) whether Humana
      can increase the effectiveness of its messages by sending them to customers around fresh
      starts moments and (b) whether highlighting a recent fresh start event in Humana's messages
      can further increase customer engagement.
