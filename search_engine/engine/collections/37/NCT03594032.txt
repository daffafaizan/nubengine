      microorganisms .Bronchiectasis and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections are
      inextricably linked Pathophysiologically. But the incidence rate and characteristics of NTM
      infections among patients with bronchiectasis remains unclear in mainland China.

      In this study, we will collect data of participants about demographic ,co-morbidities
      ,spirometry, mMRC score ,exacerbation history, QOL-B questionnaire, aetiology, spirometry ,
      HRCT(or CT) scan ,results of microbiology samples and treatments, collect three consecutive
      sputum(or induced sputum) samples to smear, bacteria culture, acid-fast stain, mycobacterium
      cultivation and identification, drug susceptibility testing of nontuberculous mycobacteria.To
      estimate the prevalance of non-tuberculous mycobacterial(NTM) infections in Middle-aged and
      old women patients with bronchiectasis in northern China. To analyze clinical manifestations
      and microbiological characteristics of patients with bronchiectasis comorbid NTM infections
      By 16SRNA and gene sequencing.

      In addition, A cross-sectional investigation about lung function and clinical data will be
      done among patients who have confirmed bronchiectasis with NTM from February 2017 to December
      2020.
