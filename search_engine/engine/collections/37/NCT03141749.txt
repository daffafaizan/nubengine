    
      A cohort of more that 2,800 adult patients admitted to our Institutions between January 2000
      and November 2014 with genetically proven myopathy will be retrospectively included.

      Any information relative to their demographic and genetic characteristics, their muscular
      functional status and the occurrence of VTE will be collected.

      Statistical analysis will be performed to estimate the incidence of venous thromboembolism in
      this population, to identify predictors of VTE, and to compare its incidence to a
      community-based population.
