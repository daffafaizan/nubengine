      newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who were eligible for stem cell transplant were
      targeted for recruitment to this study. Combination doxorubicin HCL liposome injection,
      bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy was given for 4 cycles in preparation for stem
      cell collection and transplant. As remission status after induction and prior to the first or
      second auto-transplant has been shown to be the major determinant of both event free and
      overall survival in multiple myeloma patients, the goal has been to improve response rates
      through the use of various combinational approaches. As such, the objective of the present
      study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with this regimen could result in a higher
      complete + near complete response rate (CR + nCR) prior to stem cell transplant, than
      obtained with current regimens, and then to confirm the response rate post-transplant. Safety
      was evaluated using adverse event reportings, clinical laboratory tests and tests for cardiac
      function (multiple-gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram and electrocardiogram). Four 21-day
      cycles of combination induction therapy consisting of 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib (given i.v. Days
      1, 4, 8, 11) + 30 mg/m2 Doxil/Caelyx (given i.v. Day 4) + 40 mg Dex (given po Days 1-4, 8-11,
      15-18 Cycle 1 only; Days 1-4 Cycles 2-4).
