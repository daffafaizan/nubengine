      regulation of temperature. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive
      method, which detects transient haemodynamic changes in the brain, using blood oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD) signal differences.

      In order to investigate the role of hypothalamic neural activity in response to taste,
      glucose and temperature, fMRI will be performed before, during and after ingestion of 300 ml
      plain water or water with added ethyl butyrate (pineapple flavour), added glucose or added
      ethyl butyrate plus glucose. All beverages will be consumed at 22 °C and the combination will
      also be drunk at 0 °C.

      The study uses a randomised cross-over design in 16 healthy male subjects with a normal body
      weight. There will be an interval of at least one week between the five occasions.

      BOLD signal intensity of the hypothalamus will be continuously measured for 21 minutes (5
      minutes baseline, 4 minutes during drinking and 12 minutes after drinking).
