      Detailed characterisation of donor and recipient microbial community composition (by means of
      16S rRNA profiling) and determination of the kinetics of changes following FMT

      Secondary aims:

        -  Determination of interactions of importance to persisting recipient gut microbiota.

        -  Evaluate safety of FMT in an IBS population

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of FMT in relieving symptoms in selected patients with IBS in
           an open pilot trial in order to have the possibility to calculate number of patients
           needed when planning future controlled studies.
