      consolidation treatment used in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in first or second line
      of treatment. This procedure is associated with prolonged neutropenia and considerable
      morbidity. Different guidelines have recommended the use of growth factor after peripheral
      stem cell transplantation.Pegfilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
      resulting from the modification of Filgrastim by chemical addition of a polyethylene
      glycol(PEG) moiety which increases its half-life by decreasing its renal clearance. Then, a
      single injection substitutes several Filgrastim injections. The trial "PALM" realized by our
      team has shown, between these 2 molecules, an equivalent efficacy on the duration of
      chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in patients treated for lymphoma or myeloma. This
      trial has also shown that Pegfilgrastim is a cost-effectiveness dominant strategy.

      Some studies have shown that a rapid lymphocyte reconstitution after stem cell
      transplantation is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival.

      In the present PALM2 study, the investigators want to describe the kinetics of different
      lymphocyte subsets reconstitution within 3 and 6 months after transplantation, in patients
      with B-cell malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in first or second-line chemotherapy and first
      autologous transplantation. The investigators will assess the kinetics of reconstitution for
      T-lymphocytes (Na√Øve T-lymphocytes, regulatory T-cells and memory T-cells), B-lymphocytes
      (transitional B cells), cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer T-cells, dendritic cells. A
      preliminary phase to this assessment will consist in estimate intra-center variability of
      lymphocyte phenotyping.
