      of sympathetic nervous system and contracting skeletal muscles by the release of myokines
      such as lactate and irisin that signal WAT to induce expression of beige adipocytes. It has
      been also suggested that exercise training could enhance the metabolism of already existed
      functional BAT by increasing uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) gene transcription, mitochondrial
      biogenesis and hyperplasia. This is of clinical relevance because brown fat activation has
      been found to improve metabolic factors linked to obesity and diabetes.

      In this study the investigators use a PET radiotracer 2-[18F] flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)
      to quantify the glucose uptake in BAT, whie adipose tissue and the muscle.The participants
      are scanned thrice at fast in this study once at room temperature, second at cold exposure
      and third after six weeks of exercise at cold exposure. This study will provide an insight
      about the role of exercise in activation of BAT metabolism.
