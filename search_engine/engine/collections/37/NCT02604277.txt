      suicidality in patients with Bipolar Disorder. Additionally, the study aims to identify
      treatments to reduce the suicidal behavior and improve quality of life through a 6-week
      group-based intervention program. Groups will include topics such as interpersonal/social
      rhythm and mindfulness interventions, as well as interventions focused on understanding and
      changing thoughts to better cope with Bipolar Depression.
