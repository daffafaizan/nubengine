      expectations of an inert substance or procedure", has been demonstrated to have powerful
      effects in multiple instances (Colloca & Benedetti, 2005). Although research on the placebo
      effect is prolific, the mechanisms involved can vary based on the context and have been
      difficult to research with consistent approaches and results (Brown et al., 2013; Holmes et
      al., 2018). Some researchers have found that the mere perception of a treatment as "new" is
      enough to elicit a placebo effect, while others have found that the key mechanism may be
      attention to symptoms - nevertheless, "little evidence exists on the precise mechanisms
      through which psychological treatments actually work" (Brown et al., 2013; Holmes et al.,
      2018).

      Earlier work suggests the potential for psychological treatments for hearing loss or other
      forms of hearing disability, including coping techniques (Scott et al, 2009). We are
      extending the mind-body unity theory as suggested by Dawes, et al (2011, 2013) who found in
      two successive studies that there is a reliable placebo effect in hearing-aid trials. While
      the objective of these studies was to encourage double-blind methodology (to optimize
      results), these results suggest that such effects can optimize outcomes and as the audiology
      field does not typically consider placebo effects (Dawes et al, 2013) it suggests that
      hearing improvements can be impacted by (positive) expectations in a "general" sense (not a
      specific type of hearing aid but simply a "new technology" hearing aid). While this will be
      of great use clinically in double blind trials, it suggests that the use of a psychological
      construct, specifically the Langerian attention to variability construct, can function to
      encourage a placebo effect or a clinical response by encouraging a sense of personal control
      over the symptoms of the hearing loss. In this study, researchers will look to further
      investigate one potential mechanism important to the placebo effect - attention to
      variability.
