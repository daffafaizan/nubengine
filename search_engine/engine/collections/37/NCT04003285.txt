      chronic complex TBI. The investigators' recent human data suggest that ALLO is decreased in
      patients with TBI, suggesting that ameliorating deficits of this neurosteroid may be
      clinically therapeutic. In addition, multiple groups have reported ALLO reductions in
      patients with conditions that frequently co-occur with TBI, including depression and pain
      disorders. 132 Veterans with a history of mild TBI with co-occurring depression and pain
      symptoms (chronic complex TBI) will be randomized to either intravenous placebo or ALLO (3
      groups/44 participants per group: placebo, lower dose ALLO, higher dose ALLO). Following a
      loading dose, Veterans will receive placebo or ALLO infusion targeted to achieve serum ALLO
      levels of 0 nM (placebo), 50 nM (ALLO lower dose), or 150nM (ALLO higher dose). Behavioral
      assessments will be conducted during the infusion, post-taper, and 24 hours post-infusion. In
      addition, the investigators will conduct behavioral assessments 7 days and 14 days
      post-infusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that ALLO will be well-tolerated in patients with complex TBI,
      and that this intervention may reduce depression and pain symptoms (in addition to
      potentially improving function).
