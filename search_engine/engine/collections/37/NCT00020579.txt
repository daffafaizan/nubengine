        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of MS-275 in patients
           with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the profile of adverse events, including changes in laboratory parameters, in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Design MS-275 regimens with possibly more frequent dose administration based on the
           pharmacology of MS-275 using the schedule in this study.

        -  Determine the antineoplastic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral MS-275 once on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks (every 2-week
      schedule). Alternatively, patients receive oral MS-275 once on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (weekly
      schedule). Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Treatment for both schedules continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 on the every 2-week schedule until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD for the every 2-week schedule is
      determined, patients receive treatment on the weekly schedule as above. The MTD is then
      determined for the weekly schedule. The MTD for both schedules is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of up to 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Once the MTD is determined for the weekly schedule, up to 3 additional patients are accrued
      to receive MS-275 at the MTD of the weekly schedule.

      Disease status is assessed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-75 patients will be accrued for this study.
