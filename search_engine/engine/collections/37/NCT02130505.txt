      dyslipideima are the main causes of CVD. Recently, we have shown that there is an acute
      leukocyte activation after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in patients with
      newly-diagnosed diabets mellitus type 2 (T2DM). Leukocyte activation is an important and
      obligatory aspect in the process of atherosclerosis. Complement system is another important
      inflammatory component in atherosclerosis, which becomes activated in the postprandial phase.

      In this study, we will investigate both inflammatory systems in healthy volunteers and
      patients with T2DM on insulin therapy and hyperlipidemia (both familial hyperlipidemia (FH)
      and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH)) during an OGTT.
