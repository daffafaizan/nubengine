    
      This was a Phase 3, multicenter (conducted in more than one center), placebo-controlled (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in
      a clinical trial), double-blind (neither the Physician nor the participant know about the
      study medication), parallel-group (a medical research study comparing the response in 2 or
      more groups of participants receiving different interventions), randomized-withdrawal study.
      Participants who were in clinical response to golimumab at Week 6 in induction study C0524T16
      (NCT00488774) or C0524T17 (NCT00487539) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0
      of this study to receive 1 of the following maintenance treatment regimens administered
      subcutaneously every 4 weeks through Week 52: placebo, golimumab 50 mg, or golimumab 100 mg.
      Participants who were in clinical response to placebo and participants who were not in
      clinical response to golimumab or placebo at Week 6 in induction study C0524T16 (NCT00488774)
      or C0524T17 (NCT00487539) will not be randomly assigned but will be eligible to be enrolled
      in the study (i.e., the nonrandomized group) and received the following treatment regimens:
      placebo, golimumab 100 mg and golimumab 100 mg. Dose adjustment will be done for participants
      who were in clinical response to golimumab or placebo during induction studies C0524T16
      (NCT00488774) or C0524T17 (NCT00487539) but lose clinical response during maintenance study
      C0524T18 (NCT00488631). On completing this study, participant will have the opportunity to
      continue to receive study medication in a study extension that will last up to approximately
      3 years. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by assessing the clinical response using Mayo
      Score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
