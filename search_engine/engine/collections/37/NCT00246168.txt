    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of ULTRACET® (tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg) as add-on
      therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking an NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor. The patients
      will be randomized into 2 treatment groups: The first group will receive one ULTRACET® tablet
      3 times per day for 7 days. The second group will receive one placebo tablet 3 times per day
      for 7 days. The primary efficacy measurement will be the patients' average daily pain score.
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that ULTRACET® will be
      well tolerated and the average daily pain relief score for the ULTRACET® treatment group will
      be better than that of placebo group. Patients will take one ULTRACET® tablet or placebo by
      mouth 3 times per day, for 7 days.
