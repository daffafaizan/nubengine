      (approximately 1/1000 live births). Currently, the main treatment options for patients with
      hereditary hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implantation. Both of these
      treatment options have limitations and are incapable of restoring natural hearing. Over the
      past few years, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using gene therapy to
      improve hearing in mouse models of human hereditary hearing loss. Nonsyndromic autosomal
      dominant sensorineural hearing loss (DFNA) is an attractive target for gene therapy since
      patients with DFNA usually develop hearing loss later during childhood or even adulthood7.
      This allows for a longer time period during which therapeutic intervention can be delivered
      before the onset of potentially irreversible functional and pathologic changes. The genome
      editing technology has the potential of correcting the underlying genetic mutations in
      affected cell types8. In this study, we plan to assess the efficacy of genome editing on
      cultured primary or immortalized fibroblasts obtained from DFNA patients. These patients and
      their family members will also be followed longitudinally to better characterize the natural
      history of DFNA. This will provide baseline data for DFNA that will be important for
      interpreting the results of future clinical trials of inner ear gene therapy.
