      analgesic techniques for postoperative management of this increasingly common surgery, with
      main purpose of adequately control pain, minimizing adverse effects and seeking early
      rehabilitation.

      Currently, the most used technique is the continuous femoral nerve block, which is able to
      control postoperative pain well, but has the limitation that also produces motor blockade,
      decreasing quadriceps strength up to 80%, increasing the number of falls and delaying early
      mobilization after surgery. On the other hand, the adductor canal nerve block is an
      alternative as it is considered a purely sensitive block. The nerves that are in this channel
      are the saphenous adductor nerve, posterior branches of the obturator nerve, medial vast
      nerve, sometimes the medial cutaneous nerve and anterior branches of the obturator nerve and
      the vast medial nerve.

      With regard to the adductor canal block, current literature supports analgesic effect
      comparable to femoral nerve block with less motor block than femoral nerve block. However,
      there is no clarity regarding the ideal concentration and volume of local anesthetics to use.
      Volumes ranging from 5 to 30 ml have been used in different studies. For example, using 20 mL
      of local anesthetic in femoral nerve block has produced scattering of anesthetic that has
      blocked motor branches.

      The investigators objective is to determine which volume of levobupivacaine 0.25% is
      necessary to produce analgesia and sensitive blockade while minimizing motor blockade in
      adductor canal nerve block in patients undergoing cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.
