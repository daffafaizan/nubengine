      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level will be treated with either 160 milligrams (mg) LY2157299 or
      300 mg LY2157299. Part B where HCC participants with a normal AFP level will be treated with
      300 mg LY2157299, Part C where treatment-na√Øve HCC participants will be treated with 160 mg
      LY2157299 + sorafenib or 300 mg LY2157299 + sorafenib, and Part D where HCC participants will
      be treated with either 160 mg or 300 mg LY2157299 + ramucirumab.

      Participants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time that the study is
      considered completed, may enter the treatment extension period and continue to receive the
