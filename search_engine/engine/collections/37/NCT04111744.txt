    
      Pts with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and indication for elective CABG will be
      prospectively randomized into a preoperative training group (TG) or a non active control
      group (CG). Pts in TG have to perform six sessions of aerobic endurance training within two
      weeks prior to CABG. The following investigations will be performed at baseline, one day
      before surgery and at the beginning and at the end of cardiac rehabilitation: a maximal
      symptom limited ergospirometry, assessment of endothelial function (analysing the reactive
      hyperaemic index (RHI) via a finger-tonometry), assessment of quality of life (QoL) using the
      MacNew Heart Disease Questionnaire, laboratory testing of ischemic and inflammatory
      Parameters. Baseline, peri- and postoperative characteristics will be collected.
