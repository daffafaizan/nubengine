    
      TTP is a rare blood disorder that causes blood clots to form in the small blood vessels
      throughout the body, including the kidneys, brain, abdomen, and the heart. Plasma exchange is
      the standard treatment for TTP. Plasma exchange is a treatment that removes the plasma (the
      liquid portion of the blood without any cells) from a patient and replaces it with plasma
      from a donor. With plasma exchange, 90% of patients achieve a remission of the disease.
      Unfortunately, up to one half of patient will relapse after the plasma exchange has stopped,
      leading to significant complications and added risks to the patient.

      This study randomizes patients to receive either prednisone or cyclosporine as an adjunct to
      plasma exchange, with the cyclosporine arm being the experimental arm of the study. All
      patients will undergo plasma exchange but will be randomized to receive either prednisone or
      cyclosporine as an adjunct to plasma exchange. Previous studies suggested that cyclosporine
      was superior to prednisone as an adjunct to plasma exchange, and therefore this randomized
      study attempts to confirm the findings of two previous single institution studies.
