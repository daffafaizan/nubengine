      Participants will be randomized at study entry to protocol A (vitamin E first) or protocol B
      (placebo first). The first 2 weeks of the study will be a baseline assessment of the
      frequency, severity and duration of cramps. Patients will be blinded for the remainder of the
      duration of the study. For weeks 3-6 of the study, group A will receive vitamin E 800 IU bid
      and group B will receive placebo. For weeks 7-10 of the study, group A will receive placebo
      and group B will receive vitamin E. Participants will record cramp frequency and
      characteristics via a daily journal for the duration of the study, however the data analysis
      will focus on cramp frequency only during weeks 5-6 and 9-10. Weeks 3-4 and 7-8 will be used
      as time periods to allow the new drug to come to steady state and allow for washout of the
      previous drug. Data analysis will focus on the difference in cramp frequency in individual
      patients in each treatment period.
