      hidden fluctuations in neuronal and vascular responses, and thus is especially suited for
      investigating effects of disease or drugs. In addition, this project will use nonlinear DCM,
      a DCM extension that can measure gating effects by striatum on cortico-cortical pathways. The
      overall aims of this project are: (1) To conduct functional magnetic resonance imaging-based
      DCM studies of working memory and impulsivity in order to determine the effective
      (directional) connectivity between PFC and striatum in treatment-seeking Cocaine Dependent
      (CD) subjects compared to non-drug using controls. We hypothesize that DLPFC causally affects
      ventral striatum in CDs, and that the strength of this connection is lower in CDs compared to
      controls. (2) To determine whether the pretreatment gating effect by the dorsal striatum, as
      a reflection of pretreatment hypodopaminergic state associated with chronic compulsive drug
      use, predicts the treatment response to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in CDs. We hypothesize
      that lower pretreatment gating by the dorsal striatum on prefrontal-parietal effective
      connectivity predicts greater 8-week improvement from treatment of CDs with DA enhancing
      medications (combined with cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]), but not from treatment with
      placebo (combined with CBT).
