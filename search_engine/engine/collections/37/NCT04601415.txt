      To demonstrate DUO-EF can identify heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
      post-COVID-19 where diagnosis would otherwise be missed/delayed To demonstrate DUO-EF can
      reliably and accurately diagnose new HFrEF in the primary care setting To further validate
      DUO-EF diagnostic performance at-scale against gold-standard investigations (echocardiography
      and cardia MRI) To measure if DUO-EF suggestive of HFrEF but with normal gold standard
      investigations predicts future risk of developing HFrEF

      Methods To demonstrate DUO-EF can identify heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction
      (HFrEF) post-COVID-19 where diagnosis would otherwise be missed/delayed To demonstrate DUO-EF
      can reliably and accurately diagnose new HFrEF in the primary care setting To further
      validate DUO-EF diagnostic performance at-scale against gold-standard investigations
      (echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging - cMRI) To measure if DUO-EF
      suggestive of HFrEF but with normal gold standard investigations predicts future risk of
      developing HFrEF

      DUO-EF prediction of ejection fraction in patients attending COVID-19 follow up clinic and
      comparison with:

      subsequent DUO-EF at time of gold-standard investigation for HF ejection fraction as
      calculated by gold-standard investigation

      DUO-EF prediction of ejection fraction in patients where their GP suspects new heart failure
      and comparison with:

      subsequent DUO-EF at time of gold-standard investigation ejection fraction as calculated by
      gold-standard investigation DUO-EF prediction of ejection fraction in unselected patients
      attending for echocardiography or cardiac MRI, comparing DUO-EF predicted with gold-standard
      calculated ejection fraction Telephone call follow-up at 24 months for all patients with
      DUO-EF suggestive of HFrEF but normal gold standard investigations

      OUTCOME MEASURES Area under curve (AUC) of DUO-EF calibrated for detection of EF below 40%;
      classification accuracy Positive predictive value of DUO-EF in COVID-19 clinic and GP context
      based on subsequent gold-standard estimation of EF; negative predictive value of DUO-EF in
      COVID-19 follow up cohort; positive predictive value of DUO-EF at 24 months in those with
      negative gold standard investigations Qualitative measurement of patient and clinical end
      user acceptability of Eko DUO

      POPULATION Group 1: Patients seen in the COVID-19 follow-up clinic (n = 400) Group 2:
      Patients seen in primary care with symptoms newly suggestive of heart failure (n = 400) Group
      3: All-comers to echocardiography departments across Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (n
      = 1,500) Group 4: patients undergoing cardiac MRI investigation (n = 100)
