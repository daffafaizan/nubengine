    
      Enrollment on day 3 of critically ill patients, without contraindication to EN, not achieving
      60% of the ICU per protocol energy target.

      Intervention: Randomization to either continued pure EN, or from day 4 to supplemental PN to
      complete EN at target validated by indirect calorimetry.

      Measurements: Indirect calorimetry on Days 3, 4, 9 (twice). Primary endpoints = glucose and
      leucine metabolism On days 4 and 9-10: isotopic investigation of glucose metabolism, and
      immune and inflammatory responses// Day 9-10: isotopic investigation of protein (leucine)
      metabolism Secondary endpoints: Insulin requirements, area under the curve (AUC) of blood
      Glucose, infections after day 9, overall complications, length of mechanical ventilation, of
      ICU and hospital stay.
