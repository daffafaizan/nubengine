      status, using central venous pressure (CVP) as the gold standard. Measurement of CVP requires
      placement of an invasive venous catheter, with insertion of a venous catheter into a central
      vein to obtain CVP. Catheter placement is invasive, costly and not without complications.
      Ideally, there would exist a peripheral surrogate for CVP that would be 1) minimally invasive
      to obtain, 2) low cost and 3) strongly correlate with CVP over a wide range of physiological
      conditions.

      The peripheral venous system is in continuity with the central venous system and, as such,
      would be expected to have a pressure that correlates with central venous pressure. Numerous
      previous studies suggest a correlation between peripheral venous pressure (PVP) and central
      venous pressure. Prior studies have demonstrated a reasonable correlation between CVP and PVP
      in patient populations including decompensated heart failure, cardiac and non-cardiac
      surgery(1), liver transplant donors(2) and recipients(3), neurosurgical(4) and pediatric
      patients.(5) In an earlier study published by the authors of this paper, the mean difference
      between PVP and CVP in patients with acute heart failure syndromes was 0.4 mmHg with a
      correlation coefficient of 0.947. One limitation of the earlier study was that it established
      this correlation at only one point in time. In the study presented here, PVP and CVP will be
      obtained and correlation will be assessed across multiple time points during a given
      patient's hospitalization.

      This is a prospective, single center cohort study to investigate the correlation between
      peripheral venous pressure and central venous pressure.
