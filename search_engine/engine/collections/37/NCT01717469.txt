      effects of RV pacing, including electromechanical dyssynchrony, proarrhythmia and development
      of heart failure (HF). However, it remains unclear whether pacing-related ventricular
      dyssynchrony can translate into significant LV structural changes and produce important
      clinical impairment in an average pacemaker population with compromised AV conduction.
      Alternatively, left ventricular pacing has been shown to minimize ventricular dyssynchrony
      and to improve symptoms and prognosis in patients with mild to moderated systolic HF and
      prolonged QRS duration.

      This randomized controlled study is been conducted to compare the effects of conventional
      right ventricular (RV) pacing vs. left ventricular (LV) in patients with AV block. The
      hypothesis is that isolated LV pacing through the coronary sinus can be used safely and
      provide greater hemodynamic benefits to patients with AV block and normal ventricular
      function who require only the correction of heart rate.

      Specifically, the investigator aims are to evaluate the safety, efficacy and the effects of
      left ventricular pacing using active-fixation coronary sinus lead-the Attain StarFixÂ® Model
      4195 OTW Lead, compared to right ventricular pacing in patients with implantation criteria
      for conventional pacemaker stimulation.
