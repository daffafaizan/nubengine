      of the Parkinson's disease. Physiotherapy rehabilitation is essential because these disorders
      are generally non-dopa-sensitive. Isokinetic muscle strength may reduce postural disorder in
      Parkinson's disease.

      Isokinetic device rehabilitation promotes maximum muscular contraction at constant speed; the
      resistance of the machine continuously adapting to the force developed by the subject. As the
      spinal muscle strength gain is superior to conventional post-rehabilitation motor function,
      the improvement in postural instability should be greater than that achieved with
      conventional rehabilitation. A better postural support should thus result in a decrease in
      the risk of falling and an improvement in the quality of walking.
