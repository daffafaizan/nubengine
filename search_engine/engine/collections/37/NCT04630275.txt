      with doxorubicin containing chemotherapy. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline and is known to be
      toxic to both Leydig Cells of the testes and hormone-producing cells of the hypothalamus.
      Therefore patients treated with this drug are at risk of developing hypogonadism. Standard
      follow-up programs do not include investigation of hormone levels. With this study we aim to
      investigate the extent of hypogonadisme in patients treated with anthracycline containing
      chemotherapy, to clarify whether it is relevant to include serum testosterone in standard
      follow-up programs.

      Our Hypothesis:

      Hypothesis 1: A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have
      impaired QoL due to sexual dysfunction.

      Hypothesis 2: A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have
      reduced levels of testosterone.

      Hypothesis 3: A significant relationship between QoL, sexual dysfunction and testosterone
      levels exists.

      To clarify the extent of hypogonadisme a single blood test including s-total-testosterone
      will be drawn once, and levels below 8nmol/L will be classified as hypogonadisme. To assess
      patients sexuality and quality of life, 3 questionnaires will be filled out; the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 for general quality of life, EORTC SHQ-22 for sexual health and IIEF-5 for sexual
      function.
