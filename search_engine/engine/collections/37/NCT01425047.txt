      of mangosteen fruit is used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, infections,
      wounds, and diarrhea. The proposed health-promoting effects have been attributed to a family
      of polyphenols referred to as xanthones. Since its introduction into the United States,
      juices and products containing mangosteen fruit have become a top-selling botanical dietary
      supplement. This commercial success largely has been the result of aggressive marketing of
      health claims based on in vitro observations and anecdotal reports.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioavailability of xanthones from mangosteen
      juice in adult human subjects. After an overnight fast of at least 10h, male and female
      subjects were admitted to the Ohio State University Clinical Research Center. Volunteers
      ingested 2 ounces of 100% mangosteen juice as part of a western-style breakfast. Pericarp
      particles accounted for 1% of the mass and 99% of total xanthone content in the juice. This
      dose provided 130 Â± 2 mg total xanthones. Blood was collected prior to breakfast and
      1,2,3,4,6,8 and 24h. Subjects were fed a mangosteen-free lunch and released from the unit
      after the 8h collection, refraining from mangosteen containing products until final
      collection of blood at 24h. Urine was collected for the 24 test period.
