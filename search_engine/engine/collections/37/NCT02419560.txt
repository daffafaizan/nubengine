      this study is to determine the optimal dosing scheme for the combination of ibrutinib with
      ABT-199 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The main
      criterion for eligibility is MCL with measurable disease which is relapsed or refractory to
      at least 1 chemotherapy-containing regimen and has not been previously treated with
      ibrutinib.

      This dose finding study will use a continual reassessment method, which accounts for both
      toxicity and efficacy in combinations of agents, to determine the optimal combination of the
      approved treatment ibrutinib with the investigational agent ABT-199. This study will accrue
      patients in two stages. In the initial stage, subjects will be accrued to dosing cohorts of
      increasing dosages of ABT-199 in combination with ibrutinib. The modeling is initiated once 1
      subject experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). During the modeling stage, treatment
      assignments will be made based on model prediction.

      Subjects will remain on treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, and will be
      monitored for safety during the treatment interval. Safety will be evaluated by incidence of
      adverse events and number of discontinuations due to AEs. Efficacy endpoints include Overall
      Response Rate (ORR), Complete Response Rate (CRR), minimal residual disease response rate,
      and survival (PFS and OS). The study will also include exploratory analysis of the gene
      expression pattern in subjects who progress on treatment.
