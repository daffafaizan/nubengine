    
      This is a pilot study to measure safety and tolerance of laser hair depilation in adolescents
      and young adults with pilonidal disease as a potential treatment to intervene on future
      recurrence.

      Up to a total of 10 patients will be enrolled.

      Each patient will be involved in the study for one year. Patients will be brought into
      Surgery clinic for 1 laser treatment every 4-6 weeks to obtain a total of 5 treatments.
      Follow up will occur monthly from the time of initial treatment through 1 year after the last
      treatment as we evaluate for tolerance and efficacy.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  English and non-English speaking patients

        -  All Fitzpatrick skin types

        -  Age : 12-20 years

        -  Diagnosis of pilonidal disease

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  History of photosensitivity

        -  Actively inflamed pilonidal sinus

      Laser depilation treatment: Patients will be brought into Surgery clinic for 1 treatment
      every 4-6 weeks to obtain a total of 5 treatments. The treatment will consist of an 810 nm or
      Nd:YAG depending on Fitzpatrick skin type and tolerability. A cooling platform and
      application of topical lidocaine cream will be used to minimize any discomfort associated
      with the heat of the laser treatments.

      Initial follow up for the laser depilation group will be performed to assess for tolerance of
      the laser treatment. Patients will report their pain every 6 hours for the first 48 hours
      after their laser hair depilation treatment. Once tolerance is established, patients will
      return to surgical clinic every month for their laser or placebo visit. After the 5th clinic
      visit, they will receive a telephone call monthly to assess for any evidence of resolution or
      recurrence of disease up to 1 year after the completion of the treatments.
