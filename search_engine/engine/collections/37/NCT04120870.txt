      has been debated. One cohort comparative study showed ketamine had benefit in hemodynamics
      compared to etomidate in trauma patients. One observational study showed in high shock index
      patients, ketamine showed maintain systolic blood pressure. And other retrospective showed
      less clinical hypotension was less in ketamine. However there is no randomized controlled
      study comparing ketamine and etomidate in trauma patients. The purpose of this study is
      comparing the effects of hemodynamics between ketamine and etomidate in high shock index
      trauma patients.
