      the pain management of women in labor and delivery. The investigators hypothesize that use of
      virtual reality devices will result in a reduction in pain medication use, in epidural use,
      and prolong the duration of time prior to the patient receiving an epidural.

      The study will be conducted as two parallel randomized controlled trials: one for latent
      labor patients and one for patients in active labor (defined by whether they are < 6 cm or >
      6 cm). Within each phase of labor, there will be 20 in the Virtual Reality arm and 20 in the
      Control arm for a total of 80 patients.
