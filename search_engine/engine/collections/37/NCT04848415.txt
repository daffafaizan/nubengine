      Tomography (CT) is commonly used to diagnose this disease. However, CT is not always
      available in real-time, requires technician times, is associated with increased cost and
      exposes patients to radiations.

      The researchers will investigate the diagnosis performances of POCUS for the diagnosis of BO
      with comparison with CT which will be considered as the gold standard. The wain objective
      will be the ability to exclude the diagnosis of BO, the main criteria being the negative
      predictive value. The secondary objectives will be the diagnosis performances (sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value), duration and difficulty of POCUS
