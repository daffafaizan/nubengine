    
      Our primary OBJECTIVE is: (1) to develop, implement and assess the feasibility of an online
      peer mentor employment readiness intervention for youth with physical disabilities and their
      parents to improve their self-efficacy, career maturity and social support.

      A mixed methods feasibility randomized controlled trial design will be conducted to develop
      and assess the usability of "Empowering youth towards Employment" intervention. Youth (aged
      15-25) with physical disabilities and their parents will be randomly assigned to a control or
      experimental group (12-week, interactive intervention, moderated by peer mentors). A
      qualitative thematic analysis will be conducted to analyze the content of discussion forums.
      Interviews with youth, parents and mentors will also be conducted about their experiences in
      the intervention.
