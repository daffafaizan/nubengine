      may have different disease and other health related issues than younger adults with similar
      diagnoses. One aspect of aging which can make older adults more vulnerable is frailty.
      Frailty is a general term that describes a decline in multiple areas of health, including the
      loss of energy, physical ability, and mental ability. Frailty can make it difficult for
      patients with cancer to respond to treatment and more likely to have side effects. On the
      other hand, many older patients are not frail despite advanced age. This study is being done
      to determine if co-management by a geriatrician of older adults who are found to be frail
      through a detailed baseline assessment can improve outcomes.
