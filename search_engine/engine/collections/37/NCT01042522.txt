      I. To assess the activity of paclitaxel and carboplatin with respect to progression free
      survival (using bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP] as a reference) for newly diagnosed
      advanced or recurrent chemonaive ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the toxicity of paclitaxel and carboplatin, and bleomycin, etoposide, and
      cisplatin in this patient population.

      II. To estimate overall survival for paclitaxel and carboplatin relative to that of BEP.

      III. To evaluate response rate in the subset of patients with measurable disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect fixed and/or frozen tumor tissue for future translational research studies.

      II. To explore the utility of inhibin A and inhibin B as prognostic and predictive biomarkers
      for ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors and to examine changes in these markers with treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bleomycin sulfate IV on day 1 and etoposide phosphate* IV over 1
      hour and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients who have received prior radiotherapy receive etoposide phosphate on days 1-4.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
