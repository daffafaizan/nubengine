      pylori infection in several important international consensuses. However, it is associated
      with a high frequency of adverse events. Both hybrid and high-dose dual therapies developed
      by the scholars from Taiwan can achieve a high eradication rate for clarithromycin-resistant
      strains, and have a great potential to replace bismuth quadruple therapy in the treatment of
      H. pylori infection. In the second-line treatment, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple
      therapy developed by our study group can achieve a higher eradication rate than levofloxacin
      triple therapy for salvage treatment of hybrid therapy. However, whether the new therapy can
      be a promising rescue treatment for bismuth quadruple or high-dose dual therapy remains
      unanswered.
