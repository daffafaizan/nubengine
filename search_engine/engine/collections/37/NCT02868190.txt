    
      The study design is as follows:

      Prospective

      Subjects with medicated IOP > 18 mmHg and â‰¤ 30 mmHg

      Subjects on one topical ocular hypotensive medication prior to stent implantation

      Implantation of two iStent devices (if IOP is < 6 mmHg, at any point during the postoperative
      follow-up, medication will not be prescribed or will be discontinued)

      IOP will be measured by two (2) observers to minimize bias; observer 1 will look through the
      slit lamp and turn the dial with readings being masked, and observer 2 will document the IOP

      Diurnal IOP measurements

      Follow-up through 60 months postoperative (but could be up to 61 months if subject needs to
      undergo terminal washout)

      Descriptive statistics will be tabulated

      Medical therapy considered necessary for the subject's welfare can be implemented at any time
      during the study at the investigator's discretion
