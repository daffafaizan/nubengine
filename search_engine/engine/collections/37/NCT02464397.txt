    
      OPTIMAX-OCT is a prospective, randomized (1:1), study that will be conducted at 2-3 sites
      (Finland, Belgium) to evaluate OPTIMAX-BAS vascular healing patterns and thrombus formation
      with OCT at one (Study A) and six (Study B) month after stent implantation in comparison with
      SYNERGY-EES. Patients receiving BAS will receive dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) for at
      least four weeks followed by aspirin, while patients implanted with EES, will receive DAPT
      for at least 6 months followed by aspirin.

      Patients will be randomized to study A and B as follow:

      Study A: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=25) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=25). First 50 patients will be randomized
      to study A. OCT at 1 month follow up.

      Study B: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=30) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=30) Following 60 patients will be
      randomized to study B. OCT at 6 months follow up.

      Randomization is used at the time of recruitment with sealed envelopes. Patients will be
      randomized in 1:1 fashion. First 50 patients are randomized in study A and following 60
      patients in study B. Patients in study A will have OCT follow up at 1 month after index
      procedure and patients in study B will have OCT at 6 months.

      OCT analyses will be performed blinded to patient's characteristics as well as the type of
      the stent used.

      Two (2-3) investigational sites:

        -  Cardiovascular Center Aalst, Aalst, Belgium

        -  Heart Center, Satakunta Central Hospital, Pori, Finland
