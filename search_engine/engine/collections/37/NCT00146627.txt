      human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the meningoencephalitic (second, late) phase. This
      treatment is frequently complicated by fatal reactive encephalopathy, and at the same time
      resistance is beginning to appear in various countries. Eflornithine is effective and better
      tolerated, but it is more difficult to use. Nifurtimox, registered in several South American
      countries for treatment of Chagas' disease but used off label since the 1970's in series of
      cases of meningo-encephalitic HAT, is at present the only other potential alternative for the
      treatment of late-stage HAT.

      The very limited number of compounds available, the lack of prospects for the development of
      new products and the emergence of resistance are arguments for the use of therapeutic
      combinations. Ideally, drug combinations should allow for reductions in the dosages of the
      drugs used in a way that, in particular in the case of toxic drugs such as those used for
      second stage HAT, the toxicity of the combination does not exceed that of either monotherapy.
      Of the three drug combinations nowadays possible: melarsoprol-nifurtimox,
      melarsoprol-eflornithine and eflornithine-nifurtimox, the last one has (in two different
      dosing regimens) shown the least treatment-associated toxicity and mortality in the 69
      patients treated in one previous and this clinical trial to date. Good tolerability was also
      observed in a case series of 31 patients. The efficacy data to date suggest that efficacy is
      comparable to that of eflornithine and that of melarsoprol (in areas without high melarsoprol
      failure rates).
