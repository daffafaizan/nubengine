      co-treatment) or the control group (without sopmatropin treatment). Polyethylene glycol
      recombinant human somatropin will be injected weekly (3mg/per week) for approximately 6
      weeks, i.e. from the beginning of preceding menstruation cycle until the day of ovum pickup.
      Both groups will receive a similar common protocol for ovarian stimulation. In vitro
      fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection will be performed according to
      semen parameters. All embryos will undergo culture for blastocyst and the obtained
      blastocysts will be vitrified for deferred frozen embryo transfer. The Blastocyst formation
      rate will be the primary outcome measure.
