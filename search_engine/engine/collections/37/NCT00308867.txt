      Actinic keratoses occur most commonly in fair skin, especially in the elderly. They mainly
      occur in sun-exposed skin areas like head and hands. It is standard of care to remove AK when
      diagnosed, which can be achieved by either physical ablation, chemotherapeutic agents or
      photodynamic therapy (PDT). In Europe, cryosurgery is the method primarily used and will
      therefore serve as comparator therapy for PD P 506 A-PDT. A placebo control will be necessary
      to validate the test system. While the comparison of PD P 506 A-PDT and cryosurgery is an
      open comparison, placebo-PDT and PD P 506 A-PDT will be allocated in a double-blind manner.
