      safety and efficacy of CTX-4430 administered once-daily for 48 weeks for treatment of CF. A
      total of 195 pulmonary CF patients that meet all the inclusion and no exclusion criteria and
      provide written informed consent will be randomized to receive 50 mg CTX-4430, 100 mg
      CTX-4430, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Follow-up visits will be conducted approximately every
      4 weeks from Week 4 to Week 52 (4 weeks after completion of treatment).
