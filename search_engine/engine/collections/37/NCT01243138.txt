    
      This is a cross-sectional, epidemiological study. In the course of this study, 4,300 persons
      from general practice, and other non specialist clinics of selected countries of the Africa
      and Middle East region, will be evaluated for the presence of cardiovascular (CV) risk
      factors such as obesity, smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The
      degree of control of hypertension and dyslipidaemia in those previously diagnosed with these
      conditions will also be assessed. All medications used for CV risk factor control will also
      be ascertained.

      Patient evaluation will be done by physicians in charge of the selected clinics (who will be
      trained for case report forms completion) over one visit, through history taking, clinical
      examination as well as laboratory investigations. Every fifth patient seen on a particular
      day, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria would be included in the study.
