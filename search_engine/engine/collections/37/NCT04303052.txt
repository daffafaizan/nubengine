      diagnostic and interventional radiology occurs through different departments of the
      University Hospital Jena. The patients are registered for radiological treatment and checked
      again by a radiologist if a PICC-line implantation is indicated. If this is the case, the
      radiologist conducts an informed consent discussion with the patient about possible
      complications and risks during intervention and informs him also about a possible study
      participation. After signature of the written informed consent, the patient is included. He
      can, at any time, withdraw his consent. On the intervention day, the patient is randomly
      assigned to one of the two study arms through envelope (145 cm vs 70 cm). The intervention
      time is documented. After intervention, the patient is transferred back to the ward or sent
      home. The examination of the puncture site before discharge is performed by a ward physician
      or by the family doctor.

      Within 2 weeks after PICC-line implantation, the treating physician is contacted and
      questioned about possible complications (catheter occlusion, haematoma, infection of the
      puncture site, arm vein thrombosis, pain, etc.), that are then thoroughly documented.
