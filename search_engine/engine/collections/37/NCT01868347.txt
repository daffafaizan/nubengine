    
      RARP (robotic assisted radical prostatectomy) requires the induction of pneumoperitoneum and
      the trendelenburg position, causing increase in the intra-abdominal pressure and cephalic
      shift of the diaphragm, with consequent airway closure and collapse of the dependent regions
      of the lung.

      Obese subjects present an increased risk of respiratory complications, caused not only by the
      surgical procedure itself, but also by the respiratory mechanics changes associated with the
      body mass. In obese patients we can observe higher values of lung and chest wall elastance,
      with reduction in ventilation-perfusion ratio.

      The partitioning between lung and chest wall elastance can improve ventilatory setting and
      mechanics parameters of ventilation.

      In every patient we will place, after anesthesia induction, a catheter to get esophageal and
      gastric pressure that represent pleural and abdominal pressure.

      Ventilation will be conducted with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg (IBW) and a respiratory rate
      adequate to maintain a physiological level of Pa CO2.

      The preemptive strategy involves recruitment maneuver and setting of 10 cmH2O PEEP before
      induction of pneumoperitoneum and trendelenburg position in the treatment group, while the
      current procedure provides it afterwards (control group).
