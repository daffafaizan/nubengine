      evidence that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) ameliorates the
      effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and subsequent
      incidence of wheeze by 48% through 1 year of age. the investigators are currently completing
      a second RCT of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers with more robust measures of
      pulmonary outcomes. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine these 2 focused,
      interventional cohorts to allow critical longitudinal follow-up of respiratory outcomes in
      these children including the study of pulmonary function test (PFT) trajectories and
      incidence of recurrent wheeze/asthma from infancy through early adolescence in offspring of
      pregnant smokers randomized to vitamin C versus placebo.

      This will allow the investigators to study the duration of the protection vitamin C provides
      in the face of in-utero smoke, the relationship between PFTs and the development of recurrent
      wheeze and/or asthma. In addition we have preliminary data suggesting that, in parallel with
      the effects of vitamin C on the reduction of pulmonary harm, the supplementary vitamin C
      blocked the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in
      placentas, cord blood and offspring cheek cells. Thus this study will also study the
      association between the prevention of wheeze/asthma associated with maternal smoking during
      pregnancy and the prevention of epigenetic changes caused by maternal smoking during
      pregnancy. By linking the clinical outcomes of decreased wheeze/asthma and pulmonary function
      in offspring of smokers to epigenetic changes, this study has the potential to identify genes
      linked to the effects of maternal smoking on lung development and the protective effects of
      vitamin C.
