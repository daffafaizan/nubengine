      laboratory as part of an attempt to better understand these tumors and to develop more
      effective therapeutic measures.

      Malignant primary brain tumor patients at present have a life expectancy of approximately 15
      weeks following surgery unless other adjunctive measures are taken. With currently available
      adjunctive therapy the life expectancy reaches 50 weeks.

      These survival data have spurred extensive efforts to develop new treatment modalities.
      Radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been mildly helpful adjuncts but their use has
      been largely on empirical grounds or on the basis of experimentation on animal tumor models
      often quite different in nature from human brain tumors.

      Our group has sought to develop data upon which to devise new treatment strategies for
      patients with malignant brain tumors.

      The foundation of our approach rests upon the use of in vitro studies of the cell biology of
      each patient's tumor.

      It is our plan to utilize these tumors for in vitro investigation of the immunology, biology,
      biochemistry and molecular biology of brain tumors. Optimal conventional therapy will be
      given to the patients as we seek to learn more of how the scientific information obtained can
      be used to help them.
