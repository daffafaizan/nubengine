      interventional neurophysiology applications, which generate local current and modulates brain
      activity in a specific, cortico-subcortical network. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is developed as it
      is safe and well-tolerated. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) high-frequency
      rTMS treatment has been proved effective for depression by many clinical studies,as well as
      the low-frequency rTMS over the right DLPFC. In Europe, guidelines on the therapeutic use of
      rTMS was published in 2014, in which they pointed out that high-frequency rTMS over left
      DLPFC could be used as therapeutic method for dPD, with a B-level recommendation. Among
      several small and pilot studies of rTMS in PD patients, rTMS over either the motor cortex or
      DLPFC has been reported to show beneficial effects on cognitive impairment with no serious
      adverse events.However, the relative effectiveness of rTMS over left or right prefrontal, or
      both regions on both depression and cognitive impairment symptoms, has yet to be established
      in PD patients.

      The investigators propose to conduct a ten-center, blinded, sham-controlled, randomized,
      parallel-group study of fixed-dose, high-frequency and/or low-frequency rTMS in 252 PD
      patients who are experiencing depressive symptoms or cognitive impairment. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive rTMS over right and left DLPFC, both or neither active/sham rTMS.
      Subjects will receive rTMS for 45 minutes treatment over a 2-week period, all subjects will
      undergo a comprehensive assessment of mood, cognition, motor and quality of life before and
      after the last rTMS treatment, and after 2,4 and 12 weeks post-treatment. This study directly
      addresses the expansion of rTMS as an alternative treatment for depression and cognitive
      impairment in the PD population.
