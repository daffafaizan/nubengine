      among Veterans with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension using unattended polysomnography
      and auto-titrating CPAP with a targeted adherence evaluation and educational protocol
      resulted in: an improved rate of diagnosed sleep apnea, an improved rate of treated sleep
      apnea, and improved blood pressure control.
