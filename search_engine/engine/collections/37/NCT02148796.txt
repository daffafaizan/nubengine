    
      This is a five year parallel arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the prevention
      of WLRI into the third to seventh year of life (30 to 78 mo inclusive) in young children
      (6-18 months old) at increased risk for asthma. The trial will be divided into 2 periods.
      During the initial treatment period (first and second years in the study) participants will
      receive Broncho- VaxomÂ® (3.5 mg) or placebo for ten days each month for two consecutive
      years. This period will allow the observation of key secondary outcomes while participants
      are receiving therapy. The second period (third through fifth years in the study) will be a
      three year observation of the time to occurrence of the first WLRI episode (primary outcome)
      while off study drug along with the secondary outcomes noted above. During both the treatment
      and observation periods, participants will be managed by study physicians using a rescue
      algorithm applied in the PEAK trial commensurate with the NAEPP Expert Panel Report (EPR) III
      guidelines.
