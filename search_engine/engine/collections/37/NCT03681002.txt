      specialised in diabetes care and the metabolic syndrome every three month during one year.
      The nurse led a person centered dialog based on the answers from a questionnaire. At every
      visit, focus was primarily on lifestyle habits, using motivational interviewing to strengthen
      the patient's ability to modify one or more lifestyle habits. Dietary counselling was in
      accordance with the Swedish recommendation in nutrition. If the patient were in need of
      extended counseling regarding one or more lifestyle habits, he or she could be referred
      within the primary care unit to a specialist. During the 12-month period, all patients where
      offered to participate in evening group sessions at three different occasions. Topics were
      physical activity, fatty acids, healthy food, tobacco and alcohol, stress, sleep and methods
      of how to change behavior".
