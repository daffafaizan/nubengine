      that can contribute to the differences in incidence and severity of knee osteoarthritis
      observed in men and women, particularly over the age of 50. Recent studies assessing the
      responses of articular chondrocytes to systemic factors suggest that there are underlying
      differences in the biochemical and molecular characteristics of male and female cells. It is
      also known that immune responses differ in males and females, suggesting that there may be
      important differences in the levels of immune modulators in the joint tissues, including the
      synovial membrane, the synovial fluid, and the cartilage itself. Responses to the vitamin D
      metabolite 1_,25(OH)2D3 are upregulated in osteoarthritic cartilage, raising the possibility
      that males and females differ in their circulating levels of vitamin D, in the content of
      vitamin D metabolites in the synovial tissues, or in the ability of the cells to respond to
      this steroid. Similarly, in post-menopausal women, circulating estrogen is reduced relative
      to testosterone, but it is not known if this might impact the knee. Most importantly, it is
      not known if potential sex differences can be correlated with severity of disease.

      This study is based on the hypothesis that sex differences exist in different tissues of the
      knee joint, which contribute to the increased incidence and severity of knee osteoarthritis
      in older women as compared to older men.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use tissues and fluids that are normally
      discarded during the course of total knee replacement surgery to investigate potential sex
      differences.
