    
      Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, Dr. Santhi K. Ganesh and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health
      have completed a genetic association study, entitled the CardioGene Study, using 100,000 SNPs
      spanning the entire human genome in subjects with restenosis after percutaneous intervention
      using bare metallic stents (Ganesh SK, 2004). In this replication study at the Cleveland
      Clinic, we seek to collaborate to validate findings of the CardioGene Study in an independent
      cohort of patients who have undergone bare metallic stenting. This study will examine samples
      and clinical data collected of subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization who meet study
      criteria, selected from the GeneBank. In the Genebank repository, subjects are informed their
      samples may be used indefinitely for study and consent to having their data/samples shared
      with other investigators at the Cleveland Clinic or other collaborating institutions. No
      information that might identify subjects is shared with collaborating investigators and
      samples will be shared in a de-identified manner, using assigned study numbers.
