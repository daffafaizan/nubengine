      on its effectiveness in pain reduction. There are limited data on the optimal interval from
      administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy. In previous studies, time interval
      from administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy ranged between 2 hours and 24
      hours.

      Till now no studies have yet investigated the optimal timing of misoprostol administration
      prior to office hysteroscopy or operative hysteroscopy. The aim of this study was to
      determine whether misoprostol administered 12 hours before office hysteroscopy can relieve
      pain more effectively compared with misoprostol administered 3 hours before office
      hysteroscopy
