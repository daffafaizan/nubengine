      directives guiding clinical practice to date, and despite increasing evidence directing
      treatment, research remains limited and predominantly consists of case studies or case
      series. Despite the importance of postural control in voice production, the effects of
      postural alignment on speech production efficiency are either little investigated or not at
      all explored in the dysarthric population. This study determined the effectiveness of a
      single 10-min postural repositioning session on the maximum phonation duration (MPD) in
      individuals with acquired dysarthria.
