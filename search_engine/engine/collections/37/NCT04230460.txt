      but < 5 times a week) will be recruited. They will then undergo a screening visit in which
      consent is obtained, questionnaires are given, and a physical exam is administered. They will
      then be scheduled for their next 3 (or 4 if participating in the alcohol arm), which will be
      at least one week apart. At each visit, in counter-balanced manner, subjects will be
      administered 500 mg of either placebo Marijuana (trace amounts of THC), high THC marijuana
      (7.5%), or very high THC marijuana (12.5%). All marijuana will be inhaled ad libitum via a
      VolcanoÂ® Digit vaporizer. Additionally, a subset of subjects will be asked to complete a
      fourth study visit that administers alcohol in place of cannabis. As subjects complete the
      third study visit and meet criteria for the alcohol arm, they will be invited to participate
      in the fourth study visit until eighteen subjects complete the study's alcohol arm. After
      drug administration, subjects will be asked to complete a set of computerized neurocognitive
      tasks (1 hour), followed by a simulated drive (45 minutes).

      Throughout the duration of each visit, EEG will be collected. EEG is a non-invasive method of
      recording the electrical activity of the brain. Additionally, blood draws will be taken at
      pre-determined time points.

      Finally, subjects will be monitored until the drug effects have subsided sufficiently to
      ensure it is safe to transport them home. Subjects will be transported home.
