      adductor canal block to serve as the primary anesthetic and as part of a multi-modal
      post-operative analgesic plan. The use of adductor canal block is still limited to where
      trained anesthesiologists in regional anesthesia are available. There are other nonopioid
      analgesic adjuncts, such as Lidocaine, which is is widely available and is a very commonly
      used local anesthetic. A major advantage of lidocaine is that it is not associated with a
      significant side effect profile. Intravenous lidocaine which can be administered during
      surgery and/or after surgery has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects and can significantly
      decrease the reliance on opioid use for adequate pain management in abdominal and spine
      surgeries. The addition of systemic lidocaine infusion as part of a multimodal analgesia
      strategy to minimize opioid related side effects might prove to be a useful combination for
      clinicians where adductor canal blocks are not a viable option. However, the level of
      evidence comparing the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine versus adductor canal block to
      reduce postoperative opioid consumption in patients undergoing TKA is limited. We
      hypothesized that there will be no meaningful clinical difference between systemic lidocaine
      and ultrasound-guided adductor canal block in the 24-hour postoperative analgesia period.
