      (VRC07-523LS) in the sera and mucosae of healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will
      receive 10 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS at Weeks 0, 16, and 32. Participants in Group 2 will receive
      30 mg/kg of VRC07-523LS at Weeks 0, 16, and 32.

      Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 2, 16, 18, 32, 34, and 48. Visits may include physical
      examinations; blood and urine collection; rectal, cervicovaginal, and seminal secretion
      collection; cervical, rectal, and vaginal biopsy collection; HIV testing; risk reduction
      counseling; and questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Week 50 for
      follow-up safety monitoring.
