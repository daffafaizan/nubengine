    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative expanded access study. Up to 25
      patients with clinically proven paraneoplastic or primary autoimmune LEMS per EMG and
      positive voltage-gated calcium channel antibody serology, OR patients with clinically proven
      CMS per EMG, biopsy or genetic testing who meet the selection criteria outlined in sections
      3.1 and 3.2 will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will receive 3,4-DAP starting with a low
      dose and titrating up per efficacy and patient tolerance to a maximum daily dose of 100mg .
      Treatment will continue until the subject experiences a treatment-limiting toxicity,
      voluntarily withdraws consent, transfers to another site, dies, becomes lost to follow-up, is
      no longer receiving clinical benefit from 3,4-DAP (in the opinion of the subject and/or the
      investigator), or the Jacobus Pharmaceuticals or the FDA discontinues the study.
