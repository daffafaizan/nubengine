      glucose is monitored. Patients receive test meals of Sustacal on days 3 and 4 and are
      assessed for insulin response.

      Beginning on day 5, patients are given recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I
      subcutaneously every 12 hours for a total of 3 doses. The first dose (on day 5) is given 30
      minutes before a Sustacal challenge, the second dose is followed by a bedtime snack, and the
      third dose (on day 6) is followed by a supervised fast.
