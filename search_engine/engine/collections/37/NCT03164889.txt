      nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA) targeting the viral polymerase, is widely used in China as the
      first line drug in antiviral treatment for CHB patients. The sustained suppression of serum
      HBV DNA to undetectable level has been proven to be associated with the prevention of
      progression of liver disease and inhibition of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
      According to data published, a rate about 70% HBVDNA undetectable could be reached after 1
      year therapy. However, the rate of HBsAg loss is very low about 0% to 1%.
      Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF) is an important cytokine for the
      generation and propagation of antigen-presenting cells and for priming a cellular immune
      response. It increases the production of macrophage precursors and, in turn,enhances the
      T-helper cell (Th cell)-mediated cytotoxicity and regulates the tumoricidal cytokines.
      Previous studies indicated that when combined with IFN in patients with chronic HBV
      infection, it increased the therapeutic efficacy of the latter. Recent studies showed that
      GM-CSF benefit patients with acute liver failure. In this study, entecavir (ETV) plus GM-CSF
      would be used in patients with CHB compared to ETV monotherapy. Primary objective of the
      study is to see if there is significant improvement in HBsAg loss, rates of HBeAg loss and
      HBV undetectable are also to be observed. Function of NK cell from the patients enrolled will
      be measured during the therapy.
