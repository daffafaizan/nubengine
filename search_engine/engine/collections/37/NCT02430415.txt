      the lightwand intubation in patients with cervical spine instability because manual in-line
      stabilization during intubation hinders free movements of the lightwand such as advancement,
      withdrawal, and scooping in the oral cavity. For this reason, jaw thrust is often used to
      secure enough space for free movements of the lightwand in the oral cavity in the traditional
      lightwand intubation technique. A recent study showed that laryngoscope-assisted lightwand
      intubation provided more successful intubation on the first attempt and less scooping
      movement than the traditional lightwand intubation by facilitating free movements of the
      lightwand in the oral cavity in patients with cervical immobilization during intubation for
      cervical spine surgery. In the laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation technique, the
      direct laryngoscope may provide sufficient space for free movements of the lightwand in the
      oral cavity without jaw thrust, which can result in cervical spine movement. However, the
      effect of the laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation technique on cervical spine motion
      is not investigated yet.
