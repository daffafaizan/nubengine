    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial comparing vasopressin and
      catecholamines for cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) control after a traumatic brain injury
      (TBI).

      Once a neurosurgeon is consulted for a patient presenting with a TBI, they will review entry
      criteria and refer to study personnel to obtain informed consent.

      After informed consent, subjects will be randomized into one of the 2 groups to receive
      either a catecholamine at the discretion of the attending physicians or vasopressin (AVP). A
      6 hour dose of non-study drug will be permitted prior to initiation of study drug. The amount
      of study drug will be titrated to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure within normal limits.
      Subjects will be followed until they can maintain their CPP without vasopressor medication.
      Data collection will include amount and duration of vasopressor therapy and resulting
      cerebral perfusion pressure and time until successful weaning from vasopressor therapy.

      All subsequent clinical care will be at the discretion of the attending physician.

      The standard protocol/procedure for the discontinuation of drugs in each arm of the study is
      as follows: Vasopressors are discontinued in a step-wise fashion, regardless of the specific
      agent or the specific ICU patient population. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is maintained between 60 and 70 mmHg with
      vasopressors. When intracranial pressure (ICP) begins to correct (decrease), vasopressors are
      titrated downward slowly to maintain CPP. This continues until ICP is normalized and systemic
      hemodynamics are able to support a normal CPP. At this point, vasopressors are withdrawn
      completely. This process is standard regardless of the choice of vasopressor.
