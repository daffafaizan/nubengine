    
      This descriptive, cross-sectional study will survey patients with a current or previous
      diagnosis of non-metastatic solid tumor malignancy who are being seen at the Indiana
      University Simon Cancer in Indianapolis, Indiana. Patients with active, incurable disease are
      excluded. Willing and eligible patients will complete a brief, 14 question survey while seen
      in the waiting room of the women's or multi-disciplinary clinics. We aim to survey 350
      patients over a 6 month period. Patients will fill out the survey at only one point in time
      and no patient identifiers will be kept.

      The physician survey will be emailed to oncologist/hematologists practicing within IUSCC who
      see patients at least once per week. Physicians will receive a survey at only one point in
      time. The survey will be anonymous and no physician identifiers will be kept.

      Primary objective Estimate the proportion of patients with curable solid tumor malignancies
      seen at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center who are meeting exercise recommendations
      for cancer survivors (more than 150 minutes per week of moderate or 75 minutes per week of
      vigorous activity).

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assess patients' perceived barriers to exercise during cancer survivorship

        -  Assess patients' preferences for receiving exercise recommendations

        -  Assess oncologists' perceived barriers to making exercise recommendations

        -  Assess oncologists' preferences for exercise and physical activity resources that could
           be provided by the cancer center
