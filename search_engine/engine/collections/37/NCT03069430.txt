      expert provider (healthcare providers of children with SCD) and end-user (children and
      parents/caregivers) feedback on the intervention. Interview questions are designed to solicit
      information on advantages and disadvantages, perceived usefulness, and recommendations for
      improvement on the intervention. The interviews will last approximately 1 hour and are audio
      recorded. Recordings are transcribed for analysis. Data are analyzed using a
      deductive-inductive approach with the intervention as a framework for initial categories.
      Findings will inform revisions to the intervention. Feasibility testing of the revised
      intervention will be conducted in the next phase of the study.
