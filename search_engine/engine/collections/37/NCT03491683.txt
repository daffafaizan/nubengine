    
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and
      preliminary efficacy of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with cemiplimab in subjects with
      newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). INO-5401 and INO-9012 will be delivered by intramuscular
      (IM) injection followed by electroporation (EP) in combination with cemiplimab and
      chemoradiation and radiation. There will be 2 cohorts in this trial. Cohort A will be
      participants with a tumor with an unmethylated O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. Cohort B will be participants with a tumor with a MGMT
      methylated promoter or who have indeterminate MGMT status. Both cohorts will receive INO-5401
      and INO-9012 and cemiplimab at the same doses and on the same dosing schedule, and both
      cohorts will receive radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), if clinically indicated.
