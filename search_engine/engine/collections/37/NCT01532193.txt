      species included the human are normally surrounded by values which are much less than half of
      atmospheric O2, ranging from high (8.7% O2) in the rabbit oviduct, rabbit and hamster uterus,
      to as low as 11 mm Hg (1.5% O2) in the monkey uterus. Even in the preovulatory follicle,
      oocytes are bathed within follicular fluids containing oxygen that range from > 1 to 5.5 %
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact the effect of low oxygen tension after day-3
      embryo transfer in our egg donation programme on pregnancy and implantation rates.
