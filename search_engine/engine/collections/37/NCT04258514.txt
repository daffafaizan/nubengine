           improving the patient's experience during vasectomy procedure.

        2. The secondary aim is to determine if VRG reduces the level of anxiety experienced during
           vasectomy procedure.

      VR is an immersive, multisensory experience in a three-dimensional environment designed to
      replicate a real world. It has been shown in multiple studies to decrease acute and chronic
      pain in a variety of clinical settings. The mechanism is due to distraction by activating
      visual, auditory and proprioceptive senses. One example of this is a report by G Pooja et al
      where in VR goggles reduced pain and medication use during orthopedic procedures (1). Another
      study found decrease in pain in medically treated patients (n=50 patients in 2 groups) after
      a 15 minute VR viewing on pain reduction compared to 2 -D viewing (2).
