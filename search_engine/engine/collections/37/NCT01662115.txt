      accelerate recovery of bowel function. Eligible patients include all patients undergoing
      segmental small bowel or large bowel resection with a planned primary anastomosis, planned
      removal of the nasogastric tube at the end of the surgery, and administration of clear
      liquids on post-operative day one. Patients who have an ileostomy or colostomy created will
      be excluded. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of three groups:
      nicotine gum, regular gum, or no gum. Patients randomized to nicotine gum or regular gum will
      chew the gum three times a day for 1 week. The main outcome measure is time to first bowel
      movement or flatus.
