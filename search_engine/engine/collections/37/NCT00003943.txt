      overall survival in patients with metastatic small cell cancer treated with high dose
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and topotecan with peripheral blood stem cell support. II. Assess
      the safety of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel IV over 24
      hours on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing
      through the day prior to the last collection day. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      collected over 3-5 days. Beginning approximately 21 days following mobilization, patients
      receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1, immediately followed by carboplatin IV over 2
      hours and topotecan IV over 24 hours on day 2, then G-CSF subcutaneously beginning on day 4
      and continuing until blood counts recover. PBSC are reinfused on day 5. Patients receive 1/3
      of PBSC with each course. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at week 8 after treatment, then every 3 months
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
