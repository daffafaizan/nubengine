    
      The present study (CL3-95008-002) will be performed in children from 2 to less than 7 years
      old presenting with ASD. A 6-month double-blind treatment period will be performed in which
      efficacy and safety of bumetanide 0.5mg BID will be assessed versus placebo. This
      double-blind period will be followed by a 6-month open label treatment period of bumetanide
      0.5mg BID in which long term safety will be evaluated.
