    
      This is an open label, phase II, multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI (plus trastuzumab for HER2-positive tumors) as
      first-line therapy for participants with advanced Esophageal and Gastric Adenocarcinoma
      (EGA). Participants in Cohort 1 will receive 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Participants in
      Cohort 2 will receive trastuzumab in addition to 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Chemotherapy
      doses will be the same for both cohorts and will follow the same dose modifications for
      toxicities. Nal-IRI will be administered first. 5-FU and Oxaliplatin and trastuzumab will be
      administered after nal-IRA as per institutional standards when similar regimens (such as
      FOLFIRINOX) are administered.

      Cohort 1 (HER2-negative tumors): Initially, 13 evaluable participants will be accrued to
      Cohort 1. If at most 5 objective responses are observed among the 13 subjects, then the study
      will be terminated early due to an unacceptably low response rate. Otherwise, an additional
      15 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the second stage for a total of 28 evaluable
      subjects.

      Cohort 2 (HER2-positive tumors): A total of 6 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of the proposed 5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and liposomal Irinotecan
      combination in HER2-positive subjects.
