      improvements; however, these improvements are usually short-lived, lasting less than one hour
      before the patient's performance returns to baseline. It has been suggested that repeated
      stimulation sessions are required to elicit long-lasting improvements. We aim to consider
      these details over the duration of this research, during which patients with chronic stroke
      will attend for 16 sessions over the course of 3 months.

      This research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has
      the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a
      clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to
      acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are
      of practical and scientific interest.
