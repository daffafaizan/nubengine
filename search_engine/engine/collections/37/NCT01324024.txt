      frequent complaint for which menopausal women seek clinical intervention. Many of the
      cognitive complaints detected in menopausal women including, short-term memory, organization
      of tasks, sustaining focus and concentration, and regulating emotions, overlap with symptoms
      frequently reported by adults with ADHD. These impairments are reported by many women who
      have no previous history of ADHD, and appear to be linked to reduced estrogen levels
      occurring in menopause.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study testing whether LDX, a stimulant
      medication, would be effective in alleviating midlife onset impairments of attention and
      working memory among menopausal women. There will be 3 days in which subjects will undergo a
      brief cognitive testing assessment; the first testing period will occur at baseline prior to
      beginning LDX or placebo treatment (PT) in trial A; the second testing period will occur
      following 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT; and the final testing period will take place
      after another 4 weeks of double blind LDX or PT in Trial B. Each cognitive test period will
      involve 2 separate cognitive testing batteries that will take approximately 120 minutes total
      to complete.
