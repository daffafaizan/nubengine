      behaviorally and physiologically mimic delirium in the ICU, there is concern that sleep
      deprived ICU patients are at risk for the increased mortality, longer hospital stays and
      worsened physical and mental outcomes of hospitalized patients who experience delirium during
      their admission. Furthermore, lack of sleep has been associated with decrements in FEV1, FVC
      and maximal inspiratory pressure in non-ICU COPD patients, increases in respiratory muscle
      fatigue in healthy volunteers and blunted response to hypercapnea in healthy volunteers.
      Finally, theoretical concerns exist regarding sleep loss putting patients at risk for
      prolonged bedrest, adverse cardiovascular events, derangement of metabolism and endocrine
      function as well as immune suppression; though supported by animal models and brief studies
      in healthy volunteers, no ICU data exists.
