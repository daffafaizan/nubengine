    
      70 eligible subjects will be asked to undergo contrast-enhanced MRI studies of the breast
      containing the lesion. Subjects will be asked to fast for 6 hours prior to the imaging
      session. Each subject will be tested for glucose, and if the glucose is not too high, the
      subject will be injected with a dose of radioactive sugar (fluoro-deoxyglucose) which has
      been shown in other studies to accumulate in breast cancers. The subject will be asked to sit
      quietly for 30 minutes and to empty the bladder. The subject will then be asked to be
      re-examined in the MRI scanner with MRI contrast injection. The examination bed will be moved
      out of the MRI scanner and detectors of the radioactive sugar will be placed near the breast
      in order to obtain a positron emission mammogram for a 10-minute period. The subject will
      then leave the MRI suite.
