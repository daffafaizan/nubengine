      treatments are slow to act and possess only limited efficacy. In this context, the discovery
      that the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine is rapidly antidepressant (onset of
      action within hours) -- even in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD)
      -- has ignited tremendous enthusiasm among clinicians, scientists and patients alike. A
      critical obstacle to the translation of this discovery into a novel treatment, however, is
      the limited duration of action following a course of ketamine (e.g. 1-2 weeks). The current
      project will address this important gap in medical knowledge by testing a rational
      neuropharmacological strategy designed to optimize and sustain the rapid antidepressant
      effects of ketamine. Driven by the recent characterization of the molecular mechanisms
      underpinning the antidepressant and neuroplasticity effects of ketamine, we will test the
      combination of ketamine plus lithium in patients with TRD using a randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled design. The primary aims of the project are (1) to test the efficacy of
      lithium-plus-ketamine compared to placebo-plus-ketamine as an antidepressant combination
      strategy in TRD and (2) to gather data on the safety and tolerability of the
      lithium-plus-ketamine.
