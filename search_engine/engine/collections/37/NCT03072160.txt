    
      Background:

        -  Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) therapies
           have had clinical success in a minority of unselected patients across multiple tumor
           types

        -  While many questions remain about optimal PD1/PDL1 staining techniques to pre-select
           responders, less focus is being place on how to optimize responses in a broader cohort
           of patients

        -  Emerging preclinical and clinical data supports the hypothesis that a strong immunologic
           response in the tumor microenvironment induces PDL1 expression on the tumor and is
           associated with better clinical response to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapies

        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines are one strategy to induce an immunologic response to the
           tumor, thereby enhancing PDL1 expression and optimizing clinical responses across all
           patients

        -  Limited clinical data exists about the potential benefit of sequential therapy with a
           therapeutic cancer vaccine followed by PD1/PDL1 inhibition

        -  This study will explore the role of PD1 inhibition in medullary thyroid cancer and
           evaluate the potential differences based on previous vaccine therapy

      Objective:

      -The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether administering a PD1 inhibitor to
      patients with medullary thyroid cancer will permit a modest fraction to be able to experience
      a 50% or greater decline in calcitonin levels or experience a partial/complete response on
      imaging

      Key Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with evidence of metastatic medullary
           thyroid cancer including disease that is evaluable on bone, computed tomography (CT)
           scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

        -  Must have elevated calcitonin levels greater than 40 pg/mL

        -  Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include
           those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require
           regularly schedule narcotics)

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1

        -  Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious
           inter-current medical illness

        -  No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, open label, single center clinical trial where all patients receive
           the anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy pembrolizumab

        -  Patients will enroll in one of two cohorts: patients with previous vaccine therapy or
           patients without previous vaccine therapy

        -  All patients will be TKI naive with minimal symptoms (consistent with the eligibility
           for our current study)

        -  Based on our calcitonin findings with our current study of 30 patients, we have
           determined that a confirmed calcitonin decline of 50% would be a rare finding, providing
           compelling preliminary evidence of clinical activity

        -  A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the proposed study (15 patients in each
           cohort). Given that we already have 30 patients on a study with vaccine, we would only
           need to identify and recruit 15 patients for the vaccine-naive cohort.

        -  Based on these metrics, we could have >6 months of calcitonin data in 30 patients within
           2 years from trial initiation

        -  Additional immune correlative capitalizing on the extensive immune monitoring experience
           of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) will allow for assessments of
           antigen specific T-cells and 123 immune subsets. These findings could provide the basis
           for biomarker development when taken together with biochemical and clinical responses
           seen in this study
