      their stage of skeletal maturation: pre-pubertal group (18 patients, mean age 9.15± 1.5
      years) and post-pubertal group (18 patients, mean age 16.3 ± 1.0 years). All patients were
      treated with metallic splint supported Herbst IV appliance.

      Pretreatment and post-Herbst IV treatment cone beam CT(CBCT) scans were obtained for both
      groups. Dentoskeletal and TMJ measurements made on the CBCT scans were analysed.
