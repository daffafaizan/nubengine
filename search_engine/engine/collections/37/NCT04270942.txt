      receive a 12-day course of teplizumab given through daily IV infusion and will be followed
      for 78 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of teplizumab treatment,
      administered intravenously (IV) to participants in the NIH-sponsored trial who have developed
      type 1 diabetes and are able to start teplizumab treatment within 1 year of diagnosis of type
      1 diabetes. Whether teplizumab treatment reduces the loss of insulin-producing pancreatic
      beta cells will also be evaluated.
