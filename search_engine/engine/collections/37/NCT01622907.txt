      procedure so that it can now be used for routine treatment of AF in patients undergoing
      open-heart surgery, as well as in a stand-alone arrhythmia procedure. A minimally invasive,
      thoracoscopic surgical treatment of AF is able to address both the triggers for AF by
      pulmonary vein isolation and the left posterior atrial wall exclusion, which after the
      pulmonary veins is the next most important atrial substrate in the promotion of AF.

      New hybrid procedures attempt to combine the success rate and the minimally invasive nature
      of thoracoscopic mini-Maze with the effectiveness and short recovery times associated with
      catheter ablation. The key is blocking signals that cause the arrhythmia from both outside
      (epicardial) and inside (endocardial) the heart.

      Suboptimal results of both catheter ablation and surgery suggest that success in the
      treatment of long standing persistent AF and persistent lone AF will benefit from a close
      collaboration between the cardiothoracic surgeon and the electrophysiologist, to offer
      patients the best available combination of treatments for any given set of cardiovascular
      lesions.

      Hybrid treatment for AF is being increasingly adopted in Europe and the United States and has
      been assessed for the treatment of AF at the Coordinating Center (Brescia, Italy) with
      promising results.
