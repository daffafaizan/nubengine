      tolerability (irritation) of EMSAM in two populations consisting of non-elderly (18 - 64
      years) and elderly (65 years and older) healthy volunteers. EMSAM will be dosed over the
      range of proposed sizes for marketing [(6mg/24hr), (9mg/24hr), and (12mg/24hr)]. Adhesion and
      tolerability (irritation) will be examined at three different application site areas (upper
      torso [includes chest and back], upper arm, and upper thigh).

      The secondary objective is to examine if the adhesion characteristics and dermal tolerability
      (irritation) of EMSAM may be influenced by the secondary factors such as gender, race,
      physical activity, and bathing/showering practices.
