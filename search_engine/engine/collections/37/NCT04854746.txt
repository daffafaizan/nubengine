    
      A Phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the
      safety and immunogenicity of an adenoviral-vector based oral norovirus vaccine expressing
      GI.1 VP1 administered orally to healthy older adult volunteers 55-80 years of age. The study
      is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 2 dose levels
      of vaccine with a 2-dose vaccination schedule (4 weeks apart) in healthy older adults (55 to
      80 years old).

      Subjects will we randomized in the study utilizing an age and dose escalation schedule. A
      Safety Monitoring Committee will provide oversight of the trial throughout the duration of
      the study.
