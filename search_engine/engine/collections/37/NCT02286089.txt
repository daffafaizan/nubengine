    
      OpRegen® is a cell-based product composed of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, derived
      from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and administered as a cell suspension either in
      ophthalmic Balanced Salt Solution Plus (BSS Plus) or in CryoStor® 5 (Thaw-and-Inject, TAI).

      This is a Phase I/IIa, dose-escalation, evaluating safety and tolerability of OpRegen
      transplantation to patients with progressive dry-AMD. The study includes also initial
      exploration of efficacy.

      A total of approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled. The subjects should be 50 years of age
      and older, with non-neovascular (dry) AMD, who have funduscopic findings of GA in the macula,
      with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders.

      The subjects will be divided into four cohorts, according to their best corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA) and administered OpRegen dose.
