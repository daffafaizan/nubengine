      surgical patient stratification using the SAMPE Risk Model, pioneering the creation of a
      multidisciplinary care pathway that involves nursing and medical teams, and can be
      consolidated as a future standard of assistance. The care bundle, using an objective risk
      communication tool, is expected to integrate the teams involved in the perioperative care,
      reducing the fragmentation of care and, consequently, postoperative complications. The study
      is designed to use historical controls (before and after) and is therefore inherently
      vulnerable to the biases of this design. It will be conducted in a single teaching hospital
      and referral centre that provides care to patients from across southern Brazil through the
      national unified health system centre, which can therefore limit its external validity.
