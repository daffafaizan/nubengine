    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the potential of 18F-fluoromisonidazole ([18F] FMISO) as a non-invasive indicator
      of tissue hypoxia to provide tumor-imaging data that correlates with tissue markers of
      hypoxia in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or
      without radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test [18F] FMISO tumor uptake as an independent predictor of patient outcome and if it
      provides additional predictive power over fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan.

      II. Test [18F] FMISO tumor uptake as a predictor of response in the subgroup of patients
      treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

      III. Test the reproducibility of [18F] FMISO uptake in tumors by imaging the same patients on
      sequential days in a test-retest protocol.

      IV. Determine the relationship between hypoxia-related biomarkers (HIF1-a and VEGF),
      proliferation biomarkers (microvascular density, p53, and Ki-67), and regional [18F] FMISO
      uptake in tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 [18F] FDG and 18F-fluoromisonidazole ([18F] FMISO)
      positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (without
      or without radiotherapy) and after completion of 4 courses of neoadjuvant therapy.

      NOTE: Some patients may undergo repeat [18F] FMISO PET/CT scan within 48 hours after the
      first [18F] FMISO scan to evaluate the variability (test-retest) of this imaging measurement.

      Blood samples are collected after completion of [18F] FMISO and [18F] FDG PET/CT scans for
      laboratory biomarker studies by IHC assays. Tumor samples from biopsy or surgery are also
      collected for biomarker studies.

      After completion of study procedures, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
