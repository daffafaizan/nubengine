    
      This is a phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose escalating clinical and pharmacokinetic
      study of PM01183 for patients with advanced solid tumors to identify the dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD)
      of PM01183 administered every three weeks intravenously (i.v.) over one hour to patients with
      advanced solid tumors and to preliminarily determine the pharmacokinetics of PM01183, to
      evaluate the antitumor activity of PM01183 and the safety and tolerability of PM01183.
      Besides this study will evaluate the pharmacogenomics in tumor samples and peripheral white
      blood cells (PWBCs) of patients exposed to PM01183 at the RD in order to assess potential
      markers of response and/or resistance.
