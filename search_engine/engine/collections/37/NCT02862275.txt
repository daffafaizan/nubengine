    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration in patients who have
      received adoptive cell transfer (ACT) prior to enrollment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the expansion of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab administration in
      the peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment.

      II. To evaluate the phenotype and function of engrafted T cells following atezolizumab
      administration.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To evaluate the response rate using
      immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1, or other tumor-specific criteria.

      V. To evaluate survival outcomes and progression free survival using irRC and RECIST v1.1, or
      other tumor-specific criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30- 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for a total of 17 doses over up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
