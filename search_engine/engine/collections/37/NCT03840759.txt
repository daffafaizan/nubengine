      admission list every morning if they met the inclusion criteria. Then, the detail of the
      research was explained to the patients and families. They were allowed to choose to be in the
      control group or the intervention group. After the participants and or family agreed,
      informed consent was signed. For those who were cognitively impaired or suffered from
      dementia, informed consent was signed by their relative or partner. For the intervention
      group, a geriatric physician was consulted and recommendations were made by the geriatric
      consultant after a complete CGA. The CGA includes the assessment of depression, dementia,
      physical performance of Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and nutrition using Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDC-15), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Barthel Index (BI), and Mini
      Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNAÂ®-SF) respectively. Besides the geriatric physician,
      our multidisciplinary team included a social worker, nutritionist and physical therapist. In
      the control group, the participants only received routine hospital care and no geriatric
      physician was consulted. The case manager nurse filed the participant's baseline data and
      clinical problems. After discharge, the participant's condition was assessed via telephone in
      the first, third and six months after discharge.
