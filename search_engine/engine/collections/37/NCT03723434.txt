      In Experiment A, healthy participants without disorders or medications influencing brain
      function (N=24) will be recruited. A range of negative and positive asynchronies (from minus
      50 to + 50 ms) will be tested. To allow comparison with prior studies that used MEPs as
      outcome measures, in 12 participants the primary motor cortex in the left and right
      hemisphere will be targeted. In another 12 participants, two cortical areas within the same
      hemisphere will be stimulated.

      In Experiment B, participants with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or multiple
      sclerosis (MS) (total maximum N across all such participants is 52) will be recruited. These
      participants are required to have one or more subcortical white matter lesions, which would
      be expected to result in cortico-cortical disconnections. Here, the investigators will only
      test PAS with positive asynchronies, with the goal of testing if the findings observed in
      healthy participants are similar in participants with white matter lesions. It will also be
      examined if the PAS-induced connectivity changes persist beyond the stimulation sessions if
      PAS is given repeatedly over several days. PAS will be applied to two cortical targets that
      have been disconnected from each other. The rationale for including more than one disorder in
      Experiment B is that the disconnections are in all cases caused by white matter lesions and
      the results may therefore be similar. To detect possible differences between disorders, the
      data from the three groups will also be analyzed separately.
