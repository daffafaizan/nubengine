      gender, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI, omeprazole), on the human gut microbiome. PPIs are
      commonly used for the treatment of acid-related disorders. The investigators hypothesize that
      PPI therapy might perturb microbial communities and alter the gut microbiome.

      Methods: Healthy subjects of Chinese (n=12), Malay (n=12) and Indian (n=10) ancestry, aged
      21-37 years old, were enrolled. They were required to provide a baseline stool sample (Day 1)
      and were then given a course of omeprazole at therapeutic dose (20 mg daily) for a duration
      of 7 days. Stool samples were collected again on Day 7 and Day 14 (one week after stopping
      omeprazole). Microbial DNA was extracted from the stool samples. This was followed by PCR,
      library construction, 16S rRNA sequencing using Illumina MiSEQ, and statistical and
      bioinformatics analyses.
