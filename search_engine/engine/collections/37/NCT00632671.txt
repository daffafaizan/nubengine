    
      The objective of this observational study is the follow-up of a cohort of 500 adult persons
      with morbid obesity (BMI>35 kg/m2).

      Clinical and paraclinical data, and biological samples (plasma, serum, DNA, RNA, cell blood,
      for persons undergoing bariatric surgery (specific consent): samples of liver and adipocytes)
      will be collected and stored during the follow-up visits. These visits take place at
      inclusion, at 6 months, twelve months and every year for ten years. The collection of
      parental DNA will be proposed when feasable for genetic studies.

      Persons will be recruited for four years, with an expected number of 350 persons included, in
      the clinical research unit of Louis MOURIER university hospital (AP-HP).

      Each person included will participate in the study for ten years. When included, patients
      agree to come every year to follow-up visits. They are informed that data collected will be
      used only for research on obesity and its health consequences.
