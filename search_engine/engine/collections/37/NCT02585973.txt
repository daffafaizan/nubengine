      dose (MTD) using a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design of the WEE-1 inhibitor AZD1775 when
      added to standard of care chemotherapy (cisplatin) and radiation for the treatment of locally
      advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC). The first cohort will include a
      starting dose of 50 mg AZD1775 given twice daily (BID) for three consecutive days (M-W)
      concomitantly with standard of care cisplatin and radiation. AZD1775 doses will be escalated
      in 50 mg increments up to 200 mg BID (M-W) in subsequent cohorts to determine the MTD.

      Up to 24 patients will be enrolled, depending on the rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
      The investigators plan to characterize the toxicity (and safety) profile of this regimen.
      Secondary objectives include determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; based on
      safety and other data considerations), objective response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks and
      progression free survival (PFS). the investigators will also estimate overall survival (OS)
      if the effective sample size allows. The investigators hypothesize that the investigators'
      proposed regimen is safe, and will yield an improved ORR and PFS over historical controls.
      Correlative studies will be performed on archival tissue, and on optional fresh biopsies
      performed at baseline and mid-treatment. The investigators will explore associations between
      p53 mutational status at baseline as well as changes in checkpoint markers, with ORR, PFS and
      OS. Finally, the investigators plan to describe possible changes in QOL, speech and
      swallowing.
