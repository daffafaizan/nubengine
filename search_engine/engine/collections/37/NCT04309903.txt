      exercise program on hemophilia functional independence level, joint health, kinesiophobia,
      functional level, range of motion, muscle strength and pain level in hemophilic individuals
      with lower extremity joint arthropathy. Hemophilic arthropathy was developed in at least one
      of the lower extremity joints and aged between 18-30 years 17 severe type hemophilic men were
      participated in the study. The participants were divided into two groups as Home Exercise
      Group (HEG) and Manual Therapy Group (MTG) by randomization method. While the HEG was
      performed the exercise program at home, in addition to the same HEG manual therapy were
      applied to the MTG by the same physiotherapist 3 days a week for 1 hour. Both groups were
      followed for a total of 5 weeks and pre-treatment evaluations were repeated post-treatment.
      The joint health of the hemophilics in both groups were evaluated with Hemophilia Joint
      Health Score (HJHS), their kinesiophobia level were evaluated with Tampa Kinesophobia Scale,
      their functionality with the Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH). In addition,
      Functional Reach, Timed Up and Go and 5 Times Sit-to- Stand tests were used for functional
      level. The range of motion was evaluated with a goniometer, muscle strength was measured with
      a digital dynamometer and pain level was assessed with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Number
      of hemarthrosis decreased in both groups.
