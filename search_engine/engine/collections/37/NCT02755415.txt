      cause of long-term physical and psychological disabilities in our society. Array of reasons
      have been suggested to be an obstacle for stroke patients to receive adequate physical
      rehabilitation, including the lack of physical capacity, severe neurological deficits or the
      loss of strength. Given the critical importance of high-intensity and high-repetitiveness of
      early rehabilitation for stroke patients in achieving sustainable long term outcomes,
      robot-assisted gait rehabilitation devices have gained great interest in the last decade and
      is slowly becoming part of the clinical rehabilitation program for stroke patients. However,
      despite the growing interest and the significant resources invested for the development of
      robot-assisted rehabilitation devices, there still lacks empirical evidence of its clinical
      applicability for stroke patients. Moreover, available evidence to date have mostly focused
      on sub-acute and chronic stroke patients and investigation in acute stroke population,
      especially in those with complete incapacitation for ambulation, is sparse. It is therefore
      the aim of the proposed project to fulfil this significant gap in our clinical knowledge by
      comparatively investigate the clinical applicability of a recently developed HIWIN Robotic
      Gait Training System (MRG-P100) against the traditional rehabilitation program with an
      emphasis on the determination of psychological and functional capacity recovery status in
      acute stroke survivors.
