      factors.

        1. Oscillation at proper frequency.

        2. Lung volume and airway opening.

        3. Expiratory flow rate or expiratory bias.

        4. Humidifying of inspired air.

      Multifunctional breathing device, the BreatheMAX, is the only breathing device made in
      Thailand. The BreatheMAX device possess many properties or techniques that benefit for
      respiratory care particularly 3 in 4 mechanisms for secretion clearance. The unique important
      aspect is the simultaneously providing several beneficial effects in one breath which are 1)
      Oscillation in the range of ciliary beat frequency 2) Biofeedback of respiratory effort that
      could encourage the deeper breathing performance, 3) Humidifier of inspired air, 4) Loaded
      breathing for inspiratory muscle training and generate PEP. These 4 functions would be very
      useful for increase secretion clearance particularly in more peripheral airway which are the
      most difficult to be cleared and be a risk of atelectasis and infection in patients with MV
      whose natural secretion clearance mechanisms are compromised, respiratory muscle weakness
      weak and low immunity.

      Therefore, the combination of inspiratory and expiratory breathing exercise through the
      BreatheMAX breathing device may increase or promote more secretion clearance and improve lung
      function than expiratory breathing exercise alone in intubated patients, both with and
      without mechanical ventilation dependence
