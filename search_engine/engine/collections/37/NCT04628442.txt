    
      This is a cross-sectional study of up to 100 participants who are undergoing clinically
      indicated sinus procedures to treat chronic rhinosinusitis. 50 participants with CRSwNP and
      50 participants with CRS without polyps and no features of atopy will be enrolled in the
      study. Participants will donate leftover sino-nasal secretions and tissue from their
      procedures. In addition, participants will be subject to medical record review and research
      questionnaires.

      In many instances, these participants will have multiple procedures over time to treat
      recurrent disease and this study will allow for them to donate leftover biospecimens as many
      as 9 times.

      Participants may also opt to undergo a turbinate mucosal tissue biopsy during regularly
      scheduled sinus surgery for additional tissue analysis and/or undergo a more detailed,
      complete characterization visit performed in the UCSF Airway Center Research Center (ACRC).
      During the complete characterization, participants will undergo lung function tests, sputum
      induction and blood collection, in addition to the procedures mentioned above.
