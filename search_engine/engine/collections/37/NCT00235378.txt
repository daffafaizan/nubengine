      patients with SLE may provide clues about SLE's pathogenesis. This study will compare genes
      from SLE patients, their unaffected family members, and control participants. Travel to the
      study site is not required.

      In this study, blood samples will be collected from people diagnosed with SLE, their
      unaffected family members, and condition-matched controls. Participants will be asked
      questions about their health and will provide a small blood sample. Participants will also be
      asked to provide written permission for release of medical information, so that their disease
      status can be verified through medical record review or through consultation with their
      doctors. Study personnel may contact participants in the future for follow-up questions and
      additional blood draws, if the participant agrees.
