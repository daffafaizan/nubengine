      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Patients 18-70 year old with the levels of ALT and AST
      greater than 1.5 and less than 10 times normal level, and ultrasound evidence confirm fatty
      liver disease include in study. Patients with alcohol consumption, other liver disease and
      taking medications that cause liver injury, exclude. Base on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, 50 patients select and then randomize into intervention and control groups. Control
      group, in addition to diet and exercise recommendations take placebo capsules for 3 months.
      Intervention group, in addition to diet and exercise recommendations, use capsules containing
      hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek 1g/d for 3 months. At baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after
      intervention, the investigators measure FBS, insulin, insulin resistance, Albumin, Aspartate
      transaminase, Alanine Aminotransferase, Alkaline phosphatase, Total bilirubin, Direct
      bilirubin, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, TG, High sensitivity C reactive protein and
      Creatinine. At baseline and 12 weeks after intervention fibroscan perform to evaluate the
      amount of fat in liver. In order to decrease bias, patient, physician who performs fibroscan
      and the person analyzing the data are blind to group drugs.
