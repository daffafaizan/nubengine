      minority populations at a younger age. Identification of risk factors, including traditional
      risk factors such as increased BMI, lack of exercise, increased glucose in the diet, higher
      blood pressure and lipids, along with other factors such as chronic stress, use of alcohol or
      other drugs has not previously been done with minority youth. If risk factors can be
      identified, more strategies for prevention of diabetes can be developed that specifically
      target this population. This study will enroll 300 Native American Youth over a 4 year period
      and perform body measurements including height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure
      and lab values including a 2hour glucose tolerance test, fasting lipids, and a urine albumin
      creatinine ratio test. In addition, subjects will be asked to identify behavior and feelings
      of stress in everyday lives. Subjects who are determined to be at increased risk of
      developing diabetes will be asked to repeat the tests in one year. The results will be
      reported to the tribal council to help determine prevention strategies.
