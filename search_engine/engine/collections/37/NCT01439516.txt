      dialysis facilities in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment
      to pursue LD/LRT. Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1)
      informational intervention alone (PREPARED education), 2) informational intervention plus
      living donor financial assistance program (PREPARED plus financial assistance), and 3) no
      intervention (Usual Care). The investigators will follow participants for up to 6 months for
      progression in their commitment to LD/LRT.
