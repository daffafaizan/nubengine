      at least 3 months, with stable renal function, will be recruited to a randomized open-label
      trial. Patients taking pentoxifylline or not will be compared for their spot urinary
      proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration, spot urine tumor necrosis factor-Î±/creatinine
      ratio, spot urine monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1/creatinine, and aldosterone
      concentration between groups in a 2-year study. Add-on pentoxifylline in control group in the
      same dose as in treat group will be performed to observe the renoprotective effect if any
      protective potential is demonstrated in the end of maintenance 12 months.
