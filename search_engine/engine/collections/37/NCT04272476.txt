      suicide and recurrence rate and become the hot and difficult topics in the medical study.
      Given the unsatisfactory response rates of many FDA-approved antidepressants, acupuncture is
      increasingly considered an important alternative therapy. A large number of clinical trials
      have confirmed that acupuncture is a generally safe, effective, and well-tolerated therapy
      for depression, but for MDD, the acupuncture clinical trials were only reported out of China.
      According to the clinical symptoms in patients with MDD, the chief TCM patterns are liver qi
      constraint and heart yang insufficiency, and the secondary TCM patterns are blood stasis, qi
      and blood deficiency. So we propose to combine acupuncture with moxibustion and select Baihui
      (DU20), shenting(DU24), Neiguan (PC6), Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LV3), Zusanli(ST36), Zhongwan
      (RN 12) and Gaunyuan (RN4) to Soothe the Liver, regulating the heart, warm the yang qi, boost
      qi and invigorate blood for MDD. We hypothesize that the acupuncture's antidepressant effect
      is based on the neural network reconstructing mechanism through studying the cerebral cortex
      function, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, Neurons electrophysiological change. We will
      employ multi-disciplinary methods in neuropsychology, neuroimaging, computer science, and
      electrophysiology to explore the important mechanism underlying acupuncture and moxibustion
      treating MDD.
