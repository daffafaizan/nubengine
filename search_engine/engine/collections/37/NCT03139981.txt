      people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling and skin biopsies.
      Subjects will also be assessed for improvement in their atopic dermatitis. There will be a
      screening period (up to 30 days) and a treatment period for 4 weeks with a 14 day follow up
      with an end-of-study visit.
