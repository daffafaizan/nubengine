    
      This is a non-randomized (single-arm), open-label, multi-center, single-agent, Phase II study
      of vinflunine as second- or third-line treatment of subjects with HRPC. The primary objective
      of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of vinflunine in the salvage treatment, as measured
      by Protein-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate endpoint.

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

      To evaluate the efficacy (as measured by the PSA response rate) of IV vinflunine administered
      q3w in HRPC patients who have progressed after one or two previous chemotherapy regimens.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of IV vinflunine administered q3w in HRPC patients who have
           previously received chemotherapy (one or two regimens), as measured by:

             -  Time to PSA progression

             -  Overall survival

             -  Palliative response in patients with an Analgesic Score (AS) â‰¥10 and stable
                baseline pain

             -  Health-Related Quality of Life

        -  To assess the efficacy (as measured by the PSA response rate) of IV vinflunine in HRPC
           patients based on their response to prior chemotherapy

        -  Chemotherapy responsive - previous response to most recent chemotherapy regimen lasting
           >2 months after completion.

        -  Chemotherapy refractory - failure to respond to, or progression during or within three
           months of completing last chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the response rate to IV vinflunine in the subset of patients with measurable
           disease, as measured by traditional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) criteria (Therasse et al. 2000).

        -  To evaluate the safety of IV vinflunine administered every three weeks in HRPC patients
           who have previously received chemotherapy.
