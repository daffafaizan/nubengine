      different methods of prevention will be tested and participants will be allocated at random
      to one of these methods. The investigators hope to learn how families influence each others
      eating habits.

      Participants in this study will attend a series of five classes, once a week for five weeks,
      on the topic of child feeding. The aim of the classes is to learn how to feed your child so
      as to prevent future eating and weight problems. The research component includes filling out
      some surveys before classes begin and at the end of the last class. Classes are small and
      interactive so that parents have a chance to voice concerns and get feedback.
