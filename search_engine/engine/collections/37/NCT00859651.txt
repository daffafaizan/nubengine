      Before beginning the intervention, the participants will have a general physical exam
      including a clinical breast exam and anthropometric measures, a morning blood draw (for
      analysis of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF)-I, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), estradiol, estrone,
      testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months)
      and a bilateral mammogram (at baseline and 12 months). Participants will also complete a
      baseline questionnaire, collecting data on demographic information and breast cancer risk
      factors. In addition, we will be collecting data on vitamin D sources from diet and sunlight
      exposure using a validated questionnaire administered at baseline and 12 months.

      For follow-up visits, the participant will be seen at the study site at months 3, 6, 9, and
      12. During these visits, drug will be dispensed, adherence ascertained, and adverse events
      will also be assessed. In addition, blood (serum calcium, albumin, creatinine) and urine
      (urine calcium, creatinine) will be collected to monitor for toxicity. A 24-hour urine
      collection will be conducted at baseline and 12 months to assess for hypercalciuria. After
      the 1 year intervention, all participants will have a complete physical exam including
      clinical breast exam, a bilateral mammogram, blood draw, and complete a follow-up
      questionnaire.
