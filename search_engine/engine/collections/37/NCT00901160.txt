      enrolled in this study as a pilot, to determine the feasibility for a larger study. A simple
      blood test for clotting function will be done after surgery. Patients will be assessed daily
      during their hospital stay to determine if they have any clotting or bleeding complications.
      For analysis, groups will be divided into normal and increased or decreased ability to make a
      blood clot based on the TEG® and PMA™ test done. Complications will be recorded for each
      group and analyzed to determine if there is any difference between groups.
