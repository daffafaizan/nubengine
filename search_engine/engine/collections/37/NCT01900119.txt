      bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm and occupy
      specific niches in this complex oral environment. Understanding the oral environment and the
      microbiota that inhabit it will assist in determining their impact on health and disease.
      There are several studies in critically ill patients demonstrating changes in oral bacteria
      related to acute illness. Identification of respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led
      researchers to hypothesize that a relationship exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary
      infections. This descriptive study will characterize the oral microbiota of patients who have
      severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients will be followed for 1 year after treatment for
      development of respiratory symptoms that require intubation. A difference in the oral
      microbiome will be identified in specimens collected before and after treatment.
