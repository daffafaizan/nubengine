      A sample of adolescent students (from 9th to 12th grade) is being online-recruited, through
      social media and contacts with Executive Boards of Portuguese secondary schools, private
      practices and study centers, advertising the study.

      Parents/legal guardians are encouraged to contact the team. From this approach, parents/legal
      guardians and respective adolescents who demonstrate interest are explained the aims and
      procedures of the study and asked to sign a written consent form.

      Adolescents are then assessed for eligibility through a test anxiety self-report measure and
      a clinical interview.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group, who will
      reveive the intervention (facilitated by licenced psychotherapists with training in
      contextual therapies and are familiar with the intervention protocol), or a waiting-list
      control group, who will have access to the intervention after the six-month follow-up
      assessment.

      Both groups will complete a protocol with self-report measures, assessing psychopathology
      indicators, emotion regulation processes, and general and school-related well-being, in four
      different moments: at baseline (M0), immediatly after the intervention (M1), three months
      (M2) and six months (M3) after the intervention.
