      receive instruction either for a low-GI diet (intervention group) or a low-calorie, low-fat
      diet (control group). Both groups were followed-up every month for six months. The primary
      outcomes were body composition changes during the six-month period, measured by dual X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Secondary outcomes were
      metabolic syndrome risk changes measured by fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid
      profiles.

      The adherence to the nutritional education and physical activity recommendation was evaluated
      by using three-day dietary records (two weekdays and one weekend day) and a physical activity
      questionnaire at each visit. All participants were examined and counseled about physical
      activity and life style modification strategies by a pediatrician at every visit.
