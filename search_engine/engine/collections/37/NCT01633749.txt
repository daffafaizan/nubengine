    
      An open, baseline-controlled study in two age groups: adults and elderly. The subjects will
      be screened within 14 days prior to or at Visit 1 (Day 1). At Visit 1 (Day 1) subjects will
      be vaccinated after blood sampling for baseline serum antihemagglutinin antibody titration.
      Subjects will be asked to record local and systemic reactions daily on a diary at home for 72
      hours after vaccination. One week later (Visit 2, Day 8) the subjects will return to the
      study site to hand in the diary and for the assessment of safety and tolerability
      (reactogenicity and overall inconvenience). Three weeks after vaccination (Visit 3, Day 22)
      the subjects will return to the study site for blood sampling to assess immunogenicity and
      for the assessment of safety and tolerability.
