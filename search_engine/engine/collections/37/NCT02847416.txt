      rate: 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 L/sec in each load. In each flow rate, the subjects were instructed
      to inspire as deeply as possible with steady flow rate for 3 seconds with end-inspiratory
      pause for 2-3 seconds through the inspiratory circuit and follow by passive exhalation. For
      expiratory group, the resistive load and flow rate were test similar inspiratory group. In
      each flow rate, the subjects were instructed to inspire as deeply as possible through the
      nose with end-inspiratory pause for 2-3 seconds and partially forced exhalation with reach to
      1/3 of expiratory reserve volume (ERV) for at least 3 seconds through expiratory circuit
