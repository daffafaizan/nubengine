    
      In 2004, the Cardiac Cath Lab at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta was asked to conduct a
      Quality Improvement Review examining radiation exposure.

      To perform radiological procedures with minimal radiation exposure and to ensure safe care
      during catheterization procedures, we conducted a chart review of all patients requiring
      fluoroscopy in the lab during the period of January - June, 2004.

      â€¢ Based on our Retrospective Review, we were able to present Our New Standards to the Cardiac
      Cath Lab Committee at the end of June, 2004 with the following:

        1. Diagnostic procedure time decreased from 45 minutes standard to 30 minutes standard.

        2. Intervention and Electrophysiology procedure time reduced from 90 minutes to 45 minutes.
