        1. To evaluate the 30- and 180-days outcome of cardiac surgery for rheumatic heart disease
           (RHD), and impact of gender, age, clinical findings and echocardiographic
           classification, during the time of development of cardiac surgery at Black Lion
           hospital, Ethiopia, in comparison with matched individuals (from the same waiting list)
           which had no offer of surgery due to limited availability.

        2. To evaluate the quality of anticoagulation therapy after cardiac surgery at Black Lion
           hospital, Ethiopia by evaluating the patients proportion of time in therapeutic
           INR-level, complications as valve dysfunction, bleeding and thrombosis compared to
           control patients undergoing valvular replacement due to RHD at Norwegian hospitals.

      Population: Approximately 50 RHD patients operated by Our team at Addis Abeba University
      Hospital, Ethiopia.

      Follow up for 180-days for objective 1 and continous follow-up for objective 2. Comparison
      With matched Controls. Outcome measures: Mortality, complications (heart failure,
      arrhythmias, thrombosis, bleedings, stroke, infections)
