      caused by a certain degree of inflammation, another theory is that intestinal flora has an
      influence on IBS. Coltect combines 3 ingredients: green tea, selenium and curcumin, all of
      which have been shown to have anti inflammatory and anti oxidant activity. the aim of the
      study is to investigate if use of coltect can improve symptoms in IBS patients
