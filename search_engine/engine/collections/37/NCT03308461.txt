      pattern of these patients might be related to the contribution of gut microbiota. This pilot
      study proposed hypothesis that stool pattern could be used as a simple index to screen the
      potential candidates of fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with difficult
      defecation. Patients underwent single FMT in this study were divided into hard-stool group
      and loose-stool group. All patients were assessed before FMT and during 12-week follow-up
      after FMT.
