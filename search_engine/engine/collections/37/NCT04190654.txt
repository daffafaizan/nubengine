      weeks prior to dose administration. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical
      research unit (CRU) before the initiation of investigational medicinal product (IMP)
      administration (Check-in/Day -1) and administered of KW-6356 orally on Day 1 after an 8-hour
      fast. Those subjects who complete all the scheduled observations/examinations and are
      determined to have no clinical abnormalities requiring further hospitalization by the
      Investigator, will be discharged from the study site on Day 4. Discharged subjects will then
      visit the CRU on the scheduled visit Days 5, 6, 7, 8 for PK sample collections and safety
      assessments on Day 12 to complete the End of Study (EOS) visit. The duration of
      hospitalization will be 5 days: 4 nights from Day -1 to Day 4.
