    
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after primary vaccination
      with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine (three-dose schedule with 3 different
      lots). To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will be bled at Years 11,
      12, 13, 14 and 15 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to determine
      their anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

      No additional subjects will be recruited in the course of this extension study. If a subject
      has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies or lost anti-HBs seroprotection
      concentrations at the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15),
      he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose.
