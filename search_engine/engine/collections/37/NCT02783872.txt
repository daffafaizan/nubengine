      one is eating) is prevalent among children and adolescents. LOC eating is associated with a
      range of physical and psychosocial health impairments, including obesity and the development
      of partial- and full-syndrome eating disorders. Early identification is thus critical for
      preventing or minimizing these adverse health outcomes. However, little is known about the
      development of LOC eating in children and, consequently, there is a paucity of effective
      interventions. Impairments in emotion regulation appear to be involved in the onset and
      maintenance of eating pathology in obese samples. To date, emotion regulation in youth with
      LOC eating problems is poorly understood, and research on underlying neurodevelopmental
      substrates is virtually nonexistent. The proposed research aims to characterize
      neurocircuitry involved in emotion regulation among 30 overweight children with LOC eating as
      compared to 30 overweight and 15 normal-weight controls without LOC. Participants will
      complete a cognitive reappraisal task whilst situated in an MRI scanner, the purpose of which
      is to characterize neural activity involved in reappraisal versus an emotion maintenance
      control condition. The proposed research aims to advance the field's understanding of the
      nature and correlates of LOC eating in overweight children so as to inform intervention
      development.
