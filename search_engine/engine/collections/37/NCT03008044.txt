      CGM system using the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose as an indicator of blood glucose
      levels.The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of FiberSense system across the
      glucose measurement ranges (from hypoglycemia to hyperglycemia) as compared with a gold
      standard reference laboratory method (YSI glucose) in healthy volunteers.
