      comparing a four week course of Azasite (azithromycin ophthalmic 1%) to vehicle (Durasite®)
      in patients with MGD-related evaporative dry eye. All patients will be evaluated at
      screening, baseline, two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks.

      The primary outcome measure will be improvement, as compared to baseline, in corneal
      irregularity as measured by a topographically-derived value, the Corneal Irregularity
      Measurement (CIM). Secondary outcome measures will be a global symptom score, tear film break
      up time, meibomian gland secretion characteristics, best-corrected distance visual acuity,
      corneal staining, axial topography based astigmatism patterns, and IOL Master keratometry.

      We will enroll 60 eyes of 30 patients, and each patient will be randomly assigned to receive
      Azasite in one eye and vehicle (Durasite®) in the fellow eye.
