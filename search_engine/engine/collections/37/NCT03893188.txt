        1. To obtain epidemiological data on individuals asking for PrEP in Switzerland. We are
           particularly interested in:

             -  Determining the extent of PrEP use in Switzerland;

             -  Assessing and monitoring the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
                in this particular population.

        2. To assess sexual health and sexual well-being in individuals asking for PrEP using a
           questionnaire specifically designed for the SwissPrEPared program.
