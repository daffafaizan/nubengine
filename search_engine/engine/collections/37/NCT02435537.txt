      nociceptive pain secondary to cancers. Intrathecal injection of morphine to provide
      postoperative analgesia during the initial 24 h after operation is a widely used
      technique.The Human studies on the antinociceptive effects of co-administrated intrathecal
      morphine and dexmedetomidine in postoperative pain are still lacking. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to compare the synergistic interaction and side-effects of combined
      intrathecal morphine and dexmedetomidine with either drug alone for postoperative analgesia
      in cancer patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into
      three groups of 30 patients each to receive either; hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (Group
      I/Bupivacaine Group), bupivacaine and 0.5 mg morphine (Group II/Morphine Group), bupivacaine
      and 0.5 mg morphine plus 5 Âµg of dexmedetomidine (Group III/Morphine-DEX Group). The assigned
      drugs were dissolved in 1ml physiological saline and administered intrathecal with
      bupivacaine before induction of general anesthesia.
