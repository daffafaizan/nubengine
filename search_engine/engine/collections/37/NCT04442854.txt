      Previous research has found the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy in
      improving international students' mental health and facilitating their psychological
      adaptation. However, this kind of research in Chinese societies is scant and previous studies
      lack control group in study design. This study developed an 8-session culturally appropriate
      cognitive behavioral group prevention program for Mainland Chinese university students in
      Hong Kong. Research design of randomized controlled trial was adopted. Program effectiveness
      was evaluated at both cognitive and emotional levels, including psychological distress,
      acculturative stress, emotions, automatic thoughts, sense-making coping, core belief
      re-examination and post-migration growth.
