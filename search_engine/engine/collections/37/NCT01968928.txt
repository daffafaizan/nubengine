      critical role in the development of drug resistance and can be a promising target to overcome
      drug resistance.

      In this study, our specific aims are as follows:

        1. To prove the differentia expression levels of PKM2 in UC cells and drug-resistant UC
           cells, as well as in human UC tissues and drug-resistant UC tissues.

        2. To examine the effect of PKM2 regulations（PKM2 siRNA and shikonin）on invasiveness and
           metastatic ability of UC cells and clarify the role of PKM2 in human UC cells.

        3. To investigate the combinatory effect of PKM2 regulations（PKM2 siRNA and shikonin）and
           currently used chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin，gemcitabine ,doxorubicin). Do PKM2
           regulations enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and overcome the
           chemoresistance？

        4. To further prove the in vitro findings in the nude mice xenograft model。
