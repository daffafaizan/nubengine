    
      This study aims to determine the metabolic mechanism(s) by which dietary extrinsic sugars
      (sucrose and fructose), promote the formation of a high risk dyslipidaemia, known as an
      atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (raised plasma triglyceride, low HDL and predominance of
      small, dense LDL), in men with raised cardio-metabolic risk and percentage of liver fat, as
      determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The study examined the impact of diets
      high and low in extrinsic sugars, on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in vivo, of
      two groups of men with a high (>10%)and low (<2%)percentage of liver fat, by the
      trace-labelling of these lipid moieties with stable isotopes, and detection by gas
      chromatography mass spectrometry. The study had a two-way cross-over design, with two, 12
      week dietary interventions separated by a six week wash-out period. The dietary intervention
      with high and low sugars was achieved by a dietary exchange with supermarket foods, which
      were consumed within the homes of the participants.
