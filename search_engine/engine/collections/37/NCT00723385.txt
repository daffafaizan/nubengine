      recent meta-analysis of trials with at least 5 years of follow-up of vitamin D
      supplementation concluded that intake of vitamin D supplements may decrease total mortality,
      but that the relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements,
      and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. An even more recent analysis of vitamin
      D concentrations found that participants with vitamin D deficiency and hypertension were
      about twice as likely as people without hypertension and vitamin D deficiency to have a
      cardiovascular event during the study.

      The main hypothesis to be tested is that normalization of vitamin D levels will lower
      LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations in people with inadequate vitamin D
      concentrations as determined by circulating 25-OH vitamin D. Subhypotheses are that
      HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), hs C-reactive protein and Hemoglobin A1c will
      not be affected, and that cyp3a-metabolized medication levels will decrease with vitamin D
      replacement.

      This is a 12-week randomized double-blind dose titration study of the effects of
      supplementation with 1000-2000 IU vitamin D on lipid and vitamin D concentrations. Dietary
      intake of vitamin D will be estimated by dietary recall questionnaire or analysis of three
      non-consecutive 24-hour dietary intake logs.
