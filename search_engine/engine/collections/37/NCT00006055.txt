      cells (PBSC) are collected. On the fifth day of G-CSF therapy, PBSC are collected. Patients
      undergo plasmapheresis on days -9 to -7. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 to
      -3 and total lymphoid irradiation on day -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Following PBSC
      reinfusion, patients receive prophylaxis with oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV on
      days -1 to 28, antithymocyte globulin IV on days 1-3, and cyclosporine every 12 hours on days
      1-60.

      Patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or pure red
      cell aplasia are followed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 100, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5
      years. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus
      erythematosus are followed on days 14, 28, 60, and 100, and then every 6 months. Patients
      with vasculitis are monitored for abnormal clinical and laboratory parameters characteristic
      of the individual type of vasculitis.
