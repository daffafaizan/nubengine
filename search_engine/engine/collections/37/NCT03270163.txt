    
      We propose to conduct a reproducibility study of quadriceps force measurement in patients
      undergoing resuscitation by transcutaneous electrical and/or magnetic neurostimulation in the
      initial (i.e., < 96 h) and late (> 96 h) phases of resuscitation and then in the recovery
      phase. For each investigative technique (i.e., electrical vs. magnetic), we will perform 2
      types of stimulation: single stimulation and high frequency doublet stimulation (100 Hz),
      repeated 3 times each.
