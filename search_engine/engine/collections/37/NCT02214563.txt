    
      There are 4 arms in this study: (1) Thrice-weekly cholecalciferol supplementation (3,000 IU),
      (2) Monthly cholecalciferol supplementation (equivalent to 9,000/week), (3) Thrice-weekly
      placebo, and (4) Monthly placebo. The primary analyses will be done regarding 2
      cholecalciferol groups and 2 placebo groups as one group each, and we will evaluate the
      effect of cholecalciferol regardless of the supplementation regimen. As the secondary
      analyses, we will examine if there is any difference between thrice-weekly and once-monthly
      supplementation regimen.
