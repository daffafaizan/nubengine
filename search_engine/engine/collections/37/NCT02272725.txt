      covers a total of 250 kilometers. Data will be collected during four separate events over the
      course of the coming year. All races are run by the RacingThePlanet™ 4-desert race series
      with locations including: Jordan, Ecuador, China, and Chile. The evening after stage 4,
      participants will be reminded to check in at the medical tent prior to stage 5 start, and at
      that time the participants will be weighed and given their study drug packet (ibuprofen or
      visually identical placebo). Approximately 80% of the finishers complete the 80-kilometer
      Stage 5 in less than 19 hours, so the majority of participants will ingest 1600mg of
      ibuprofen (400mg q 4 hours x 4 doses). The optimal adult dosing for analgesia is 400mg every
      4 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 3200mg ((1999). Product information: Motrin™,
      ibuprofen. Kalamazoo, MI, Pharmacia & Upjohn Company.)

      Immediately after crossing the finish line of Stage 5, participants will be reweighed, then
      seated in the study tent where a fingertip blood sample will be obtained via lancet and
      capillary collection tube (Mock, Morrison, & Yatscoff, 1995) then analyzed for Na, Cr and BUN
      (utilizing a Chem-8 cartridge) onsite immediately after collection using an iSTAT® point-of-
      care analyzer (Abbott; East Windsor, NJ). Any participant who did not complete any stage
      prior to stage 5 will be removed from the competition and the study. Both the point-of-care
      device and the digital scale will be calibrated for prior to taking measurements. At this
      point, the study is over and there is no further participant responsibilities.
