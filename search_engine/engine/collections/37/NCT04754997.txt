      clotting factors in the blood. Male individuals with problems in the X chromosome are
      affected, females are carriers. There are two common types, factor VIII (Hemophilia A) and
      factor IX (Hemophilia B), and the percentage of the exposed factor in circulation determines
      the degree of hemophilia disease (<1% severe, 1-5% moderate,> 20% mild). The most common
      clinical symptoms in hemophilia are intra-articular and intramuscular spontaneous bleeding, a
      history of bleeding that lasts longer than expected after trauma, hemarthrosis and hematomas
      after crawling or walking in children with moderate or severe hemophilia. Pain, swelling,
      redness, temperature increase and limitation of movement occur in the bleeding joint.
      Bleeding into the joint space causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and synovitis
      occurs. With chronic synovitis, the synovial membrane thickens. Degeneration of the joint
      cartilage and narrowing of the joint space occurs. Hemarthroses constitute 70-80% of bleeding
      findings. The most common bleeding joints are knee joints with a rate of 45%. Besides
      pharmacological treatment for joint and muscle bleeding, the most suitable option is exercise
      therapy.

      The aim of our study is to examine the effect of exercise agitation on pain, physical
      activity and quality of life in pediatric hemophilia patients. The results of the study
      indicate that the exercise protocol developed for the lower extremity in pediatric hemophilia
      patients will have a positive effect on pain, physical activity and quality of life.
