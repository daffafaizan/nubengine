    
      This study is an open label, two-part, FIH Phase 1/2 dose-finding study designed to determine
      the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and proof-of-concept of OMO-103 in patients with advanced
      solid tumours.

      The study consists of two parts:

      • Part 1: Dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumours, including 5 OMO-103 dose
      levels.

      Approximately 11 to 24 patients in total will be enrolled in Part 1, covering 5 dose levels
      with the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of OMO-103 and defining
      an appropriate dose for further evaluation in Part 2.

      The study will start with an accelerated-titration dose-escalation scheme enrolling one
      evaluable patient per cohort for the first 2 dose levels followed by a classic 3+3 design.

      • Part 2: Dose expansion where at least 3 parallel groups of patients with advanced Non Small
      Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
      will be treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OMO-103 to further characterise the
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumour activity of OMO-103.

      Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled in each of the 3 parallel groups of patients
      (NSCLC, TNBC, CRC) in Part 2.
