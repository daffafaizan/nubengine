      however patient's discomfort may be responsible for up to a fifth of failures. Scant
      literature exists on NIV-related pressure ulcers and their determinants.

      Aim of the study is to seek for determinants, if any, associated with the development of
      pressure ulcers related to noninvasive ventilation.

      Study design: observational. Patients treated with NIV from December 2009 to December 2011
      will be analyzed. Main end-points: to seek for variables associated to the development of
      NIV-related pressure ulcers in patients with acute respiratory failure.
