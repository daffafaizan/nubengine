      convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In the case of
      SARS-CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy would
      mediate protection is viral neutralization. The only antibody type that is currently
      available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma. As more individuals
      contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential donors will continue to increase. The
      investigators seek to treat participants who are sick enough to warrant hospitalization prior
      to the onset of overwhelming disease.
