      clear how to treat those subjects with evidence of pre-clinical atherosclerosis but without
      obvious conventional risk factors. This randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study is
      to evaluate the effect of Atorvastatin 10 mg daily, therapeutic lifestyle change, and their
      combination, on the progression of CIMT in those with higher baseline CIMT value but are not
      belong to 'high risk' category, according to the conventional risk factors.
