      iron in the body, life-long treatment and adherence to iron chelation therapy (ICT) are
      necessary to prevent the morbidity and mortality that may result if excess iron is allowed to
      .

      Deferasirox (DFO),is the oldest available form of ICT used by patients with
      transfusion-dependent disorders. Improvements in ICT administration convenience and
      tolerability are expected to improve patient's satisfaction with ICT and Health Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL), thus promoting adherence to ICT regimens and potentially reducing
      iron overload-related morbidity/mortality and associated healthcare costs
