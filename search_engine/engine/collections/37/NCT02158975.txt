      trial in two stages. All enrolled patients will be treated with MLN9708 4 mg PO weekly (days
      1, 8, 15 every 28 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the initial
      stage of the study a total of 11 patients will be enrolled and treated with MLN9708. Should
      at least 4 patients exhibit a response (CR/CRu, PR), the second stage of 14 patients will
      open for enrollment. Efficacy will be assessed radiographically, by peripheral blood and bone
      marrow examination (when indicated), and physical exam every 8 weeks. Safety will be assessed
      by periodic physical exams, laboratory studies, and adverse events. All patients will have a
      follow-up visit 35 days (+/-7 days) following the last study drug treatment. Patients with
      accessible tumor tissue will be asked to undergo a biopsy for a fresh tissue sample for
      assessment of GATA-3 expression. Archived tissue samples from the initial diagnostic biopsy
      and the most recent lymphoma biopsy will be obtained in the event a fresh tumor biopsy cannot
      be obtained. Patients with GATA-3+ TCL and accessible tumor tissue will undergo a tumor
      biopsy at day 21 (+/- 7 days) of cycle 1. All baseline fresh or archived tissue will undergo
      central pathology review to confirm the diagnosis of TCL. The rationale for proteasome
      inhibition in T-cell lymphomas, based on the pre-clinical (and previous phase II) data, is
      compelling. Therefore, this phase II study will not be restricted to patients with GATA-3
      expressing lymphomas.
