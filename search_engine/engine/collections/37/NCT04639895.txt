      temporal lobes, including different executive functions, memory, and complex motor control.
      Among several treatments, the Transtheoretical Model, a multidisciplinary approach, is one of
      the most standardized. However, it lacks effective and innovative cognitive rehabilitation
      tools. In this study, two cognitive rehabilitation tools, already clinically validated for
      stroke patients, will be implemented to promote cognitive recovery of Alcohol Use Disorder
      (AUD) individuals under treatment in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center S. Ricardo Pampuri
      from Casa de Saúde S. João de Deus (Madeira, Portugal). Within a randomized controlled trial
      with 60 participants, this study intend to assess and compare the clinical effectiveness of
      both a paper-and-pencil tasks training and content equivalent virtual reality (VR) simulation
      of activities of daily living with time-matched standard treatment.
