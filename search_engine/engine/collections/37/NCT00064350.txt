        -  To determine the percent of patients maintaining stable disease or objective response
           two months after randomization with continued sorafenib treatment, compared to patients
           switched to placebo.

        -  To determine progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to number of prior chemotherapy regimens (2 vs more than 2) and prior epidermal
      growth factor receptor inhibitor treatment (yes vs no).

        -  Induction: All patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment
           continues for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients with stable disease proceed to randomization. Patients with responding disease
           continue to receive sorafenib for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression.

        -  Randomization: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily for up to 1 year in the absence
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for up to 1 year in the absence
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop disease
                progression within 1 year after randomization cross over to arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 311 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 3 years.
