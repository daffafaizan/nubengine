    
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) remains poorly documented in head and neck cancer
      cancer population, who have a higher risk than the general population. OSAS is a risk factor
      for quality of life impairment and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      This study proposes to carry out an OSAS prevalence study among a locally advanced head and
      neck cancer population, already treated and to compare the consequences of current
      therapeutic options in sleep quality.The primary research objective will be a prevalence
      determination in a locally advanced stages treated population of oropharyngeal cancer.
      Secondary objectives will be the comparison of the prevalence between the surgical group and
      the radio-chemotherapy group, the research of predictive factors of presenting an OSAS and
      the precision of the impact on quality of life.
