      the external anal sphincter. However, attempts to reroute the seton and the involved fistula
      track were made to preserve the external anal sphincter fibers and hasten healing of the anal
      wound. Mann and Clifton first introduced a transposition technique for the management of high
      anal and anorectal fistulas by re-routing the extrasphincteric portion of the track into an
      intersphincteric position with immediate repair of the external sphincter and reported
      successful outcomes of five patients in terms of quick healing and preserved anal continence.

      The present study aimed to evaluate the outcome of draining seton with or without rerouting
      of the fistula track in treatment complex high anal fistula regarding healing time,
      postoperative pain, and incidence of recurrence and FI postoperatively. We hypothesized that
      rerouting the seton to include the fistula track and the internal anal sphincter only,
      preserving the external anal sphincter muscles, would serve to hasten healing and decrease
      the incidence of recurrence and continence disturbances.
