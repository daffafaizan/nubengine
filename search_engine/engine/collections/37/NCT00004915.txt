      recurrent endometrial cancer treated with raloxifene. II. Determine overall survival in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of raloxifene in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral raloxifene daily. Treatment continues indefinitely in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
