      depressed medical inpatients by collecting data on the impact of a modified evidence-based
      care transition model on clinical/health and utilization outcomes of depression in medically
      ill inpatients. The study could generate evidence to support the inpatient application of the
      USPSTF guidelines for screening adults for depression through staff-assisted depression care
      systems including follow-up and continuity of care. This study will add to the existing
      outpatient evidence for identification and treatment of depression in improving outcomes
      (Simon et al., 2001;O'Connor et al., 2013), the crucial aspect of inpatient evidence for
      depression identification, treatment, and continuity of care/care transitions in improving
      clinical/health and utilization outcomes.
