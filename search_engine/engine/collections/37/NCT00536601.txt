    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) distribution for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL),
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) for each disease-specific high dose
      therapy regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the PFS distribution for amyloidosis, acute leukemia and selected solid tumors
      for each disease-specific high dose therapy regimen.

      II. Explore the role of risk factors in the outcome of all treated patients. III. Examine the
      high dose therapy regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and overall survival after bone marrow
      transplant (BMT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are assigned to conditioning regimens based on disease, age, and co-morbidities.
