      suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, irrespective of risk. However, despite
      the advances in valve technology and implantation techniques, there is still no consensus on
      how to effectively screen, manage and discharge patients undergoing such an intervention.

      In an effort not to lose grounds because of an increasing inner-hospital competition for
      resources including intensive care unit (ICU) and general hospital beds, there is a need for
      a streamlined Quality of Care (QoC) pathway that delivers the procedure more efficient, but
      with at least the same patient safety. In this context, the recent FAST-TAVI and North
      American Multidisciplinary, Multimodality, But Minimalist (3M) studies have shown that
      optimized risk assessment and patient management results in a more effective, as least as
      safe treatment pathway and a reduced length of stay (LoS).

      The results gain importance especially in a situation where patients suffering from the
      coronavirus disease compete for hospital resources throughout Europe. Using a clear set of
      Quality of Care criteria, the BENCHMARK registry aims to document the progress that can be
      made if tailored Quality of Care improvement measures are initiated.

      The hypothesis is that the implementation of standardized, reproducible and scalable Quality
      of Care improvement measures will help reducing resource requirements, intensive care unit
      bed occupancy and overall length of hospitalization with uncompromised patient safety.

      There will be up to 30 centers participating across Europe (Germany, Austria, Italy, France,
      Spain, Czech Republic, Romania). Each center will enroll 80 patients (retrospective
      documentation of 30 patients, prospective enrollment of 50 patients), resulting in 2400
      patients in total.
