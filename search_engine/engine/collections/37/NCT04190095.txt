      the real-time user interaction and simultaneous motion tracking and analysis in the immersive
      VR environment were made possible. We now propose to customize this technology for
      telerehabilitation. The ultimate goal is to build a VR-based interactive tele-rehab system
      that is patient-centered, with augmented feedback and tele-presence of therapist to assist
      rehabilitative exercises and recovery of motor functions in both real and virtual
      environment. To achieve this goal, we are specifically tackling three problems.

        -  1: Cross validating the precision of motion data captured in VR. We will modify our
           current software (Unity-based) so that it can work simultaneous with two motion tracking
           systems (Optical tracking and Magnetic tracking) to capture motion data in a 3D VR
           environment. The recorded data in our software will be compared and correlated with
           those data recorded by the two motion tracking systems in 3D for examination of
           accuracy.

        -  2: Building and testing the network code for remote data transmission and interaction.
           We will write network code to enable the remote transmission of motion tracking data
           between two sites. The latency of data transmission will be tested to determine the
           minimum speed of internet for implementing such a tele-rehab system.

        -  3: Designing and implementing a VR interaction task for remote monitoring and diagnosis.
           A 3D interactive VR task will be built for real-time local interaction and the remote
           monitoring, assessment and intervention.
