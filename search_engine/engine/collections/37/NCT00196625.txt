      effects and the great number of pills reduces adherence to the treatment, and induces
      therapeutic failure. In order to maintain efficacy of HAART, new combination is evaluated.
      The aim of the study is to compare the antiviral efficacy of this salvage therapy combining
      lopinavir and amprenavir with 200 mg/d or 400 mg/d ritonavir, together with nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), over a 26-week period in HIV-infected patients in
      whom multiple antiretroviral regimens had failed. 100 patients with CD4 cell count below
      300/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA over 30,000 copies/ml are to be included in four groups:
      amprenavir, lopinavir, NRTI, with ritonavir 200 mg.d or not (patients previously treated by
      additional ritonavir 200 or 400 mg/d).
