      after the acute event. The aim is to give 70 % of all patients with MINCA (35-70 years old) a
      definitive diagnosis made by CMR only. One-hundred and fifty patients will be included and
      compared with a similar historical sample where 50 % of the patients received a diagnosis
      made by a late CMR and clinical findings. The study has 80 % power to detect this 20 %
      absolute difference (p <0.05).
