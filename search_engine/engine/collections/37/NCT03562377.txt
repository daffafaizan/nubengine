      treatment (placebo) for 16 weeks. All subjects will receive 2 vaccines at Week 12. The
      vaccines are: >

        1. Tetanus (lockjaw), diphtheria (infection of the nose and throat), and pertussis
           (whooping cough) vaccine. This combination vaccine is also known as the Tdap vaccine and
           is used to prevent these 3 diseases.>

        2. Meningococcal vaccine. This vaccine is used to prevent meningococcal diseases (infection
           of the brain and spinal cord) and blood poisoning.> > The primary objective of the trial
           is to demonstrate non-inferiority of tralokinumab versus placebo with respect to immune
           responses to concomitantly administered vaccines.> The secondary objective is to
           evaluate efficacy of tralokinumab concomitantly administered with vaccines.
