      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete and partial response), as defined by the
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, in patients with advanced
      refractory biliary cancers (BC) receiving Akt inhibitor MK2206 (MK2206).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events and tolerability of the regimen
      in patients with advanced refractory BC receiving MK2206.

      II. To determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients with advanced
      refractory BC receiving MK2206.

      III. To determine the presence of genetic mutations of PI3-kinase/ Akt pathway
      signaling-pathway genes relevant to BC and how these correlate with objective response to
      treatment with MK2206.

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic profile as a way of assessing
      inter-individual variability as well as how these relate to clinical outcomes.

      V. To determine genetic variants and mutations in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes
      and transporters, and genes involved in tumor biology, and how these may be related to
      response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacogenetic, and other correlative studies. Previously collected tumor tissue is also
      analyzed.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
