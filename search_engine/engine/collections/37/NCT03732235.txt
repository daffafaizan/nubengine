      systemic chemotherapy, elderly, or have a poor performance status, and is usually performed
      using irinotecan (IRI) covalently loaded onto embolics.

      Although chemoembolization with irinotecan-loaded embolics results in an objective response,
      this method creates a hypoxic micro-environment. Hypoxia induces and activates the HIF-1 and
      HIF 2 hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, which promote high-level VEGF expression and
      subsequent neo-angiogenesis.

      This may provide a mechanism for early relapse and progression following TACE and strongly
      support a rational for following TACE therapy with a therapeutic inhibitor of angiogenesis,
      such as bevacizumab.

      The use of FOLFIRI associate to Bevacizumab is part of clinical practice and is commonly used
      for the therapy of patients with CRC-LM both wild type and mutant.

      This case-control observational study aim to compare patients treated with TACE using
      Irinotecan-loaded embolics followed by systemic Bevacizumab versus patients treated with
      FILFIRI+ Bevacizumab
