      participant will still receive the standard oral medications for pain (ibuprofen) as well as
      an injection of numbing medicine (lidocaine) near the cervix (PCB). The co-primary outcomes
      are patient perception of anxiety and pain with uterine aspiration reported on a 100 mm
      visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes include reported anxiety and pain at time
      points before, during, and after the procedure, as well as subject satisfaction with anxiety
      and pain control and overall abortion experience. Due to the dose-dependent anterograde
      amnesic effect of midazolam, we will also investigate the effects on memory and recall, which
      has not previously been studied. In addition, we will also collect data on side effects
      frequently associated with oral midazolam such as nausea and sleepiness. Women will also be
      responsible for completing a one-page survey 1-3 days after the procedure visit and return it
      by mail using a pre-addressed and stamped envelope.
