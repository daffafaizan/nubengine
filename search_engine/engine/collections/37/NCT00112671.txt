      I. To assess the efficacy (response rate and stable disease rate) of Bay 439006 given to
      patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      II. To assess the toxicity, time to progression and response duration of Bay 439006 given to
      patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      III. To measure Ras mutational status and EGFR/HER2 on archival specimens. To determine
      baseline and post-treatment levels of pERK, pAKT, VEGFR2, CD31, Ki-67/MIB-1, and cleaved
      caspase 3 and to explore the relationship between these correlative endpoints and clinical
      outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 3 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
