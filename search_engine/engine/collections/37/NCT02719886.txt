      serial ultrasound examinations in the 3rd trimester, there is a lack of consensus on how
      frequently these exams should be done. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology
      recommend that an ultrasound to assess fetal growth be performed between 2 to 4 weeks;
      however, there have been no prospective or randomized trials to determine whether the optimal
      interval should be closer to 2 weeks or delayed to 4 weeks. Currently, only 60% of fetuses'
      with abnormal growth are detected antenatally. There is equipoise of whether ultrasound every
      2 versus 4 weeks improves the detection and subsequent newborn outcomes or merely leads to an
      increase in false positives and unnecessary interventions. It has been proposed, that if
      delivery occurs within 2 weeks of the ultrasound, the antenatal detection of abnormal growth
      may be more accurate and hence more likely to improve outcomes. Conversely, a shorter
      interval may result in confusion as to whether there is actual change in growth or merely
      variation in the measurement technique itself. Moreover, with the cost of ultrasound
      averaging approximately $200 per examination, the interval between ultrasounds can have major
      implications on public-health costs as well as the interventions that subsequently follow if
      an abnormality is detected.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the frequency of the diagnosis
      of fetal growth abnormalities when ultrasound assessment is performed at 2 versus 4 week
      intervals.
