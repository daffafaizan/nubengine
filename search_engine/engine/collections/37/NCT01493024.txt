    
      A total of 90 subjects with moderate CKD (defined as GFR between 40- 60ml/min) and mild
      hyperkalemia (S-K between 5-6 mmol/l) will be enrolled in the study where, in a double-blind
      dose-escalating fashion (three separate cohorts), they will be randomized to receive one of
      the doses of ZS (0.3g, 3g and 10g) or placebo, administered 3 times (tid) daily with meals.
      The first cohort will have 18 subjects while both of the second and third cohorts will have
      36 subjects for a total of 90 subjects.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) after completion of each cohort, before escalation to the next dose level will be
      allowed. The next dose escalation will happen no sooner than one week after the last dose of
      study drug at the previous dosing level has been administered. Safety stopping rules will be
      specified for this study. Within the first dose level (300 mg dose), 12 subjects will be
      randomized to receive ZS, whereas 6 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo for a
      total of 18 subjects in this first cohort. In the next two cohorts (3 g and 10 g doses), 24
      subjects per cohort will be randomized to receive ZS, whereas 12 subjects per cohort will be
      randomized to receive placebo for a total of 36 subjects in each of the second and third
      cohorts.
