      contractures, paresthesia, or dysarthria. This occurs when the electrical field of the
      stimulation spreads out beyond the targeted area. This is especially common in patients whose
      disease has progressed, and must use increasingly higher currents in order to regain control
      of their tremor. Unfortunately, because the electrical field affects neurons in a symmetrical
      sphere around the DBS, it is often impossible to reach the additional desired neuronal
      elements without simultaneously affecting equidistant brain regions responsible for side
      effects. For many of our advanced patients, this means choosing between a debilitating tremor
      or disabling side effects.The directional lead is a FDA and Health Canada approved DBS lead
      which features radially segmented electrodes which can selectively steer the electrical field
      in a predefined direction, orthogonal to the lead trajectory. This will allow DBS clinicians
      to steer current towards desired structural areas, while avoiding locations, which produce
      negative side effects.
