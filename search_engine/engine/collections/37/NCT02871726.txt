      novel robotic TRUS manipulator (TRUS-Robot) developed by our team. The hypothesis of the
      study is that clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate from the SB cores (at SB
      or TB+SB) can be improved above that of current devices. The objective of the study is to
      gain early evidence on the effectiveness of prostate biopsy assisted by the TRUS-Robot vs. a
      current TB device in a randomized clinical trial.
