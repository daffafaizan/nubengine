      disabilities that in the general population. Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare disease,
      associated with an anxiety rate 8 times higher than in the general population. The
      therapeutic solutions proposed in this population remain limited, in particular concerning
      approaches without the use of medication. The objective of the study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a program of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT) in Williams Syndrome
      (WS). For this, an ABA-type protocol will be used. It consists of evaluating the
      effectiveness of an interventional program longitudinally, using a single case type study.
      Adults patients with WS and suffering from anxiety will be recruited. They will be enrolled
      in a program consisting in nine sessions of a psychotherapy program targeting anxiety. There
      will be a pretherapy visit (day 0), nine sessions of psychotherapy (month 0 to month 5) and a
      visit 3 month after the end of the therapy (at month 8) : the visit of the end of the
      research (V10). The expected results will be to validate a psychotherapeutic program for
      patients with WS suffering of anxiety. This program might be extended to other patients with
      intellectual disability.
