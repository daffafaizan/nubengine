      Lanreotide helps in alleviating the symptoms. Lanreotide is an FDA approved medication for
      management of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, but has never been used for treating
      small bowel motility disorders. However, Octreotide which is similar to Lanreotide but is a
      short acting synthetic somatostatin has been used in few research studies.

      If a patient is interested and qualifies for the study then he/she will be explained about
      the study and signature will be collected on the consent form. Health and social history will
      be collected. Blood work, urine analysis, pregnancy test (in women of reproductive age group
      and have the capability of getting pregnant)) will be performed to make sure that patient
      qualifies for the study and for follow-up during the treatment. Physical examination, ECG,
      wireless motility capsule testing and hydrogen breath testing will be performed. Patients
      will be required to complete a questionnaire regarding their health.

      The total study duration from the first administration of study drug is 12 weeks. The study
      medication will be given once a month for 3 months and there is a 1 month follow-up after the
      last study medication. There will be a screening visit approximately 1 month before the first
      study drug administration.
