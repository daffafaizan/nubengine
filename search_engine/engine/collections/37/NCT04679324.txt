      both before treatment and after completing treatment to study the presence of C. difficile in
      the colonic mucosa pre as well as assessment for microbiome and patient/clinical factors that
      may contribute to disease recurrence. Assessment will include sigmoid colon biopsies, blood
      draw, stool samples and surveys.
