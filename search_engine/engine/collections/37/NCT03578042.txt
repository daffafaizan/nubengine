      to receive:

        1. Fixed combination containing 3 anti-hypertensive drugs: losartan 100 mg + amlodipin 5 mg
           + hydrocholorothiazide 12.5 mg one tab/day

        2. Or any other therapy decided by the treating physician containing three
           anti-hypertensive agents but supplied as "free" therapy, meaning supplied as 2 or 3
           separate tablets Patients will have a baseline ambulatory blood pressure recording. The
           same recording will be repeated at 2 months of therapy.

      We expect fixed triple combination to be more effective because the drugs used work
      synergistically together and the compliance will be higher
