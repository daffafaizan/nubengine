      reaching or grasping movements, but these improvements don't generalize well to use of the
      weaker limb during everyday tasks.

      This study aims to refine and test a protocol named the Active Learning Program for Stroke
      (ALPS), which teaches people to use active problem solving strategies and a home program to
      improve function. Therapist-delivered ALPS instruction may incorporate use of strategies
      (e.g. STOP, THINK, DO, CHECK) modeled after the Cognitive Orientation for daily Occupational
      Performance (CO-OP) approach to improve real-world use of the paretic upper limb. We will
      evaluate whether the combination of robot-assisted therapy and ALPS training leads to better
      satisfaction and functional use of the weaker arm in persons with motor impairments more than
      6 months after stroke, as compared to robot-assisted therapy alone.
