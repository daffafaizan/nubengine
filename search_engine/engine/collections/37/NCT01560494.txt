      for a basic laparoscopic procedure. Although simulators have been well validated as tools to
      teach technical skills, their integration into comprehensive curricula is lacking. Moreover,
      neither the effect of ex-vivo training on learning curves in the operating room (OR), nor the
      effect on non-technical proficiency has been investigated. This randomized single-blinded
      prospective trial allocated 20 surgical trainees to a structured-curriculum (STAC) group or
      conventional residency training. The STAC curriculum consisted of: case-based learning,
      proficiency-based virtual reality training, laparoscopic box training, and OR participation.
      After completion of the intervention, all participants performed 5 sequential laparoscopic
      cholecystectomies in the OR. The primary outcome measure was the difference in technical
      performance between the 2 groups during the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Secondary
      outcome measures included differences with respect to: learning curves in the OR, technical
      proficiency of each sequential laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and non-technical skills.
