      period. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will receive: Lenalidomide 25 mg p.o. once
      daily on days 1-21 plus Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each
      28-day cycle (4-weeks cycles) until CR achievement, progression of disease or intolerable
      toxicity. The daily dose of Lenalidomide and that of Dexamethasone will remain fixed. No dose
      adaptations are allowed according to the hematologic toxicity. However, in case of
      non-hematologic grade > 2 toxicity, the next cycle may be delayed up to 21 days after the
      onset of the event until the adverse event has returned to baseline or â‰¤ grade 1. Patients
      may be allowed to receive a pre-treatment with high doses of dexamethasone for initial
      hyperleukocytosis at the discretion of the investigator. The use of hematopoietic growth
      factor (HGF) during the initial or extended treatment period is also let at the discretion of
      the investigator. At the end of the initial treatment period, all responding patients
      (without HLA compatible donor) or patients showing sufficient clinical activity will be
      allowed to receive extended treatment with cycles identical to the first cycle. Patients may
      continue to receive treatment as long as the patient is tolerating the treatment well and the
      patient's physician believes the patient is receiving some benefit. The severity of adverse
      events will be graded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Any
      life-threatening adverse effects that are observed during the initial or extended treatment
      period, which are possibly or probably related to study drug, will require the subject to
      discontinue study treatment.
