      month prior to conditioning therapy, if possible. 1) The subject is to receive total body
      irradiation (300 cGy) with thymic shielding; it will be given six days before the stem cells
      are given (day -6). 2) Day -5 through Day -2, subjects will receive a chemotherapy regimen of
      Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide via central line (i.e. Hickman or Broviac). Starting Day -3,
      patients will receive sirolimus therapy with a taper commencing on day +180 and also
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) through day +30 or for 7 days after engraftment, whichever day is
      later, if no acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 4) If the subject is receiving bone
      marrow or "peripheral" stem cells (cells collected from the donor's arm via a cell
      separator), on the day of transplantation, the stem cells taken from the donor will be put
      into a machine which will separate the lymphocytes (the cells that cause graft-versus-host
      disease [GVHD]) from the stem cells. If the subject is receiving an umbilical cord blood, the
      lymphocytes will not be removed because the risk of GVHD is not as high. Otherwise all
      patients will receive the same treatment. The stem cells are given as an infusion into the
      subject's existing catheter over 1-2 hours on day 0.5. On the day after transplant (day +1)
      subjects will be given G-CSF to stimulate the growth of the transplanted cells. 6. While
      receiving treatment and until the subject's blood counts recover he/she will have daily blood
      tests, and several bone marrow biopsies and aspirates. After recovery, subjects will be seen
      once a month for a health assessment and blood tests until at least 3 months after the cells
      have been infused. Additional blood tests or assessments may be done as medically indicated.
