      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibition following conventional high dose salvage
      chemotherapy with detectable IDH2 mutations on event free survival (EFS) in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of IDH2 inhibitor maintenance therapy following intensive salvage
      therapy: i.e., rate of hematocrit (HCT), duration of maintenance therapy and overall survival
      in patients with IDH2 mutant relapsed/refractory AML.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the changes in IDH2 mutational variant allelic frequency and deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) methylation signature while on enasidenib therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) 7-14 days after treatment.
      Within 30-100 days following the transplant, patients receive enasidenib QD. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients receive enasidenib PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then yearly for
      5 years.
