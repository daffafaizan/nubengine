      presenting with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for stroke and
      systemic embolism based on CHA2DS2-VASc scores, and who are recommended for oral
      anticoagulation therapy but have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic
      alternative to oral anticoagulation, and who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled
      in the study.

      Subjects will have clinical follow-up in-hospital and at 45 days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2,
      3, 4, and 5 years. Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) or CT follow-up will occur at 45
      days.

      The LAmbreTM Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure System is intended to reduce the risk of
      thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with nonvalvular atrial
      fibrillation who:

        -  Are at increased risk for stroke and systemic embolism based on CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc
           scores and are recommended for oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy; AND

        -  Are deemed by their physician to be suitable for OAC; AND

        -  Have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacological alternative to OAC, taking
           into account the safety and effectiveness of the device compared to OAC
