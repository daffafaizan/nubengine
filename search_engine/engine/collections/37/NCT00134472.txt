      cardiac arrest patients. However, Clifton et al. reported that mild hypothermia has no
      protective effect for severe head trauma but has a risk of complications. In this study, all
      the participants must be treated with continuous monitoring of cardiac output and jugular
      venous oxygen saturation to get optimal physiological conditions. Adequate anesthesia such as
      neuroleptanesthesia is essential to maintain organ function and tissue microcirculation.
      Participants are randomly assigned to two groups of mild hypothermia (32.0 - 34.0 degree
      Celsius) and anti-hyperthermia (35.5 - 37.0 C). The body temperature must be kept for at
      least 72 hours. Hypothermia must be induced within 6 hours after traumatic brain injury.
      Glasgow outcome score at 6 months after injury and the total medical expenses of the two
      groups will be evaluated.
