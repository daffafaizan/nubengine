      be given acupuncture treatment for 12 weeks prior to COS.The patients will be given three
      times acupuncture every week except menstruation. One treatment lasts for 30 minutes. The
      acupuncture acupoint locations are as follows: head acupoint(Yintang, Shenting, Baihui),
      abdominal acupoint (Guanyuan, Zhongji), leg acupoint(Sanyinjiao, Zusanli),waist acupoint
      (Shenyu, Guanyuanyu）. Patients in no intervention group will not be given any intervention
      for 12 weeks prior to COS.

      When at least one dominant follicle is greater than 18 mm then injection Human chorionic
      gonadotropin （hCG） 10000 IU. 36 hours later transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be taken.
      After 3 hours of incubation, each egg will be transferred with a density of about
      100,000/mllive sperm. The fresh embryo transfer is performed 72 hours after embryo culture in
      vitro. The whole embryos will be frozen.

      The primary outcome measure is the number of MII eggs obtained in the COS cycle. The
      secondary outcome measures are the lab and clinical reproductive outcomes,including basic
      endocrine, serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone （AMH）, gonadotropin （Gn） dosage and duration,
      estrogen level on HCG day, number of eggs obtained, fertilization rate, cleavage rate,
      effective embryo rate, cycle cancellation rate, the clinical pregnancy rate.
