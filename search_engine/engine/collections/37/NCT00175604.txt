      group will receive standard treatment which includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
      The other group will receive standard treatment plus an injection of Botox. The babies will
      be monitored to determine if one group has a more favorable outcome than the other in terms
      of range of motion, length of treatment time and number of required surgeries.
