    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerability, and optimal clinical dose of
      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) followed by surgical resection in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive
      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) intratumorally as a continuous infusion
      over 4-5 days beginning within 12-36 hours after ventricular catheter placement. Patients
      then undergo surgical tumor resection approximately 3 weeks after drug infusion. Cohorts of 6
      patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.
      Patients are followed within 1 week and then at 8, 16, and 26 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
