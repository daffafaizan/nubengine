      to Emergency Department (ED) patients. We hope to explore the preliminary feasibility,
      tolerability and efficacy of single-dose, intravenous (IV) ketamine in depressed ED patients
      who presented with suicide ideation (SI).

      The manuscript (article) for this study has been retracted because Yale University conducted
      an investigation that determined that the description of the research was not accurate. The
      article misrepresents both the protocol-specified doses and the actual delivered doses of
      ketamine.
