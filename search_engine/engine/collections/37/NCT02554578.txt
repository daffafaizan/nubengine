      with acute rejection episodes and graft loss. Many solid organ transplant centres have
      incorporated transplant pharmacists into the multidisciplinary transplant clinical team
      focused on improving outcomes and safety associated with drug therapy.

      Mobile technology has undergone rapid advances in the past several years and the use of
      mHealth in pharmaceutical care is changing pharmacy practice. Several published reports have
      identified general mobile applications suited for improve adherence. But evidence supporting
      the benefits in clinical practice is limited.

      This study expects to analyse the potential of mHealth to improve medication adherence and
      heart transplant patient management in real clinical practice.

      The investigators asses a new multidisciplinary follow-up programme in heart transplant
      recipients supported by mobile health (mHealth) with the aim to improve medication adherence,
      prevent drug related problems and improve patient clinical outcomes.
