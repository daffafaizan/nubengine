      Primary

        -  Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-mastectomy
           pain syndrome after surgery in women with resectable breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the psychological and sociological factors that predispose post-surgical pain
           in these patients.

        -  Evaluate emotional distress over time in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the acute and chronic pain over time in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete multiple questionnaires, including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HAD), Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), PCS, and QLQ-C30, to evaluate psychological
      variables (alexithymia, neurosis, repression of negative emotions, solicitude, dramatization,
      emotional distress) and quality of life.

      Post-mastectomy chronic pain (PMCP) syndrome is measured immediately after surgery and at 24
      hours, day 6, and 5 months post-surgery.

      A subgroup of patients (20 with PMCP and 20 without PMCP) are followed at months 5 and 6
      months post-surgery for medication use, pathological problems, morbid events, family history,
      and environmental factors.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
