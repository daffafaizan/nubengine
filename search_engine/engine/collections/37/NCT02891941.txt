    
      This will be a prospective study of subjects with MTBI, body injury and healthy controls.
      Subjects who meet the study criteria will be enrolled in the study after they provide
      informed consent.

      All subjects will be followed longitudinally at 3 and 6 months post-injury.

      All subjects will have 3-4 visits:

      Screening visit to determine eligibility; first study visit within 1 month of injury for
      those with brain or body injury (at the time of screening or within 1 month of screening for
      healthy controls); second study visit at 3 months post-injury (3 months after the first visit
      for healthy controls) and third study visit at 6 months post-injury (6 months after the first
      visit for healthy controls).
