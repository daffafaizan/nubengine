      identify the lung intersegmental plane. This is relevant because the detection of small and
      early lung cancer is becoming increasingly common. segmentectomy may become a more prominent
      procedure for early-small lung cancer. One of the most difficult aspects of complete
      segmentectomy is detection of the intersegmental plane while maintaining an adequate surgical
      margin and remaining lung function. The method used to detect the intersegmental plane
      remains controversial. It is hoped that this technology can be used to recognize the
      intersegmental plane on the pleural surface and the pulmonary parenchyma and will save lots
      of money for patients in developing countries.
