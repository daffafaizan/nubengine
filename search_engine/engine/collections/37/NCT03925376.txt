      mortality. Patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery are becoming increasingly complex due to
      multiple comorbidities, adherence of mediastinal structures to the undersurface of the
      sternum as well as the spatial location of patent bypass grafts relative to the route of
      entry. Association estimates between baseline characteristics and outcomes in those cohort
      are imprecise. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors associated with redo
      cardiac surgery which may help physicians predict clinical outcomes and guide their treatment
      decision.
