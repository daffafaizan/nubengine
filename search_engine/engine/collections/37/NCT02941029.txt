      statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) dose are based on phase I data and not on the
      individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage within
      24 hours of radiation exposure and should help identify patients at higher risk for radiation
      complications. This should allow physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to
      minimize long-term toxicity.

      Patients undergoing radiation treatment for stage I to III prostate cancer, using protons or
      X-rays, either as primary treatment or consolidation after prostatectomy (positive margins or
      prostate-specific assay [PSA]-related indications) will be eligible. Hormone treatment will
      be allowed.
