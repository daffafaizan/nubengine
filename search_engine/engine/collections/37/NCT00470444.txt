      patients having cardiac surgery have not been established, and red cell transfusion rates for
      these patients are high. In a recent retrospective study of seven Canadian centres, which
      included 11,812 cardiac surgical patients, 44% of patients received one or more red cell
      units, and the range of patients transfused was 28% to 60%. As morbidity and mortality may be
      dependent on the severity of anemia and administration of transfusions, it is essential to
      determine at what hemoglobin concentration physicians should be transfusing these patients,
      particularly because the efficacy of transfusion has not been established. However, as any
      definitive trial will require thousands of patients, and as there is variability in
      transfusion practices, preliminary studies need to be completed to ensure the feasibility of
      adherence to proposed transfusion strategies. This pilot study is the first of two pilot
      trials designed to address the question of optimum hemoglobin concentrations for transfusion
      in patients having cardiac surgery prior to undertaking a definitive randomized controlled
      trial. The purpose of this study is to determine adherence to transfusion strategies.
