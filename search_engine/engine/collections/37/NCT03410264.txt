      one's fear in a systematic and therapeutic way) works in the treatment of phobias focus on
      the importance of extinction learning). This "inhibitory learning model" proposes that EXP
      helps the phobic individual learn that phobic stimuli are not dangerous; yet older
      danger-related learning is not "erased", and so must be inhibited by the new "safety
      learning." Research indicates that incorporating surprise into EXP (e.g., the patient is
      surprised that the spider didn't bite) maximizes this type of inhibitory learning and would
      correspond to better outcomes for phobias then when there is no surprise at the outcome of
      EXP.

      Traditionally, EXP is used with the addition of cognitive restructuring (CR), which involves
      discussing and disputing exaggerated beliefs that underlie one's fears (e.g., "spiders are
      very dangerous"). CR encourages phobic individuals to re-evaluate their expectations of
      danger when encountering phobic stimuli, and therefore might rob the individual of the
      opportunity to be surprised when actually facing their fear.

      Despite the theoretical plausibility of the importance of surprise during EXP, this question
      has yet to be investigated empirically. The aim of the present study is to test the
      hypothesis that incorporating surprise into EXP (by postponing CR until after EXP) will
      enhance immediate and long-term outcome of EXP for spider phobia.
