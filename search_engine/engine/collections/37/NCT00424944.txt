      Merozoite Surface Protein 3 (MSP 3).This product has been developed at Sate Serum Institute
      in Denmark and Bacth released by Henogen of Belgium. The phase Ia trial in malaria naive
      volunteers is currently ongoing in Germany, at Tuebingen University. This phase Ia trial will
      establish safety of the vaccine and also select the best dosage (10, 30 or 100 Âµg). The
      dosage with the best safety and immunogenicity profile will be recommended for the phase Ib
      trial in Gabon.

      2. Study Design This will be a single center, randomized, blinded and controlled study
      involving 40 adult male volunteers. The entire study duration will be 16 months with each
      participant remaining 13 months in the study.There will be 15 scheduled hospital visits and
      11 scheduled field worker home visits. The Rabies vaccine will be used as control vaccine.

      3. Objectives:

      - The primary objective of this trial to evaluate the safety of 3 doses of GMZ2 when
      administered on Days 0, 28 & 56, adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide in healthy Gabonese
      adults.

      - Secondary objectives include the following: (i). To assess the humoral response to the
      vaccine antigens GLURP and MSP3 by measuring the antibody response by ELISA and IFA.

      (ii). To assess the cellular immune response by profiling the Th1/Th2-type cytokines after 24
      and 48 hours stimulation.
