        -  Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and radiotherapy, in terms of 1-year
           survival, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour twice a week for the
      first 3 weeks of radiotherapy. Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy,
      patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of radiotherapy, at completion of
      chemotherapy, and 3 months after completion of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-47 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28
      months.
