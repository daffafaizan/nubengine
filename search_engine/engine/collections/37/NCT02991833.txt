      embarrassing health problems. Urinary incontinence affects the life quality , and causes to
      isolation and depression. Faecal incontinence can cause to psychosocial problems such as loss
      of self-esteem, progressive isolation, social stigmatisation and reduces the life quality,
      also burden a high cost on the patients and the community . Both urinary and fecal
      incontinence may leads to incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), an inflamatory skin
      disease, which is a a clinical evolution of skin damage associated with moisture , as a
      result of chronic or repeated exposure of the skin to urine or fecal matter. In IAD shows as
      redness with or without blistering, erosion, or loss of the skin barrier function IAD which
      causes discomfort and stres for patients , is a serious and common problem in many health
      care setting and impacts patients' well-being. Health care professionals who are working in
      many health institutions struggled to giving the optimal care to keep incontinent patients'
      skin in a healthy condition. When IAD developed, the risk of infection, the length of
      hospitalization, and morbidity increases and those patients are at greater risk of developing
      a pressure ulser.

      The research question was; are there differences in the incidence of IAD in patients with
      fecal incontinence by a new incontinece care versus adult diaper.
