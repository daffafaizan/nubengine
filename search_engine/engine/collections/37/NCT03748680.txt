      not present with detectable tumor DNA in the plasma, whereas patients with detectable tumor
      DNA two weeks' post surgery have residual microscopic disease, and consequently a high risk
      of diseases recurrence which can be prevented with adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate - in a randomized trial - if use of
      standard adjuvant chemotherapy therapy improves the disease free survival in patients with
      molecular biological residual disease where adjuvant chemotherapy is not standard treatment .

      Secondary aims include investigating molecular biological response to adjuvant chemotherapy
      in patients with post-operative ctDNA.
