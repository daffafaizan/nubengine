      1990 and june 2013 were selected. CRM status in patients treated by surgery only (n = 747) or
      after neoadjuvant therapy (n = 176) was recorded prospectively after surgery.

      Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and factors affecting survival were assessed by
      Cox regression multivariate analysis.
