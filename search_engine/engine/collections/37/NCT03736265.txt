      reversion after effective anti-viral therapy. But there is still some patients progress to
      decompensation. Esophageal varices are the main complication of cirrhotic patients.
      Propranolol are widely used to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with large esophageal
      varices. It has been shown the efficacy of propranolol in the preventing of the progression
      from small to large varices reported no effect. Recently, carvedilol has been shown to be
      more potent in decreasing portal hypertension to propranolol. But the efficacy of carvedilol
      to delay the growth of esophageal varices in chronic hepatitis B patients was unclear. The
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of carvedilol in the preventing of the
      progression from small to large varices in hepatitis B patients.
