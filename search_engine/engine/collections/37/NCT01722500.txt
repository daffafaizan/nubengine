      world (Eurasia & Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and the Pacific).
      Cross-sectional evaluations will be undertaken in each country. The physical characteristics
      of the children will be directly measured in order to classify their body weight and
      adiposity status, and physical activity and dietary patterns will be measured with the most
      objective techniques currently available. A concise set of environmental measures that are
      feasible, valid and meaningful across the international settings included in this research
      will also be employed. The results of this study will provide a robust examination of the
      correlates of obesity and weight gain in children, focusing on both sides of the energy
      balance equation. The results will also provide important new information that will inform
      the development of lifestyle interventions to address childhood obesity that can be
      culturally adapted for implementation around the world.
