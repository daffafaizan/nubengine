      this molecule is also found in normal cells, it is much more active in some cancer cells, so
      inhibiting the molecule with PX-866 is hoped to slow the growth of cancer cells. Laboratory
      tests show that it may help slow the growth of prostate cancer in animals, but it is not
      known whether it will have the same effects in humans. PX-866 has been studied in some cancer
      patients to find out safe doses that can be given but it has not undergone study in prostate
      cancer. This study will be the first study of PX-866 in prostate cancer.

      Health Canada has not approved the sale or use of PX-866 to treat prostate cancer, although
      they have approved its use in this clinical trial.
