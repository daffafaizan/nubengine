    
      This is a cross-over study with randomization in terms of 4 treatments: two long-acting
      muscarinic antagonists (tiotropium and glycopyrronium), one long-acting beta-adrenoceptor
      agonist(indacaterol) and placebo.

      Each subject will pass 4 experimental random sessions, separated by at least 48 hours given
      the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs tested. During each of the 4 sessions, blood
      pressure will be measured. Drugs inhaled by the patient will be prepared and administered by
      the nurse according to the randomization schedule. Patients and investigators will be blinded
      regarding the administered drug/placebo (anonymized inhaler). After 15 minutes (at rest, at
      neutral temperature), patients will have continuous measurement of blood pressure and heart
      rate (by a sphygmomanometer) (1) in supine position and (2) after a passive tilt test on a
      tilt test table.

      A flow-volume loop (BDV) will be performed after the tilt table test (measurement of Forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FVC).
