      the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccines for cancer patients with
      brain metastases (BM). BM patients will undergo tumor resection or biopsy and the tumor
      tissues will be analyzed for the expression of tumor antigens and immune-related genes. The
      patients will be immunized with DCs pulsed with mRNA encoded tumor antigens. Patients will be
      immunized with DC vaccines on a biweekly basis. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The
      objective of this study is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines and to
      deterimine the antitumor specific T cell responses. The efficacy of the vaccines will be
      determined using RANO-BM criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival.
