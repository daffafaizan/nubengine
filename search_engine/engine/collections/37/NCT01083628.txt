    
      Background: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression is efficacious, but
      effectiveness is limited when implemented in low-income settings due to engagement
      difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and early discontinuation of
      treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of
      depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.

      Objectives: The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood
      monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to
      display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT
      treatment for depression. Specifically, the investigators aim to assess whether the text
      messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in
      duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9)
      symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income
      Spanish speaking Latino patients.

      Methods: Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group
      CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a
      text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a
      daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment
      reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS)
      for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills.
