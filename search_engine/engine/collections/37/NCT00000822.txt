      progression since both T helper and cytotoxic function against HIV decrease with disease
      progression.

      Patients with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3 are randomized to receive
      HIV-1 MN rgp160 (Immuno-AG) or control. Patients with CD4 counts 50-499 cells/mm3 receive
      didanosine (ddI) and are then randomized to receive ddI plus vaccine or control. Vaccine or
      control is given every 4 weeks for 7 injections, then every 8 weeks for 6-12 months or until
      1 year after the last patient is randomized. AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96: Stratum 1 is composed
      of 16 subjects with CD4+ T cells greater than or equal to 500 mm3. These subjects are
      randomized to vaccine therapy or vaccine control. HIV-1 MN rgp160 vaccine or control is given
      every 4 weeks for 7 injections (Schedule 1), then every 8 weeks until 52 weeks after the last
      subject has been randomized to stratum 1 (Schedule 2). Stratum 1 patients receive ddI or d4T
      only if their CD4 cell count has a sustained decrease on 2 consecutive occasions 10-14 days
      apart and/or HIV/RNA plasma viral load increases to greater than 10,000 copies/ml on 2
      consecutive occasions 10-14 days apart. Stratum 2 is composed of 30 subjects with CD4+ T
      cells 200-400/mm3; accrual to this stratum was activated based on preliminary results from
      stratum 1 (closed as of 4/5/97). Patients on stratum 2 (open as of 3/4/97) initially receive
      ritonavir at escalating doses for 2 weeks. Subjects then have ddI and d4T added to the
      regimen for 7 weeks. Subjects are then randomized to vaccine therapy or vaccine control every
      4 weeks for 7 injections, with ritonavir/ddI/d4T continued during vaccine therapy.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 3/23/98: As of 6/1/98 vaccine consists of sodium chloride for injection
      (USP).
