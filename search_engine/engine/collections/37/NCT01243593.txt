      Children. All children are given fentanyl plus local anesthetic wound infiltration for
      intraoperative analgesia. A retrospective audit demonstrated that 63% of children required
      additional opioid treatment in the early recovery period following surgery. Concern exists
      regarding potential side effects of opioids including nausea or vomiting, respiratory
      depression, pruritus, over-sedation and delayed transition to oral intake. More importantly,
      children may under-report their pain or pain may not be recognized by medical staff leading
      to inadequate provision of analgesia. This suggests that the use of a regional technique,
      such as a TAP block, may benefit children undergoing open pyeloplasty.

      The ultrasound guided TAP block introduces a local anaesthetic to the transversus abdominis
      plane which is one of three muscle layers in the abdominal wall. This results in a block of
      the nerves leading to the abdominal wall thereby reducing pain sensations.
