      fluid of IVF patients.

      Study group: poor prognosis patients: repeated IVF failure, implantation failure, poor
      ovarian response, low sperm quality (according to WHO criteria) Control group: Good prognosis
      patients. Normal sperm count. Heavy metals concentrations will be measured using atomic
      absorption spectrometer, and will be correlated with IVF outcomes: number of mature oocytes
      obtained, fertilizations, embryos quality, and reproductive outcome post embryo transfer.
