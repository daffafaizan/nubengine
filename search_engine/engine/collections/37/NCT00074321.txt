      I. To define the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of CPT-11 (irinotecan
      hydrochloride), oxaliplatin, and capecitabine in three different populations, based on UDP
      glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype (6/6, 6/7, and 7/7).

      II. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic
      cancer.

      III. To examine the differences in the toxicity profile, especially pertaining to hematologic
      and gastrointestinal (GI), and the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of CPT-11,
      oxaliplatin and capecitabine with respect to the UGT1A1 haplotypes.

      IV. Examine the effect of the UGT1A1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and its
      metabolites.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to UGT1A1
      genotype (6/6 vs 6/7 [closed to accrual as of 8/24/06] vs 7/7).

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and oxaliplatin
      IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (QD) on days 2-15. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin,
      and capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6-10 patients (for a total of 12 patients) receive
      treatment at that dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54-84 patients (12-22 for stratum I, 18-28 for stratum II
      [closed to accrual as of 8/24/06], and 24-34 for stratum III) will be accrued for this study
      within approximately 4.4 years.
