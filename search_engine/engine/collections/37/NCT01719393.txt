      hypothesis is that radial arterial pulse spectrum may reflect the airway condition in
      asthmatics. The aims of this study are to investigate the pulse spectrim of the radial artery
      in adult asthmatics, and evaluate its correlation with lung function, asthma control
      status,exhaled nitric oxide, and metabolites in the exhaed breath condensates.
