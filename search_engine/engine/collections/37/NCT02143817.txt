    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 8 weeks combination of WBVT plus
      L-citrulline supplementation on arterial stiffness, endothelial function, BP and muscle
      strength/mass in overweight/obese postmenopausal women.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To investigate if the additive effect of 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline
           supplementation are more efficacious than either treatment alone in ameliorating
           cardiovascular disease risk factors by assessing arterial stiffness (aortic, systemic,
           and leg), aortic BP and wave reflection, and autonomic function (heart rate variability,
           vascular sympathetic activity [low-frequency power of systolic BP variability], and
           baroreflex sensitivity). Flow mediated dilation and circulating levels of adipocytokines
           (adiponectin and leptin) and endothelial-derived vasodilators (NO metabolites [NOx],
           6-keto PGFIa, insulin, and ghrelin) and vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1 [ET-1],8-iso
           PGF2a,vascular endothelium growth factor [VGEF]) will be assessed as secondary outcome
           variables.

        2. To evaluate the extent to which 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline improves body
           composition assessed by changes in fat mass and lean mass using dual-energy x-ray
           absorptiometry and waist circumference.

        3. To determine the additive effect of 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline
           supplementation on muscle strength. These will be evaluated using the eight-repetition
           maximum test for the leg press and chest press exercises
