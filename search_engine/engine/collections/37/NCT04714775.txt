      (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03357250): The aim of the study is to validate the application of
      combinations of several laboratory parameters in early postnatal blood samples, for
      identification of infants, who will suffer from early abnormal neonatal neurological outcome,
      in a population at risk. The population at risk is defined as term and late preterm (>36
      weeks of gestation) human infants following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia with or without
      postnatal resuscitation, and where the combination of laboratory parameters is derived from a
      preliminary study performed in Turkey (AAMBI) using a metabolomics approach.
