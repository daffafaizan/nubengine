      evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug balloon therapy for de novo lesions in patients with
      CHD under the guidance of QFR compared with DES implantation. Based on previous study, the
      incidence rate of target lesion failure is 5%-10% in patients with CHD undergoing DES
      implantation. And in the investigators study the expected incidence rate of target lesion
      failure is up to 5.0 % in patients with CHD after treatment with DCB. Moreover, the
      investigators estimated 10% loss follow-up of these patients in each arm. As a result, a
      total of 220 patients with CHD were required, and with 110 patients per group as a ratio of
      1:1 randomization.
