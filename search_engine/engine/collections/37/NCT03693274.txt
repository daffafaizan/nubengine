      fibromyalgia and other pain conditions leading to central sensitization have limited
      treatment options. The only medications currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia includes pregabalin, milnacipran and
      duloxetine. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) also recommends the
      implementation of an exercise program and cognitive behavioral therapy. A previous
      meta-analysis found weak evidence to support Mindfulness-Based Stress Reductions (MBSR) in
      fibromyalgia patients, however more robust clinical studies are needed. In the midst of an
      opioid crisis, MBSR provides a safer alternative for the treatment of chronic pain.
      Unfortunately, an instructor lead MBSR program is both costly and largely unavailable in
      rural areas of the country. This web-based mindfulness program provides a treatment option
      for patients who would otherwise, not have access to alternative medicine therapies.
