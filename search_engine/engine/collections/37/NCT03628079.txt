      low dose but also at considerably higher doses during months to years against invasive
      echinococcus infections. Recent research has now clearly indicated that mebendazole has
      anticancer effect. Given these observations and the experience of excellent tolerance to
      mebendazole the current clinical trial protocol is based on the repositioning strategy to
      more extensively investigate whether mebendazole could be developed into a useful anticancer
      drug.
