      surgical outcome, level of postoperative care and the length of hospital stay. Too much or
      too little fluid during surgery can affect the patients negatively. The kidneys play an
      imperative role in the regulation of water and sodium homeostasis, however there are lack of
      knowledge in how the anesthesia per se affects renal function. Previous studies have shown
      that volatile anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane can cause fluid retention. Why this
      happens is not completely known.

      We are now investigating the different affects of sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia on
      renal function in patients undergoing basic back surgery to elucidate if there is a
      difference in the risk of developing acute kidney injury.
