      developed to predict different degrees of food allergy has been successfully reported among
      cow's milk protein allergy. This technique provide a more precise and advanced adaptation
      from microarray-based immunoassay (MIA). Using this technique will aid us for the
      differentiation of clinical phenotypes of wheat-allergic patients. This study will be the
      first study to date using this technique aim to determine major IgE-binding epitope among
      immediated-reaction of wheat allergic children to differentiate clinical phenotypes, and may
      lead to further study to develop the new therapeutic approach to wheat-allergic patients.
