      of the causes was Ventilator Induced Diaphragm Dysfunction (VIDD). This VIDD process occurred
      due to thinning process of the diaphragm thickness or decreased diaphragm muscle mass. The
      whole process happened due to inflammatory reaction that usually appeared on patients in
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Thus, this study was aimed to find the relationship between
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with diaphragm thickness of critical patients in ICU.
