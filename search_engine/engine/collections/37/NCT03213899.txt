        -  Prospective cohort study

      Setting:

        -  35-bedded integrated intensive care/ high dependency unit in Ng Teng Fong General
           Hospital. Patients' status can be changed between ICU-status and HD-status within the
           same ICU-/ HD-bed

      Participants:

        -  All adult patients who will be admitted to the unit between August-2015 to October-2016
           for â‰¥ 24 hours

      Intervention:

      Nil. Given the observational nature of this study, no attempt will be made to standardize
      care, including nutritional practices.

      Measurement:

        -  As per routine care, a validated nutritional assessment tool [7-point Subjective Global
           Assessment (7-point SGA)] will be used to determine patients' nutritional status within
           48 hours of ICU admission

        -  The primary outcomes will be hospital mortality and ICU length of stay. To measure
           hospital mortality, all patients will be followed until hospital discharge or death for
           up to one year after ICU admission. For ICU length of stay (in days), duration will be
           measured from the date of the first ICU admission to the date of the first change in
           ICU-status to HD-status or discharge to the general ward

      Analysis:

        -  Modified Cox regression model with robust variance and logistic regression will be used
           to determine the associations between nutritional status and hospital mortality.
           Analyses will be conducted in two ways: 1) presence versus absence of malnutrition, and
           2) dose-dependent association for each 1-point decrease in the 7-point SGA

        -  Multiple linear regression will be applied to determine the associations between
           nutritional status and ICU length of stay
