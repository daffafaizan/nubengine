      top ten leading causes of cancer deaths in the Western world. Patients with PC can be divided
      into three subgroups; resectable (rPC), locally advanced (LAPC) and metastatic (mPC). For
      patients with rPC surgery offers the best chance for long term survival. However it is
      estimated that only 20% of patients have rPC at the time of diagnosis. For patients with
      LACP, invasion of local large vessels is most often the cause for non-resectability. The
      median survival of these patients is between 6 to 12 months and long term survival in is
      extremely rare. The optimal treatment of LAPC is controversial. Treatment strategies vary
      between attempts to "downstage" the tumour to rPC, or treat the patients in a palliative
      setting only. Phase II studies and retrospective series have evaluated various treatments
      regimens and strategies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) alone or in combination
      - chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Results from these trials give no clear answer regarding the best
      treatment strategy. However, data from several studies shows that treatment of LAPC may
      result in shrinkage of the tumour, and thus potentially lead to a resection; also data
      suggests that CRT after chemotherapy improves treatment efficacy. Recent data from patients
      with mPC has show a combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 5-FU (FOLFIRINOX) increases
      response rates from 10% to 30% and median survival to 11.1 months. The promising efficacy
      makes it natural to attempt this treatment in patients with LAPC.
