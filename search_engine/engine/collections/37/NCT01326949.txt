      endoscopic band ligation combined with non-selective beta-blockers and, when necessary, the
      anticoagulation is started after the varices eradication.

      TIPS is just regarded as the second-line therapy for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal
      bleeding in cirrhotic patients. However, this indication might be changed in the setting of
      PVT. Indeed, the risk to benefit ratio of TIPS in cirrhotic patients with PVT for the
      prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding has never been evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of TIPS and endoscopic band
      ligation + propranolol in decompensated cirrhosis patients with PVT and a history of variceal
      bleeding in the past 6 weeks.
