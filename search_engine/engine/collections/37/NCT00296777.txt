      standard dichotic listening tests, EEG, ERP and an f-MRI while performing a neuropsychologic
      test, the Simon. Once testing is completed, patients will be treated in an open treatment
      trial of SSRI. Non-responders will then receive Bupropion followed by Tricyclic
      Antidepressant if still depressed. While our main purpose is to correlate imaging testing
      with other measures of brain functioning, we also intend to see whether f-MRI findings
      demonstrate specific brain areas which differ between responders and non-responders. At the
      end of SSRI treatment, patients will have a second f-MRI scan to investigate any changes
      treatment and/or response may have caused.
