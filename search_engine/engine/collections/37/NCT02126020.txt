    
      This is an unmasked, prospective, multicenter clinical trial of four patients that are
      candidates for a Boston Keratoprosthesis or have had prior KPro surgery and have a diagnosis
      of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome (TENS) or mucous
      membrane pemphigoid (MMP). Only one eye per patient will be considered for inclusion.

      This is a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of topical infliximab 10
      mg/mL eye drops. Research subjects will be required to administer infliximab eye drops four
      times per day for three months followed by twice daily administration for nine months. The
      subjects will be monitored while on the study medication as well as for one year following
      discontinuation of the drug. The total study duration for each patient will be two years.
