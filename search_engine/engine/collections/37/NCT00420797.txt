    
      Faecal seepage and even frank incontinence at night can be a problem for approximately 30% of
      patients who have undergone ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). Nocturnal seepage may be a
      problem in patients who do not have gross incontinence, or who may even have no incontinence
      during the day. Although baseline continence during the day is maintained by involuntary
      control of the internal anal sphincter, this can be supplemented by voluntary contraction of
      the external sphincter. While sleeping, this supplementary external sphincter effect is lost
      and internal anal sphincter tone is reduced, leading to seepage. This is obviously
      distressing and leads some patients to wear a pad to reduce the soiling that may occur.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride gel,
      applied three times a day, on the change from baseline to the end of study (8 weeks)in the
      faecal incontinence score (St Mark's) with passive faecal incontinence after ileo-anal pouch
      construction, compared with placebo.
