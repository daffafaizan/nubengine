    
      The purpose of this study is to study whether percutaneous chronic total occlusion (CTO)
      revascularization, by the use of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), stenting,
      guidewire, and catheter, improves a patient's quality of life and their left ventricular
      function, reduces angina severity, and improves long-term survival. The study will consist of
      the two following groups:

      Retrospective patients This group will consist of consecutive patients that have already
      undergone CTO PCI by the PHI CTO team.

        -  The patients will be contacted by telephone for informed consent and will be asked how
           they are feeling and if they have seen any doctors for their heart conditions. The
           patient will also be asked if they are taking antiplatelet medicines as prescribed, and
           if there have been any changes in on their medicines.

        -  If more than 12 months have passed since the procedure, the patients will be queried
           regarding medical history

        -  If the patient cannot be contacted, then analysis of data will be limited to
           de-identified data collected from the chart, procedure angiogram, and the procedure
           report.

      Prospective patients This group will consist of patients in which the CTO procedure will be
      performed by the PHI CTO team.

        -  A clinical assessment will be performed before the stent procedure

        -  A blood sample will be taken for routine blood chemistry and hematology

        -  Medications will be prescribed to prevent blood clots

        -  Follow-up will occur 6 and 12 months post-procedure
