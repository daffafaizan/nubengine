    
      PARADIGM is a prospective, international, multi-center, single arm study to demonstrate the
      safety and effectiveness of the AVP III for percutaneous, transcatheter closure of PVLs
      occurring after aortic or mitral valve replacement with a surgically-implanted mechanical or
      bioprosthetic valve. The study will be conducted at up to 25 clinical sites in the US, EU and
      Canada, where a total of 200 subjects with a clinically significant PVL will undergo an AVP
      III implant procedure for PVL closure. Pre-procedural Baseline and follow-up assessments at
      Discharge, 30 days, 6 months and 1 year will include echocardiography, physical examinations,
      lab measurements and questionnaires to assess PVL severity, prosthetic valve function,
      hemolytic anemia, heart failure symptoms, and quality of life. Adverse events will be
      recorded throughout the study.
