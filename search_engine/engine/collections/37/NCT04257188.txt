    
      A prospective, one-center clinical trial to identify the safety and feasibility of sutureless
      pars-plana vitrectomy performed in sub-tenon anesthesia.

      Background:

      In Germany pars-plana vitrectomies are mostly performed in general anesthesia. This requires
      the immediate availability of a trained anesthesiology team, which is not always granted,
      especially in urgent eye disease (i.e. endophthalmitis, high risk retinal detachment).
      Furthermore, some patients are not suitable for general anesthesia due to systemic diseases
      (i.e. cardio-vascular diseases). There are several procedures of local ocular anesthesia
      (i.e. peribulbar, retrobulbar, sub-tenon anesthesia). The main advantage of sub-tenon
      anesthesia is the use of a blunt cannula limiting the risk of potential complications.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of local sub-tenon anesthesia
      procedure for sutureless vitrectomy (anesthetic mixture: 2ml xylocaine and 2ml bupivacaine)
      in a prospective clinical study design.

      Objectives:

      Primary outcome: The evaluation of 1. sensation of pain, 2. patients' intraoperative
      discomfort and 3. visual sensations using the standardized questionnaires (WONG-BAKER Faces
      Scale, Visual Analog Scale and individual questions).

      Secondary Outcome: The evaluation of 1. chemosis, 2. eye movement, 3. surgeon's general
      feeling of comfort during surgery (rating scale).
