      phase I/II trial to determine the value of BNCT in the treatment of subjects who have
      undergone surgery for glioblastoma, but glioblastoma has not been treated with radiation
      therapy or chemotherapy. The neutron irradiation site is the FiR 1 reactor site, located at
      Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland, about 6 kilometers from the Helsinki University Central Hospital,
      Helsinki, where patient evaluation and post-irradiation care will take place.

      BPA is infused as a fructose complex (BPA-F) into a peripheral vein over 2 hours prior to
      neutron irradiation. Blood samples will be taken before starting the BPA infusion, and
      thereafter at 20 to 40 minute intervals during the infusion, following infusion, and after
      delivering neutron irradiation to monitor the blood boron concentration. The blood samples
      will be analyzed for boron to estimate the average blood boron level during neutron
      irradiation. The first 12 patients are treated using a BPA dose of 290 mg/kg, following which
      the dose of BPA is increased stepwise to 500 mg/kg, provided that unacceptable toxicity will
      not occur.

      All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
