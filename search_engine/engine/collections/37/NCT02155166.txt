    
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of Injectable intracervical anesthesia in comparison with a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) on the pain scores immediately after insertion
      of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in women without previous
      vaginal delivery. As secondary objectives, the effects of the interventions on the pain
      scores assessed 2 and 6 hours after the LNG-IUS insertion, the level of discomfort associated
      with the insertion procedure and the ease of insertion of the LNG-IUS will be evaluated.

      Design: open randomized controlled trial Setting: Outpatient contraceptive services Patients:
      100 women who want to use the LNG-IUS Interventions: 100 women will be randomized into two
      groups: a) use of a NSAID (ibuprofen, 400 mg) 1 hour before the LNG-IUS insertion; and b) 2%
      lidocaine intracervical injection. These women will be evaluated immediately after the
      LNG-IUS insertion, and then 2 hours and 6 hours after it.

      Main outcome measures: Two pain scales will be used (the visual analogue scale and the facial
      pain scale) in addition to assessing the ease of insertion (as rated by the provider) and the
      level of discomfort from the procedure (as rated by the patient). Multivariate logistic
      regression will be performed to analyze the predictors associated with moderate/severe pain.
