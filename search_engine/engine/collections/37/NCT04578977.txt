      dislocations are associated with a fracture. (1) Terrible triad injury of the elbow is a
      complex injury that is classically defined as elbow dislocation along with fractures of the
      coronoid process of the ulna and the radial head. The injury is usually associated with
      typical soft-tissue disruptions (with common involvement of the lateral collateral ligament
      complex, elbow joint capsule, as well as the common extensor and flexor-pronator tendons)
      Complications of terrible triad injuries include redislocation, residual instability, elbow
      stiffness, heterotopic ossification, fracture malunion or nonunion, elbow arthrosis,
      olecranon bursitis, ulnar or radial nerve palsy (due to the surgical approach or placement of
      hardware), and hardware related complications.

      Management of trrible triade is conservative or surgical treatment ,in this study we will use
      surgical treatment and make evaluation of it.

      Surgical treatment involves radial head repair or replacement ,medial and lateral collateral
      ligament repair and coronoid fracture fixation.

      aim of research isFunctional assessment of surgical treatment of terrible triade injury of
      the elbow according to Mayo elbow performance score, According to the system of Mayo, scores
      of 90-100 are classified as excellent, 75-89 as good, 60-74 as fair, and 0-59 as poor
