      In phase Ib, a maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled in the dose-finding period to
      determine the RP2D, dependent on the toxicity of the study drugs. The response rates of
      salvage chemotherapy regimen in R/R DLBCL were reported to be within the range of 35-65%.3
      Assuming that the response rate of traditional salvage therapy has an overall response rate
      of 35% (H0=0.35) and that our experimental regimen would increase it to 50% (H1=0.50), the
      estimated sample size according to the Simon's two-stage minimal design will be 49 in the
      second phase.1 Briefly, among the 31 patients recruited during the first stage, the response
      should be seen in at least 10 of the cases, the lowest threshold for the trial to be moved
      into the second stage of the phase II part. Furthermore, for the RPR regimen to be deemed
      effective, a response must be demonstrated in at least 21 of the whole 49 patients enrolled
      in the phase II period. This would achieve a power of 80%, with a two-sided type I error rate
      of 10%. An additional 7 patients will be recruited, for an estimated dropout rate of 10%.
