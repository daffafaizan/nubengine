      overload in African American families and to identify the genetic defect. The iron status of
      index subjects and family members will be determined by measuring transferrin saturation and
      serum ferritin, and the genetic pattern will be studied with segregation analysis. The
      chromosomal localization of the iron-loading locus will be pursued by determining HLA
      haplotypes, by testing for HFE gene mutations, by sequencing portions of genes for molecules
      involved in iron metabolism, by analyzing polymorphisms in these genes by PCR, by employing
      molecular methods to screen the genome, and by testing for linkage to iron phenotype with lod
      scores. Loci for proteins important in iron metabolism will be examined as candidate genes.
