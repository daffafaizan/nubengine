      cardiogenic shock to bridge to decision,ventricular assist devices,or transplant.Close
      monitoring of cardiac output, especially in patients before and after intervention (such as
      volume expansion, diuresis, vasoconstriction, vasodilation therapy), can help to adjust the
      treatment strategy. Hemodynamic monitoring in ECMO patients requires familiarity with the
      underlying pathophysiology and circulatory mechanics of extracorporeal flow.Limited to the
      actual clinical situation of patients, one or two hemodynamic monitoring methods may be
      accepted. Is there consistency between different hemodynamic monitoring results? And whether
      hemodynamic monitoring can accurately detect the changes of these parameters before and after
      intervention is an important issue in clinical practice. This study will provide important
      reference for VA-ECMO patients how to choose appropriate hemodynamic monitoring tools and how
      to interpret the results of hemodynamic monitoring.
