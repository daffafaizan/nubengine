      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      berzosertib (M6620) in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of M6620 in combination with irinotecan.

      II. To document anti-tumor activity. III. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of M6620 and irinotecan.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify molecular subpopulations of patients with increased sensitivity to the
      irinotecan and M6620 combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and M6620 IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then at 3 and 6
      months.
