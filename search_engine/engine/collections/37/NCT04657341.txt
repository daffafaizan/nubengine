    
      This is a prospective, multicenter study.More than 1000 participants will enrolled.Most of
      them with CEUS,MRI and pathological follow up.When enhanced MRI is needed in the neoadjuvant
      cycle of patients, Sonazoid-CEUS examination is added at this time point, and postoperative
      pathology will be used as the gold standard, so as to compare the ability of the two imaging
      examinations in judging the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Investigators will also record the parameter information of imaging examination, pathological
      type of pathological examination and immunohistochemical index, etc.Contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound includes lesion location, initial peak tumor volume, 1-minute tumor volume,
      2-minute tumor volume, and 5-minute tumor volume, as well as the time for contrast
      enhancement, contrast agent clearance, and contrast agent clearance.Whether there is no
      enhancement area in the lesion after contrast enhancement, shape after contrast enhancement,
      edge after contrast enhancement, order of enhancement, uniformity of enhancement, intensity
      enhancement, pattern of enhancement, clear boundary after contrast enhancement, aspect ratio
      after contrast enhancement, etc.The magnetic field strength of the equipment is planned to be
      recorded in the enhanced MRI information, the name of the MRI contrast agent, the lesion
      location, the size of the lesion, and the scanning performance are enhanced (lump-like
      enhancement, non-lump-like enhancement, point-like enhancement), time-signal intensity
      enhancement curve, DWI signal, ADC value, etc.
