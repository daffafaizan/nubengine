      exploratory, novel endpoint. The results of the primary analysis at the interim for N=12
      patients showed results that generally favored pregabalin but were not statistically
      significant compared to placebo. Based on the estimated conditional power, this result is
      unlikely to change with full recruitment of N=24 patients and therefore the data monitoring
      committee recommended termination of the trial. The decision to terminate the trial was not
      based on any safety concerns.
