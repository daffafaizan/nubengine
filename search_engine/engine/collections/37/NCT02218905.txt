      chronic diseases arena. Bu the reference values for normative population is not available.
      Hence the present study aimed at finding relation between the anthropometric variables (age,
      height, weight) and number of sit to stand repetitions. The volunteers will be asked to sit
      to stand in an arm less chair of 40 inches height. The number of repetition will be
      correlated and regression equations will be sought out relating number of repetitions and
      anthropometric variables through best fit regression equations
