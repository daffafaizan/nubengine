      Thirty-six middle schools in Hawaii were randomly assigned to participate as either a
      treatment or control school. Treatment school teachers were trained to deliver Pono Choices.
      Control school teachers did not receive training and chose their own middle school sexual
      health education curricula.

      Over 1,700 7th and 8th grade students in 34 Hawaii schools enrolled into the study. As part
      of the study, students were invited to participate in baseline and follow-up surveys. The
      student survey responses were used to determine the impact Pono Choices has on teen pregnancy
      and STI prevention measures.
