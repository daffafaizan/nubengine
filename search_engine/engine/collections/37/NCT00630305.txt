      sessions of approximately 30 minutes duration each. Informed consent obtained. Baseline
      measurements of visual acuity and corneal and conjunctival physiology will be recorded. An
      examination of the endothelium of the corneas will be conducted using the specular
      microscope, readings obtained at 5 locations on each cornea: one in the centre and one in
      each of the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal peripheral regions, approximately 2mm from
      the limbal margin. The assigned lenses will be inserted according to a fixed-allocation
      randomization schedule, where each session follows an optimized 2- period simultaneous
      crossover design, which specifies lenses to be used in each of the four sessions. Lenses will
      be worn for 20 minutes and then removed. Endothelial specular microscopy will be conducted at
      20 minutes with the lenses on. A final evaluation of corneal and conjunctival physiology will
      be performed prior to subject clearance from the study.
