      patients, such as elders and diabetics, because of frequency reduction of hypotensive
      episodes and symptoms during the treatment and a better control to metabolic aspects (such as
      metabolic acidosis).

      The Blood Volume Control (BVC) is a tool, that allows to improve the cardiovascular tolerance
      to the treatment, especially in hypotension-prone patients, appearing promising in the
      correction of the arterial hypertension induced by the hydro-saline overload.

      The use of BVC in AFB has been tested to verify the behaviour of the kinetics of electrolyte
      (in particular of bicarbonate) and it has got good results, in terms of a further improvement
      in treatment tolerance, for critical patients However, this therapy (AFB+BVC) was not yet
      evaluated as the dialysis tolerance improvement in diabetics concern, nor the relative
      contribution given by each factor in achieving this result.

      The study, 9 months long, is aimed to verify the treatment tolerance of insulin requiring
      diabetic patients, by using standard bicarbonate dialysis (BD), or Acetate Free Biofiltration
      (AFB) and/or a Blood Volume Control(BVC). The study is divided in three phases: the first
      one, three months long, is the baseline in standard bicarbonate dialysis, then all the
      patients are shifted to AFB with BVC, for other three months, while the last three months
      long phase, after a randomization, has the aim to identify the relative contribution of each
      factor (absence of acetate in the bath or BVC) in the treatment tolerance improvement(if
      any). The treatment tolerance will be evaluated considering the frequency of intradialytic
      hypotensive events.
