      Tracheal intubation an action that allows the insertion of a tube through the vocal cords and
      fixation by the balloon inflation is a definitive airway. The use of the Laryngeal Mask
      Airway for fast control of the airway is known for many years. The Laryngeal Mask Airway and
      others similar devices are known as Supraglottic Airway Devices and are inserted blind in the
      oropharynx and allow a fast oxygenation and ventilation of the patients.The aim of this study
      is to examine the effectiveness of the Laryngeal Mask Airway to achieve a definitive airway
      by unskilled practitioners in anesthetized patients with the head in neutral position (trauma
      model)

      The hypothesis is that definitive airway obtaining with Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway will
      be more success and faster compared to the standard way of direct laryngoscope. If the
      hypothesis is proven, this research will be very important implications for the management of
      the airway describing pre-hospital and in particular military scenarios.
