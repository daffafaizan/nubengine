      pain. Here, we investigate the feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of the combination
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and peripheral muscle stimulation
      (rPMS) in chronic tinnitus in a pilot study. rTMS is considered to interact with neural
      tinnitus networks. rPMS is suggested to bring relief to muscle tension. This is an one arm
      study where explorative analyses will be done with special consideration on patients
      suffering from neck pain in the analysis.
