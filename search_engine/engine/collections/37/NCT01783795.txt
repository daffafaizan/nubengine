      Â½ teaspoons for children), of blood from the subject's arm to obtain white blood cells. These
      white blood cells will be used as a source of DNA for genetic testing. The investigator will
      use the isolated DNA to try to identify the gene that is defective in Dent Disease by
      comparing it with the structure of genes in normal individuals, patients with Dent Disease,
      and family members for Dent Disease.
