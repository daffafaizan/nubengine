      transfusion to sustain life. Deficient synthesis of the beta chain leads to imbalanced chain
      synthesis with an excess of alpha globin. This alpha globin precipitates, causing ineffective
      erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. Hydroxyurea is a cell-cycle specific agent
      that blocks DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonuclease reductase, the enzyme that converts
      ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Administration of hydroxyurea to primates and more
      than 300 patients with sickle cell anemia has been frequently, but not invariably associated
      with a substantial increase in synthesis of gamma globin. In patients with homozygous
      beta-thalassemia, enhanced gamma globin synthesis could partially compensate for the
      deficient synthesis of beta globin rendering chain synthesis more balanced and reducing the
      relative excess of alpha chains. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that
      chronic daily low dose administration of hydroxyurea will enhance gamma globin synthesis,
      increase red cell production and partially or substantially correct the anemia in patients
      with homozygous beta-thalassemia. The effect of treatment will be monitored by serial
      determination of the hemoglobin and hematocrit. The relationship between response to therapy
      and the specific beta-globin mutation(s) will also be analyzed. This study will therefore
      examine a cohort of patients not previously treated with hydroxyurea.
