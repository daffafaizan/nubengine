      cavernous hemangiomas, benign venous malformations, telangiectasia, port-wine stains,
      pigmented lesions and erythema of rosacea. As shown by a retrospective study, in over 85% of
      the cases, using IPL in subjects with ocular rosacea also alleviated the symptoms of DED
      caused by MGD. No serious adverse events were recorded, suggesting that IPL therapy
      administered close to the ocular orbits is safe (provided that the eyes are shielded).
      However, the above mentioned study was retrospective. Therefore, additional evidence is
      needed in order to substantiate the hypothesis that alleviation of MGD symptom was
      facilitated by IPL treatments.

      The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and efficacy of IPL treatment for
      reducing the symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in subjects with MGD. The study hypothesis is
      that in a study population of subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe MGD, 4 sessions of
      IPL therapy with the M22 system, followed by expression of the MGs, will cause a significant
      increase in tear break-up time post-treatment, compared to pre-treatment.
