      glucocorticoids and oral glucocorticoids, both of which are associated with significant
      ocular and systemic toxicities. Steroid-sparing therapies are limited by variable and
      unpredictable efficacy, prolonged time until clinical response, medication intolerance, and
      difficulties obtaining payor approval. As a result, it is not uncommon that treating
      physicians must choose between excessive glucocorticoid toxicity versus poor control of
      ocular inflammation. Ongoing ocular inflammation, in turn, leads to eventual visual loss and
      occasionally blindness.

      There is a need for a more reliable, expeditious therapy that can be used as an alternative
      to glucocorticoids in sarcoidosis uveitis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, through activation of
      melanocortin receptors on leukocytes, can dampen immune responses through non-glucocorticoid
      dependent mechanisms. The proposed study will aim to define whether there is effectiveness
      for ACTHAR gel in these patients, delineate an effect dosing regimen, and provide information
      about the safety of this approach for moderate to severe ocular sarcoidosis.

      ACTHAR is a 39-amino acid peptide natural form of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that was
      initially approved in 1952 by the FDA. It has since been approved for 19 indications
      including respiratory sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and infantile spasms.
