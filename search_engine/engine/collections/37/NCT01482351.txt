      apnea-hypopnea index â‰¥ 10. Groups were: (1) MCI, OSA, and CPAP adherent (MCI+CPAP); (2) MCI,
      OSA, CPAP nonadherent(MCI-CPAP). There were 68 MCI+OSA participants at baseline, and 14 (21%)
      dropped out during the 1 year follow-up. At 1 year, n=54, with MCI+CPAP group n=29, and
      MCI-CPAP group n=25. Statistically significant improvements in psychomotor/cognitive
      processing speed in the MCI+CPAP group versus the MCI-CPAP group were observed at 1 year
      after adjustment for age, race, and marital status. There were small to moderate effect sizes
      (ES) for memory, attention, daytime sleepiness, and everyday function, favoring the MCI+CPAP
      group versus the MCI-CPAP group.
