      correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for the test-retest reliability. The internal
      consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha Coefficient. Construct validity and
      discriminant validity were calculated, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory
      factor analysis (CFA) were employed.
