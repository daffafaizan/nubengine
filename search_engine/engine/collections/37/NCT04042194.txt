      augmentation, limited supply of donor tissue because of palatal vessels and nerves, and
      postoperative pain may require alternative methods.

      The purpose of this study is to reduce the crestal bone resorption around the implant site by
      augmenting the Peri-Implant Soft Tissue with T-PRF (titanium prepared platelet-rich fibrin)
      or CTG and to compare the effectiveness of the two techniques.

      Through simultaneous augmentation of the soft tissue by T-PRF or CTG, a total of 30 implants
      were implanted in 30 patients (12 males, 18 females) with a mean age of 38.4 years. In the
      test group, implants were placed in thin tissues and thickened with T- PRF membrane at the
      same time, while in the control group, implants were placed in thin tissues and thickened
      with CTG at the same time. During the surgery (T 0 ) and at postoperative 3 months (T 1 ),
      keratinised tissue width (KTW) and Peri-Implant soft tissue thickness (STT) were measured
      from three points: occlusal part of the alveolar crest (OAC), midbuccal mucosa level (MBML),
      and over 1 mm of mucogingival junction (MGJ1).
