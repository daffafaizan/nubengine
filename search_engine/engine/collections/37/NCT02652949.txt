    
      Data from the Valiant Evo US trial (NCT02652949) and Valiant Evo International trial
      (NCT02625324) were combined to create the global cohort of 100 total subjects, in order to
      obtain 87 evaluable subjects for the primary endpoint. The two protocols are identical, and
      the trials were run simultaneously to enroll subjects concurrently in the United States (US)
      and Outside United States (OUS). The poolability on the primary endpoint between US and OUS
      data will be assessed using Fisher's exact test during the data analysis. Data for both
      trials will be combined and presented as a pooled analysis.
