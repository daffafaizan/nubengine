      study medication is assigned by chance), parallel study (each group of participants will be
      treated at the same time) of guselkumab in healthy participants. Approximately 140
      participants will be randomly assigned in the ratio 2:2:2:1 in to 4 treatment groups: Group 1
      (SC injection of lyophilized formulation), Group 2 (subcutaneous [SC] injection of liquid
      formulation with PFS-U), Group 3 (SC injection of liquid formulation with PFS-FID), and Group
      4 (IV infusion of liquid formulation). The study consists of 3 phases: screening (up to 4
      weeks), open-label treatment and inpatient follow up (1 week) and outpatient follow up (11
      weeks). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, injection-site reactions, and clinical laboratory tests. The
      total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 16 weeks.
