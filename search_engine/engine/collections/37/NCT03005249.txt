      epidemiological investigation of cerebral palsy in 2004 has reported that 2.74â€° (about
      6.50-9.75 million) of children suffered from cerebral palsy. The costs of medical expenses,
      living allowance and nursing care can go up to RMB 20000-50000 yuan per year for each child
      with cerebral palsy and thus China will expend RMB 120-300 billion yuan per year for children
      with cerebral palsy. With full liberalization of two-child policy, there is an increasing
      number of second babies born to women who are 35 years or older. Thus, the incidence of
      cerebral palsy tends to increase. There is currently no cure for cerebral palsy, resulting in
      a heavy burden for families and on society. Recent clinical trials performed in countries
      outside China have demonstrated that stem cell therapy is likely the most effective method to
      treat cerebral palsy. Fifteen trials regarding stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy have been
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. In China, there have been no standardized registered
      trials regarding stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy, which greatly restricts its clinical
      application. In October 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission and the Food
      and Drug Administration of China jointly announced the premier stem cell clinical research
      institutions, making performing standardized trials regarding stem cell therapy for cerebral
      palsy in China possible.
