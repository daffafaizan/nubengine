    
      Method: This prospective multicentric observational cohort study enrolls participants of 75
      years and over with symptomatic hip or knee OA for more than three months, hospitalized in
      seven geriatric departments of three hospitals of "Assistance Publique - HÃ´pitaux de Paris",
      for any cause of admission. Quality of care for OA before hospitalization is assessed by the
      Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elderly's (ACOVE) quality indicators (QI) for OA, using a
      questionnaire. The primary endpoint is the pass rate for the ACOVE's QI about referral to an
      orthopedic surgeon for patients with severe functionally compromising knee or hip OA. The
      secondary endpoints are the pass rates for the six others ACOVE's QI for OA (annual
      assessment of functional status and degree of pain ; exercise therapy for patients with newly
      diagnosed knee OA ; education regarding the natural history, treatment, and self- management
      of OA ; acetaminophen as first-line pharmacologic therapy ; advising patients treated with
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of their risks ; offering prophylaxis with a
      proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol to patients treated with non-selective NSAIDs) and other
      elements of hip or knee OA care not assessed by the seven QI (including use of opioid
      analgesics, NSAIDs, intra-articular infiltrations, joint replacements). The sample is
      described with a rheumatologic assessment including Western Ontario and MACmaster
      universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and Kellgren-Laurence classification, and with a
      geriatric assessment including nutritional status, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scores, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
      score, Timed Up and Go walking test, modified Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment (mSEGA)
      scale and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G). Participants also complete
      the 12-Item Short Form Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) quality of life questionnaire. They receive
      a call twelve months after inclusion to collect vital status, orthopedic consultation and
      joint replacement during the last year.
