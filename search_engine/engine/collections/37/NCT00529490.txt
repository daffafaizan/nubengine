    
      Prospective, randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of hypertonic
      lactate solution, compared to Ringer's Lactate as fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic
      stability in post-coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) patients. Patients who were eligible
      received either hypertonic lactate solution or Ringer's Lactate post-CABG observed in the
      first 12 hours in the ICU when fluid resuscitation was needed.
