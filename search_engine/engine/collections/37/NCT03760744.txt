      for visualizing lymphatic circulation dysfunction to test a fundamental hypothesis about
      secondary lymphedema conservative decongestive therapy. Breast cancer treatment-related
      lymphedema (BCRL) arises secondary to surgical axillary lymph node (LN) dissection and
      irritation, and is a chronic and lifelong condition affecting a high 21.4% of patients
      receiving common breast cancer therapies. Persons with secondary lymphedema following
      axillary lymph node removal also include undergoing treatment for other cancers, such as
      melanoma involving the upper body, necessitating the need for axially lymph node removal.

      Improving lymphedema management represents a major clinical need, and emerging efforts focus
      on improving quality of life through optimizing post-surgical complex decongestive therapy
      (CDT), and exploring novel pharmacological and surgical procedures. Here, the investigators
      will perform a repeated-measures cross-over trial to test the hypothesis that mobilization of
      protein enriched hardened tissue using graded negative pressure therapy in conjunction with
      complete decongestive therapy (CDT) is more effective to standard CDT alone for secondary
      lymphedema management. Both of these conservative physical therapy treatments are commonly
      employed for treatment of secondary lymphedema.
