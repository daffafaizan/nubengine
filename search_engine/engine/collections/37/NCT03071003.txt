    
      This is a randomised, double blind, multiple dose, safety and PK study. Three cohorts of 12
      subjects will be administered with three different dose regimens.

      Screening assessments will be carried out within 14 days before administration of the
      investigational medicinal product (IMP). Eligible subjects will be asked to return for the
      treatment period.

      Cohort 1: 12 subjects will receive 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo once daily for 7 days.

      Cohort 2: 12 subjects will receive 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo twice daily for 6 days and a
      single dose of 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo in the morning on Day 7.

      Cohort 3: 12 subjects will receive 43.5 mg SENS-401 or placebo twice daily for 6 days and a
      single dose of 43.5 mg SENS-401 or placebo in the morning on Day 7.

      Subjects will be asked to attend Simbec 5-7 days after administration of the last dose for a
      post study visit. If they are withdrawn from the study, they will still be asked to attend
      for an end of study assessment. Subjects may be asked to return again if we need to follow
      them up.
