      increased hopsital cost. This research is being done to measure how often delirium after
      spine surgery occurs and to see if there are ways to predict if delirium will develop. We
      hypothesize that impaired cerebral autoregulation may be a possible mechanism for
      postoperative delirium. We will measure intraoperative cerebral autoregulation and assess the
      relationship with postoperative dleirium. The results from this study will provide important
      information on a possible mechanism and predictor of delirium.
