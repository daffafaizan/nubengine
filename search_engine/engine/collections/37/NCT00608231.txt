      movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. Because of the
      uniqueness of each individual brain, the surgery to implant a DBS electrode requires detailed
      anatomic and physiological information for each patient. The anatomic data is obtained before
      surgery via a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the patient's brain. Physiological
      data is obtained during the operation via micro-electrode recording of the patient's brain
      and neurological examination of the patient. Therefore, DBS surgery can be uncomfortable to
      patients, as it can be very time consuming and requires the patient to be awake and
      attentive.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that sedation induced by Dexmedetomidine at levels appropriate
           for awake, DBS surgery has no significant effect on electrophysiological parameters of
           DBS micro-electrode recordings.

        2. To test the hypothesis that sedation induced by Dexmedetomidine at levels appropriate
           for awake, DBS surgery have no significant effects on neurological findings and/or
           patient cooperation during neurological examination.
