      barrier in pseudophakic eyes, leading to an increase in macular thickness, compared to a
      non-BAK containing solution. The secondary hypothesis is that solutions containing BAK will
      increase the permeability of the blood aqueous barrier compared to non-BAK solutions. If the
      hypotheses are confirmed, they may serve as a contraindication to the use of BAK-preserved
      drops in pseudophakic eyes requiring chronic use of medications.

      This is a prospective, randomized, examiner-masked, controlled study involving 44
      pseudophakic eyes of 44 patients. Patients receiving any other eyedrop, with a previous
      history of uveitis, posterior capsule rupture or any other ophthalmic surgery will be
      excluded. Patients will be randomized to the use of a BAK-preserved lubricating drop or to
      the use of a non-preserved lubricating drop q.i.d for one month. Effects on the blood aqueous
      barrier will be objectively measured with a laser flare meter (Kowa, Japan) at baseline, 15
      days and one month after inclusion. Patients will also have OCT images (Cirrus, Zeiss, USA)
      of the macula at the same time intervals to evaluate the possible effects on the blood-retina
      barrier. Macular thickness and the presence of cystoid macular edema will be evaluated at
      each time interval.
