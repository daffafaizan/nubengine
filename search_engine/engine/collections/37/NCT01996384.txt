    
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, pilot trial to study the feasibility and
      acceptability of acupuncture and 5% lidocaine. Patients will be recruited from the patient
      population of the Oregon Health & Science University Vulvar Health Clinic. Thirty (30)
      patients with PLV will be enrolled as study participants into the study. Fifteen (15) will be
      allocated in the treatment (classical) acupuncture + 5% lidocaine group and fifteen (15) will
      be allocated in the control (non-classical) acupuncture + 5% lidocaine group via a computer
      generated randomization program to balance allocation based on four variables: pain
      intensity, smoking status, body mass index, and pain duration.

      The acupuncturist will interview each patient and perform an exam of the pulse and tongue. A
      standardized acupuncture treatment will be assigned, and both groups will receive 18
      acupuncture treatments that follow a standardized protocol on classical or non-classical
      acupuncture points, with or without mild electrical stimulation. All study participants will
      self-apply lidocaine cream to their genital region four times daily during the study.
