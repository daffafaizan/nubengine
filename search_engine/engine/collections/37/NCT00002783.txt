    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant cisplatin/fluorouracil
      (CDDP/5-FU) followed by surgery followed by adjuvant intraperitoneal floxuridine/leucovorin
      in patients with high-risk gastric cancer. II. Assess the quality of life and cost-benefit
      ratio associated with this treatment. III. Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and overall
      staging accuracy of laparoscopy with or without laparoscopic ultrasound in predicting the
      resectability rate (with and without neoadjuvant CDDP/5-FU), response to chemotherapy, and
      accuracy when compared to pathologic findings. IV. Correlate the presence of mutated vs.
      wild-type p53 suppressor oncogenes in endoscopic biopsies and resected tumor specimens with
      clinical outcome (defined as downstaging, failure pattern, and disease-free and overall
      survival) in patients treated with and without neoadjuvant CDDP/5-FU.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 CF Leucovorin calcium,
      NSC-3590 5-FU Fluorouracil, NSC-19893 FUDR Floxuridine, NSC-27640 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy followed by Surgery followed by Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation.
      CDDP/5-FU; followed by total or subtotal radical gastrectomy with D2 dissection; followed by
      FUDR; with CF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be entered over 2-2.5 years.
