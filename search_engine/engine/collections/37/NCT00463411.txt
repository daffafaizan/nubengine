      the microarchitecture of the bones. The clinical significance of osteoporosis is the
      association with fragility fractures and, consequently, increases in both morbidity and
      mortality.

      In men, genetical and life-style factors are known to affect the risk of fractures, however,
      data relating these factors with measures of bone mineral density and fracture risk are
      limited.

      30.000 men aged 60-70 were randomly selected from the Central Office of Civil Registration in
      Denmark. Each receive a questionnaire addressing demographics, potential risk factors of
      osteoporosis, past medical history and medication by mail. In case of consent, the
      participants will complete a full medical examination including DXA and sampling of DNA if
      they have a fragility fracture. At the same time, 2 participants from the study population
      will be selected as control. The study period is 10 years.
