      patients. Fear of pain has contributed to patients' avoidance of seeking orthodontic
      treatment, affect patients' compliance to the treatment and even become a main reason of
      discontinuing orthodontic treatment. Patients have reported using of analgesic particularly
      NSAIDS and Paracetamol during orthodontic treatment to ease the pain. However, NSAIDS have
      been associated with various side effects such as allergic reactions, bleeding disorders and
      gastric ulcers had raised the concern of orthodontists. Studies on animals have shown that
      NSAIDS slower the rate of tooth movement, hence affecting orthodontic treatment efficacy.
      Paracetamol have been reported to cause liver toxicity in the case of over dosage.

      The action of chewing the gum can produce forces to temporary displace the teeth sufficiently
      to allow blood flow through compressed area, preventing the build-up of metabolic products,
      thus reduce the pain severity. In addition, non-sugared chewing gum has anti-caries effect
      which is very important to prevent caries formation during orthodontic treatment.

      This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of chewing gum in pain reduction in
      orthodontic patients and to explore the possibility of chewing gum to be recommended as a
      suitable substitute for analgesics in future practice.
