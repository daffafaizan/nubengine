      acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), and death are often caused by bacterial infections.
      Different sub-groups of patients with cirrhosis at increased risk, i.e. active upper
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage, low protein ascites, history of spontaneous bacterial
      peritonitis (SBP), are known to benefit from prophylactic antibiotics. The investigators
      hypothesize that hospitalized patients with advanced cirrhosis are also at increased risk and
      thus may benefit from preventive treatment. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive an
      antibiotic vs placebo.
