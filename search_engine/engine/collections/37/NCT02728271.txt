      small-sized arteries and veins and is closely related to Wegener's granulomatosis. It is also
      one of the diseases that are associated with antibodies to neutrophils cytoplasmic antigens
      (ANCAs). Patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome often present with refractory asthma,
      eosinophilia, pulmonary infiltrates and mononeuritis multiplex.

      Corticosteroids remain the first line therapy for these patients and most patients respond to
      corticosteroid therapy. However, a small proportion of patients need other immunosuppressive
      agents such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, Rituximab, and azathioprine. Still a number
      of these patients remain refractory and extremely dependent on high dose corticosteroids.

      The principal cause of mortality in these patients is myocarditis and myocardial infarction
      due to coronary arteritis. Without therapy, the 5-year survival in patients with
      Churg-Strauss syndrome is 25%. Although with the 5-year survival is increased to 62% with the
      appropriate therapy, many patients remain refractory to therapy. The long term outcome of
      these patients remains grim.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of total lymphatic irradiation
      to the combination of high dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulins can be given
      safely to these patients and will not only induce disease remission in patients with
      refractory Churg-Strauss syndrome, it would also induce sustained and long period of
      medication-free remission in these patients. Since this combination preparative regimen has
      never been used previously, the investigators will test this hypothesis in a pilot study.
