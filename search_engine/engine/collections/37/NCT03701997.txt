      the surveillance. The network was developed to determine best practice and improve quality in
      the pediatric mechanical circulatory support field. The registry Protocol and Manual of
      Operations will be followed by participating pediatric transplant hospitals. Quality
      assurance of the data will be monitored by the registry's data coordinating center.
