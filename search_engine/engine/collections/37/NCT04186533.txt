      The present study is the first longitudinal randomized control trial to examine if an online
      prefilled grocery shopping cart (i.e., a default cart) nudges individuals with food
      insecurity to purchase healthier groceries compared to receiving nutrition education.

      It was hypothesized that the prefilled online grocery shopping cart (i.e., default condition)
      will result in a significant improvement in the nutritional quality of groceries purchased
      compared to those receiving nutrition education.

      Thirty-eight food pantry users recruited from food pantries in New York in 2018 were enrolled
      in the present study and were given $48.50 to purchase groceries weekly using an online
      grocery website for five weeks. At baseline, participants were instructed to purchase
      groceries keeping in mind nutrition, cost, and taste. For the subsequent four weeks (T1-T4),
      participants were randomized to receive 1) nutrition education or 2) a prefilled online
      grocery shopping cart that met their nutritional needs based on age and sex (Default).

      Our primary nutritional outcomes included HEI scores, calories (kcal), and energy density
      (kcal/grams).
