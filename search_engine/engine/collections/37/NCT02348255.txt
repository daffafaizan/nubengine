      I. Establish the safety of NovoTTF-100A in combination with bevacizumab and BCNU (carmustine)
      in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients who have relapsed after chemoradiation therapy
      (first relapse).

      II. Determine the 6 month overall survival (OS). III. Determine the 6 month progression free
      survival (PFS). IV. Evaluate the effect of this therapy regimen on quality-of-life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks beginning on
      day -7 for up to 13 doses and carmustine IV over 4 hours every 8 weeks beginning on day 1 for
      up to 3 doses. Patients also undergo NovoTTF-100A according to standard procedures starting
      one week before the first dose of carmustine.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
