      six-week intervals with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DC) loaded with
      heat-inactivated autologous HIV in 12 HIV infected patients who had been receiving highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since early chronic infection. Autologous HIV was
      concentrated from plasma (1,500 ml) obtained by plasmapheresis after a 3-month HAART
      interruption (STOP1) performed 78 weeks before therapeutic immunizations, and HAART was
      discontinued again (STOP2) after therapeutic immunization. There was a decrease of set-point
      plasma viral load (PVL) >= 0.5 log after 24 weeks off HAART in 4 out of 12 patients. In
      addition, we observed a significant lengthening in mean doubling time of PVL rebound (p=
      0.01), and significant decreases in the area under the curve of PVL rebound (p= 0.02) and in
      the mean peak PVL (p= 0.004) during the 12 weeks after STOP 2 compared with STOP1. This
      virological response was associated with a weak but significant increase in HIV-1 specific
      CD4 lymphoproliferative response, and with changes in HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cell responses in
      peripheral blood and in lymphoid CTL cells after immunization. In lymphoid tissue, we also
      observed a trend towards a better control of HIV-1 replication coupled with an increase of
      CD4+ and CTL cells. No significant virological or immunological changes occurred in controls.
      We show that a therapeutic vaccine with autologous MD-DC pulsed with heat inactivated
      autologous HIV-1 is feasible, safe and well tolerated and elicited weak and transient
      cellular immune responses against HIV, associated with a partial and transient control of HIV
      replication in some patients.

      we hypothesized that a DC vaccine pulsed with higher amount of autologous virus obtained by
      culture could be more effective than the vaccine we used.
