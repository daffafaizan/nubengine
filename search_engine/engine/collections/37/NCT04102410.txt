      achieve maximum power. This optimization can be evaluated through a force-velocity profile,
      measured from an only sprint on a cycloergometer.

      The hypothesis that force-velocity profile could be used in cardiac rehabilitation in
      coronary patients to induce a force-velocity balance adapted through personalized sessions
      and regular medical follow-up.

      This prospective, controlled, randomized and open label study will attempt to evaluate
      further the relevance of force or velocity training based on the initial force-velocity
      profile of coronary patients included in the cardiac rehabilitation program in the University
      Hospital of Saint-Etienne.
