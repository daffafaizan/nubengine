      arthroplasty due to knee OA were recruited into a randomized, double-blind, prospective and
      controlled study. Participants were recruited at the Orthopedics and Traumatology inpatient
      clinic. The patients were seen postoperative first day and were assigned to receive either
      interferential current or sham interferential current by block randomization. After the
      procedure was explained to each subject, interferential current treatment was applied 2 times
      for 5 days, each treatment was continued approximately 30 minutes. Four electrodes were used
      to deliver quadripolar interferential current Subjects were told that in order to produce an
      effect, the intensity of the stimulator must be maintained at a "strong but comfortable
      level" at all times. The sham interferential current treatment consisted of the placement of
      the same pads for the same time but no electrical stimulation was applied to the probes. At
      the same time, all patients received standard postoperatively rehabilitation program.
      Patients were assessed with pain, range of motion , edema and the amount of used paracetamol.
