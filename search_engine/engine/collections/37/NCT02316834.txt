    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore basal levels and effects of talazoparib (BMN 673) on DNA copy number, loss of
      heterozygosity and mutation, and level of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression
      (together described as "molecular results") in homologous recombination-related pathways
      before and after treatment in women with primary advanced high grade serous ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate molecular results to clinical endpoints including response and survival.

      II. To correlate molecular results to pathologic endpoints including tumor volume and
      apoptosis.

      III. To compare DNA copy number and level of RNA and protein expression in homologous
      recombination-related pathways in tissue from patients treated with BMN 673 to those
      untreated with BMN 673 in the preoperative period.

      IV. To determine the toxicity of daily BMN 673 given preoperatively, with a focus on
      postoperative wound healing.

      V. To determine feasibility of daily BMN 673 given preoperatively.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
