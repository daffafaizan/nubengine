      home-based monitoring devices, here defined as 'Remote Measurement Technologies' (RMTs),
      provide an opportunity to change radically the way in which functional assessment is
      undertaken in AD, RMTs have the potential to obtain better measurements of behavioural and
      biological parameters associated with individual Activities of Daily Living (ADL) when
      compared to the current subjective scales or questionnaires. Divergence from normative ADL
      profiles could objectively indicate the presence of specific incipient functional impairments
      even at the very early stages of AD.

      Therefore, the main hypothesis of this project is that RMTs should allow the detection of
      impairments in functional components of ADLs that occur below the threshold of clinical scale
      detection or disability questionnaires.

      ANANEOS is an independent Brain Registry (patient registry), created as an organized system
      to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes for the
      Neurological Progression Index (NPI) and serves as a real-world view of clinical practice,
      patient outcomes, safety, and can serve a number of evidence development and decision making
      purposes.
