    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to examine the safety, tolerability, and
      immune response to a Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) vaccine in healthy
      adults ages 18 to 50 years old. The plan is for 25 subjects to receive 3 intramuscular
      vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, and 20. The three groups will be enrolled sequentially
      starting with the lowest dose of 10 micrograms per injection in Group 1.

      The hypothesis is that the vaccine is safe and induces immune responses to CHIKV. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine,
      VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP, at three dosages, 10 micrograms (mcg), 20 mcg, and 40 mcg, in healthy
      adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the antibody response against CHIKV VLPs four
      weeks after the third vaccine injection. The exploratory objectives relate to
      antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses throughout the study.
