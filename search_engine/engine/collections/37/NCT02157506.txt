    
      This is a dose finding, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of continuous
      6-hour IV infusions of CXL-1427 in hospitalized patients with systolic heart failure which
      will first evaluate up to four ascending dose levels of CXL-1427 in up to four cohorts of 8
      patients each (the "Dose Escalation" cohorts). Subsequently, up to three of the initial dose
      levels of CXL-1427 may be assessed in the additional "Expansion" cohorts of up to
      approximately 16 patients to gain further confidence in the results at these dose levels. The
      CXL-1427 dose that will be evaluated in the first cohort will be 3Âµg/kg/min. The dose levels
      for the next three sequential Dose Escalation cohorts will be dependent on clinical safety
      and tolerability, as well as the results of the invasive hemodynamic measurements.
