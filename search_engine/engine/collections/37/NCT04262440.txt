      PN/EN caloric intake, days of ICU stay, days of hospital stay, hospital mortality, days of
      ventilator use.. will be collected. Statistic analysis included chi-square, student t test,
      logistic regression and ROC curve will be applied to analyze the different characteristics
      between survived and died patients. Also we can figure out the optimal cut value of caloric
      intake with best outcome by ROC curve analysis. We plan enrolled 200 participants within
      study period.
