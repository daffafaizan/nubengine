      affects almost one third of individuals aged 65 and older and approximately 25% of
      osteoarthritis patients 60 years and older cannot perform activities of daily living.[3] The
      clinical symptoms that lead to disability in Knee osteoarthritis are more frequent than all
      other joint complaint.

      A large body of evidence exists proving the beneficial effects of progressive resistance
      exercise (PRE) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).[4,5,6] Pulse electromagnetic
      field(PEMF) is a physical therapy modality that could be used for treating knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) and there emerging evidence suggesting its beneficial effect in reducing
      pain and improving function for knee osteoarthritis (OA)[7] The purpose of the study is to
      examine the effectiveness of using pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) with progressive
      resistance exercise (PRE) training in decreasing pain level ,improving physical function, and
      improving quality of life in patients with Knee osteoarthritis (OA) A small randomized
      control trial conducted to recruit 32 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Participants
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) as defined by American College of Rheumatology recruited from
      Prince Basma Educational Hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 24
      sessions (3 sessions/week for 8 weeks) of either the combined (PRE and PEMF) treatment or PRE
      only. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the end of treatment protocol (8
      weeks), and at 3 and 6 months follow up. Mixed ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA will be used
      to evaluate the differences between groups in pain, and physical function, and quality of
      life
