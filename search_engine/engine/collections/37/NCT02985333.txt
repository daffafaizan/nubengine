      investigators have previously shown that the combination of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide
      acts synergistically to induce apoptosis of myeloma cells in vitro. Based on these
      preclinical studies, the investigators initiated a phase II clinical trial of paclitaxel 175
      mg/m(2) IV over 3 h d1 combined with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) IV over 30-60 min d1,3,5
      and dexamethasone 20mg IV over 30-60 min d1-4 in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
      This regimen was administered every four weeks for a total of six cycles
