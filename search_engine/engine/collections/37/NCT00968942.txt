      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a repeat application of RT001 compared to
      placebo gel in at least 36 subjects with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines (LCL).
      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (active versus
      placebo). At least 36 adult volunteers who have provided informed consent and have met the
      study eligibility criteria will be enrolled. There will be 18 subjects in each treatment
      group.
