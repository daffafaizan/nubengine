    
      This is a randomized, Phase 2/3 study of rociletinib versus erlotinib as a first-line
      treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have
      EGFR-activating mutations. The study will consist of Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts which will use
      the same enrollment criteria and treatment assignment principles. Patients will be randomized
      1:1 to erlotinib or rociletinib. The Phase 2 part is an open-label study. In the Phase 3
      part, the sponsor will be blinded to the efficacy and safety results. The study will consist
      of a screening phase to establish study eligibility (including tumor genotype) and document
      baseline measurements, a treatment phase, in which patients will receive either rociletinib
      BID (twice a day) or erlotinib QD (once daily) to ascertain safety and efficacy until
      protocol-defined disease progression, and a follow-up phase, to monitor survival status and
      subsequent NSCLC cancer therapy. In the Phase 2 part only, patients initially randomized to
      erlotinib may be eligible to participate in an optional crossover phase to receive
      rociletinib if they demonstrate the T790M resistance mutation after radiographic progression
      on erlotinib treatment among other eligibility requirements. Patients eligible for this study
      must have EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have not been treated with an EGFR-directed
      therapy.Treatment with rociletinib or erlotinib is continuous. Each 28 day period of
      treatment will represent one cycle, with dosing initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1).
