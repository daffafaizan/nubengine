      partner healthcare systems, to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing patient
      decision aids and provider notifications as well as cancer risk assessment tools, for
      colorectal cancer screening, and for other evidence-based cancer screening during the COVID
      pandemic and, potentially, after the conclusion of the pandemic.

      At the conclusion of the study, the investigators will have extensive information regarding
      how best to provide decision aids through an electronic health record (EHR) portal, with or
      without personalized information, and to deliver provider notifications, which can guide
      broader implementation.

      The study will involve interviews with staff and providers at the study team's partner
      healthcare systems to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing decision aids and
      provider notifications for colorectal cancer screening.

      Also, the investigators will interview patients to identify perceptions of prevention during
      the COVID-19 pandemic including risk perception and barriers to screening, perceptions of
      risk from both the pandemic and disease, and patient cancer screening and risk prevention
      behaviors engaged in or postponed during the pandemic and patient rationales for their
      decisions. This part of the study will suggest potentially promising approaches for providing
      prevention and disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
