      tolerated/administered dose (MTD/MAD) and anti-tumor activity for MGC018 as monotherapy
      (Module A) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Each module consists of a Dose Escalation
      (3+3+3 design) followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase. Patients with solid tumors will be
      enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase; Cohort Expansion will include metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN),
      and melanoma. Patients who do not experience unacceptable toxicity or meet criteria for
      permanent discontinuation may undergo additional cycles for up to two years. Patients in
      Cohort Expansion will be followed for survival every 3 months for 2 years following last
      dose.

      Module B, MGC018 in combination with MGA012, Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion will
      commence only upon sponsor notification to all study investigators.
