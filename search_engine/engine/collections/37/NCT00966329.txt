    
      This is a 48 week randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, proof-of-concept pilot
      clinical trial.

      Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART regimen including 2 NRTI/NtRTIs plus one of the
      following : 1 PI/ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir
      /ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir) or ATV/unboosted (in a regimen without
      tenofovir) or 1 NNRTI (nevirapine or efavirenz).

      Patients will be randomized to switch from the NNRTI/PI to maraviroc (300 mg /12 h) or to
      continue with the same approach.

      The primary endpoint would be the percentage of patients who maintain virological suppression
      at week 48.
