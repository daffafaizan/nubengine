      a viable option for low risk lung cancer patients. Currently, the National Cancer Care
      Network (NCCN) guidelines recommends considering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)
      for patients not well enough for surgery, which is generally well tolerated, but it's also
      been shown to cause significant worsening of shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and in
      extreme cases, death. Investigators are using this pilot study as a means to determine
      outcomes for patients who choose an active surveillance approach. This information could
      change future conversations between doctor and patient regarding treatment options, giving
      patients the choice to choose radiation therapy or to delay treatment by taking an active
      surveillance approach.

      Investigators have published outcomes for 12 elderly patients with stage IA lung cancer who
      had chosen the active surveillance approach, reserving radiation therapy for when rapid tumor
      growth was determined (PMID 30648024). The clinical outcomes were similar to those expected
      if treatment had been provided, and at two years from the time the tumor was found almost
      half the patients were able to avoid getting radiation.

      By deciding to participate in this study, patients are agreeing to postpone their treatment
      for an active surveillance approach while continuing with a computed tomography (CT) scan
      regimen to follow tumor growth. Once their tumor size is determined there are parameters in
      place to decide when patients should consider radiation. These parameters are based on speed
      of tumor growth over time and tumor size.
