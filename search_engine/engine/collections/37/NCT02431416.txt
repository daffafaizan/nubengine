      to have an appropriate diagnosis. 20 such girls will be recruited to this study and a
      modified GnRH stimulation test will be done. The modification includes prolonged blood
      sampling time (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after the GnRH injection instead of the usual
      0, 30, 60, and 90 min). The girls will also be investigated twice. In randomised order they
      will be given either GnRH or placebo (isotone saline), on different days. One week to one
      month will separate the different investigation days.

      The proteinase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene-sulfonyl fluoride hydrochlorid (AEBSF) will
      be added to some of the blood tubes, and hydrochloric acid will be added to some of the
      plasma. All plasma samples will be frozen and all analyses will be done at the same time.
      Acylated ghrelin will be analyzed by Millipore's specific ELISA kit and deacylated ghrelin
      will be analyzed by Cayman's specific ELISA kit.

      Anthropometric data as well as pubertal state will be collected. P-glucose, S-insulin,
      S-follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), S-luteinizing hormone (LH), and S-estradiol will also
      be analyzed.
