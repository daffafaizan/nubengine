      which have been reported to be increasing in the last decade. Many students are not prepared
      for the rigor and intensity of their first clinical internship and experience exacerbations
      of stress and anxiety at this time. There is evidence that lucid dream induction methods have
      effectively alleviated stress and anxiety in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder,
      and depression in community dwelling adults. Although lucid dream techniques have been used
      to manage anxiety in some populations, it has never been used to help health care students on
      clinical internship experiencing heightened stress levels. In this study, the investigators
      aim to determine whether lucid dream induction techniques combined with stress management and
      sleep hygiene could effectively help students on their first clinical internship to better
      manage stress and anxiety. The investigators hope to gain a greater understanding of which of
      three study conditions can best alleviate stress and anxiety in participants.
