      (EBUS-TBNA) was used to be compared. The patients involved were randomly divided into two
      groups. In the experimental group, EBUS-TBMCB was performed following EBUS-TBNA while in
      another only EBUS-TBNA was performed. The samples obtained in the two groups were analyzed by
      the pathologists. Patients were followed up for confirming the diagnosis and complications.
      The diagnostic accuracy and prevalence of complications were compared between the two groups.
