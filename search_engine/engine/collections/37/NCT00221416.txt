      aripiprazole for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. The
      secondary aim of this study is to determine if common polymorphic variations in the CYP 2D6
      gene underlie the inter-individual variability in aripiprazole systemic drug exposure and the
      occurrence of treatment emergent side effects.
