      not previously matched. Matching was based upon gender, age, BMI, and estrogen status for
      females. They received one oral dose of AEZS-130 followed by serial blood draws for growth
      hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and pharmacokinetic (PK) determinations.
      There was no cross over due to the unavailability of GHRH (Geref) in the United States. Under
      Amendment #4 to this protocol, 10 additional AGHD subjects were to be enrolled and matched as
      described above.

      Furthermore, the objective of the study was changed to delete comparison with L-ARG + GHRH.
