    
      This is a global, randomized, double-blind trial of pamrevlumab or placebo in combination
      with systemic corticosteroids in subjects with non-ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
      aged 12 years and older. Approximately 90 male subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      Arm A (pamrevlumab + systemic corticosteroid) or Arm B (placebo+ systemic corticosteroid),
      respectively.

      Subjects must be fully informed of the potential benefits of approved products and make an
      informed decision that they prefer to participate in a clinical trial in which they could be
      randomized to placebo.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study treatment arms;
      pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with systemic steroids.

      This trial has three study periods:

        -  Screening period: Up to 4 weeks

        -  Treatment period: 52 weeks

        -  Safety Follow-up period/final assessment: 4 weeks (Week 56 (+/-3 days))

      In the screening period, subjects will be evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion
      criteria to determine eligibility for participation in this trial.

      During the treatment period, each subject will receive pamrevlumab or placebo at 35 mg/kg
      every 2 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

      Subjects who complete the 52-week study (either arm) may be eligible for rollover into an
      open-label extension treatment (OLE) with pamrevlumab + systemic corticosteroids.

      Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason should be encouraged to return to the
      investigative site to complete final safety and efficacy assessments.
