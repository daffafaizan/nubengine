    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of LMSCs (Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells) or placebo in subjects with Alzheimer's
      Disease. Following a successful Safety Run-In Phase, a total of twenty-five (25) subjects
      will be randomized to (2:2:1) to receive low-dose LMSCs, high-dose LMSCs or placebo. After
      randomization, baseline imaging, and study product infusion, subjects will be followed up at
      2,4,13, 26, 39 and 52 week post study product infusion. Intention-to-treat study population
      will be used for the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations.
