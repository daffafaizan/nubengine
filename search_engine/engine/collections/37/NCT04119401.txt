      grounds of referring for medical attention, but also one of the reasons for the modest
      deterioration in the quality of life that can possibly result in temporary or permanent
      reduction of work capacities. Today, the doppler-guided dearterialization of hemorrhoidal
      arteries and the following suture-fixation mucopexy in the anal canal (synonyms: mucopexy,
      hemorrhoids lifting, HAL-RAR) is one of the most popular and actively studied methods of the
      stage II - III hemorrhoidal disease surgical treatment. A number of publications raise an
      issue whether it is really necessary to use a doppler while the localization of the
      hemorrhoidal arteries is typical in the vast majority of the observations and can be easily
      determined on palpation.

      The aim of the study is to compare the direct and long-term results of the II - III grade HD
      surgical treatment with the use of two techniques of the suture ligation of the hemorrhoidal
      arteries with mucopexy. One of these methods is classic and widely known HAL-RAR, the other
      one has a principal differ in no-using the doppler to find the arteries, the surgeon defines
      them on palpation.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the digital detection of hemorrhoidal arteries pulsation
      followed by suture ligation and mucopexy may be no less effective in the treatment of grade
      II - III hemorrhoids than the use of a doppler guide.
