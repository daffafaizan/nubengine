    
      On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 2-hour IV infusion.
      AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with administration on Day 1 of the
      first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period. In Phase 2a AVID100 will be administered at
      a dose of 220 mg/m2.

      Evidence of progressive disease at any point in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the
      patient from further participation so that alternative management of their malignancy may be
      considered. All patients will be followed to further evaluate safety as well as evidence of
      the anti-tumor effects of AVID100 in these selected patient populations. If anti-tumor
      activity is observed additional patients may be added to the planned Phase 2a patient
      populations to further characterize these effects.
