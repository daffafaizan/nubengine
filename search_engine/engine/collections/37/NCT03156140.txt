    
      Evaluate the performance of 4 pulse oximeters (Masimo Radical-7, Nihon-Koden OxyPal Neo,
      Nellcor N-600, and Philips Intellivue MP5) in 10 healthy adult volunteers. Three motions will
      be evaluated: tapping, pseudorandom, and volunteer-generated rubbing, adjusted to produce
      photoplethsmogram disturbance similar to arterial pulsation amplitude. During motion,
      inspired gases will be adjusted to achieve stable target plateaus of arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2) at 75%, 88%, and 100%. Pulse oximeter readings (SpO2) will be compared with
      SaO2 from simultaneous arterial blood samples
