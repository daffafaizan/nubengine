      level lumbar (L) spondylolisthesis (L3-L5) after ineffective conservative treatment. We
      evaluated bilateral ultrasound (US)-guided single shot erector spinae plane (ESP) block at
      the level of lumbar 3 (L3) vertebra with or without dexmedetomidine (Dex).

      Methods: A prospective controlled randomized, double-blind study comparing two groups of
      patients; each group included 20 patients of double level spondylolisthesis (L3-L5) scheduled
      for (PLIF) under general anesthesia combined with bilateral US-guided ESP single shot block
      at (L3). Group I received 20 ml of 0. 25% bupivacaine plus one mL normal saline bilaterally.
      Group II received 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with supplementation of 1 mL containing 100µg
      dexmedetomidine bilaterally. Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) length of stay, the total dose
      of postoperative analgesics need, postoperative visual analogue score (VAS) at 1h, 6h, 12h,
      and 24 h after the operation and postoperative complications which related to block or
      opioids were recorded.

      ESP block at combined with (Dex) is a safe, effective block with no complications. Addition
      of 100µg Dex to preoperative ESP block provided good postoperative opioid-sparing analgesia,
      facilitated the early emergence and shortened the length of stay in the PACU during (PLIF)
      for double level spondylolisthesis (L3-L5).
