    
      The study involves the allocation of either 250ml of water or 200ml of tea and 50ml of milk
      to fasted parturients, and assessment of gastric antrum CSA at intervals up to 2 hours. The
      study will be performed in patients with >34 weeks gestation at the antenatal clinic. The
      participants will be randomized into one of two groups with an internet based randomisation
      tool, and then allocated to either group as per the allocation in a sealed opaque envelope.
      The ultrasound assessor will be blinded to the group allocation.

      Participants will be asked to come to clinic in the morning fasting from solids for >6 hours
      and for 2 hours for clear fluids. Gastric ultrasound will be performed on the fasted pregnant
      patients in the right lateral decubitus position to establish a baseline and ensure that the
      gastric antrum is empty. Gastric antrum CSA will be measured.

      Intervention group:

      The intervention group will be given 200ml of black breakfast tea with 50ml of full fat milk.
      This should be consumed within 5 minutes. Gastric ultrasound will be performed at intervals
      up to 2 hours after the intervention in the right lateral decubitus position. Gastric antrum
      CSA will be measured. Three measurements of CSA will be taken and averaged.

      Placebo group:

      The placebo group will be given 250ml of water. This should be consumed within 5 minutes.
      Gastric ultrasound will be performed at intervals up to 2 hours after the intervention in the
      right lateral decubitus position. Gastric antrum CSA will be measured. Three measurements of
      CSA will be taken and averaged.
