      urgently needed to improve overall clinical care, especially in settings with a high case
      burden where appropriate allocation of limited resources is crucial to outcome. In this work
      package 10,000 outpatients with undifferentiated fever, consistent with possible dengue, will
      be recruited within 3 days of fever onset in 6 endemic countries (Brazil, Cambodia, El
      Salvador, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam), and will be followed daily until full recovery.
      Clinical features and simple laboratory parameters differentiating dengue from other febrile
      illness will be identified, and, among those with confirmed dengue, risk factors for
      progression to more severe disease will be evaluated. As well as contributing to the
      development of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms the clinical cohort has considerable
      potential towards standardisation of procedures for dengue management and reporting.
