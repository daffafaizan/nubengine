      Primary

      To determine whether exercise more than 30 minutes each time and 3 times weekly for 8 weeks
      (24 sessions) compared to sedentary life could make a significant improvement on attention
      according to the response times of the Schulte Test at week 8.

      Secondary

      To evaluate the changes from baseline to week 8 of the response times, correct rates, and
      omission rates of the Stroop Colour-Word Test.

      To evaluate the changes from baseline to week 8 of the anxiety and depression by Self-rating
      anxiety scale (SAS) and Self-rating depression scale (SDS).

      OUTLINE: This is a single-centered study. Participants are randomized into two interventional
      arms.

      Arm I: Participants receive exercise intervention more than 30 minutes per week and 3 times
      weekly for 8 weeks. Arm II: Participants keep sedentary life without exercise.
