    
      100 subjects (18 to 60 years old) will be enrolled (1:1) with one to two painful traumatic
      fractures, non-pathological (types A1 and A3.1 by Magerl Classification).

      Subjects will be followed at admission, procedure, discharge, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months
      and 24 months post Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) reduction procedure or the set-up of
      the brace.

      The estimated enrollment period is 12 months and each patient should perform a 24 months
      follow-up period. Therefore, the total study duration is estimated to be 36 months for the
      complete study.
