      additional data on use of Keppra速 (Levetiracetam) oral solution in clinical practice, and on
      efficacy and safety of Keppra速 (Levetiracetam) in infants younger than12 months. Epileptic
      patients between the age of 1 month and 11 months inclusive can be invited for participation
      to the non-interventional sentinel sites PASS, after the physician has decided to initiate
      therapy with Keppra速 (Levetiracetam) oral solution (100 mg/ml bottle) and patient has so far
      been treated with Keppra速 (Levetiracetam) for no longer than 10 days. The patients will be
      followed and their data will be collected until they reach the age of 13 months.
