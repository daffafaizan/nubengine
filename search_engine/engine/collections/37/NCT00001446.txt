    
      This is a phase II study designed to evaluate the potential clinical efficacy of thalidomide
      in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Patients will be randomized to two
      different treatment arms (low dose versus high dose). An important aspect of this study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide, as well as make correlations between the
      degree of angiogenesis occurring in a patient and the activity of thalidomide. Each patient
      that has biopsiable lesions will undergo a pretreatment biopsy of their prostate (or other
      site of soft tissue disease) and repeat after 2 to 6 months of treatment. Additional
      information will be obtained on the changes in the circulating levels of the following growth
      factors: bFGF, TNF, VEGF, and TGFB. Neurological complications are the primary dose-limiting
      toxicity anticipated with chronic thalidomide administration.
