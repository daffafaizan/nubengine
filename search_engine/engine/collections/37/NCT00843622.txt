      allocated to either a smokefree, oral tobacco product or a non-tobacco, non-nicotine placebo
      product with identical flavoring and physical appearance. The study consists of three phases:
      Study Product Test Period (4 weeks), Intervention Phase (12 weeks), and a Follow-Up Phase (12
      weeks). The participants are all cigarette smokers who are motivated to quit. They are
      encouraged to gradually substitute as many cigarettes as possible with study products during
      the Study Product Test Period and to refrain from all cigarettes at the latest by the first
      day of Week 5. Use of study products will continue during the 12 week Intervention Phase. The
      participants are encouraged to cut down on use of study products during the last 3 weeks to
      avoid a too abrupt ending of nicotine intake.

      All subjects are encouraged to continue in the study for clinical follow-up independent of
      smoking status although use of study products is discontinued during the Follow-Up Phase. If
      a subject has managed to quit smoking during the Intervention Phase but there is an imminent
      danger of smoking relapse during the Follow-Up Phase, that subject is informed that use of
      nicotine replacement therapy or a smokefree tobacco product is a better option in terms of
      health risks than a smoking relapse.
