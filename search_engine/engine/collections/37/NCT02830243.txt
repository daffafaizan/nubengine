      that equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetic agents may produce
      different bispectral index values. However, the difference between analgesic effects of
      volatile anesthetics have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this clinical trial is to
      compare analgesic effect of sevoflurane and desflurane at equal minimum alveolar
      concentrations using surgical pleth index-guided remifentanil infusion.
