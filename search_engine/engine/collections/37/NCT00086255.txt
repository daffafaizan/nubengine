      cocaine dependence. It is hypothesized that tiagabine treatment, compared to placebo, will be
      associated with fewer days of cocaine use as assessed by self-report confirmed with urine
      assays for benzoylecgonine (BE). This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      design study, in which, after screening and a 2-week baseline assessment period, subjects
      will be equally randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, tiagabine or matched placebo.
