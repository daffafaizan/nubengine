      with age. Diastolic function typically declines with age. Targeting age-related causal
      factors leading to the decline in diastolic function in both women and men is a major public
      health initiative. In this pilot study, the investigators will determine whether
      supplementation with a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone (MitoQ)) improves
      mitochondrial function, left ventricular diastolic and vascular function in older adults. As
      an exploratory aim, the investigators will determine whether there are differences between
      men and women in response to this supplementation.
