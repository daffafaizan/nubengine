      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma or Ewing's
           sarcoma or unresectable or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma treated with sequential
           gemcitabine and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetics of this regimen vs gemcitabine alone in these patients.

        -  Obtain tumor samples for cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression and development of
           cell lines and xenotransplantation models.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to diagnosis recurrent osteosarcoma vs recurrent Ewing's
      sarcoma vs unresectable or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma).

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel
      intravenously over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      (SC) beginning on day 9 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients may receive
      pegfilgrastim SC on day 9 (once per course) as an alternative to G-CSF. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Optional blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetics studies. Optional tumor tissue samples from biopsy or surgical resection are
      analysed for cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 120 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 17-24 months.
