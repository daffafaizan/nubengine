    
      This is an open-label study investigating the relationship between SEP-228432 and SEP-228431
      (the active metabolite of SEP-228432) plasma concentrations, SERT occupancy, and DAT
      occupancy, both measured by SPECT imaging using [123I]-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)
      tropane ([123I] β -CIT). Up to 3 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects each will have multiple
      dose administrations of SEP-228432. The target dose for the first cohort will be 200 mg. Dose
      selection for the remaining cohorts will be based on preliminary review of all available
      relevant data from prior dosing cohort(s).
