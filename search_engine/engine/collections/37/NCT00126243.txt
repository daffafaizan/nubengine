      use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses
      has decreased, leading to a significant improvement in survival of HIV-infected patients. The
      incidence of ARL has decreased in a lower degree and lymphoma remains the major cause of
      death of HIV patients. Most treatment procedures disclose a relatively poor outcome of
      patients with low response rates, high number of relapses and AIDS events. Since the majority
      of HIV-associated NHL are CD20-positive the addition of rituximab to the standard regimen -
      CHOP could improve the outcome of these patients
