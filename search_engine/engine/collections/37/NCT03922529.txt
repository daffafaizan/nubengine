    
      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 480 older adults eligible for
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR): hospitalized adults aged â‰¥70 years with a primary diagnosis of
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/ Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stable Ischemic Heart
      Disease (IHD),Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
      (PCI), valvular heart disease (valve replacements or repairs for aortic stenosis or mitral
      regurgitation), or heart failure (HF). Participants who consent to participate will be
      randomly assigned to Modified Application of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Older Adults (MACRO)
      or standard of care (SOC) arms (which may include CR at the discretion of the providers). In
      the MACRO arm, participants will benefit from personalized engagement, de-prescribing, and CR
      will be explicitly facilitated, risk stratification will be utilized to determine the best
      option of CR care from flexible range of options (site-, home, or hybrid). While SOC may
      include CR, the SOC CR provides no specialized engagement, and no programmatic facilitation,
      enhancement, customization, or deliberate flexibility in how care is provided. It will be
      entirely standard care.

      Aim 1: To establish efficacy, safety and acceptability of the MACRO intervention.

      Investigators hypothesize that after 3 months, compared to standard of care (SOC),
      participants randomized into the MACRO arm will have:

      H1.1: Greater improvements in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (primary
      outcome); H1.2: Greater improvements in physical activity (accelerometry), depression;
      cognition; frailty; self-efficacy; and quality of life; H1.3: Greater CR participation and
      adherence; H1.4: Greater impact in readmissions and hospitalization.

      Aim 2: To examine duration of benefit from the MACRO compared to SOC H2.1: the investigators
      hypothesize that relative MACRO benefits (in outcomes, safety, and utilization) will persist
      after 6 and 12 months

      Aim 3: To explore characteristics of participants who benefit the most from the MACRO
      intervention.

      H3.1: the investigators anticipate functional capacity and other baseline characteristics
      will identify those who benefit from the MACRO intervention (exploratory).
