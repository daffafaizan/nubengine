    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab for clinical remission/response of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis (immune-mediated colitis [IMC]).

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of IMC treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab for clinical remission/response of
      IMC at 4 weeks.

      II. To assess the success of corticosteroid tapering. III. To measure the recurrence rate
      after corticosteroid taper.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab to achieve endoscopic remission of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

      II. To assess the efficacy of infliximab and vedolizumab to achieve histological remission of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

      III. To assess the time duration to achieve the clinical remission/response. IV. To assess
      the long term outcome of cancer. V. To assess immunological, molecular and microbiome changes
      in tissue/blood/stool.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive infliximab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once at week 0, 2, 6 for a
      total of 3 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive vedolizumab IV over 1 hour once at week 0, 2, 6 for a total of 3
      doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up weekly for 1 month and then at 2 and 3 months after the treatment.
