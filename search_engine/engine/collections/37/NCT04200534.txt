    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Test the effectiveness of usual care (primary care providers with training in
      guideline-based smoking cessation and shared decision making) versus (vs.) centralized care
      (smoking cessation and shared decision making delivered remotely by trained counselors) on
      smoking abstinence and the quality of patients' decisions about lung cancer screening.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the reach, acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the two smoking cessation
      and shared decision-making implementation models in meeting the requirements from Centers for
      Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the lung cancer screening patient counseling and
      shared decision making visit.

      II. Conduct budget impact and cost-effectiveness analyses of the two implementation models
      for the smoking cessation and shared decision making to inform adoption of the intervention
      beyond the current study.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CENTRALIZED CARE): Participants receive counseling over the phone to help them quit
      smoking and learn about lung cancer screening over 15-20 minutes for 6-8 sessions over 8
      weeks. Participants may also receive nicotine patches.

      GROUP II (USUAL CARE): Participants receive counseling on lung cancer screening and smoking
      cessation from primary care providers at health care visit.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1, 8, and 12 weeks.
