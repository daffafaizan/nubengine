      may often be recognizable through testing in advance of any changes noticed by family members
      or caregivers. Early and frequent testing can therefore trigger an earlier diagnosis, which
      may increase the effectiveness of currently available medications used to delay onset of
      Alzheimer's symptoms. Primary care and geriatric physicians currently lack the necessary
      tools required for quick and accurate MCI screening in the doctor's office environment. The
      current industry-standard is a battery of pen & paper neuropsychological tests that require
      1.5 hours in a quiet room with a neuropsychologist.

      evaluation for detecting mild cognitive impairment (problems with memory, concentration,
      reaction time, etc.).
