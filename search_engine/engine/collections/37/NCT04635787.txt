      monitoring COVID-19 infections. Our small, wearable sensor can get data on your respiration,
      body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen level, which may help physicians better
      identify if a respiratory condition is worsening overtime. If successful, our sensor could
      help healthcare professionals detect early symptoms of COVID-19 respiratory infection and
      monitor recovery and treat people before their condition worsens significantly.
