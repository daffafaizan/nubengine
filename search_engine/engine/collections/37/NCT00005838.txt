      I. Determine the overall survival of patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small
      cell lung cancer treated with induction platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy with or
      without AE-941 (Neovastat).

      II. Determine the progression-free survival, tumor response, tumor response duration, and
      metastasis-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to stage (IIIA vs IIIB), type of platinum-based induction
      chemotherapy to be received (cisplatin and vinorelbine vs carboplatin and paclitaxel), and
      gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice daily beginning on day 1 or within 10
      days of initiation of chemotherapy.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily beginning on day 1 or within 10 days of
      initiation of chemotherapy.

      All patients receive induction chemotherapy with 1 of the following platinum-based regimens:
      cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, 50, and 71 and vinorelbine IV on days 1, 8, 22, 29, 50, 57, 71,
      and 78 carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 22, 50, 57,
      64, 71, 78, and 85.

      All patients receive radiotherapy beginning on day 50 for 6 weeks. Treatment in both arms
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 756 patients (378 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 36 months.
