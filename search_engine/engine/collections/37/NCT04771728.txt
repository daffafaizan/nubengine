      vaginal flora mainly because intestinal microbiota can migrate and affect vaginal
      microecology. This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral Probiotics(Umeta-mimi,30
      days) with Metronidazole vaginal suppositories(7 days) in the treatment of bacterial
      vaginosis (BV) and to explore the correlation between vaginal flora and fecal flora by
      detecting the metagenomics of vaginal secretions and intestinal feces at the time of baseline
      phase,14 days after treatmentï¼Œ the first month after treatment, 5-7 days after third
      menstruation after treatment and 5-7 days after sixth menstruation after treatment
