      I. Determine the non-inferiority of omission of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients who
      meet the biochemical and radiological criteria compared to current standard of care (i.e. use
      of intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cost-analysis to determine savings of omission of intraoperative PTH testing.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without PTH testing during
      surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.
