    
      This is a phase 1b study of MLN8237, cetuximab and definitive radiation therapy for patients
      with previously untreated locoregionally advanced HNSCC who are candidates for definitive
      radiation therapy with curative intent with cetuximab as the radiosensitizer. The treatment
      regimen consists of MLN8237 po bid for 7 days followed by 2 weeks off for 4 cycles with the
      first 3 cycles of MLN8237 concurrent with RT. Three dose levels of MLN8237 are planned: 30,
      40 and 50 mg po bid. Cetuximab will be given at the FDA-approved loading and maintenance
      doses starting ~ 1 week prior to the initiation of radiation therapy and continuing for a
      grand total of 12 weeks. Radiotherapy will be administered in 2-Gy fractions, 5 days a week,
      to total dose of ~70 Gy according to standard departmental protocols. Correlative biomarker
      assays on pre- and on-therapy biopsy specimens (tissue micro arrays analyzed by AQUA
      quantitative immunofluorescence) will seek to establish proof-of-mechanism by determining if
      the novel drug combination has the predicted effects on biochemical signaling pathways linked
      to Aurora A and EGFR. Tumor samples will also be analyzed for Aurora A and EGFR expression by
      IHC and FISH.
