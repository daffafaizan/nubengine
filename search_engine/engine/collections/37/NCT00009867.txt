      I. To determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with measurable urothelial
      carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis.

      II. To determine the toxicity of arsenic trioxide administered to patients with urothelial
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year after registration and then every 6 months
      for 1 year or until disease progression or relapse.
