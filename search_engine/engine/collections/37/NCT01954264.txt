      prior to and after implementation of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine. EPI-MAL-002
      will take place before RTS,S is authorised and EPI-MAL-003 will start when RTS,S is
      registered and authorised in the country. A cross-sectional survey at peak transmission will
      provide by-site point estimates of Parasite prevalence (PP) and malaria control measure
      coverage in the areas participating in EPI-MAL-002/-003. EPI-MAL-006 will be conducted in
      advance of EPI-MAL-002/-003 in order to assess PP and malaria control measures to inform
      enrollment in these studies. The age group for enrollment (â‰¥6 months - <10 years) will permit
      analysis of PP according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (2-9 years) and by
      the Joint Technical Expert Group (JTEG) suggested age (<5 years).
