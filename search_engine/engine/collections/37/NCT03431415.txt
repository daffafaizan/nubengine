      therapy in the treatment of the early stage lung cancer. However, good emerging data
      demonstrates potential equality between these two treatments. Two major international studies
      have tried to compare both treatments but have failed to complete the study because of the
      lack of patients accrual. We chose to design a trial in which patients will be part of a
      shared decision making process in selecting the treatment modality.

      Patients with early stage lung cancer, that can undergo surgical treatment will be offered
      SBRT, and in conjunction with the pulmonologist will decide which treatment they prefer. We
      intend to complete the recruitment of patients within 02 years, then follow-up for 5 more
      years to collect data.
