      Alcohol Help Center delivered with assistance from a health educator (AHC+A). The assistance
      will be in the form of email contact with the participant during the first two weeks after
      randomization. AHC+A will be tested against a group receiving access to the intervention
      without any such assistance (AHC).

      The Investigators hypothesize that

        1. participants allocated to AHC+A will display significant reductions in drinking (drinks
           preceding week/heavy drinking days preceding week) in 3- and 6-month follow ups compared
           to AHC

        2. participants allocated to AHC+A will display greater engagement with the intervention in
           terms of a higher number of modules completed compared to AHC

        3. engagement with the intervention will mediate any effects on drinking behavior.

      A 2-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial will be used to test these specified
      hypotheses. Follow-ups will be conducted at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Online media
      advertisements will be used to recruit people with current alcohol problems, and will target
      people who are 'experiencing difficulties in controlling or cutting down on their drinking.'
      The advertisements will be placed across Canada using locations found successful in previous
      trials to rapidly recruit participants (e.g. Google AdWords).
