      predominantly ethnic minority, urban communities, which is reflected in the extraordinarily
      high levels of trauma-related psychiatric disorders, particularly PTSD and MDD. Despite this,
      limited access to behavioral health treatment and significant barriers to treatment
      engagement and success remain and integrating mind-body approaches in medical settings could
      be a critical next step in treating chronically traumatized individuals in these urban
      settings. This study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design along with a
      multi-method assessment approach to ascertain the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      mechanisms of action and outcomes of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus wait-list
      control in 80 African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and comorbid PTSD and MDD
      symptoms.

      Participants will be randomized to an 8-session (90 minutes each) group intervention or
      wait-list control. The researchers will examine the retention and follow-up rates,
      participants' report of acceptability and interest in the intervention, and examine barriers
      to treatment engagement through self-report measures and exit interviews. This study will
      also investigate preliminary mechanisms of action and outcomes of the mindfulness
      intervention in targeting emotion regulation and autonomic processes by measuring self-report
      of emotion dysregulation using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and autonomic
      arousal to trauma cues using eSense technology to assess skin conductance during
      administration of Standardized Trauma Interview. Latent growth modeling will assess relative
      changes in emotion dysregulation and autonomic function over time through intervention and 1
      month follow-up.
