      intensive endocrine therapy for Luminal B1 early-staged breast cancer. In this trial the
      investigators will randomly assign 200 primary breast cancer patients to receive four cycles
      of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel(T), or four
      cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) followed by intensive endocrine therapy
      (Goserelin acetate+Tamoxifen/Letrozole for young patients) . Patients with HER-2 positive was
      excluded. The patient's conditions will be assessed before, and after every four cycles of
      adjuvant chemotherapy to determine if there is any progression of the disease. The patient's
      conditions will be assessed every three months when they received the intensive endocrine
      therapy (Goserelin acetate+Tamoxifen for young patients/Letrozole for postmenopausal
      patients). Patients will be followed up for DFS and OS in different regiments, the secondary
      endpoint is to assess the expression of female hormone levels. The correlation of the
      expression of female hormone levels with the clinical outcomes, so that the investigators
      could optimize adjuvant treatment regiment with luminal B1 breast cancer.
