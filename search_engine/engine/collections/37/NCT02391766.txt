      Charlson's comorbidity index is calculated to assess the severity and prognostic value of the
      participants' disease burden . Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the patients is
      assessed by using the 15D instrument Dementia patients are also assessed with the Clinical
      Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Other measurements
      include activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) The

      measurements include height, weight, blood pressure and hand grip strength. The spousal
      caregivers are asked questions concerning the impact of their spouse's dementia diagnosis and
      they are assessed by the RAND-36 HRQoL instrument, 12-item General Health Questionnaire
      (GHQ-12) the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) the randomization is
      performed by telephone to a randomization center. Couples are randomly allocated by means of
      computer-generated random numbers. Every randomization result will appear in the program
      after the participants name has been written and the person executing the randomization has
      confirmed the process with her initials. Participating couples are assessed by two study
      nurses three times over nine months: at baseline, three, and nine months. Use of health
      services, institutionalizations and mortality of both patients and caregivers will be
      retrieved from the central registers until 24 months from the baseline measurements.
