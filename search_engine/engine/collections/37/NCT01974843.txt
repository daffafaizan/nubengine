      orchidopexy received bupivacaine 0.25% plus tramadol 2 mg/kg (BT group) or levobupivacaine
      0.25% plus tramadol 2 mg/kg (LT group) by the caudal route after laryngeal mask anesthesia.
      The primary outcome of the study was to compare the duration and quality of postoperative
      analgesia. The postoperative pain relief was evaluated by the Children and Infants
      Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. In addition, the
      time of first analgesic requirement was noted.
