      and stroke, which are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States,
      respectively. African Americans and Hispanics have a higher risk of developing hypertension
      and diabetes than do Caucasians. They are also less likely to know that they have high blood
      pressure, are more prone to organ damage, and are more likely to die as a result of these
      chronic conditions. A significant number of African Americans and Hispanics are uninsured and
      receive care through publicly supported CHCs. It is important to identify factors that
      contribute to healthcare differences among the lower income, uninsured, and minority
      populations that are typically served by CHCs. In this study, a collaborative partnership
      will be developed between CHCs, health service research organizations, and academic
      researchers. The goal of the study is to examine the barriers that minority CHC patients face
      in receiving appropriate hypertension and diabetes care.

      This study will develop a collaborative partnership between various health organizations and
      seven CHCs located in Boston neighborhoods that have a large percentage of African American
      and Hispanic residents. Researchers will conduct focus groups with CHC patients who are
      receiving care for hypertension or diabetes. CHC staff members will be interviewed to collect
      information regarding the relationship between CHC organizational structure and disparities
      in heart disease risk factors among minority patients with hypertension or diabetes.
      Researchers will then develop, implement, and evaluate a patient- and CHC-focused
      intervention aimed at reducing the cardiovascular risks of minority patients at four CHCs in
      Boston.
