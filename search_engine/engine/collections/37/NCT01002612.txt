      intakes, to meet the recommended for HIV-infected children (CLHIV) would be able to improve
      growth of these children. We implemented the nutrition support program through the two
      strategies aiming to increase dietary intake for all children to meet the current World
      Health Organization (WHO) recommendations which the recommended energy requirements are
      increased by10% for asymptomatic CLHIV and increased by 20 to 50% for children who require
      catch up growth or experiencing opportunistic infections. The nutrition support program
      composed two strategies. Firstly is providing nutrition education to caregivers and also
      children. Secondly, revision food menus by caregivers with assisting from the nutritionists
      of the project. After this program have been implemented for 6 months, reassessment is needed
      to evaluate the changes of nutritional status and health outcomes in this children aiming to
      further providing support and applying to other settings.
