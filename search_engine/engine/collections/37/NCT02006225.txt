    
      Improve and report outcomes of children undergoing peripheral stem and progenitor cell
      harvesting applying plerixafor in first-line aphaeresis, including:

      Pre-harvesting FACS-derived CD34+ cell number. Number of stem cells harvested. Number of
      T-cells harvested. Days of hospitalization.

      Procedure related toxicity including:

      Infections. Line complications. Other organ toxicities.

      Compare outcomes of plerixafor-derived stem and progenitor cells harvesting between different
      pediatric oncological diseases, including high-risk neuroblastoma, high-risk brain tumors,
      high-risk sarcomas and relapsed lymphomas.

      Outcomes to be analyzed:

        1. Peripheral blood stem cell content by means of percentage of CD34+ cells, after
           conditioning protocol (4 days of 10mcg/kg GCSF per day and one dose of plerixafor
           0.24mg/kg 10 hours before collection) and before harvesting.

        2. Number of stem cells harvested.

        3. Morbidity:

             1. Bleeding at the time of catheter placement, during harvesting procedure and post
                harvesting.

             2. Infections: localized vs. generalized. Type of pathogen isolated.

        4. Platelet number and hemoglobin level post harvesting.

        5. kidney function.

        6. Duration of hospitalization: Evaluation of the time course from the day of
           hospitalization for the harvesting to the day of discharge.
