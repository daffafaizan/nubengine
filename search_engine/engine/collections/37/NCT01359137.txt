      numbers of probationers are ultimately revoked from probation and sentenced to long
      underlying jail or prison terms. Arizona is experimenting with alternatives to routine
      probation with the goal of reducing the overall burden of incarceration. Cochise County in
      Arizona is experimenting with innovative probation supervision practices. Subjects are
      assigned to one of three supervision conditions: Probation-as-usual (routine supervision with
      no deferred jail); discretionary deferred jail in response to probation violations; and
      Arizona's Swift, Accountable, Fair, Enforcement, or SAFE (SAFE involves non-discretionary
      deferred jail in response to probation violations).
