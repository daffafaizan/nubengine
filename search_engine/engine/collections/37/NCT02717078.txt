      and surrounding communities, and will be randomized to treatment with the LoBAG diet or a
      control diet. Following a consent and screening visit, there will be 5 additional study
      visits over a 12-week diet intervention period. Instruction in the assigned diet will be
      provided by a research dietitian at the beginning of the 12-week period, and reinforced at
      subsequent visits throughout the study. Participants will be asked to purchase food, prepare
      food, and consume the assigned diet in their own homes. They will be asked to keep activity
      level constant and to continue medications for diabetes (metformin or no medication) without
      change during the intervention. The primary outcome, HgbA1c, and secondary outcome measures
      will be assessed at baseline and following diet intervention. Study visits will occur at
      baseline (visits 1 and 2), week 1 (visit 3), week 6 (visit 4), week 9 (visit 5) and week 12
      (final study visit). In addition to scheduled study visits the research team will contact
      participants every other week by telephone to address any issues that arise, with the purpose
      of increasing compliance and retention. Participants will be contacted once in weeks 9-12 for
      a 24-hour diet recall collected by the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of
      Minnesota. Study procedures will conclude after the 12-week diet intervention period and
      collection of all outcome measures.
