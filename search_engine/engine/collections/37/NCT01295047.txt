      centres. The investigators performed radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave
      analysis to derive central aortic pressure and haemodynamic indexes pre-and post
      administering Atenolol 75mg, Perindopril 4mg and Verapamil 240mgs each for four weeks with a
      two week wash-out between medications. All patients underwent detailed functional and
      anatomical echocardiographic assessments at each visit.

      Inclusion criteria were ages 16-60 years with no treatment or β-blocker or other monotherapy
      only for Marfan syndrome. Patients with previous aortic dissection or aortic surgery, severe
      valvular regurgitation, aortic diameter at the sinotubular junction ≥ 5.0cm,
      contraindications to specific drug treatment, e.g. asthma and β-blocker, or those who were
      pregnant or at risk of pregnancy were excluded.
