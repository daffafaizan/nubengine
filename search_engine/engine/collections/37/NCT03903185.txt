    
      In this study, patients in both treatment groups will receive 12 weeks of treatment with a
      Ô¨Åxed-dose combination tablet containing 45 mg of ledipasvir and 200 mg of sofosbuvir
      (LDV/SOF) orally, once daily with food, as prescribed by the attending physician.

      Twelve eligible HCV-infected patients with hematological malignancy and 12 matching HCV
      control patients without haematological malignancy or co-morbidities will be enrolled in the
      study.

      At baseline, careful history of the recruited patients including demographic characteristics
      (age, height, weight, and gender), comorbidities, medication history, familial history,
      social history, blood transfusion history, time on maintenance chemotherapy, and baseline
      laboratory tests will be documented. The baseline laboratory tests will include renal
      function tests (serum creatinine), liver function tests (bilirubin, albumin, AST, and ALT),
      international normalized ratio (INR), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), complete blood count (CBC),
      degree of liver fibrosis by Fibroscan, and viral load by PCR.

      Followup will be done for all participants at baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and
      after 12 weeks from the end of treatment. A Forth visit will be done after 10 days of
      treatment for the evaluation of the steady state PK parameters of LDV\SOF in those patients.
