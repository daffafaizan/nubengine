      treatment of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. After informed consent, pretreatment
      pancreatic tumor tissues will be collected and immediately frozen at the time of staging
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Ribonucleic acid (RNA) will be extracted from tumor specimens
      and run on microarray analysis to determine radiosensitivity index score. Borderline
      resectable (BR) patients will be treated with 3 cycles of GTX chemotherapy followed by SBRT.
      They will be restaged and evaluated for resectability 3 to 4 weeks later. Non-metastatic
      patients who are deemed resectable after neoadjuvant therapy will be taken to surgery.
