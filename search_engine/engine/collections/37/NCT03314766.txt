    
      This will be a prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study in up to 80 patients
      previously implanted with an IC-8 IOL contralaterally or bilaterally under the protocol
      ACU-P14-029 at up to nine clinical sites within Europe.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the long-term clinical acceptability and overall
      satisfaction in patients implanted with the IC-8 IOL. The primary study endpoint is binocular
      target-corrected near visual acuity (TCNVA) of 20/32 or better in 85% or more patients at
      least 12 months post-implantation. The secondary study endpoint is overall satisfaction with
      postoperative vision in 85% or more patients reporting either satisfied or very satisfied at
      least 12 months post-implantation.
