      gluteus medius originates at the dorsal ilium (uppermost, largest bone of the pelvis) below
      the iliac crest and inserts at the top outside surfaces of the greater trochanter (top of the
      thigh bone). It is the major abductor of the thigh (moves the leg away from the midline of
      the body). The anterior fibres rotate the hip internally and the posterior fibres rotate the
      hip externally. Based on the anatomy and function of this muscle, the gluteus medius plays a
      major role in the mechanics of running. Research has shown that runners with iliotibial band
      syndrome have been shown to have weakness in this muscle. Most conventional exercises that
      have been research have been exercises that focus on only activation of this muscle in an
      unloaded position (non-weightbearing). Group B of this study will focus on those exercises
      that have been researched. Group C will be the experimental group in which we will begin with
      the conventional exercises and progress the exercises from a floor (unloaded) position to a
      more dynamic functional position (standing). This will be geared towards running specific
      exercises. We would like to know if there will be a difference in how fast symptoms reduce
      and strength gains occur and at what rate.
