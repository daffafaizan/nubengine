      can detect tumor associated cell free DNA. Although this is the first time investigators are
      using this type of procedure to detect cell free DNA, culdocentesis is not a new procedure.
      It used to be done routinely in the past to examine pelvic fluid. The investigator's goal is
      to develop a test to detect ovarian cancer in women before they develop any signs or symptoms
      of the disease. Currently, there is no screening test for ovarian cancer.

      This study uses a technique called "culdocentesis" to detect DNA released by ovarian cancer
      cells into pelvic fluid. During culdocentesis, a small needle is inserted through the vagina
      into an empty space between the uterus and the rectum called the "cul-de-sac." Fluid is
      withdrawn from this space and sent for analysis. Culdocentesis is a technique that has been
      used for many years to examine pelvic fluid and determine its composition, but it has not
      previously been studied as a technique for examining cell-free DNA to detect ovarian cancer.
      The investigators suspect that this may be a useful way to detect cell-free DNA from ovarian
      cancer cells because the ovaries are very close to the cul-de-sac space.

      In this study, the investigators will compare our ability to detect cell-free DNA in fluid
      from the cul-de-sac with our ability to detect cell-free DNA from a vaginal swab (similar to
      a Pap smear), a blood test, and in the tissue specimens collected at the time of surgery. The
      investigators are hoping to learn from this study whether developing a cell-free DNA test to
      screen for ovarian cancer involving culdocentesis would be an effective strategy.
