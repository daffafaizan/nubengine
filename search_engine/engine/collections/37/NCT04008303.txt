      painful and affect daily life. The cause of migraine is multifactorial and not completely
      understood. Treatment usually includes different classes of medications, life style changes,
      physical therapy, acupuncture, nerve stimulators and avoiding common triggers (like bright
      lights, certain foods, or loud sounds).

      For some patients, Botox injected into the muscles of the forehead and neck can significantly
      reduce pain. Unfortunately, this does not provide long-term relief as the effect of Botox
      lasts for 3 months. Since year 2000 surgery to treat a selected population of migraine
      patients has been gaining popularity and showing promising results. The surgery reduces the
      pressure on the peripheral nerves that are believed to cause migraine headaches by resecting
      the surrounding tissue (bone, fascia, muscle, and arteries). This surgery provides a more
      long-term and permanent relief.

      The purpose of this study is to follow the effectiveness and outcomes of migraine surgery.
