    
      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most painful oral lesion with a considerable
      prevalence . The most common aphthous ulcer treatments include applying topical agents such
      as antibiotics, Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) to immunosuppressants.

      The mixture of Diphenhydramine and Aluminum MgS suspension has been prescribed as an
      analgesic mouthwash for a long time in order to decrease a great number of oral ulcers
      symptoms such as aphthous ulcers. Ibuprofen is a potent NSAID with fair anti-inflammatory
      potential prescribed in dental pains.

      This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effect of Ibuprofen,
      Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS mixture on symptoms of aphthous ulcers.40 patients will be
      participating in this study,20 will receive the mixture of Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS
      while the other group will receive Ibuprofen, Diphenhydramine and Aluminium MgS mixture.

      All patients will be instructed to apply the drug on the site of the ulcer 30-60 minutes
      before meals, 3 times daily. The ulcers will be assessed when the drug is applied for 3 days
      and the level of pain and irritation will be estimated by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale, a
      scaled ruler which the zero point displays the zone of lack of pain and the 10th point was
      considered as the zone of maximum pain).
