      prospectively formulated to compare outcomes of 60 people who completed the study, 30
      participants in each intervention group. Subjects from 18 through 64 years old with low back
      pain on at least half the days over the previous 6 months will be recruited by the Wilton
      Family YMCA and New Canaan Community YMCA to participate in the study. The participants
      within each recruitment cohort will be randomized by a sub-investigator who is a statistician
      to the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1 (stretching exercise experimental arm: self-care
      book active comparator arm). Seven cohorts will receive the intervention stretching exercise
      program at the Wilton Family YMCA and New Canaan Community YMCA from January 2015 to December
      2017. The stretching exercise program consists of 12 standardized weekly stretching exercise
      sessions that incrementally increase in duration from 15-30 minutes. Participants who receive
      the stretching exercise intervention will be asked to practice the identical stretches that
      they did in class on non-class days and will be given handouts and a companion CD to assist
      in this. Thirty control subjects will receive a self-care book. All analyses will be
      conducted assuming intent-to-treat principles using SAS statistical software. All P values
      and 95% CIs will be 2-sided with statistical significance at the P = 0.05 value.
