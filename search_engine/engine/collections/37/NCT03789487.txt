      have been implanted with a CRT device between 6 and 18 months prior to inclusion and are
      considered non-responders are eligible for this study. CRT non-response can be clinical (lack
      of functional improvement or hospitalization for heart failure) and/or echocardiographic
      (insufficient improvement of LVEF and/or reduction of LVESV). Among exclusion criteria,
      permanent atrial fibrillation is of note.

      Recruited patients will be submitted to an optimization procedure of their CRT device
      settings. This will be performed with a non-invasive method using the Finapress NOVA device,
      which records blood pressure with a digital cuff. The peak of blood pressure will correspond
      to the optimal device settings. The first step will be to chose the best pacing vector. The
      second step will be to chose the best AV delay. The best setting, i.e. associated with the
      highest blood pressure, will be programmed at the end of the optimization protocol.

      The patients will be followed at 6 months with clinical evaluation and echocardiography to
      assess the conversion rate of non-responders to responders.
