    
      This is a single-dose, two-period crossover, randomized, fasting, open-label, bioequivalence
      study.

      244 male and female volunteers with a smoking history of minimum 3 months and aged between 18
      and 45 years, inclusive, and motivated to quit will be included. The treatment administration
      order will be randomized with an equal number of subjects in each treatment sequence.

      Single doses of 4 mg Nicorette Strongmint Lozenge (i.e. test product) and 4 mg NiQuitinÂ®
      Minimint Lozenge (i.e. reference product) will be administered in a standardized mode, on two
      separate treatment visits. A washout period of minimum 48 hours will separate the treatment
      administrations.

      An abstinence period of 12 hours including an overnight stay at the clinic is required at
      both treatment occasions.

      Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn pre-dose (i.e. within 5 minutes before drug
      administration) and at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes, as well as 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after start of drug administration. Thus, 17 samples will be collected
      per treatment visit.

      Subjects will be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur.
