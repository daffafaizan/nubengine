      phenylketonuria (PKU) patients within the United States as the pharmaceutical KuvanTM. This
      small molecule functions as a cofactor in multiple enzyme systems, including the metabolism
      of phenylalanine into tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).

      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that KuvanTM therapy could influence nutritional
      and body composition parameters and neurotransmitter concentrations in pediatric and adult
      PKU subjects.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To record nutritional biomarkers, body composition, bone density, and measures of
           nutrient intake in a phenylketonuria subject group at baseline and for one year after
           start of KuvanTM therapy.

        2. To investigate changes in monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis in a phenylketonuria
           subject group at baseline and for one year after start of KuvanTM therapy.

        3. Evaluate changes in quality of life (QOL) for PKU subjects beginning KuvanTM therapy

      METHODOLOGY: Investigators intend to enroll 60 PKU patients, ages 4 to adulthood, who are
      planning to begin BH4 treatment as prescribed by their medical provider. Patients will be
      given 4 weeks to demonstrate a response to KuvanTM as determined by a drop in plasma PHE by
      ≥15%. All patients, regardless of response to KuvanTM, will be allowed to continue in the
      study. All subjects will be followed for a full 12 months while monitoring nutrient intake,
      nutritional biomarkers, serotonin and catecholamine levels, and QOL. Two-tailed statistical
      analysis with α=0.05 will be used to compare results between responders and nonresponders, as
      well as compare follow-up values with baseline measures.
