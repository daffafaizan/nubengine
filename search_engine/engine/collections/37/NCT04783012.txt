      urinary retention often requires the use of indwelling catheters. However, patients often
      view the need for catheters as the worst part of their surgical experience, and follow-up
      voiding trials in the office utilize excess healthcare resources. Many Urology practices
      allow patient removal of catheters after procedures, though this has not been formally
      studied. The purpose of this study is to see if patient removal of catheters at home is
      non-inferior to standard office removal.
