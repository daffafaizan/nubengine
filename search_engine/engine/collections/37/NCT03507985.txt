      non-cancerous (Zenz et al) pain and for the relief of acute trauma pain, for example.

      It is know that morphine as well as pain can cause cognitive disorders but the pain seems to
      slow down the reaction time whereas morphine has an action on the long-term memory (Lorenz J
      et al). According to an experimental study on rats, low dose morphine (equivalent to that
      present in the human brain) does not cause long-term memory problems, as opposed to a higher
      dose. In healthy volunteers, a single dose of morphine gives little cognitive and psychomotor
      dysfunction (Hank et al). After 12 months of taking oral morphine, no cognitive dysfunction
      is detected, with even some improvement for some functions related to stopping pain. More
      recently, it has been shown that long-term morphine use causes spatial memory disturbances
      and that these are probably due to extracellular adenosine accumulation.

      This work suggests that acute morphine could lead to memory and attention disorders. This
      would therefore result in intrinsic impairment of the cognitive abilities of the patient and
      thus an alteration of his understanding in the explanations given concerning a possible
      surgical intervention, the risks and benefits of it.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the patient's attention and memory skills after acute
      morphine use. In order to know their initial capacities, the tests are also done remotely
      outside the influence of the analgesic drugs given to the emergency services. The two
      practical tests, the Stroop Color Word Test and Rey's 15-word test, are easily performed
      tests in an emergency context and validated in the literature.
