      changes in the concentrations and activity of components of the generalized stress response.
      These include the principal hypothalamic stimulus of pituitary-adrenal activation
      (corticotropin releasing hormone) and the locus ceruleus/norepinephrine system. The current
      study attempts to provide a clearer picture of the stability of changes during the acute
      illness, the treatment phase and the recovery process. We particularly wish to determine
      whether abnormalities in HPA axis perturbability in the well-state can be demonstrated, and
      if so how these are related to the acutely-ill state, since this information could provide a
      quantifiable phenotypic marker for depression.
