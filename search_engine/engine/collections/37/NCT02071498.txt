      remember to take all their medications, at the correct doses, distinguish between drugs to
      avoid confusions, avoid known potential interactions and common errors in use of the
      medications and know how to properly store the medications. The app design was based on
      suggestions extracted from 3 nominal groups with a total of 23 patients and a focus group
      with 7 professionals (3 physicians and 4 pharmacists).

      The tablet used was selected on the basis of the need for a device with an at least 7-inch,
      easy to use touch screen, ensuring that users would only have to follow simple instructions
      and tap on some icons on the screen. Specifically, the BQ Verne Plus 3G with an LCD Tactile
      screen was chosen in the case of Android, and an iPad 2 with Wi-Fi + 3G in the case of the
      iOS.
