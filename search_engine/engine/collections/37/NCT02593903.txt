      occurrence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and complications. However, even though
      prophylactic antibiotics are used by some pediatric urologists, to date there has been no
      evidence supporting the role of prophylactic antibiotics in decreasing UTIs or complications.
      This is a prospective, randomized trial involving children undergoing distal or mid-shaft
      hypospadias repair. Subjects randomized into a group taking prophylactic dosages of
      antibiotics and a group not receiving post-operative antibiotics.
