      designed to assess the proportion of overall confirmed responses (CR + PR + MR) using a
      two-stage phase II study design to permit early stopping of the trial if there is strong
      evidence that the study regimen is inactive. In addition, it will assess toxicity of this
      drug in patients with WM. Patients will receive perifosine 150 mg qhs daily. Patients will be
      assessed by serum immunoelectrophoresis and IgM level at least every 4 weeks.

      Patients will take three 50 mg tablets of perifosine qhs daily (for 28 days cycles) with
      food. Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheas. All patients should continue
      therapy unless disease progression is documented on two occasions at least 1 week apart.
      Patients with progressive disease or who refuse further therapy will be discontinued from the
      protocol. Dose modifications for toxicity will be performed.

      Standard criteria for evaluation of response in WM recommended by the Second International WM
      Workshop will be used in this study.
