        -  Determine whether zinc supplements reduce cadmium levels in smokers.

        -  Measure serum levels of cotinine (a biomarker of smoking), zinc (a marker of
           compliance), and cadmium (the dependent variable) at 3 pre-supplementation visits and at
           6 supplementation visits.

        -  Determine whether serum cadmium levels (adjusted for serum levels of cotinine) decrease
           during supplementation with VisiVite Smoker's Formula.

        -  Determine if increased cadmium levels in the blood of cigarette smokers can be
           correlated with decreased mismatch repair.

        -  Determine if administration of zinc-containing supplements reverses cadmium-induced
           inhibition of mismatch repair.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral zinc supplements once daily for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood, serum, and urine are collected once weekly for 3 weeks before beginning treatment and
      in weeks 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 17 for biomarker/laboratory analysis. Samples are examined for
      cadmium, zinc, and cotinine levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, expression of
      mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MSH3, MLH1, and PMS2), levels of messenger RNA by
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and microsatellite instability by gel
      electrophoresis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 5 weeks.
