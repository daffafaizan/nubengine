      operating room and be connected to routine monitors that included a BIS (Covidien), M-Entropy
      sensor (GE Healthcare) and TOF (train of four) monitor. Following preoxygenation, general
      anesthesia will be induced with propofol and remifentanil using traditional syringe pumps.
      The induction doses given and subsequent infusion rates will be determined by utilizing
      pharmacokinetic (Pk) models (Marsh model for propofol, Minto model for remifentanil).
      Unconsciousness will be confirmed by performing the usual clinical assessments and by
      obtaining a BIS value between 40 and 50. Once the subject is unconsciousness, they will be
      given the assigned dose of rocuronium, after which the study anesthesiologist will perform a
      laryngoscopy. The anesthesiologist performing the laryngoscopy will not know what dose of
      rocuronium the subject received. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) will be monitored by a
      train-of-four twitch monitor (TOF Watch-SX) at the adductor pollicis muscle (2 HZ, 50mAmp)
      every 15 seconds.

      At three minutes after the rocuronium administration, a standardized 20-second laryngoscopy
      will be applied. The CVI, entropy, and hemodynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure
      measurement each minute) and train-of-four measurements will be monitored for three minutes
      before and after the laryngoscopy.
