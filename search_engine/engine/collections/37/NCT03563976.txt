      screening CT scans will improve prediction of the outcome of subsequent lung biopsy, an
      invasive diagnostic procedure. In this project, we will construct an image feature-based
      multiparametric prognostic model for biopsy outcome from screening lung CT scans performed at
      our institution, and then validate it using theNLST imaging and clinical outcomes dataset.

      This study involves no treatment or invasive procedures. Investigator will review all charts
      of patients who were treated for early stage lung cancer with definitive radiation therapy at
      UTSW or Parkland Memorial hospital, diagnosed with a malignancy from January 1, 2004 to
      October 31, 2014, to compile demographic, diagnostic, therapeutic, outcome, and toxicity
      data. Investigator expect that this will include approximately 200 patient charts. This data
      will be analyzed statistically and used for future directed research. Investigator will also
      analyze an anonymized dataset of patients from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial
      (NLST) provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
