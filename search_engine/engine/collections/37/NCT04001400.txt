      esophagus. This disease can be classified in to two subtypes according to the symptoms;
      Typical symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, and atypical symptoms (extra-esophageal
      symptoms) such as chronic cough, asthma, non-cardiac chest pain, globus sensation, etc.

      Acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors is the mainstream of therapy for the
      extra-esophageal manifestation as well as the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.

      However, there is controversy about the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors on
      extra-esophageal reflux.

      Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of proton pump inhibotor (rabeprazole) on the
      extra-esophageal manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease, through comparison of
      treatment response with high-dose and standard-dose rabeprazole.
