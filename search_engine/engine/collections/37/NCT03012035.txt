      Both groups undergo the same standardized psychotherapeutic intervention, i.e. exposure
      training. All participants will receive the same exposure training in groups of maximum three
      participants of the same study group. The two study groups only differ regarding the induced
      treatment expectations towards the effects of the exposure training. While the experimental
      group will get an open administration of treatment and be informed in order to have a
      positive treatment expectation, the comparator group will receive a hidden administration of
      treatment and get neutral information, thus treatment expectations will be neutral. Study
      members conducting the exposure training with the participants will not be aware of the
      allocation of the study participants. Study participants will be informed about the aim of
      the allocated condition, but they will be blind to the aim of the study in order to induce
      the specific expectation. Differences in treatment outcomes are compared between both groups
      to investigate the association with treatment expectation.
