      either 1 eye (unilateral cases) or both eyes (bilateral cases) with vascularly active ROP.
      Serum samples are collected 1 day before and 1 day, 3 days, 1 week after intravitreal
      ranibizumab. The serum concentrations of ranibizumab and VEGF are measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay, and the changes of the serum VEGF levels are determined.
