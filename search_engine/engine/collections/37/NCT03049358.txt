      I. To evaluate the effect of olfactory training on olfactory function in patients with
      paranasal sinus and nasopharyngeal carcinoma suffering from olfactory loss after radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the possible effect of olfactory training on quality of life in patients with
      paranasal sinus and nasopharyngeal carcinoma suffering from olfactory loss after radiation.

      II. To study rate and severity of olfactory dysfunction after radiation therapy in patients
      with paranasal sinus or nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      III. To evaluate the possible preventive effect of olfactory training on olfactory
      dysfunction in patients with paranasal sinus and nasopharyngeal carcinoma who will undergo
      radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Arm I: Patients undergo olfactory training
      by smelling 4 essential oils in vials (rose, lemon, clove, and eucalyptus) over 15 seconds
      each, twice daily for 12 weeks.

      Arm II: Patients undergo sham training by smelling canola oil in 4 vials over 15 seconds
      each, twice daily for 12 weeks.
