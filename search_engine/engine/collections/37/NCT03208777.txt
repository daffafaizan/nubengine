      damage but also have a role in regulating cellular senescence. After reaching a critical
      length, telomeres experience a double DNA change and cells will eventually enter senescence
      (replication) or cell death . Telomere length and telomere shortening have been long
      hypothesized to be a biological marker of aging at the cellular level and a potential
      mechanism of carcinogenesis. Genomic instability is a critical factor in the initiation and
      progression of human cancers. One mechanism that underlies genomic instability is loss of
      telomere function .

      fluorescent in situ hybridization is a molecular diagnostic technique that utilizes labeled
      DNA probes to detect or confirm gene or chromosome abnormalities. fluorescent in situ
      hybridization is often utilized for both research and diagnosis of hematological malignancies
      and solid tumors. Conceptually, fluorescent in situ hybridization is a very straightforward
      technique whereby a DNA probe is hybridized to its complementary sequence on chromosomal
      preparations previously fixed on microscope slides . fluorescent in situ hybridization is
      able to detect cells that have chromosomal abnormalities consistent with neoplasia .

      There has been a surge of published studies which assessed the association between telomere
      length and development of colorectal carcinoma. Thus, a meta-analysis addressing colorectal
      carcinoma and telomere length would be a useful addition to the current information in this
      area.
