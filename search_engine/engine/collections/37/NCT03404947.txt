      exercise. Evidence suggests that delivery of fat to the working muscles during exercise may
      be limited with ethanol and therefore this may shift the relative proportions of energy
      derived from muscle stores of carbohydrate as a result (Jorfeldt & Juhlin-Dannfelt, 1976).

      The current study aims to investigate how a small-moderate dose of ethanol influences where
      energy is derived from during a prolonged bout of moderate intensity cycling exercise.

      Participants will visit the lab on three occasions, once for preliminary measurements of
      fitness and body composition, and twice for the experimental bouts of exercise. Body
      composition will be assessed using a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, which will
      measure lean mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density. Participants will then perform an
      incremental maximal oxygen uptake test to determine intensity for the experimental bouts of
      exercise.

      The two experimental bouts of exercise include cycling on an exercise bike for 2 hours at 55%
      of their maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. fitness) following 1 hours rest. This will be performed
      under two conditions: with and without ethanol ingestion. Pre and post exercise muscle
      biopsies will be collected to assess muscle metabolism, with regular blood samples and
      expired breath samples being collected to further investigate fuel delivery and use by the
      working tissues. The experimental bouts of exercise will be performed 1 week apart in a
      randomised order.
