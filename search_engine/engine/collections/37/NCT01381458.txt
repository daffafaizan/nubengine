    
      Managed care patients (aged >40 years) who were fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate
      combination (FSC)-naive in the 12 months pre-index period. The index-date was the date of
      discharge of the index Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-related
      hospitalization/Emergency Department (ED) visit. Eligible patients were required to newly
      initiate or switch to drug therapy with FSC or ipratropium (IPR) / tiotropium (TIO) during
      the identification period (01/01/2004 to 01/31/2008) to treat COPD. Patients who switched to
      another maintenance medication or had an exacerbation in the treatment assessment period
      (30-days post-index date) were excluded from the study. Follow-up period was 12 months post
      treatment assessment period. Patients classified as being on FSC 250/50 versus
      anticholinergics (TIO, IP or IPR). Examined risk of COPD-related exacerbations such as
      hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, COPD-related physician/outpatient visit
      with oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic prescription (ABX) within 5 days of
      physician/outpatient visit and COPD-related medical, pharmacy, and total healthcare costs in
      follow-up period.
