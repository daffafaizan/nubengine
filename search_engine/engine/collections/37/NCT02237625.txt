      wide range of clinical expressivity, with a spectrum ranging from stillbirth without
      mineralized bone to early loss of teeth without bone symptoms. Depending on the age at
      diagnosis six clinical forms are currently recognized: perinatal (lethal), perinatal benign,
      infantile, childhood, adult and odontohypophosphatasia. Severe forms of HPP (perinatal and
      infantile) are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and in milder forms (adult and
      odontohypophosphatasia) autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance coexist.

      Because of the rarity of HPP as well as the side spectrum of both clinical presentation and
      inheritance patterns of the HPP trait, a natural history study cataloging specific clinical
      data with HPP would prove invaluable for future research into this disease. Specifically, it
      is our goal to create a comprehensive multi-discipline modality for care for hypophosphatasia
      patients, researching clinical manifestations of the disease such as extent of bone disease,
      ophthalmologic manifestations, orthopedic issues, renal issues, musculoskeletal
      manifestations as well as other more anecdotal findings such as those seen with cochlear
      implant failures and/or early menopause.
