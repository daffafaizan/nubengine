      Portuguese with an estimated cost in the United Stated of $50 billion. Randomized controlled
      trials has shown that placebo interventions can dramatically reduce chronic low back pain and
      its associated disability. Generally, it is assumed that response to placebo requires
      concealment or deception, which presents a dilemma to the clinician. In clinical practice,
      how can patients benefit from an available, effective and potentially cost-effective
      intervention without being deceived? This study seeks to determine ethically acceptable
      open-label placebo treatment (with full informed consent) can lead to meaningful benefits.
      The primary study will involve 80 patients with cLBP who will be randomly assigned to a
      three-week course of either non-deceptive open-label placebo pills in the context of a
      persuasive rationale + treatment as usual or to be continued on their treatment-as-usual.
      Primary outcome measures will be pain intensity and symptom bothersomeness on the previous
      week. Additionally, the study will investigate a possible association between the genetic
      variation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT polymorphisms) with the hypothesized
      observed placebo effect on cLBP patients. Participants will be followed for 3 weeks with a
      mid-point (11 days) visit. Patients who receive only usual care for the first three weeks
      will be eligible to elect a three week course of treatment with open-label placebo after
      which they will be assessed. This study has been submitted and approved by the following
      review board: Comissão de Ética do Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (Lisbon West
      Hospitals Centre's Ethical Committee) Institutional Review Board.
