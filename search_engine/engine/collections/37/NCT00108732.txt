      I. To evaluate the effect of PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM (Vaccinia) on cycle 1 followed by
      PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM (Fowlpox) and GM-CSF on biochemical PSA progression at 6 months.

      II. To determine the change in PSA velocity pre-treatment to post-treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the percentage of patients experiencing a >50% decline in serum PSA repeated
      at 4 weeks.

      II. To evaluate tolerability and any toxicity related to treatment with PSA vaccine and
      GM-CSF.

      III. To determine the effect of GM-CSF on PSA immediately after treatment (day 4) compared to
      a delayed effect (day 15).

      IV. To determine the PSA nadir, and percentage of patients with undetectable PSA, treated
      with combined vaccine and androgen ablation therapy over 12 months.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 during weeks 1-4. Beginning in week 5, patients receive
      fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine SC on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4. Treatment with
      fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 5-16).
      Beginning in week 17, patients receive fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF as above every
      12 weeks in the absence of clinical or biochemical disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with biochemical or clinical disease progression receive androgen ablation therapy
      comprising oral bicalutamide once daily for 1 month and goserelin SC once every 4 weeks in
      addition to fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF. Treatment continues in the absence of
      further clinical or biochemical disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
