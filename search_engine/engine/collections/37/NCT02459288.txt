      including aspirin and P2Y12 antagonist, play important roles at the acute and subacute stage
      treatment for acute coronary syndrome, especially after coronary stent implantation. Patients
      with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) experience higher cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. Clopidogrel, one of P2Y12 receptor antagonists, inhibits the
      receptor's activation by blocking its interaction with ADP. However, the efficacy of
      clopidogrel shows substantial variation and residual platelet reactivity, which is related to
      adverse cardiovascular outcome, especially in impaired renal function. Our study aims to
      check the platelet inhibition rate comparing both medication with a cross-over study among
      CKD subjects and ACS condition.
