      medicines are broken down in the liver. The liver is an organ in the belly. A person's age,
      size, genetics (DNA), and the health of their liver decide how quickly the body breaks down
      medicines and how much medication a person needs to take. Everybody's liver has some fat in
      it, but the amount of fat is different from person to person. The purpose of this study is to
      see if the amount of fat in the liver affects how quickly acid suppression medications start
      and stop working and get removed from the body.
