      Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV) is the third cause of late mortality and the leading
      cause of late allograft dysfunction. The field of heart transplantation currently lacks
      longitudinal description of CAV profiles. Identifying relevant CAV trajectories, or evolution
      profiles, and their respective determinants is an unmet clinical need. CAV trajectories
      requires an additional level of understanding and characterization over the current paradigm.
      Understanding the mechanisms and clinical factors involved in the development of CAV will be
      useful to provide a more nuanced picture of disease progression, which may ultimately
      contribute to risk stratification and ultimately guiding the care of HTx patients.

      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s):

        -  Identification of CAV trajectories after transplantation using an unsupervised latent
           class mixed modeling. CAV angiograms were recorded per center protocol for all patients
           after transplantation. CAV was graded according to the current ISHLT classification as
           CAV 0 (not significant), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe).

        -  Determination of clinical, functional, structural, immunological factors associated with
           the trajectories. In the derivation cohort, the associations between CAV trajectories
           and clinical, histological, functional, and immunological parameters at the time of
           transplantation, during the first year and at one-year post-transplant were assessed
           using multinomial logistic regression.
