      recruited, sign an informed consent and will receive a thorough explanation regarding the
      side effects and possible beneficial affects the laser treatments may bestow.

      Patients will undergo randomization to either a series of 3 laser treatments or 3 sham
      treatments, and the effect of these treatments will be measured by several validated
      questionaires and by means of gynecological examination.

      Follow up after treatment cessation will be for 12 months post-treatment.
