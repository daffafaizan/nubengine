      8400 medical intensive care units at Barnes-Jewish Hospital requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation for support in respiratory failure from pneumonia. Data will be collected on
      patients admitted from 1/2016-12/2016. The investigators will be collecting initial patient
      characteristic data as well as reviewing microbial specimen results (tracheal aspirate,
      bronchial alveolar lavage, viral multiplex, blood cultures) and antibiotic usage in real
      time. The investigators will identify any changes in antibiotic usage demonstrated with the
      advising of the ICU antibiotic stewardship team.
