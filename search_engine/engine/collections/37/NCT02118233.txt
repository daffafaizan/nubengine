      revascularization for symptomatic carotid stenosis and for asymptomatic carotid stenosis
      (greater than 60%) to prevent stroke. Guidelines supporting the use of carotid endarterectomy
      for asymptomatic stenosis are based largely on the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study
      (ACAS) which reported a 47% relative risk reduction for ipsilateral stroke or death in
      patients randomized to surgery compared to best medical management over 5 years. These data
      were further substantiated by the recent publication of the Medical Research Council
      Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery (ACST) trial results (1); however, both trials estimated that at
      least 40 operative procedures were required to prevent a single disabling stroke or death in
      one patient after 5 years (2). These data underscore the importance of understanding the
      cognitive risks of carotid revascularization and developing strategies to limit factors that
      contribute to this risk especially in asymptomatic patients.

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of carotid revascularization
      (using either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting
      (CAS)) on cognitive outcome by prospectively collecting cerebral blood flow data and
      cognitive testing data prior to and after carotid revascularization procedures.
