      accordance with a list of random numbers, generated by a computer program, are allocated in
      one of the treatment groups (conventional or intensive) when the blood glucose value recorded
      is greater than 200 mg/dl on two consecutive measures in an interval of 30
      minutes.Conventional Group (GCon): patients randomized to the conventional group will receive
      insulin infusion in a dilution of 100 units of regular insulin in 100 ml of physiological
      solution (NaCl 0.9%) in continuous infusion pump for maintenance of blood glucose between 140
      mg/dl and 180 mg/dl.

      Group intensive (GInt): patients randomized to the intensive group will receive insulin
      infusion in a dilution of 100 units of regular insulin in 100 ml of physiological solution
      (NaCl 0.9%) in continuous infusion pump for maintenance of blood glucose between 90 mg/dl and
      110 mg/dl.

      The insulin dose adjustment will be based on measurements of arterial blood glucose
      undiluted, held at intervals of one to 4 hours with the use of a monitoring system of glucose
      and beta-blood ketone (Freestyle Precision Pro, Abbott). The dosage is adjusted according to
      an algorithm by a team of intensive care nurses, trained for this purpose and assisted by a
      study physician not involved in the clinical care of patients.

      On admission, all patients will receive intravenous glucose solution continuously (200 to 300
      g in 24 hours). As soon as possible, the patient will be nurtured according to the routine of
      Surgical ICU for nutrition in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery patient.
