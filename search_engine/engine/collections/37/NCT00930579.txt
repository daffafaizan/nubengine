      biologic effects of metformin in women with newly diagnosed early invasive breast cancer.
      Metformin is a biguanide derivative which is commonly used to treat patients with diabetes.
      This model will be used to evaluate the effects of metformin on a specific molecular pathway
      called the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in the tumor. The effects of metformin on serum
      insulin levels and components of the insulin resistance syndrome will also be studied.
