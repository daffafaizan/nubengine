      organ prolapse. A voiding trial is performed postoperative day one to determine if urinary
      retention or abnormal bladder function exists. A significant number of patients ranging from
      26-47% will require continued catheterization post-op for urinary retention in order to avoid
      injuries associated with over distention of the bladder and ureteral reflux.

      This study aims to explore a strategy to reduce the length of catheterization
      post-operatively by testing the bladder at a closer interval to surgery. An earlier voiding
      trial may improve patient perioperative satisfaction and decrease catheter associated urinary
      tract infections. Additional benefits that may also be seen are earlier first ambulation and
      quicker achievement of post-op discharge milestones (pain control, ambulation with symptoms,
      oral intake tolerance and completion of a voiding trial). To date, few studies have attempted
      a day of surgery voiding trial in patients being admitted for repair of pelvic organ prolapse
      that requires an overnight admission.
