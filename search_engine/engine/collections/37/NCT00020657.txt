        -  Compare the effectiveness of a 5 hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist
           antiemetic vs prochlorperazine in controlling delayed nausea after chemotherapy in
           patients with chemotherapy-naive cancer.

        -  Compare the effectiveness of prochlorperazine administered on a preventive vs as needed
           basis in controlling delayed nausea after chemotherapy in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
           antiemetic vs prochlorperazine.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with prochlorperazine administered on a
           preventive vs as needed basis.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center.

      Patients receive their scheduled chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin and their
      scheduled oral 5 hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist antiemetic (ondansetron,
      granisetron, tropisetron, or dolasetron mesylate) combined with dexamethasone on day 1.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 3 antiemetic arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral prochlorperazine every 8 hours on days 2 and 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral ondansetron every 12 hours, oral granisetron every 12
           hours, or oral dolasetron mesylate either once a day or every 12 hours on days 2 and 3.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral prochlorperazine as needed, up to 4 times per day, on
           days 2 and 3.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 670 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
