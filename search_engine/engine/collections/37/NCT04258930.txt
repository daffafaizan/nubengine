      virus. It is considered a local reactivation of varicella (chicken pox). The rash of herpes
      zoster is characterized by vesicles that appear following a single dermatome (the territory
      that is innervated by one spinal nerve). These vesicles may be very painful and cause
      discomfort due to draining and crusting. When a person becomes sick with shingles healthcare
      professionals prescribe systemic (oral) treatment with antivirals (e.g. acyclovir) and pain
      medication according to the type and severity. To treat the local lesions caused by shingles,
      over the centuries, patients have been treated with drying solutions and drying powders. This
      practice has been passed on through the years without any evidence supporting its
      effectiveness, in all likelihood due to the fact that the rash is self-limited to 2 to 3
      weeks. Recently, new evidence has shown that the vesicles that appear with the shingles rash
      are not superficial but involve deeper areas of the skin and should be considered partial
      thickness wounds. Since 1962, it has become clear that partial thickness wounds benefit from
      occlusive therapy (keeping wounds closed and avoiding drying) such as dressings and occlusive
      gels that keep the wound wet rather than allowing it to dry.

      In this clinical trial the investigators believe that given this information, using occlusive
      therapy with a hydrocolloid dressing or a silicone-based gel may heal the rash of herpes
      zoster, decrease pain and improve the quality of life, much faster than the treatment
      currently used of drying the area with powders and solutions.
