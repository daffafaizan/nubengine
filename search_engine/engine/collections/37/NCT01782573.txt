      a result of colonization by the patient's native skin flora . The most common pathogens
      causing SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci , components of
      normal skin flora . Therefore, preoperative disinfection of the surgical site with an
      antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice before any surgical intervention to decrease
      skin microbial counts before incision . It is considered an important step in limiting
      surgical wound contamination and preventing infection.

      A variety of skin-preparation agents and methods are available for preventing surgical site
      infections and the techniques for preoperative cleansing of the skin vary among hospitals and
      surgeons. There is a pressing need to elucidate the effect of cutaneous disinfection with
      chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) in prevention of surgical site infections.

      Many studies demonstrated that comparisons with cutaneous disinfection with povidone-iodine,
      disinfection with CHG before insertion of an intravascular device and for post-infection site
      care can substantially reduce the incidence of device-related infection .

      Hence, this study aimed to test whether an additional chlorhexidine gluconate scrub followed
      by a routine disinfection would lower the incidence of surgical site culture and subsequent
      infection after hepatic resection. This data will show the originality and clinical
      importance of a cutaneous pre-disinfection scrubbing solution for such risk patients with
      hepatectomy.
