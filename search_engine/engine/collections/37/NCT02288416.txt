      I. Test the feasibility and acceptability of the video-based intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe incidence, degree, and duration of screen-related anxiety among individuals
      scheduled to undergo low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan (LDCT) for lung cancer screening
      (LCS).

      II. To describe baseline patient characteristics and pre-screening anxiety levels.

      III. To describe the preliminary outcomes on screen-related anxiety for patients both not in
      the intervention group and those in the intervention group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care following LCS consisting of routine visits and
      telephone contact with the LCS program nurse practitioner and coordinator.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo a video-based intervention prior to undergoing LCS. Patients watch
      a 5-minute video that focuses on preparing patients for LCS by providing information on the
      following: program team and contact information; reason to be screened; screening
      eligibility; how screening is performed; what to expect on the day of screening; what to
      expect after screening; what to expect if result is positive; what to expect if result is
      negative; and risks of screening. Patients also receive an educational handbook. Patients
      with positive scans (a Lung-Imaging Reporting and Data Systems [RADS] 3 or 4) receive
      additional brochure and nursing support within 1 week after notification of scan results.

      After completion of LCS, patients are followed up at 1 week and then at 3 and 7 months.
