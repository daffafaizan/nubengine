      cervical spinal cord compression caused by chronic degenerative changes of the cervical
      spine. CSM is the most serious and disabling condition of cervical spondylosis. Natural
      history studies showed that most of the CSM patients have a progressive deterioration course
      and no spontaneous regression occurs. It is suggested that the patients with moderate to
      severe CSM should be operated as early as possible before neurological deficits are too
      pronounced.

      Although there are many options available for the surgical treatment of cervical spondylotic
      myelopathy, the choice of surgical approach for CSM is still a controversial issue. Most of
      the surgeons select the surgical approach based on the number of levels involved and the
      alignment of the spine. Anterior procedure is generally recommended for patients with
      compression of less than 3 levels or in patients with kyphotic alignment, while posterior
      decompression is suggested for three or more levels of compression. Retrospective clinical
      study however has shown that both anterior and posterior surgeries could produce comparable
      results. There is no scientific data based on randomized, prospective clinical studies
      comparing the various surgical alternatives. The existing information does not clearly favor
      any one single approach or operative option. Since anterior and posterior surgeries carries
      different risks, it is important to identify the most appropriate surgical procedure that is
      supported by evidence rather than just by surgeons preference.

      The objective of this study is to compare the long-term clinical outcome of anterior approach
      versus posterior approach in the treatment of cervical myelopathy caused by degenerative
      disease of the cervical spine.
