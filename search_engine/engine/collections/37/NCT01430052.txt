      pancreas itself, it becomes difficult to excise in most cases. Generally, most pancreatic
      cancers are already unresectable at the time of diagnosis when we have recognized
      infiltration of over 1/2 the circumference of major arteries such as the celiac artery and
      super mesenteric artery in particular.

      In comparison with advanced pancreatic cancer with distant metastases, it is not easy to
      treat unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer, even when performing standard
      gemcitabine monotherapy. In the case of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancers
      without distant metastases, we are left with the choice of whether or not to perform
      radiation therapy. This decision remains unsolved worldwide, despite the continuing efforts
      of researchers to bring an end to the clinical doubt.

      We will report our results as well as the problems of combining treatments with
      chemoradiotherapy, using the novel anticancer agent gemcitabine as well as/or S-1, not 5FU,
      predominantly from our own clinical trials on this occasion.
