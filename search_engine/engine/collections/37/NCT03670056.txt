    
      The primary objective of this study is t assess whether the change in the ratio of effector T
      cells (Teff) to regulatory T cells (Treg), i.e. CD8 positive/FoxP3 expressing CD4 T cells,
      between pre- and on- treatment biopsies, will predict clinical response in patients with
      recurrent SCLC treated with combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      Secondary objectives of the study include: to determine the objective response rate per
      RECIST 1.1 and immune-related response criteria, duration of response, progression free
      survival, and overall survival with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with recurrent SCLC;
      to evaluate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment and blood after treatment with
      ipilimumab and nivolumab; and to evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a marker for
      response to therapy.
