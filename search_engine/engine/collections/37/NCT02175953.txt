      Department of Psychosomatic Medicine of the University Rostock Medical Center. In a first
      pilot study with 10 participants without control group, we tested the feasability and
      acceptance of the program (completed 2/2015). From 4/2015 a phase IIa study started with 10
      participants in the intervention group and 10 in the control groups (will be organized by
      waiting list). The program consists of two modules of caregiver education followed by ten
      psychotherapeutic group modules. Duration of each module is planned to be 90 minutes
      including a relaxation exercise at the end of each module. Primary outcomes are the
      feasibility, acceptance and the effect on caregiver burden.
