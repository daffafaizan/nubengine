      not responsive to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs for the sarcoidosis (1;2). Inhaled
      iloprost has been approved for treatment of pulmonary hypertension (3). We propose to study
      the effectiveness of inhaled iloprost for sarcoidosis associated pulmonary hypertension
      (SAPAH). This is an open label trial, with patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy. Clinical
      and hemodynamic outcome of therapy will be assessed.
