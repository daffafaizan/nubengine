      prior to arthroscopy by the infusion of sterile saline into the knee joint followed by the
      immediate withdrawal into the syringe. Sixteen asymptomatic control subjects also contributed
      knee samples. The concentrations of 17 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were measured using
      a multiplexed immunoassay panel. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging findings and
      cytokine assay results were compared to "gold-standard" intraoperative findings.
