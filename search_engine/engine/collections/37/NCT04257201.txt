      distinct postprandial nutrimetabolomic profiles in the plasma and urine and that the amount
      of metabolites present will increase with the servings of mushrooms. Measuring ergothioneine
      in the plasma will provide a quantitative outcome to document the postprandial responses to
      consuming the test meals. The nutrimetabolomic related outcomes are exploratory and have not
      been documented in human research.
