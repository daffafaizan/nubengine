    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine, and the dose-limiting toxicities
      of the combination of clofarabine and cytarabine with G-CSF priming, in the treatment of
      patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the hematological and non-hematological side effect profile of the
      combination of clofarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF.

      II. To determine the efficacy of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine and G-CSF priming
      in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      III. To determine the disease-free and overall survival after therapy with clofarabine,
      cytarabine, and G-CSF for relapsed or refractory AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of clofarabine.

      PART I:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour and cytarabine IV over 2 hours
      on days 1-5, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning 24 hours prior to
      chemotherapy and continuing until blood count recover. Patients with residual leukemia (>= 5%
      blasts by morphology) at day 14 and if blast remain > 5% by day 21 receive a second course of
      induction therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF as in induction
      therapy. Patients may receive a second course of consolidation therapy depending on response
      and whether additional therapy (e.g., stem cell transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion) is
      planned.

      PARTS II and III:

      Patients receive induction therapy and consolidation therapy as in part 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
