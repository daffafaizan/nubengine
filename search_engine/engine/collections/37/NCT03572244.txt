      microgrooved and machined. The implant abutment is the dental prosthetic part that connects
      the implant to the crown. As a part of this study, subjects will have a dental implant
      surgically placed in their jaw bone. The implant will serve as the artificial root. After the
      implant heals, subjects will have the abutment and crown placed on the implant.

      This study will compare levels of inflammation next to the implant abutment. Both implant
      abutment designs are FDA approved but differ in microtexturing. This study will determine if
      these texture differences have any impact on the healing of subjects' jaw bone and gums after
      implant surgery.
