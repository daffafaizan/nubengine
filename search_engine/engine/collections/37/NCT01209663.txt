      beds (high dependency beds). This may reflect lack of scientific evidence for the effect of
      intermediate care combined with restricted healthcare resources. Better access to dedicated
      postoperative intensive/intermediate care facilities has been suggested as a factor which
      potentially can reduce postoperative complication rate and mortality in high risk surgical
      patients. The Incare Trial will provide important data on the effect of postoperative
      intermediate care in emergency abdominal surgery patients.
