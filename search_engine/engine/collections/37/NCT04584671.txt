    
      This is a multisite longitudinal study of the long-term lung health impact of COVID-19 using
      hyperpolarized xenon-129 (129Xe) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a period of up to 4
      years.

      In total 200 participants age ≥ 18 and <80 years who experienced a documented case of
      COVID-19 (documented by positive COVID-19 test and/or clinical history) will be screened and
      recruited if they meet all inclusion criteria at the 5 participating sites. Participants will
      be grouped in mild or severe COVID-19 infection (100 in each group) including 50 with
      symptoms and at least 50 participants who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, all of
      whom are within 3 months post recovery and non-infectious. Participants will attend up to 5
      study visits over the 4 year period. (Visit 1 within 3 months post-COVID-19 recovery, Visit 2
      at 24 ± 4 weeks, Visit 3 at 48 ± 4 weeks, Visit 4 at 78 ± 4 weeks, Visit 5 at 200 ± 16 weeks)

      At all visits, participants will complete 129Xe MRI, questionnaires (St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale,
      Modified Borg Scale Breathlessness and Fatigue Questionnaire, Baseline Dyspnea Index
      Questionnaire and International Physical Activity Questionnaire), pulmonary function tests
      (Spirometry, Plethysmography, Forced Oscillation Technique, Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide,
      and Multiple Breath Nitrogen Washout), blood and sputum analysis, exercise testing
      (six-minute walk test). At Visit 1, participants will also complete computed tomography
      imaging at University Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre. Visits 2 and 4 have the option
      of being completed over the phone, in which case only questionnaires will be completed. Visit
      5 is an optional 4-year follow-up.
