      fulvestrant in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. To test this hypothesis, the
      researchers propose a pre-surgical randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen vs fulvestrant in
      the window between breast cancer diagnosis on core biopsy and definitive surgery. Women with
      ER/cyclinD1 positive tumors will be eligible. Response to tamoxifen or fulvestrant will be
      evaluated using standard proliferation index as well as gene expression signatures obtained
      in pre-clinical models of tamoxifen resistance and sensitivity to fulvestrant. In addition,
      the researchers propose to use cutting edge new technology allowing ex-vivo expansion of
      primary culture from only a few cancer cells obtained by fine needle biopsy. The researchers
      propose to compare the response of these primary cells to patient response. If successful,
      the impact of this work can support the expansion of use of fulvestrant to not only
      postmenopausal women but premenopausal women as well. In addition, it may serve as a proof of
      principle to maximize the use of biopsy material to predict treatment response
