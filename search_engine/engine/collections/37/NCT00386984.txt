      methodological deficiencies the results of this pilot study will be re-evaluated by
      comparison of octreotide versus placebo primarily regarding to the global survival time and
      secondarily concerning the costs, side effects, patient compliance and quality of life as
      well as the Somatostatin receptors in the tumor tissue and its prognostic relevance in both
      groups with 108 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      An interim analysis was done after occurrence of the half of the events (deaths). No
      significant effect could be shown.
