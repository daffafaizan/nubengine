    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic
      valve implantation (TAVI) in septuagenarians with severe, symptomatic Aortic Stenosis (AS)
      and risk factors for adverse surgical outcomes not captured by the traditional risk scores
      and therefore of intermediate surgical risk.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate device success of TAVI with the Evolut R
      and Evolut Pro systems in septuagenarians with risk factors for adverse surgical outcomes not
      captured by the traditional risk scores and therefore of intermediate surgical risk.

      The secondary objective is to assess early safety (at 30 days) and clinical efficacy (after
      30 days) of the TAVI procedure.

      Exploratory objective: comparative health economics in septuagenarians with symptomatic
      severe aortic stenosis and intermediate surgical risk treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation (TAVI) vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) (matched historic cohort)
