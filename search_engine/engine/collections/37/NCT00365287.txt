      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of nonmyeloablative preparative regimen comprising
           cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation with or without anti-thymocyte
           globulin, in terms of non-relapse mortality at day 100 post-transplantation, in patients
           with advanced hematologic malignancies, metastatic breast cancer, or renal cell cancer
           who are undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation from an unrelated donor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery and degree of chimerism on days 21, 60, 100, 180,
           and 360 post-transplantation.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
           by day 100 post-transplantation and chronic GVHD at 1 year post-transplantation.

        -  Evaluate the risk of relapse at 1 year post-transplantation.

        -  Determine overall survival at 1 year post-transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Nonmyeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours
           on day -6 and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2. Patients also undergo
           total-body irradiation on day -1. Some patients* may also receive anti-thymocyte
           globulin (ATG) IV twice daily on days -6 to -4.

      NOTE: *Patients who have not had prior combination chemotherapy within the past 3 months OR
      who only received 1 prior induction course for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
      acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast
      crisis receive ATG during the preparative regimen.

        -  Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT): Patients undergo UCBT from an unrelated
           donor on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours or
           orally 2-3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a
           taper until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally twice
           daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 30 or until 7 days after engraftment.

      After transplantation, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
