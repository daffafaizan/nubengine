    
      This will be a phase I/II study of hypofractionation delivering five fractions (one fraction
      delivered every 2nd day) of 7 Gy of external beam radiotherapy over 5 fractions (one and half
      week period) in patients with localized STSs who are planned to receive pre-operative
      radiotherapy. Patients will undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of RT.

      Pre-treatment evaluation will be according to standard practice:

      History and Physical Exam

        -  height,

        -  weight

        -  history (diabetes, vascular disease)

      Radiology

        -  MRI of primary site or

        -  CT if MRI not tolerated

        -  CT chest

      Quality of Life

        -  Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Rating Scale

        -  Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS)

      Follow-up assessment will be done as follows:

      History and Physical Exam

        -  Acute radiation toxicity

        -  During RT and 2 weeks after end of RT

      Acute surgical toxicity - wound assessment

        -  At hospital discharge,

        -  2 weeks post-surgery

        -  1 month post-surgery

        -  3 months post-surgery

        -  6 months post-surgery

      Late toxicity (skin, subcutaneous, bone, joint) & peripheral limb edema

      - Every 6 months thereafter

      Radiology

        -  Chest CT-scan

        -  Within 1 month pre-surgery

        -  Standard thereafter

      MRI or CT scan of primary site

        -  Prior to surgery, as standard

        -  Every 3-6 months or as needed after surgery

      Quality of life Questionnaires

        -  Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS

        -  Musclo Tumor Rating Scale (MSTS)

        -  At months 1,3,6, 12, 18 and 24 after surgery.

        -  Yearly thereafter up to 5 years
