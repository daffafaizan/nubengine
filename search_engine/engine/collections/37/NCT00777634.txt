      disorder, 150 matched controls, and approximately 888 of their first degree relatives. In
      follow-up to this, we are interviewing these individuals again at 2.5 and 5 years after their
      initial interview. During the course of the interview, individuals are asked about their
      psychiatric and medical history and blood pressure and laboratory specimens are obtained to
      measure, among other things, fasting lipids and glucose.
