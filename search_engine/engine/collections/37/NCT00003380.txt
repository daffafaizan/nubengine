      etoposide in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma.
      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this therapy in these patients. III.
      Evaluate the response rate of patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of etoposide and doxorubicin HCl
      liposome. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1, followed by oral
      etoposide for 8-14 days beginning on day 2. For patients who achieve partial or complete
      response, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. For patients with stable disease, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      6 months. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 3 patients treated,
      subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive doses of etoposide for more prolonged
      periods. After 14 days of oral etoposide, the dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome is escalated.
      The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
