      I. Determine whether decitabine can restore iodine I 131 (131I) uptake in patients with
      metastatic papillary thyroid or follicular thyroid cancer lesions that are undetectable by
      low-dose iodine 131I scanning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of 131I therapy, administered after restoration of 131I uptake by
      decitabine, in these patients.

      II. Determine the effect of decitabine on clinical and molecular markers of thyroid cancer
      cell differentiation in these patients.

      III. Determine the safety and tolerability of decitabine in patients undergoing thyroid
      hormone withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism and 131I therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenous (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 of weeks 1 and
      2 (course 1). On week 3, patients undergo iodine I 131 (131I) scanning using thyrotropin alfa
      injections. Patients whose scan does not demonstrate iodine uptake continue suppressive
      thyroid hormone therapy but receive no further study therapy. These patients undergo study
      follow up.

      Patients whose scan demonstrates iodine uptake undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal on weeks
      4-8 and receive a second course of decitabine (as in course 1) on weeks 7 and 8. Patients
      then receive 131I therapy on week 9.

      Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months.
