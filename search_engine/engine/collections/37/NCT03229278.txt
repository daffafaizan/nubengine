      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of trigriluzole in
      combination with PD-1 inhibiting antibodies, and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      trigriluzole in combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the efficacy of the combination therapy. II. To identify markers of
      response to trigriluzole in the tumor microenvironment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trigriluzole.

      Patients receive trigriluzole orally (PO) every other day (QOD), twice daily (BID), every
      morning (QAM) or every bedtime (QHS) on days -14 to -1. Patients then receive nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO QOD,
      BID, QAM or QHS. Once the MTD of trigriluzole with nivolumab is identified, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO.
      Treatment repeats for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3
      years.
