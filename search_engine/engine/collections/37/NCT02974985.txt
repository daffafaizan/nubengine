      indications (the cheek, subcutaneously and supraperiosteally, the dermis and subdermis for
      the correction of wrinkles and folds such as the nasolabial fold) and placed as usual and
      customary using techniques as practiced by the authors and as are accepted widely.

      Additional steps prior to injection for this study are temporary sterile magic marker
      markings markers on the face and detailed photography, both 2D and 3D, that will be taken
      before, during, and after injection, and the segmentation of injections such that the midface
      will be injected prior to and separately from the lower face.

      Three dimensional data will be analyzed using Vectra analytic software, and 2-D photographs
      will be analyzed by measuring improvements in WIZDOM (width of the interzygomatic distance of
      the midface) and its distance to the inner canthus.
