    
      This is a dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of
      multiple doses of an oral, sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite (TV1001sr) in
      subjects with DNP. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of twice daily 40 mg and 80 mg TV1001sr compared with placebo over a 12 week treatment
      period and the pharmacokinetics of the sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and markers of functional
      improvement including pain questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing and changes in
      markers of diabetes.
