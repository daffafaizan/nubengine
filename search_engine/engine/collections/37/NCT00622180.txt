      vitiligo on the backs of both hands. Punch minigrafting will be performed on both hands
      taking skin from the thighs and/or buttocks. Light treatments will be administered starting
      at week one after grafting. One hand will receive narrow-band ultraviolet B light and the
      other will receive focal 308-nm light treatments. Light treatments will be administered 3
      times per week for 12 weeks. A long term follow-up visit will be completed at week 25. The
      investigator will evaluate the subjects at week 4, 7, 13 and 25 in addition to screening and
      baseline evaluations/procedures.
