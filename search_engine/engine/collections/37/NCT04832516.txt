      physical activity, even moderate, plays an important role in the prevention and the
      management of the main chronic non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, certain
      cancers, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis ...) as well as by improving psychological health.
      The effects are beneficial regardless of age, gender and state of health. Moreover, in
      addition to the well-being of employees, several studies have shown that physical activity
      has a positive impact on the economy of companies via the reduction of absenteeism and the
      improvement of productivity. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribes 150 min of
      physical activity per week regardless of the person's profile (active employee, employee
      working in his office, construction worker, etc.).. In this project,the investigators
      therefore want to test the physical qualities of employees in order to prescribe the best
      possible dose of physical activity with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life.
