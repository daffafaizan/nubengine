      Aim 1 (Phase I). Systematically adapt an empirically supported couple-based skills training
      intervention to help young breast and gynecologic cancer (BGC) survivors and their partners
      jointly manage the reproductive and sexual health consequences of cancer.

      Aim 2 (Phase II - Quantitative). Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention and hypothesized
      mediators by conducting a randomized trial. We will evaluate the efficacy of the newly
      adapted intervention, Opening the Conversation (OC), on survivors' and their partners'
      reproductive and sexual distress as well as the relationship, sexual, and psychosocial health
      outcomes. We will determine whether dyadic coping and communication mediate intervention
      effects on survivors' and partners' reproductive and sexual distress.

      Aim 3 (Phase II - Qualitative). Evaluate couples' experiences within and across conditions to
      gain in-depth knowledge of intervention components that influence hypothesized mediators and
      outcomes.
