        -  Compare the efficacy of 2 different doses of ZD 1839, in terms of objective response,
           PSA response, and duration of response, in patients with hormone-refractory
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Compare the tolerability and quantitative toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is an association between any response or stable disease and
           clinical benefit as assessed by changes in quality of life of patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral, low-dose ZD 1839 twice daily on day 1 and once daily on
           days 2-28 during course 1 and then once daily on days 1-28 during subsequent courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral, high-dose ZD 1839 as in arm I. Treatment in both arms
           continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of each course during study, and then at
      4 weeks after study.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      until disease progression. All other patients are followed at 4 weeks only.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients (15-30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
