    
      This is a single institution, single arm, Phase II study examining the clinical efficacy of
      an allogeneic GM-CSF secreting myeloma vaccine in combination with lenalidomide. Fifteen (15)
      patients enrolled in the study must have two disease measurements (including the last one)
      consistent with a near complete remission (M-spike negative with persistence of
      immunofixation) per criteria for response in a 6 month period. Patients will continue on the
      dose of lenalidomide they were on prior to being enrolled but will need to discontinue
      steroids for at least 4 weeks. Patients will receive 4 vaccinations on day 14(+/-3 days) of
      cycles 1, 2, 3 and 6 from enrollment that will include both the myeloma vaccine as well as
      Prevnar.
