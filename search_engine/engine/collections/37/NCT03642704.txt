    
      Objectives Principal objective Assess the operational efficacy of a strategy combining early
      diagnosis and preventive antiretroviral treatment systematically reinforced from the birth*
      among infants at high risk of infection with HIV** .

      * in a maximum of 48 hours after delivery

      **born from HIV infected mothers who received less than 4 weeks of antiretroviral therapy
      prior delivery and / or HIV infection diagnosed at delivery Secondary objectives

        -  Measure the cascade management of HIV infected mothers and HIV infected infants

        -  Measure the tolerance of reinforced preventive antiretroviral treatment

        -  Describe the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV and its risk factors

        -  Describe the clinical and immuno-virologic outcomes in mothers, in HIV infected children
           and in HIV-non-infected children

        -  Evaluate the acceptability of the strategy by mothers and caregivers.

        -  Compare the early diagnosis of HIV infection with Abbott and Biocentric HIV RNA tests

      Methodology Prospective non-comparative study of mother-child pairs whose mother is
      HIV-infected and received less than 4 weeks of antiretroviral therapy before birth or whose
      HIV infection has been diagnosed at birth.

      Estimated enrolment: 300 mother-child pairs

      Eligibility:

      Inclusion criteria:

      Mother-child pairs whose mother is HIV-infected and received less than 4 weeks of
      antiretroviral therapy before delivery or whose HIV infection has been diagnosed at delivery
      Mother who signed the informed consent form to participate in the study.

      non-inclusion criteria: Mother treated with antiretrovirals during the month preceding
      delivery No inclusion for precautionary reason : clinical symptoms suggesting an
      opportunistic infection of the central nervous system.

      No inclusion for monitoring difficulties History or presence of allergy to the study drugs or
      their components Contra-indications to the study drugs Symptoms, physical signs or laboratory
      values suggestive of systemic disorders, (including renal, hepatic, cardiovascular,
      pulmonary, skin, or psychiatric and other conditions, which could interfere with the
      interpretation of the trial results

      Intervention, a combined strategy :

      After positive HIV infection screening from mother in the delivery room and put on
      antiretroviral treatment of mothers with post partum according to national guidelines ,
      newborns benefit :

        -  Early detection of HIV infection at birth

        -  Without awaiting the outcome of early detection result, a preventive reinforced
           antiretroviral treatment (AZT / 3TC / NVP or AZT / 3TC if their mother is infected with
           HIV -2), from birth for 12 weeks.

        -  Regular HIV screening until the end of breastfeeding or later to 18 months.

        -  In case of positive results of an HIV test, an antiretroviral treatment with AZT / 3TC /
           LPV whatever serology HIV 1 or 2.
