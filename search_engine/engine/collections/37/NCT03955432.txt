      high risk for co-morbidities, accidents, injury and SUDEP. This is confounded by the major
      antiepileptic drug burden in this population. Very little, however, is known about the risk
      of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with a lower seizure burden, i.e. patients with infrequent
      focal seizures and/or those without secondarily generalized convulsions. Furthermore, no
      chronic cardiac data is available in patients with epileptic encephalopathies especially
      given the fact that some of these patients are known to carry mutations that increase the
      risk for cardiac arrhythmias.In addition, periods of reduced cerebral blood flow during tachy
      or brady arrhythmias may exacerbate seizure severity and during. Diagnosing and treating
      these arrhythmias may not only prevent adverse cardiac events, but also reduce seizure
      burden. This study primarily aims to compare the frequency of cardiac rhythm abnormalities in
      patients with epilepsy of different severity, assess the long-term cardiac risk and evaluate
      the possible preventive role of anti-arrhythmic agents and/or cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator
      needs.
