      consumed in amounts relevant to usual dietary intakes. Thus, we hypothesize that anthocyanins
      from a single oral dose of cranberry juice will be absorbed quickly and can be measured in
      the circulation and urine within 2-4 h. Further, these anthocyanins will undergo a degree of
      metabolism but will circulate as well as be removed from blood as both parent compounds and
      metabolic products.

      This research proposal is submitted as an independent sub-study of an existing project,
      "Effects of Cranberry Juice on Endothelial Function in Patients with Coronary Artery
      Disease", conducted by Joseph A. Vita, MD at the Boston University School of Medicine and
      sponsored by Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.

      This study includes 15 subjects aged 21-80 y and with demonstrated endothelial dysfunction
      and angiographically proven coronary artery disease who will receive a single dose of 480 mL
      cranberry juice.

      To test the hypotheses of the study to be conducted at HNRCA Tufts, we will utilize blood and
      urine samples that are already collected and stored. We will separate and analyze
      anthocyanins in these samples by HPLC and determine the pharmacokinetics of relevant
      anthocyanins.
