      associated with significant impairments in child neurocognitive, academic, behavioral, and
      physical health functioning. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) children are at increased risk
      for poor sleep. Compared to their higher-SES peers, lower-SES youth tend to obtain less sleep
      overall and experience worse sleep quality. Many children of lower-SES also may live in noisy
      or high-violence neighborhoods and in overcrowded homes that lack a child bed or other
      designated child sleep space. These environmental factors may perpetuate SES-related health
      disparities in child sleep duration, quality, and poor sleep health behaviors (i.e., bedroom
      electronics). Although there is a robust evidence-base for treating childhood sleep problems,
      there is a paucity of sleep intervention research focused on lower-SES children.

      Beds for Kids is a Philadelphia-area program that is part of the larger volunteer
      organization, One House at a Time, that provides lower-SES children with beds, bedding, and a
      sleep education brochure. To qualify for program participation, youth must be: (1) between
      the ages of 2 and 20 years, (2) living without an individual bed (e.g., sleeping on the
      floor, on a sofa, or crowded into one bed with family members), and (3) living in a household
      whose income is at or below 100 percent of the United States poverty threshold. The program
      accepts referrals from area social service agencies in the greater Philadelphia area.
