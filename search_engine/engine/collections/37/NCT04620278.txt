    
      Genetic screening will be performed on DNA (and/or RNA) isolated from collected samples from
      affected individuals by whole exome sequencing or RNA sequencing using in-house pipeline to
      identify candidate sequence variants. These variants will be tested for segregation with the
      phenotype in other relatives (affected/unaffected). Candidate variants will be subjected to
      additional downstream analysis, to be guided by the actual type of gene/variant.
