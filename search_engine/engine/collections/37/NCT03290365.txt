      and control group. One dose of PRP is applied into both groups. One week later, one dose of
      HA is injected in intervention group and one dose of normal saline is injected in control
      group. Outcome measurements included visual analog scale (VAS)、Lequesne's severity
      index、Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)、balance test
      (Biodex) and analysis of synovial fluid at different follow-up frame (1st month, 3rd month,
