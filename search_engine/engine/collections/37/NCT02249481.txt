      femoral nerve block. We currently use a low dose femoral nerve catheter based technique as
      part of our standard treatment strategy for total knee arthroplasty. The use of a catheter
      provides prolonged analgesia compared to a single shot block, and also allows a lower
      concentration of local anaesthetic to be employed, thus potentially reducing the incidence of
      motor blockade. The concentration of local anaesthetic employed in our routine practice
      (0.0625% L- Bupivacaine) is lower than that routinely used in many other centres, and most
      clinical studies have compared higher concentrations of local anaesthetic - this might be
      expected to produce more motor blockade. The concentration we use is higher than the minimum
      effective concentration for a femoral catheter infusion for knee arthroplasty.
