      much research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, the risk of relapse to substance use
      following treatment is high and attention to continuing care is critical. New continuing care
      strategies targeting life-style change and improved coping mechanisms are important in
      facilitating maintenance of abstinence, promoting rehabilitation and functional recovery for
      Veterans with SUDs. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a manualized treatment
      integrating cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention therapy with mindfulness practices, has
      shown promise in continuing care for SUDs. The proposed project will compare MBRP to a
      12-Step Facilitation treatment as a continuing care strategy following primary treatment for
      SUDs. Participants will be randomized to participate in 8-weeks of weekly 90-minute,
      group-based MBRP or 12-Step Facilitation followed by a 10-month follow-up period with regular
      assessments of substance use, mood/anxiety symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes.
      Two VAMC sites (Charleston and Tuscaloosa) with a history of successful collaboration will
      work together to recruit an adequate sample size to address the primary study questions
      within a 4-year period and to ensure generalizability of the results. If this trial
      demonstrates that MBRP promotes sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this
      will provide a valuable treatment to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for Veterans with
      SUDs.
