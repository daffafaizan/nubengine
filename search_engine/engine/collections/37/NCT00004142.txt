      by hepatic arterial chemotherapy with floxuridine and fluorouracil in patients with
      colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo an open laparotomy to identify the target tumor in the liver using
      intraoperative ultrasound followed by radiofrequency tissue ablation over 20 minutes to each
      tumor and placement of hepatic arterial catheter. Within 35 days postoperatively, patients
      receive hepatic arterial chemotherapy consisting of floxuridine on days 1-7 and fluorouracil
      over 1 hour on days 15, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 6 courses. Patients
      are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
