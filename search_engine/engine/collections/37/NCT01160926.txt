      with standard chemoradiotherapy are approximately 50-60%.The pathological complete response
      rates are only 10-20%. Therefore, there is a need for more effective treatment. In this trial
      we will evaluate the combination of chemoradiotherapy with either a VEGFR (vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor) or MEK (MAP Kinase)inhibitor.

      Aims

        1. Define the tolerability, MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and DLT (dose limiting toxicities)
           of chemoradiotherapy in combination with

             -  cediranib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis or

             -  AZD6244, a potent MEK inhibitor that inhibits cell proliferation

        2. Define a dose suitable for phase II evaluation

        3. Test the impact of the combination on soluble and imaging (FLT-PET and DCEMRI/DWI)
           biomarkers to guide their use in phase II testing Summary Patients will receive standard
           chemoradiotherapy plus ascending doses of AZD6244 or cediranib from day -10 (relative to
           start of chemoradiotherapy) to day 35. If feasible, patients' tumours will be resected
           10-12 weeks after treatment. Translational studies on available tissue and blood will be
           performed and DCE-MRI/DWI and FLT-PET will be carried out on 5 patients in the expanded
           cohort for AZD6244 (FLT-PET and DCE-MRI) and 5 patients in the expanded cohort for
           cediranib (DCE-MRI).

      Cohorts Cediranib - 15mg od, 20mg od and 30mg od AZD6244 - 50mg bd and 75mg bd
