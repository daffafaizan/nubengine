      used in short term such as systemic steroids, antibiotics or retinoids due to their
      association to side effects or potentially teratogenetic effects.

      Apremilast, a specific inhibitor for PDE-4, mediates its clinical effect through the
      cAMP-PKA-NFkappaB pathway which results in a decrease of pro-inflammatory and increase of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in several types of leukocytes. The clinical picture changes to a
      decrease of all signs of inflammation.

      Due to the NFkappaB mediated chronical inflammation in the pathogenesis of acne conglobata, a
      treatment with Apremilast seems to be an effective option.

      In this study, treatment with Apremilast (OtezlaÂ®) will be performed in patients with acne
      conglobata to observe its preliminary efficacy and safety in an open label, single-centre
      proof of concept study design.
