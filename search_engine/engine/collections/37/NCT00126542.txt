      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the median
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral
      erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity due to 1 of the study drugs may continue
      treatment with the remaining study drug alone in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
