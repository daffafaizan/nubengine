    
      Adjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months of
      androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. Following docetaxel
      therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed
      to maximum consolidative therapy.

      Radiation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the men will be
      treated with definitive local therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). After definitive
      local therapy, patients will be treated with consolidative stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites (if present).

      Follow up: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 2 years. They will
      be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until 2-years after
      completion of ADT (Androgen deprivation therapy) treatment. Androgen blockade will be the
      same throughout the course of treatment.
