      tested to treat people who have helicobacter pylori infection.

      The study is planned to enroll 425 patients at the beginning and will enroll a maximum of
      approximately 510 patients based on the interim analysis results. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

      Vonoprazan 20 mg

      Esomeprazole 20 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet in combination with bismuth containing
      quadruple therapy (amoxicillin, clarithromycin and bismuth potassium citrate) twice at the
      same time each day throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 10 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 28 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
