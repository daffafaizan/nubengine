      interval (CI) for the ratio of the geometric means (TRS003, China-approved bevacizumab and
      US-licensed AvastinÂ®) for AUC0-inf on PK analysis set. If the 90 percentage CI of the ratio
      of the geometric means for AUC0-inf is within the range of 80-125 percentage, then PK
      similarity will be concluded. Secondary PK parameters such as but not limited to Cmax,
      AUClast will be analyzed using the same statistical approach. A nonparametric approach, for
      example, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, will be taken to evaluate parameters such as t1/2.
      Exploratory analyses may be performed for other PK parameters as deemed appropriate. All
      adverse events (AEs) will be listed and summarized using descriptive methodology. The
      incidence of AEs for each treatment will be presented by severity and association with the
      study drugs. Clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG)
      parameters will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics. The number and
      percentage of participants testing positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) will be
      summarized by treatment and time point.
