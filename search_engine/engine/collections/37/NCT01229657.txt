      supplementary treatment to reducing the tangential tractional forces and inducing hole
      closure in macular hole surgery, and thus the anatomic success rate has increased to over
      90%. However, despite these high rates of surgical success, the reopening of initially closed
      macular holes has also been observed from the first month to several years following surgery.
      Because about 45% to 95% of phakic patients frequently develop a progressive nuclear
      sclerosis cataract after macular hole surgery and require combined or subsequent cataract
      extraction to improve visual acuity, cataract extraction has become a potential factor in
      causing macular hole reopening, although this is still under debate. The purpose of this
      study is to describe the long-term anatomic and visual outcomes in patients who had initial
      anatomic success with macular hole surgery and who had postoperative follow-up of one or more
      years. All patient's charts were reviewed for age, macular hole stage (using the Gass
      classification), macular hole duration, epiretinal membrane of macula presence, ILM peeling,
      preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, rate of macular hole reopening, cataract
      extraction, and length of follow-up after vitrectomy.
