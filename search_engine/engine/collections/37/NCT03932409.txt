      Endometrial cancer is commonly treated with surgery. The patient must have already had
      surgery including hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) prior to being considered eligible for
      this study. The surgery may also include removal of the ovaries, and removal of pelvic and
      para-aortic lymph nodes. Following the surgery, the doctor will identify if the patient has
      factors related to the cancer which places the patient at a greater risk for the cancer
      returning.

      Prior to participating in this study there are exams, tests or procedures to find out if the
      patient can be treated in the study. Most are part of regular cancer care. Tumor tissue will
      need to be collected for study tests to see if the patient is eligible for to take part on
      the study.

      TREATMENT If the patient is eligible, pembrolizumab will be given 7 days before radiation
      therapy. After radiation therapy, three cycles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy will be
      given.

      Study participation will be up to two years.
