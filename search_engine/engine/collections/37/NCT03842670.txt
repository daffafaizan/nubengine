      that improve outcomes over natural recovery (Finney et al., 2013), outcomes are still modest.
      Identifying mechanisms of behavior change (MOBCs) that lead to successful outcomes may be
      critical for efforts to improve existing treatments or to better match patients with
      particular treatments. The goal of the proposed research is to conduct a randomized clinical
      trial to systematically examine pretreatment neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics
      and changes in brain function over time during two empirically supported treatments for AUD.
      One hundred forty treatment-seeking individuals with an AUD will be randomized to receive
      either 8 weeks of Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) or Mindfulness Based Treatment (MBT)
      after receiving 4 weeks of a platform treatment that focuses on enhancing motivation to
      change. Neurocognitive and behavioral characteristics will be measured using neuroimaging,
      comprehensive behavioral assessments, and patient self-reports. To establish the temporal
      relationship between changes in drinking and changes in these MOBCs, patients will be
      assessed at: (a) baseline; (b) four weeks into treatment; (c) immediately post-treatment; and
      (d) 9- and 15-months post-baseline. Self-report measures and behavioral tasks will be
      administered at monthly intervals during treatment; and fMRI will be collected at baseline,
      and at 3, and 9-months post baseline. The primary aim of the study is to examine the effects
      of the treatments on three hypothesized mechanisms: craving/regulation of craving, cognitive
      and behavioral control, and regulation of affect/arousal. The secondary aim will identify
      neurocognitive and behavioral baseline characteristics predictive of reductions in drinking
      over time and differential patterns of response to CBT or MBT.
