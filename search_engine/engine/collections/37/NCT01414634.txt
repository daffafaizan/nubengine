    
      Open-label, single center, phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability
      and preliminary efficacy and in vivo mechanisms of action of a single infusion of autologous
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells chemically coupled with seven myelin peptides (MOG1-20,
      MOG35-55, MBP13-32, MBP83-99, MBP111-129, MBP146-170, and PLP139-154) in Multiple Sclerosis
      patients who were off-treatment for standard therapies. Neurological, magnetic resonance
      imaging, laboratory, and immunological examinations were performed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and in vivo mechanisms of action of this regimen.
