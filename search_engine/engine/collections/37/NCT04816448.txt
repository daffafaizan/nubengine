      when cervicogenic headache becomes severe, in some patients pain may occasionally feel it on
      the other side of the head. Diagnosis of cervicogenic headache depends on the detailed
      patient's history, manual examination and the assessment of nervous system. After the
      diagnostic block test disappearance of headache shows that the source of this pain is
      cervical spine. Cervical flexion rotation test is a very useful diagnostic measure in
      cervical movement restriction and differential diagnosis of cervicogenic headache. Physical
      therapy is considered most effective treatment of cervicogenic headache in which different
      techniques manipulative therapy, mobilization of cervical vertebrae, stretches and
      sub-occipital myofascial release used.

      Objective: To determine the effects of sub-occipital myofascial release in patients with
      cervicogenic headache.

      Methods: This study was randomized control trial and on the basis of inclusion criteria, 22
      patients were included and were randomized through sealed envelope in two groups A and B.
      Group A was given sub-occipital myofascial release along with conventional therapy while
      group B was given cervical mobilization and conventional therapy and both groups were
      assessed by using Neck Disability Index(NDI), Pain Numerical Rating Scale(PNRS) and cervical
      range of motion by goniometer at baseline, Week(1-4) and 8th week( last week) .The data was
      analyzed using SPSS 21.
