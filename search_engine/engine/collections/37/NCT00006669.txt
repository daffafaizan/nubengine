      intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab followed by
      etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (EPOCH). II. Determine
      the toxicity of the regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-10 hours on day 1
      followed by etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 4-7,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 5-30 minutes on day 8 and oral prednisone on days 4-8. Patients also
      receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 9 until blood counts recover.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
