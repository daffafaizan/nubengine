      infertility. MRI is considered as the best imaging technique to detect and to predict the
      extent of the disease. Susceptibility Weighted Imaging is routinely performed to identify
      haemorrhagic lesions in brain MRI protocols and has proven to be a sensitive technique to
      detect blood by-products. A pelvic MRI protocol including SWI will be performed in all women
      addressed for diagnostic assessment or pre-operative work-up of endometriosis.
