      create reproducible flaps in terms of thickness and predictability. The aim of this study was
      to test the hypothesis that OCT-guided 110 Âµm targeted flaps will result in accurate,
      predictable, and precise thickness flaps, with low complication rates when performed and
      compared using both 2D and 3D flap geometry applications. Patient-reported outcomes are
      increasingly incorporated into clinical trials as they provide access to valuable information
      on the physical experience of the patient during and after the treatment. A questionnaire
      will therefore also be introduced in this study to evaluate how well self-reported pain,
      visual experience, and quality of life responses are correlated with flap geometries in both
      groups during the early postoperative period. The study holds direct medical benefit to the
      patient in this that they received an immediate improvement in his/her unaided vision.
      Moreover, the patient's participation contributes to the medical knowledge about the use of
      femtosecond lasers for refractive surgery, in particular in view of the use of intraoperative
      OCT visualization tools. The patients will gain access to the newest technology available for
      refractive surgery namely a low pulse energy high-frequency femtosecond laser.
