      implantable loop recorder (ILR), capable of automatically recording episodes of AF, 3 months
      prior to their ablation procedure. Patients will also be given a standardized diary in which
      they will record all perceived episodes of AF. Patients will have the data from the ILR
      downloaded prior to their ablation to record baseline AF data.

      A blanking period of 3 months will be used to censor early recurrences post-ablation. A
      'successful' AF ablation will be defined as a lack of AF episodes > 2min at least 3 months
      post-ablation. A 'Failure' AF ablation will encompass all patients not meeting the definition
      of 'success'. Redo ablation procedures will be allowed in this protocol for patients who
      continue to have AF recurrences beyond the first three months post-ablation.

      After the patient's ablation procedure, patients will be followed every 3 months for 18
      months. At each follow-up visit data on AF episodes from the ILR and the patient diaries will
      be collected. Patients will be blinded to the data downloaded from the device.

      Further data will be collected as the patient study follow-up period has been extended to
      include a 30-month post-ablation visit with device interrogation as device battery is 36-42
      months.
