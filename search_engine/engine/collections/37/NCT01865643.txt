      the tools used to assist with a difficult tracheal intubation is the GlideScope (GS)
      (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA). The GS is a video laryngoscope that has a 60 degree angle blade
      with a built-in high-resolution camera and a light source assembled beside it. The image is
      transmitted onto a mobile bedside monitor. It has been widely used in medicine for over a
      decade. The GS was designed to provide an improved view of the glottis during difficult
      intubations without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes, as it is able to
      "look around the corner" to facilitate the intubation.

      The standard technique of the GS intubation involves a midline laryngoscopy followed by the
      insertion of a styleted endotracheal tube (ETT) once an adequate view of the vocal cords has
      been achieved. The ETT insertion process requires the operator to look away from the monitor
      during the laryngoscopy while maintaining the blade position in order to insert it into its
      initial position.

      An alternative GS intubation technique has been described for cases in which there is limited
      mouth opening, a big tongue or other anatomical impediments. In these cases the ETT is
      inserted under direct vision as a "fish hook" at the side of the mouth before the GS blade is
      introduced into the oropharynx.

      There are several advantages to this alternative technique. The first advantage is that this
      technique of ETT insertion would minimize the laryngoscopy time as a part of it is performed
      before the blade is introduced and the stimulating effect occurs. This technique thus has the
      potential of reducing the sympathetic response. Minimizing oropharyngo-laryngeal stimulation
      time would theoretically attenuate the hemodynamic response.
