    
      Among people living with HIV (PLWH), tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic
      illness and a leading cause of death, accounting for nearly a quarter of HIV-related deaths
      worldwide. Initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) early during TB treatment significantly
      increases survival, and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend ART initiation
      for all PLWH as soon as possible after TB treatment initiation, regardless of CD4+ count. Yet
      in the African Region, only 42% of TB patients known to be living with HIV were on ART in
      2010, and retention in ART programs has been limited. In Lesotho, only 27% of HIVinfected TB
      patients received ART in 2010. There is an urgent need to identify programmatic interventions
      that increase the proportion of HIV-infected TB patients on ART, shorten the duration between
      TB diagnosis and ART initiation, and improve adherence to medications and retention in care
      amongst HIV-infected TB patients in Lesotho.

      Lesotho, a small, landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa, is among the
      world's poorest nations with one of the world's most severe epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis
      (TB). There is strong evidence that TB patients who are also infected with HIV have better
      survival rates if they begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) soon after starting TB treatment;
      however, there are many patients who do not initiate ART within the recommended timeframe,
      and who do not remain in care.
