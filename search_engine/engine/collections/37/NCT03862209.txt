      significant yet most neglected public health problem: depression affects an estimated 30.3
      million Europeans, and psychotic disorders 5 million Europeans. People with severe and
      enduring mental ill health want the same things out of life as other citizens but are often
      placed in a vulnerable position and are hence afforded less opportunities to attain their
      goals and thus experience a lower quality of life, and have a lower life expectancy compared
      to the general population. For many countries that have undergone mental health services
      reform or have health systems in transition, efforts to make such comprehensive
      community-based mental health services available resulted in short-lived outcomes or are
      still to demonstrate substantial impact. RECOVER-E's aims to ensure well-functioning
      community mental health teams in 5 countries in Europe (Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria,
      Croatia, and Montenegro), which will serve as the central node for coordination and provision
      of care for people with SMI. Our project narrows the implementation gap by going beyond
      infrastructure changes and pursuing the development of human resource capacity and care
      pathways that can be distilled in a comprehensive pathway to scale for regional and national
      decision-makers for uptake after the project's life span. RECOVER-E will: 1) Develop evidence
      based care pathways and treatment protocols for transition to scale for regional and national
      decision makers in 5 implementation sites; 2) Establish a peer to peer capacity building
      partnership in community mental health by linking a European expert panel with key
      stakeholders in 5 implementation sites to co-create community mental health services for
      people with SMI) 3) Evaluate intervention elements that will enhance sustainable adoption and
      implementation of community-based mental health care for people with SMI, by carrying out
      implementation research.
