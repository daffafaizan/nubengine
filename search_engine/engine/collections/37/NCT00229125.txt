    
      In the current protocol we evaluated a newer generation anticonvulsant agent, gabapentin.
      Gabapentin does not significantly interact with alcohol or other medications, has no abuse
      potential, and is excreted by the kidneys and not the liver .

      The primary aim of the present application was to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin in
      comparison to lorazepam (as a benzodiazepine gold standard) for the acute outpatient
      treatment of alcohol withdrawal (AW). In addition, evaluation of the lorazepam "rebound"
      effects observed during the current funding period will be replicated and compared with the
      response to gabapentin. Also, the acoustic startle response was used to evaluate the
      neurobiological effects of the medications on underlying AW-related CNS excitation, both
      during and immediately after AW. In addition, the effect of a history of multiple
      detoxifications on parameters such as withdrawal symptoms, CNS excitability, relapse to
      alcohol use, craving for alcohol, and response to medication treatment was explored.
