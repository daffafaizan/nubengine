      smokers will be recruited in each of the four groups: bupropion SR only, bupropion SR + CM,
      CM + placebo, and placebo only. The cells will be balanced for gender and attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder using permuted block randomization. A counseling intervention was
      added for all groups because it was reasoned that it would be unethical not to provide an
      active treatment to cigarette smoking adolescents. The counseling intervention will consist
      of two quit smoking brochures that provide information on tips to help quit smoking.

      The study will consist of a one-week lead in period followed by a six-week treatment trial.
      For the medication groups, medications will be titrated during the one-week lead-in period.
      The primary outcome measure is urine cotinine and self-report of cigarette use collected
      using the Time-Line Follow-Back at the end of six weeks.
