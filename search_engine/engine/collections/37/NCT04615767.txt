      selected by their age and BMI. The aim is to test the effect of oral daily treatment with 1 g
      D-chiro-inositol for 30 days on some clinical parameters, to see if D-chiro-inositol acts as
      an aromatase inhibitor. Testosterone, estradiol, Testosterone/Estradiol ratio,
      Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, Estrone, glycemia and insulinemia (with calculation of HOMA
      index), follicle-stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone, D-chiro-inositol and Myo-inositol
      serum concentrations have to be determined before and after D-chiro-inositol administration.

      We wish to evaluate if this treatment for one month is able to change the sexual hormone
      levels, increasing androgens and decreasing estrogens. Furthermore, we wish to control the
      safety profile of D-chiro-inositol, a well-known molecule, different from the classic
      aromatase inhibitors. We think that our pilot study can open up new perspectives of research
      and therapeutic applications for this many-sided molecule.
