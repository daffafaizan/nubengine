      stent in patients receiving radiotherapy for tongue cancer. It was found that most of the
      patients tolerated the stent. The mean radiation dose to the hard palate was reduced by 61%
      (absolute percentage) as compared with a control group not using the stent. Based on these
      results, the investigators wish to perform a study on a larger cohort to confirm that the
      intraoral stent will not lead to increased symptoms towards the end of the radiotherapy
      period.
