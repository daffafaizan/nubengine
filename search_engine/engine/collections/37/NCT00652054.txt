      nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, with a response rate of approximately 10%, as well as for
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Even when gemcitabine is combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs or
      biological agents, the overall tumor response rate remains basically unchanged. S-1 is a new
      generation oral fluoropyrimidine that combines Tegafur
      (5-fluoro-1-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione [FT]), an oral prodrug of 5-FU,
      with two modulators, Gimeracil (5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine [CDHP]), which inhibits 5-FU
      degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibition, and Oteracil potassium
      (Oxo), which inhibits 5-FU phosphorylation in the digestive tract. This combination of 3
      compounds is designed to achieve enhanced antitumor activity while decreasing
      gastrointestinal toxicity.
