      oxygenation therapy (HBOT) is a medical procedure in which participants inspire enriched
      oxygen while their bodies are subjected to pressure greater than ambient barometric pressure
      at sea level (i.e., greater than 1 atmosphere absolute, or 760 mmHg). Hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy elevates tissue oxygen levels, thereby increasing the rate of tissue healing, and
      enhancing leukocyte-mediated phagocytosis. It may also elevate growth factors, which promotes
      angiogenesis and healing (Siddiqui, Davidson, & Mustoe, 1997).

      While HBOT is most often used in wound healing and serious infections, it has been utilized
      in treating various disorders, most notably in cerebral palsy (Liptak, 2005; Marois &
      Vanasse, 2003) and other conditions, including fetal alcohol syndrome (Stoller, 2005), brain
      injury (Rockswold, 1993), and stroke (Helms, 2005) (see Joiner, 2002 for a review). The
      rationale for using HBOT in participants with neurological and developmental disorders is to
      relieve hypoxia, which often accompany these conditions. This leads to improvements in
      microcirculation and relief of cerebral edema by vasoconstriction, therefore leading to
      decreases in the symptom characteristics.

      HBOT is implemented in various dose pressures (ATA) by practitioners for the treatment of
      symptoms of autism, averaging around 1.3-1.5 atmospheres for one hour sessions, for a minimum
      of 40 sessions. The results of HBOT are presumed to be long-term, but systematic examination
      of both short-term and long-term effects is currently warranted.
