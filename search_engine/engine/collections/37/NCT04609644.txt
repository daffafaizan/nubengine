    
      The Asthma Digital Study is a virtual, two-arm, randomized, controlled trial that will
      investigate the impact of digital tools on asthma symptom control, exacerbation frequency,
      healthcare utilization, and medical expenditures. Adults with asthma will be randomized to
      the passive or active arm in a 1:1 ratio.

      All participants will be sent two devices, at no cost-an Apple Watch and a Beddit Sleep
      Monitor. These are publicly available, commercial devices that have not been modified for
      this study.

      The study will be administered largely through a customized version of CareEvolution's
      MyDataHelps app (the "Study App"). Access to the Study App will be provided to all
      participants. It will be used to administer informed consent and electronic patient reported
      outcome (ePRO) measures, and for other study purposes. Only active arm participants will have
      access to Study App features designed to support asthma self-management. These features
      include "smart nudges" based on device data, symptom and trigger tracking, evidence-based
      education, summaries of health metrics gathered from the Apple Watch and Beddit Sleep
      Monitor, in-app medication refill resources, as well as other resources.

      The study duration is 2 years. Participants can keep using the Study App and devices after
      Year 1, though this is not required. Primary analyses will utilize Year 1 data only. During
      Year 2, data collection will continue where available, though fewer data will be collected
      because use of digital tools is not required during Year 2, and health coverage changes may
      cause loss of access to claims data.
