      magnesium levels) will be evaluated (1 and 3 months of treatment) and that status will define
      the exposure criterion. Included patients will be followed for 1 year during which
      cardiometabolic markers will be measured.

      Patients will be recruited during consultations and stays in care units of Adult Psychiatry
      Unit of Montpellier University Hospital.
