    
      The study consists in two parts. The first study part (Part I) is a single dose, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-way, 5-period crossover design, in healthy subjects.

      The second study part (Part II) is a repeated dose, open label treatment in healthy subjects.

      The PK of CHF 6532 and CHF 6532 acyl glucuronide metabolite (CHF 6532-AG), the cardiac safety
      will be assessed after single or repeated administration of CHF 6532 tablet formulations in
      healthy subjects under fed conditions.

      A total of 30 healthy male and female are planned to be included where they will participate
      the 2 study parts.

      Standard safety assessments will be conducted during the Study, including safety blood and
      urine laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs and observations of any
      adverse events. Blood and urines samples will be also collected for PK analysis. Holter
      recordings will be performed to build a prospective concentration-response model of QTc for
      CHF 6532 in Part I and for cardiac safety purpose at steady state in Part II.
