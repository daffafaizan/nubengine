      temporal lobe and hopefully improve verbal memory functions. A total of 30 patients with
      Alzheimer disease will receive tDCS treatment for 30 minutes, six times. Half of the patients
      will undergo sham stimulation. These six stimulations will be executed during 10 days.
      Patients will be tested with neuropsychological tests before the first stimulation and after
      the last stimulation to assess the effect of the treatment. Patients will be retested six
      months later in order to investigate long-term effects ot the stimulation. The main
      hypothesis in the present study is that tDCS stimulation will lead to significant
      improvements in verbal memory functions.
