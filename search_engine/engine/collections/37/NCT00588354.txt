    
      Patients with approximately 3 months of low back pain and leg pain due to intervertebral disc
      herniation were randomized to transforaminal epidural injections of 2% lidocaine and either
      clonidine (200 or 400 micrograms) or triamcinolone (40 mg) (corticosteroid). Patients
      received one to three injections administered at about 2 weeks apart. Patients,
      investigators, and study coordinators were blinded to the treatment. The primary outcome was
      an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale at 1 month. The hypothesis was that
      clonidine will be as effective as steroid for this condition.
