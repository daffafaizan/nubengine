      of the esophagus or gastric cardia. II. Evaluate the toxicities of this drug in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive irinotecan intravenous (IV) over 90
      minutes once a week for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period. Treatment continues in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
