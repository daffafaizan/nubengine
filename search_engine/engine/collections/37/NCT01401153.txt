      nutrient supply. Therefore, an optimised composition of meals at nutritionally favourable
      mealtime should be considered for optimal cognitive performance. The increasing
      implementation of all-day schools in Germany requires the children's catering at school.
      However, also the number of 'meal skippers' is increasing among children. Thus, the effect of
      skipping of the midday meal at school on cognitive functioning is examined in this
      experimental cross-over trial.

      As prior intake of food can have an influence on the physiological effect of test meal, the
      children's dietary intake in the morning is standardized. The intervention is integrated in
      the usual everyday school life:

      9.15 a.m. standardized snack within the frame of the regular break, 9.45 a.m. to 12.25 p.m.
      everyday school life, 12.25 p.m. either lunch (control) or only a non-caloric beverage
      (intervention of 'skipping meal'), 12.45 p.m. to 1.15 p.m. regular lunch break, 1.15 p.m.
      computerized tests of cognitive functioning, 2 p.m. lunch for the 'skipping meal'-group.

      Parameters of cognition with relevance to everyday school life are measured by a computerized
      test battery of the 'Wiener Testsystem'. Usual eating behaviour, sleep behaviour, physical
      activity, parental education and migration background are determined as control variables by
      questionnaires for children, parents and teachers. Beside the Body Mass Index, the individual
      IQ is measured by a paper-pencil-test.
