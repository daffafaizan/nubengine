      recording products given to women during pregnancy in Haute-Garonne (data from Primary Health
      Insurance Fund), fate of these pregnancies and the state health of newborns (Mother and child
      protection data, prenatal Diagnostic Centre and Medicalisation Program of Information Systems
      data).

      Women included in this database (> 90 000 to date) has allowed us to study the risks of
      taking certain medications still not assessed in pregnant women (for example phloroglucinol,
      the H1N1 flu vaccine , oseltamivir ...). Each year about 10 000 pregnant women join the
      cohort. The collection and management of data concerning require careful organization and
      mobilize multiple stakeholders.

      The pursuit of these inclusions is needed to study medication less often prescribed but raise
      questions. For example, if the investigators consider that the relative risk of cardiac
      abnormalities following in utero exposure to paroxetine is multiplied by 1.5, it will take
      1,000 women exposed to paroxetine for 5 additional cases observed. In December 2013, 0.3% of
      women EFEMERIS were exposed to paroxetine in the first quarter (274 women).

      The objective of this project is to continue the EFEMERIS project (funded for 10 years public
      tenders until December 2015) by continuing to include pregnant women (about 10 000 per year)
      in order to explore the potential effects of exposure to different drugs on the newborn
      (prematurity, birth defects, neonatal diseases).

      The processing of data will EFEMERIS to detect drugs at risk to the fetus and provide a
      warning role in terms of malformation effects, to monitor over time prescribing practices,
      participate in pharmacoepidemiology international multicenter studies including similar
      databases in general population.
