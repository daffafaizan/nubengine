      associated barriers to healing. Analytical methods used to examine the blood or debridement
      can investigate morphological, molecular, immunological, cellular, viral, biochemical,
      chemical, genetic, and/or transcriptional components of the samples. It is the goal of this
      study to determine if these tests may be able to provide important insights into the keys of
      wound healing, wound persistence, or wound deterioration.
