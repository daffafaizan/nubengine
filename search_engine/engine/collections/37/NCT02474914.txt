    
      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial for perioperative use of
      octreotide in patients after PD for pancreatic and periampullary tumours from May 2014 to
      April 2017 in Gastroenterology surgical center, Mansoura University, Egypt.

      The primary outcome of the study is the effect of perioperative use of octreotide on the rate
      of development of postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients after PD for pancreatic and
      periampullary tumours. The secondary outcome is postoperative overall complications,
      mortality, duration of the hospital length of stay and cost-benefit relationship of
      perioperative use of octreotide.

      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either the octreotide or the placebo group. The
      randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and will be withdrawn by a
      nurse after pancreaticoduodenectomy . Patients in the octreotide group will receive
      sandostatin 100ug SC every 8 hours daily staring from the day of operation to the
      postoperative day 7. Patients in the placebo group will receive saline administered in a
      similar manner.
