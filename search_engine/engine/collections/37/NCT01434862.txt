      closed-loop insulin therapy is more efficacious in controlling glycemia than either of the
      individual therapies. The control algorithm is in effect an insulin dose calculator for
      mimicry of basal insulin secretion by estimating requirements for basal rates of insulin pump
      infusion based on current and past glucose levels estimated from the Continuous Glucose
      Monitor (CGM) device and prior insulin infusions. The closed-loop system-recommended insulin
      will replace (in a clinical setting) the basal rate insulin that the patient would normally
      use. The patients' meal insulin needs will be estimated using an insulin-to-carbohydrate
      ratio as per standard clinical practice and will be optimized prior to admission to the
      Clinical Research Unit.

      The primary goal of this feasibility study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of
      a closed loop system (Open-Loop Informed with a Model Predicted Control (MPC) algorithm plus
      a safety system module (SSM)) with pramlintide (a synthetic analog of the hormone amylin
      which in health is released by the β-cells along with insulin) treatment will improve glucose
      control versus each of the individual therapies. Because pramlintide reduces hyperglycemia
      extremes generated at meals and closed loop control markedly reduces the risk of
      hypoglycemia, thus representing potentially important complementary actions to reduced
      variability - the investigators expect to find decreased hyperglycemia while simultaneously
      decreasing hypoglycemia risks.

      Secondary goals are to explore factors associated with achieving safer and/or more effective
      closed loop control. For example, based upon our work in animal models, one secondary goal is
      to explore whether moderate inhibition of α-cell glucagon, known to occur with pramlintide
      administration in the early postprandial period, has the potential to repair inadequate
      glucagon counterregulation.
