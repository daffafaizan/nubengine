      evidence has accumulated demonstrating the efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor agents in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
      various retinal vascular diseases.

      Although IVT injections are generally safe, infectious endophthalmitis is a rare but
      devastating complication, and the risk of morbidity and vision loss from endophthalmitis is
      high. The objective is to examine the change in antibiotic resistance of ocular surface flora
      with repeated prophylactic use of antibiotics after IVT injection for AMD.
