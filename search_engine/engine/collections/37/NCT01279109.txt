      future generations by applying information emerging from social network studies to the
      development of new population-based behavioral interventions. There are a number of critical
      periods during fetal development that appear to influence the later development of obesity.
      Interventions that prevent insult to these critical windows from occurring could improve
      children's life course trajectories. This project sets the groundwork for examining whether
      social networks could explicitly be utilized to support women in gaining weight during
      pregnancy within their clinically recommended weight gain target.
