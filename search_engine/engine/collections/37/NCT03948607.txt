    
      The main goal is to assess with EEG the timing of the attentional demobilization that
      precedes a sustained attention lapse in patients with ADHD.

      The secondary objectives are: 1 / To analyze impaired cognitive control mechanisms during
      lapses in patients with ADHD; 2 / Study the relationships between the deficits identified
      through EEG recording, clinical evaluations, and the subjective perception of daily
      difficulties; 3 / To measure the impact of the subjective attention state on the neuronal
      precursors of the attentional lapses; 4 / Evaluate the relation between propensity to
      wandering mind and attentional lapses.
