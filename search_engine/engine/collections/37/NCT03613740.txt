    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial will be conducted in 28
      patients with MS according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, men and
      women, ages 30 to 60. Participants will be assigned randomly into two groups of 14
      individuals each. Patients will receive a capsule with Fucoxanthin 12 mg or homologated
      placebo once a day during 90 days.

      Waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, serum triglycerides, serum HDL cholesterol and
      blood pressure will be evaluated before and after intervention in both groups. First phase of
      insulin secretion (Stumvoll index), total insulin secretion (Insulinogenic index) and Insulin
      sensitivity (Matsuda index) will be calculated from the concentration of glucose and insulin
      obtained from an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.

      Data from statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and
      dispersion( mean and standard deviation) for quantitative variables and frequencies and
      percentages for qualitative variables. The qualitative variables will be analyzed through the
      X2 or Fisher's exact test. The intra-group analysis of the quantitative variables will be
      carried out by means of the Wilcoxon rank test, while the inter-group analysis with the U
      test of Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis. Statistical significance will be considered with a
      p<0.05.

      This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent will be
      obtained from all volunteers
