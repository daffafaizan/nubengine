      ratio), controlled with general measures (supporting motivational videos, fitness videos),
      participant and investigator unblinded, evaluator by phone will be blinded, single-site
      superiority trial of oral CBD 300 mg daily for 28 days to prevent burnout and distress in
      health care workers dealing with SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At 28 days, there is an open-label
      extension wherein all participants are offered a 28 days course of CBD 300mg daily. The
      objective of this work is to monitor the level of stress and overload of a group of
      front-line health workers (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) who will participate in
      the care of patients with COVID-19 at Hospital das Clínicas in Ribeirão Preto and its
      Emergency Unit (HCRP), for four weeks, and evaluate the CBD's effectiveness in reducing
      stress for those who wish to use it.

        1. Assess the level of stress and emotional overload of front-line health workers
           (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) during their performance in the pandemic
           caused by COVID-19.

        2. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, reduces the level of stress,
           during the period of performance of professionals in the care of patients with COVID-19.

        3. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, will modify inflammatory
           parameters, such as cytokines, measured from the serum of professionals in the care of
           patients with COVID-19.

        4. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, prevents depression, burnout
           and Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD.
