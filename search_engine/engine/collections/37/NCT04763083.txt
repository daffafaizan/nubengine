      high levels on many types of haematological cancers but is absent or expressed at low levels
      in normal adult organs. NVG-111 is a bispecific antibody T cell engager, comprising tandem
      single chain variable fragments (scFv), one arm binding to ROR1 on cancer cells, the other to
      cell surface CD3 on lymphocytes. Dual binding of NVG-111 causes MHC-independent immunological
      synapse formation, releasing perforins, granzyme B and cytokines, resulting in targeted
      killing of the cancer cells.

      This is a Phase 1/2 first in human study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy
      of NVG-111 in patients with debulked, relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and MCL on at least 2nd
      line therapy. NVG-111 will be added on to existent therapy which will continue through the
      study.

      In Phase 1, a range of doses will be studied in sequential cohorts to understand safety,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug and establish the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). At each dose level, patients will receive 3 cycles of NVG-111 by continuous
      intravenous infusion, each cycle consists of 21 days treatment followed by 7 days break. An
      additional 3 cycles may be given depending on the response seen.

      In Phase 2, efficacy and safety of NVG-111 at the RP2D will be studied in separate cohorts of
      CLL/SLL and MCL patients.

      All patients will have a safety follow up visit 4 weeks after completion of treatment with
      NVG-111, and will then enter long term follow up for up to two years to evaluate the duration
      of efficacy.
