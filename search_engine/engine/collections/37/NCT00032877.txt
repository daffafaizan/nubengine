      syndromes, Fraser syndrome (OMIM 219000) and Fryns syndrome (OMIM 229850). To date, we are
      unaware of molecular genetic studies that have been performed in either syndrome.

      We are planning to perform molecular genetic studies on DNA specimens from affected
      individuals ascertained outside NIH by other clinicians and/or reported in the medical
      literature. Should these studies prove fruitful, we would plan to expand this work to a
      combined clinical and molecular study to fully delineate the phenotypes associated with these
      disorders.

      We plan to collect DNA specimens from affected patients and from unaffected siblings and
      parents and to evaluate the specimens in the laboratory by linkage analysis, physical
      mapping, candidate gene characterization and mutation screening. If the causative genes(s)
      for either syndrome are identified, then mouse models of the diseases may be developed and
      cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins may be undertaken.

      The cloning of these genes would enable better characterization of human developmental
      processes and improve patient counseling for individuals and families affected by these
      diseases.
