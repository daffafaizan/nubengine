      overall survival of EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab/Nimotuzumab) in combination with a
      chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR-amplication advanced
      gastric cancer. Cetuximab will be administered as intravenous infusion of 500 mg/m2 (BSA)
      every 3 weeks, while nimotuzumab will be administered as intravenous infusion of 400mg every
      week. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 12 cycles of mFOLFOX-6, 6-8 cycles of
      SOX, 6-8 cycles of CapOX. Treatment with cetuximab/nimotuzumab will continue until disease
      progression. The target sample size is 50-100 patients.
