      population are participants diagnosed with possible or probable parkinsonian variant of
      Multiple System Atrophy who are on stable doses of levodopa.

      Trial participation will be up to a maximum duration of 14 weeks and will comprise a
      screening period (up to 2 weeks), a 2-week run in period during which subjects will receive 1
      tablet (either 100 mg safinamide or matching placebo), followed by a 10-week period, during
      which study participants will take 2 tablets of study medication (200 mg safinamide or
      placebo) once daily, taken in the morning in addition to their morning levodopa dose. A
      telephone follow-up call will be performed 2 weeks after the end of treatment.
