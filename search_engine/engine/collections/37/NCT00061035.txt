      lymphocyte immunization (TLI). In this process patient's lymphocytes are rendered transgenic
      for a gene coding for selected portion of telomerase an enzyme expressed in the vast majority
      of cancer cells. Transgenic cells are then returned to the patient to produce an immune
      response targeted at cancer cells expressing telomerase. The Phase 1 trial will evaluate TLI
      in patients with advanced, androgen-independent prostate cancer with metastases confined to
      lymph nodes or bones.
