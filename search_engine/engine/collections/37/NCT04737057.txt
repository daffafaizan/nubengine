      is formed through interaction between acid-producing bacteria and carbohydrate. The caries
      develops in both the crowns and roots of teeth. Progress of caries depended on the lifestyle
      of the child (as high numbers of cariogenic bacteria, inadequate salivary flow, insufficient
      fluoride exposure and poor oral hygiene). To avoid this disease should follow the proper oral
      hygiene and improve lifestyle . A lot of methods found to treatment the decayed tooth - like;
      Hall technique and Silver diamine fluoride The first report on the Hall Technique published
      in 2007 by a general dental practitioner from Aberdeen/Scotland, Dr. Norna Hall. Dr. Hall
      used PMCs to restore carious primary molars rather than using the standard technique, placed
      them using a simplified method2

      Previous studies have recommended that Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution would exert a
      preventive result in managing early childhood caries ECC. However, no well-designed clinical
      trials have yet been performed to study the effect of SDF on caries prevention. the objective
      is useful in arresting early childhood caries (ECC)
