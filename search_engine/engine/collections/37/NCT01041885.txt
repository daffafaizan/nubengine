      and efficacy of the INSTRUCT therapy in the treatment of knee cartilage defects.

      All patients who meet eligibility criteria and who consent to participate will undergo the
      implantation of a biodegradable scaffold seeded with autologous primary chondrocytes and bone
      marrow cells via arthrotomy.

      Patients will be followed-up for 2 years at regular intervals. Evaluations will include
      adverse events collection, patient reported outcomes (mostly pain and function), arthroscopic
      and histologic evaluations and MRIs (including dGEMRIC).
