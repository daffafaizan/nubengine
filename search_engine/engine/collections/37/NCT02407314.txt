    
      Prospective, randomized study, comparing ticagrelor + aspirin vs. aspirin monotherapy
      following the 4-week post-procedural combination of Ticagrelor or Plavix with low dose
      aspirin. The investigators will enroll a minimum of 40 patients. Patients will be enrolled if
      they have either claudication and/or critical limb ischemia, and angiographically identified
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease requiring intervention, with either total occlusion
      or a significant SFA stenosis with the presence of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) defined
      clot following stent placement.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 4 months, 6 and 7 months following SFA
      intervention. At baseline demographic data will be collected, and anthropomorphic and
      physiological variables (body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure). Baseline and
      6-month ankle brachial index (ABI) will be performed. A 6-min walk test will be performed at
      baseline and 6-month follow-up. At 6 month time point patients in both treatment groups will
      return for a peripheral angiogram and repeat OCT imaging of the SFA segments of interest.
      Subject will have a final follow up clinic visit at 7 months.
