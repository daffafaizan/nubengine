      Chinese healthy adults, adolescents and infants. The subjects were divided into 5 groups. Two
      dose and three dose levels will be evaluated. Adult (aged 18-49 years), adolescents (aged
      6-17 years), infant subjects (aged 7-71 months) and infant subjects (aged 2-6 months) will
      receive intramuscular (IM) injection on Days 0 and 28. Infant subjects (aged 2-6 months)
      subjects will receive intramuscular (IM) injection on Days 0 , 28 and 56. Three dose
      subgroups (low dose, medium dose and high dose were included in each age group. To maintain
      blindness in the trial, subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive different dosages
      of the vaccine group or placebo group. In the analysis, the placebo subjects of the same age
      group were combined to ensure that the analysis ratio of the experimental vaccine group to
      the placebo group is 1:1. Therefore, 24 subjects in the experimental vaccine group and 8
      subjects in the placebo group were chose in each dose group. Subjects were randomized to
      receive different dosages of the vaccine or placebo. Vaccination was performed in the adult
      group first, then on the adolescents, and on the infants last. Within each age group,
      dose-escalation with the principle from low to high dosage.
