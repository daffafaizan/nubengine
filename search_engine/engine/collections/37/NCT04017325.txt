    
      This is an open observational extended follow-up study of patients originally randomized into
      TOOKAD速 Soluble VTP therapy or active surveillance (control group). No intervention or
      further intervention with TOOKAD速 Soluble is mandated in this additional 60-month follow-up
      study where patients in the original TOOKAD速 Soluble group and active surveillance (control)
      group are both managed by their physician as appropriate to their condition using any
      treatment available following a 'local standard of care' principle from the end of the trial
      (M24) up to the end of follow-up (M84). Management decisions are entirely left to clinicians
      and their patients in this pragmatic extension of the trial (no criteria imposed) where
      standard of care that reflects clinical practice within each centre is applied.

      All patients originally randomised in study CLIN1001 PCM301, whether allocated to the TOOKAD速
      Soluble VTP arm (n=206) or Active surveillance arm (n=207 and who did not withdraw their
      consent will be included in this extension study.

      This extension study consists of 2 different follow-up:

        -  a follow-up of patients via investigators

        -  and a follow-up via interviews directly with patients
