      shown better compliance of LARC patients, and may be more effective in reducing the incidence
      of local recurrence and distant metastasis. This study used the anti-angiogenesis drugs
      beacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with LARC for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and
      investigated the short-term efficacy to provide objective basis for the selection of
      neoadjuvant therapy.

      Methods: 70 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma clinical staging in Stage II or Stage III
      were included for neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME, of which 35 underwent neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy, and other 35 underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy+beacizumab.
