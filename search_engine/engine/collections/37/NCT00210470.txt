      seen in the cancer tumor micro-environment, restores immune function and activates a
      coordinated immune response against the tumor. IRX-2 is a complex proprietary therapeutic
      containing numerous active cytokine components, which restores and activates multiple immune
      cell types including T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to recognize and
      destroy tumors.

      The present study administered the IRX-2 Regimen to 27 patients as a neoadjuvant (before
      surgery) therapy, and the main objective of the study was to determine the safety and
      tolerability of the IRX-2 regimen.
