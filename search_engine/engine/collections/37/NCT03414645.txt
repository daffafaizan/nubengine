      been used as an alternative therapy since the mid-1980s. Limitations such as the need for
      periodic blood draws, the lack of standardization in the preparation of AST and
      platelet-enriched plasma tears, the unknown shelf life of AST preparations, the use of
      non-preserved multi-dose packaging and the practical difficulties patients face in storing
      these products frozen or refrigerated have hindered their widespread use for treating GvHD
      and other forms of severe tear deficiency.

      To address these shortcomings, Cambium Medical Technologies, LLC has developed a proprietary
      method of standardizing and manufacturing a fibrinogen-depleted standardized platelet lysate
      using pooled human platelet lysates (phPL) collected from qualified healthy donors (CAM-101).
      Because Cambium's proprietary manufacturing process depletes pooled human platelet lysates of
      fibrinogen (the key clotting protein in platelets), the remaining product contains enriched
      levels of several key nutritive and regenerative components than are normally found in
      non-standardized AST as well as healthy tear film.

      Given the multi-factorial nature of DED, the enriched levels of numerous key nutritive
      components in CAM-101 may well prove to be superior to artificial tears and certain single
      active ingredient products which treat only one cause or contributor of dry eye (e.g.,
      inflammation) and other forms of tear deficiency.
