      strength. Therefore, the investigators conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to investigate the effects of Ishige Okamurae extracts on muscle strength, muscle mass,
      and muscle function in adults with relative sarcopenia; the safety of the compound are also
      evaluated. The Investigators examine the peak torque/body weight at 60Â°/s knee extension,
      handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass, physical performance, and metabolic parameters at
      baseline, as well as after 6 and 12 weeks of intervention. Eighty adults were administered
      either 300 mg of Ishige Okamurae extracts or a placebo each day for 12 weeks.
