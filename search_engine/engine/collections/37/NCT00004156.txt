      MUC-1(106) or MUC-1(33) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate plus immunological adjuvant
      QS21 induces an antibody, helper T cell and/or cytotoxic T cell response against MUC-1 in
      patients with high risk breast cancer expressing MUC-1.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1(106) or MUC-1(33) with
      keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ
      on weeks 1-3, 7, and 19 for a total of 5 vaccinations. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
