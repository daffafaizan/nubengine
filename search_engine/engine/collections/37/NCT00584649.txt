      rate is intermittently (or persistently) higher than expected for the physiological
      circumstances, with ECG appearance indistinguishable from normal sinus rhythm, after the
      exclusion of medical conditions causing sinus tachycardia.

      Hypothesis- Radiofrequency ablation, targeting the sympathetic input of the sinus node
      identified by 20Hz stimulation at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right
      atrium, will effectively reduce sinus rate acutely and will reduce palpitations due to
      inappropriate sinus tachycardia without the need for pacemaker implantation due to sinus node
      dysfunction post ablation.
