    
      A randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to examine the post-prandial glycaemic
      response to peas in soup will be conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute in
      Winnipeg, Manitoba. Eligible participants who have provided consent will be asked to attend 3
      clinic visits in a fasted state. Participants will be given soup containing peas at 2 visits
      and soup without peas at 1 visit. At each visit participants will provide 7 capillary blood
      samples via finger poke, 5 questionnaires about their appetite and a questionnaire about the
      acceptability of the products. Each visit will last approximately 2.5h and be separated by
      3-14 days.
