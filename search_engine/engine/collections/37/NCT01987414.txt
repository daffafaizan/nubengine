      their affected limb effectively and efficiently into functional tasks due to muscle weakness
      and/or spasticity. This may further interfere with their performance of everyday activities
      and restrict life roles. Traditional rehabilitation interventions emphasize spasticity
      reduction. However, active movement and muscle strength of forearm supination are found
      strongly related to motor function, rather than spasticity. In contrast, task-oriented
      movement training trials have demonstrated promising evidence that persons with CNS
      dysfunction benefit from the training in improvement of motor function and increase
      functional use of the affected limb.

      Orthotic intervention is one therapeutic option for this population. Most orthotic designs
      for this population are static, developed for sympton reduction or deformity prevention, and
      aimed at the wrist and hand. However, its effects on spasticity reduction remain
      controversial. Given that static orthotics may interfere with functional performance and
      further develop the learned nonuse of the affected limb, a dynamic or mobilization orthosis
      would be appropriate for enhancing functional performance. Moreover, an orthosis that assists
      forearm rotation is speculated to enhance functional performance. This study will examine the
      efficacy of a forearm rotation orthosis combined with the occupational therapy task-oriented
      approach on functional performance for persons with a hemiparetic arm.
