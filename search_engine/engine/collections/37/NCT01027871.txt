      sulfonylurea. Prestudy therapy also includes once daily insulin glargine or neutral protamine
      Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. The 12-week active treatment phase will be followed by a 4-week
      follow-up period, during which patients will return to the basal insulin recommended by the
      investigator.
