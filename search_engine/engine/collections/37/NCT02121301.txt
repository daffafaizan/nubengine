    
      Single-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study comprising 4 visits over
      the course of approximately 5 weeks. The study included a 1-week placebo (SkQ1 vehicle)
      run-in period between Visit 1 and Visit 2, and approximately 28 days of twice daily (BID)
      dosing (Visit 2 - Visit 4). Qualified subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 1.55
      µg/mL SkQ1 ophthalmic solution, 0.155 µg/mL SkQ1 ophthalmic solution, or placebo (vehicle of
      SkQ1 ophthalmic solution).

      The following primary endpoints were tested:

        -  Corneal Fluorescein staining in the inferior region Pre-CAE at Visit 4 (Day 29), as
           measured by the Ora Calibra Scale in the worst eye at baseline;

        -  Worst dry eye symptom (ocular discomfort, dryness, or grittiness - as determined from
           subject diary data recorded during the 1-week run-in period between Visit 1 and Visit 2)
           evaluated over the seven days preceding Visit 4 (not including day of visit) during the
           treatment period.
