      studies using transgenic mouse models of familial ALS have shown markedly slowed disease
      progression, improved functional capacity, and extension of survival in animals undergoing
      aerobic exercise training. In humans, only one non-randomized study has shown that
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training was of little beneficial effect in a small group
      of patients with Kennedy disease, a rare X-linked progressive neuromuscular disease involving
      lower motorneurons, presenting a pathophysiological picture quite different from that of ALS.
      To the best of our knowledge, the safety and the effects of aerobic exercise training on
      functional capacity and quality of life of patients with ALS have not been systematically
      evaluated as yet in a randomized, controlled trial with an adequate sample size.
