      (fistulotomy) or delayed (seton) transsection of the sphincter muscle possibly resulting in
      fecal incontinence, take a long time to heal, and/or are associated with significant failure
      rates (ex. fibrin glue).

      Newer treatment concepts such as the collagen plug do not physically interrupt the sphincter
      muscle, avoid and minimize the risk of fecal incontinence, and decrease the time to fistula
      healing. Exciting initial reports have confirmed the collagen plug's utility in treating
      perirectal fistulae, but a systematic scientific comparison is needed to validate the new,
      less invasive plug method.

      The primary goal of this study is to show that the collagen plug heals transsphincteric
      perirectal fistulae as well as the conventional seton method.
