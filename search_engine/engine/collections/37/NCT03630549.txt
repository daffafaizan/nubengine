      resource-limited setting. The trial is linked to a another trial, the HOSENG (HOme-based
      SElf-testiNG) trial, that is described elsewhere (NCT03598686). Together, they consitute the
      GET ON (GETing tOwards Ninety) research project. The HOSENG study, with its home-based HIV
      testing campaign, provides the recruitment platform for the VIBRA study. The reasons for this
      interlinked design are: a) potential study participants for VIBRA trial (HIV-positive
      individuals not on ART) are to be recruited during a home-based HIV testing campaign and
      hence, it allows us to assess the entire HIV care cascade in one larger project, and b) both
      trials rely on interventions involving VHWs, who need to be randomized and specifically
      trained. Therefore, it is efficient and feasible to run both trials parallel and randomize at
      one time point only. The rational for a cluster randomized design is the reliance of the
      trial on the VHWs and, thus, the high risk of cross-contamination between the study arms if
      randomization would be done at individual level.
