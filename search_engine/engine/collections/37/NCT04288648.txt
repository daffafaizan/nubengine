      in different positions among women suffering from SUI to healthy women. Secondary objectives:
      is to compare subjective reports of the difficulty to contract the pelvic floor muscles
      between the two groups, and to examine the connection between the severity of urinary leakage
      and the ability to contract pelvic floor muscles.

      The study will include 50 female participants in the ages of 18-45. Research group will
      include 25 participants suffering from SUI in accordance with the International Consultation
      on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and 25 healthy participants (grade 0 on
      the ICIQ-SF questionnaire).

      The examination will be performed with an abdominal ultrasound device in supine, sitting,
      standing and squatting. The Height of the bladder base will be measured during rest period
      and maximal contraction. The extent and direction of bladder base movement would indicate the
      quality of pelvic floor performance. Next, the length of contraction time will be measured.
      The participant would hold the maximal contraction as long as possible in order to examine
      muscular endurance. Rest will be given between tests. After finishing the tests in all four
      postures, the participants will be questioned about the degree of difficulty contracting the
      pelvic floor.

      Significance of the study: The importance of the research is about granting the clinicians
      and researchers additional tools in order to help establishing a protocol for pelvic floor
      muscle activity examination and treatment.
