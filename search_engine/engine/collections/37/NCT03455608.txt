      severity of dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients; however, best practice is not
      established. This multi-site, international randomized clinical trial (RCT) will compare the
      effectiveness of PRO-ACTIVE (high and low intensity) versus RE-ACTIVE swallowing
      interventions in 952 HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). The 3 study arms represent
      alternate timing and intensity of swallowing therapy delivered by a speech language
      pathologist: 1) RE-ACTIVE, 2) PRO-ACTIVE EAT, and 3) PRO-ACTIVE EAT + EXERCISE.

      The primary aim of the PRO-ACTIVE trial is to compare the effectiveness of PRO-ACTIVE versus
      RE-ACTIVE swallowing interventions among patients with HNC planned to undergo RT. We
      hypothesize that the combined PRO-ACTIVE therapies are more effective than RE-ACTIVE therapy;
      and, if so, that more intensive PRO-ACTIVE (EAT + EXERCISE) is superior to less intensive
      PRO-ACTIVE (EAT). Effectiveness will be measured based on reduced duration of feeding tube
      dependency as the primary endpoint, an outcome valued equally by patients, caregivers and
      clinicians.

      The secondary aim of the PRO-ACTIVE trial is to compare the relative benefit or harm of
      swallowing therapy arms on secondary outcomes including videofluoroscopic swallowing
      evaluations, functional status measures, health status measures, and patient-reported
      outcomes.
