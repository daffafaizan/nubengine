      extraction of mandibular teeth. Buccal infiltration technique alone is considered to be
      ineffective in treating mandibular teeth due to the thickness of buccal cortical plate.
      However, buccal infiltration, if provided with an agent with higher penetration capability,
      may be used instead of Inferior alveolar nerve block. Articaine, due to its thiophene ring,
      has higher liposolubility and bony diffusion than any other agent.

      This study compares the effectiveness of inferior alveolar nerve block and buccal
      infiltration using 4% Articaine in the extraction of mandibular teeth
