      activity (LDA) or clinical remission as measured by the CDAI score. Once LDA or clinical
      remission has been achieved, the structural benefit in reducing erosions, synovitis and bone
      edema as measured by low field MRI will be determined at the same time period by the use of
      the OMERACT/RAMRIS scoring system and correlated to the clinical findings. The target for
      each patient will be determined at the time of study entry depending on the degree of disease
      activity of the individual patient. This is based on the understanding that LDA is an
      acceptable goal in certain patients with long standing disease or high disease activity. If
      the patient reaches LDA while taking tofacitinib at a 5 mg b.i.d. dose, the patient will be
      given the opportunity to have the dose increased to 10 mg b.i.d. in the hopes of reaching
      clinical remission.

      There are two treat to target goals: Clinical Remission as defined by a CDAI score of <2.8
      for those patients who entered the study with a CDAI score of <22 and Low Disease Activity
      (LDA) as defined by a CDAI score of <10 for those who entered the study with a CDAI score of
      > 22.
