      modifying the previous treatment to a 6 unit program that could be delivered online.
      Sixty-one participants completed the study, being randomly assigned to an online ABBT plus
      treatment-as-usual (online ABBT + TAU) group or a treatment-as-usual alone (TAU) group. All
      participants completed a series of self-report measures at baseline, at post-treatment, and
      at a 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed modelling supported significant differences between the
      groups in favour of the ABBT + TAU treatment group on the primary outcome measure
      (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R); F (2, 52.82) = 20.10, p < .0001)
      following treatment. The online ABBT + TAU group also had significantly greater improvements
      in depression, pain, acceptance, perceived helplessness, and kinesiophobia. Increased
      acceptance mediated the effects of treatment on improvements in FMS quality of life and FMS
      impact, while reduced helplessness mediated the effects of treatment on improvements in level
      of reported pain. Comments and subjective ratings of improvement were consistent with the
      quantitative results. Participants rated mindfulness (contact with present moment experience)
      as the most useful treatment unit.
