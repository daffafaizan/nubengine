      significantly increasing the activity of mitochondrial ATP complex enzyme and mitochondrial
      respiratory chain complex enzyme IV, improving the fluidity of mitochondrial membrane and
      maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. Butylphthalide can reconstruct microcirculation
      and protect mitochondria, which can protect neurovascular units in an all-round way. Findings
      from previous studies have shown that butylphthalide can improve the ability of daily living
      of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and can enhance cognitive function of
      patients diagnosed as subcortical vascular cognitive impairment no dementia.
