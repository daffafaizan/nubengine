      whether commonly used anesthetics (volatile versus intravenous) have an effect on the changes
      or occurrence of CTC in patients suffering from primary pancreatic cancer undergoing curative
      surgery. The specific research question is if there are changes of the CTC count in the
      postoperative phase in the desflurane group (intervention) compared to the propofol one
      (control). A secondary question is if these changes can be correlated to tumor outcome.
