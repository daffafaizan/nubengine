      prior to exposure. The venous blood will be used to obtain PMNs for apoptosis assays, and
      serum for CFH and sCD163 levels. Additionally, this will be used to measure cytokines and
      growth factors. At each visit, if the subject is female, there will be a urine pregnancy test
      performed. Following this initial assessment, subjects will be challenged with FA or O3 and
      then spirometry will be performed, and venous blood will be obtained immediately following
      the exposure (V2). The subjects will then return 20 hours Â±4h later for follow up studies
      (V3). There will be spirometry, a venous blood draw and urine pregnancy testing (if female)
      followed by bronchoscopy. At bronchoscopy, vital signs will be determined, including O2 sat.
      Patient then undergo an 18-20 day washout period before they are brought back in for V4 for
      the alternate challenge. This will follow the same protocol as outline above in the initial
      exposure and use the same series of analysis as the first set of visits. Therefore, we will
      fully characterize the biological response to ozone and filtered air in these same subjects.
