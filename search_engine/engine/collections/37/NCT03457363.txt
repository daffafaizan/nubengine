      Enrolled participants had hypoxia being treated at Intensive Care Unit associated with a
      hospital in Hornu (Epicura).

      The study consisted of two intervention periods separated by a washout period of 30 minutes.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether adjunctive mask of our design (Double
      Trunk Mask - DTM) has an effect on increasing arterial pressure in Oxygen (PaO2) diagnosed
      with hypoxia.

      The protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by a recognized ethics
      review board at the study facility. The study was performed in accordance with the
