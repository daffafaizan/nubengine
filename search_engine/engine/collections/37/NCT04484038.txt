      daily fractions of 2.5 Gy / day, which was chosen to provide a biological equivalent dose
      (BED) of 166.67 Gy, comparable to the 163 Gy administered with a scheme Normally divided up
      to 70 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy / day Version 2.0, March 27, 2019

      (assuming an α / β ratio of 1.5 Gy for prostate cancer). The BED in risk organs (mainly
      rectum and bladder) will be governed by the ratio used and will differ depending on whether
      acute or late toxicity is calculated. If selected an acute α / β of 10 Gy and a conservative
      α / β for late toxicity of 3 Gy, the standard fractionation will result in an acute BED of 84
      Gy versus 78 Gy in the hypofractionation scheme and a BED of 116.67 vs. 114.5 Gy for late
      toxicity.

      Therefore, what the investigators expect is a toxicity profile that is at least similar, if
      not slightly better, compared to the norm-fractionated scheme of 70 Gy in 35 fractions and
      similar rates of biochemical control and survival.

      To all this is added the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy and image-guided
      radiotherapy techniques (IGRT) that will allow the investigators to significantly reduce the
      dose administered to risk organs.
