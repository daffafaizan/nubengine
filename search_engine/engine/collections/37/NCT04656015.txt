      or are prevented by treating the bowel inflammation, whereas others require specific
      treatment because they are independent of the underlying bowel inflammation .

      Cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. They may
      arise for various reasons such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, genetic, environmental, dietary,
      and lifestyle factors. Besides all these, there is much evidence suggesting that inflammation
      is an important player in the pathogenesis of heart disease, as well as atherogenesis and
      atherosclerosis . A most common systemic inflammatory disease is inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), which is a collection of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a chronic intestinal
      disease that may arise due to different factors, and is precipitated by environmental and
      genetic susceptibility Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is a useful echocardiographic technique
      to evaluate global and regional myocardial systolic as well as diastolic function. It can
      also be used to quantify right ventricular and left atrial function.

      To date, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is mostly used to detect significantly
      decreased EFs and abnormalities in wall motion. Contrast enhancement (CE) CMR is a more
      sensitive technique of cMRI and can detect areas of myocardial damage in patients with acute
      myocarditis .
