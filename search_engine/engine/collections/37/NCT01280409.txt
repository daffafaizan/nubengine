      and consented to the study. Maternal weight will be measured and 20ml of maternal blood will
      be obtained to assess glucose control and lipid profile. Women will be counseled regarding
      diet, exercise and glucose control. Data including maternal demographics, clinical
      characteristics and neonatal outcomes will be collected. At 3 weeks postpartum, a research
      nurse will contact the subject via telephone call to inquire about adverse or side effects,
      ability to take the prescribed medication (metformin or placebo), and to answer questions
      about the study. At 6 weeks postpartum, maternal weight will be measured , blood will be
      obtained and side effects will be evaluated again. Finally, a satisfaction survey will be
      completed.
