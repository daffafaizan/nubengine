      benzodiazepines plus opioids in ERCP procedures. Propofol is a potent hypnotic drug with a
      short duration of action and consequently a more rapid recovery time for the patients
      compared with the available Benzodiazepines. Several prospective studies have shown that
      balanced propofol sedation (BPS) can be used safely and effectively for diagnostic endoscopy
      under the direction of a gastroenterologist. BPS which was originally described by Cohen et
      al, combines small incremental doses of propofol with single induction doses of
      benzodiazepines and opioids under the direction of a physician that is not an
      anesthesiologist. Because BPS usually targets moderate sedation, adequate amnesia and
      analgesia can be achieved with concomitant administration of benzodiazepines and opioids. It
      may cause synergism between propofol and midazolam and reduce dose of propofol. However,
      there was no proven benefit between propofol alone titrated to moderate level of sedation and
      BPS; propofol titration combination with benzodiazepines and fentanyl.
