      haemodynamics, introducing the concept of intracranial baroreflex We have to i) confirm the
      presence of this intracranial baroreflex, ii) analyze the changes in autonomic function
      during moderate rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) in human, and iii) correlate the changes
      in cerebral and systemic haemodynamics with autonomic function.
