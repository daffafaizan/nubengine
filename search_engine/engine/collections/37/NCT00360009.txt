      (GPi) has been shown to relieve the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as
      tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, there is increasing evidence that DBS may be
      associated with a significant number of mood and cognitive changes.

      The aims of this study are to characterize and compare the mood and cognitive effects
      associated with DBS of the STN and GPi, to delineate regions within or around the STN and GPi
      that are associated with specific mood and cognitive changes when DBS is applied to these
      areas, and to assess the relative effectiveness of right versus left STN or GPi stimulation
      on mood and cognition.

      In the study, researchers will compare motor, mood, and cognitive function in people with PD
      who have had DBS treatment with control subjects (or individuals with PD who have not had
      DBS). The scientists will characterize the types and incidence of mood and cognitive changes
      that occur during DBS in each target (STN and GPi), compare the targets, and examine the role
      of lead location.

      The study will enroll 62 participants-10 control subjects (individuals with PD who have not
      had DBS), and 52 individuals with PD who are scheduled for DBS; the site of the implant (STN
      or GPi) will be randomly assigned. Participants will perform motor, mood, and cognitive tests
      (following 6 months of stimulation) over a 2-day period. Duration of the trial for
      participants is 6 months and includes a 2-night hospital stay.

      Findings from this study may help researchers better understand how DBS affects non-motor
      circuitry.
