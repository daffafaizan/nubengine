      them to three different clopidogrel loading dose regimens at first medical contact: no
      pre-treatment, 600 mg or 900 mg. Platelet activity after administration of clopidogrel will
      be evaluated by VerifyNowâ„¢ P2Y12 point-of-care system.

      The study is powered to demonstrate significant differences in the primary end point (the
      rate of TIMI Myocardial Perfusion Grade=3).
