    
      This is a randomized, attention control clinical trial to compare MBSR to support and
      education on biobehavioral outcomes in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors
      with clinically-significant CRF. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods to
      evaluate the following:

      Primary Aim 1: Determine effect size estimates of MBSR compared to attention control in
      reducing fatigue interference and the severity of several cancer-related symptoms immediately
      post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.

      Exploratory Aim 1: To identify potential moderators of intervention effects in breast cancer
      survivors (BCS) and colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS), such as demographic, clinical/disease
      characteristics, personality traits, and baseline mindfulness level.

      Exploratory Aim 2: To compare levels of a number of anti- and pro-inflammatory proteins
      present in blood and urine between MBSR and attention control groups immediately
      post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, and between fatigued and non-fatigued breast cancer
      survivors at baseline.
