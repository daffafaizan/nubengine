      a worrying public health problem. The evidence shows that healthy eating and regular physical
      exercise, monitored by different means (internet, face to face, exercise diaries), play an
      important prevention role to maintain health while ageing. In this way, Information and
      Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been demonstrated as a useful tool to promote health,
      working on barriers at the same time, such as low motivation and difficulties to maintain
      regular exercise or healthy eating habits. ICTs also allows to reach a wider audience at a
      lower cost, due to their good cost-benefit relationship and the possibility of increasing the
      efficiency of interventions. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months
      duration self-applied online program, composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy
      lifestyle habits (healthy eating and increased physical activity), on obese or overweight
      adults with hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public
      hospital. These patients will be randomized allocated into two interventional groups:
      experimental group will receive audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist
      doctor, and the control group from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include:
      body composition (BMI), blood pressure, levels of physical activity, functional capacity,
      fall risk, and quality of life.
