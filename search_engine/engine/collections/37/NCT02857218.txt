      I. To determine feasibility of administering ferumoxytol and obtaining ferumoxytol enhanced
      magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer
      before starting neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and again before esophagectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect detailed information about the location of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron
      oxide (USPIO)-MRI detected lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and again
      prior to esophagectomy.

      II. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol enhanced MR imaging in the
      assessment of pathologic lymph node involvement based on pathological findings at the time of
      esophagectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and then undergo
      ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI after 24-36 hours and before surgery at week 12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.
