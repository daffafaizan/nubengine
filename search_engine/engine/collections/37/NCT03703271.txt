      placental trophoblastic cells, most of which are secondary to hydatidiform mole, and 95% of
      GTN patients present low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia(LR-GTN).In the 1960s and
      1970s, with the in-depth study of the disease, it was found that the malignant tumor was
      highly sensitive to chemotherapy and had ideal tumor marker HCG to guide the treatment and
      follow-up. Therefore, GTN was the best malignant tumor with the overall cure rate of LR-GTN
      nearly 100%.MTX single-drug multi-course chemotherapy is the classic treatment of LR-GTN
      recommended by FIGO, but most patients can develop gastrointestinal, blood and liver toxicity
      during chemotherapy. In addition, the longer treatment cycle also brings a lot of discomfort
      to patients.

      In recent years, some scholars proposed that the selection of treatment regimen of LR-GTN
      secondary to hydatidiform pregnancy should consider the toxic and side effects of
      chemotherapy, the maintenance of patients' physiological functions and quality of
      life.Retrospective studies abroad have shown that LR-GTN delayed chemotherapy for
      hydatidiform mole pregnancy only started chemotherapy for LR-GTN at a certain stage of
      progression, and the results did not change the prognosis of LR-GTN but reduced the rate of
      chemotherapy.In addition, for some patients with ultra-low risk of LR-GTN in hydatidiform
      pregnancy undergoing hysteroscopic repeat curettage , the rate of chemotherapy can be
      reduced, the related costs can be reduced and the quality of life of patients can be
      improved.

      In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study, with the routine use
      of a gleam of MTX single drug treatment scheme for comparison, comparing uterine cavity again
      emptying delay chemotherapy guided by parallel hysteroscopy surgery clinical curative effect
      and adverse reaction, which discuss after hydatidiform mole ultra-low dangerous GTN patients
      with uterine cavity emptying again guided by hysteroscopy surgery as a line of ultra low
      dangerous GTN patients after hydatidiform mole security and feasibility of the treatmen
