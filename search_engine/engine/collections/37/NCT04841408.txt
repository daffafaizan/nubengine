      responsible for sexually transmitted infection . M. genitalium can cause cervicitis and more
      rarely high genital infections.

      In the vast majority of cases, presence of M. genitalium is not accompanied by any symptoms
      and women do not develop disease. Natural history of M. genitalium infection is not well
      documented. Some studies have shown a natural clearance of infection in women. The published
      work mainly concerns patients at very high risk of sexually transmitted disease, but we do
      not have French data.

      We propose to study the natural clearance of M. genitalium infection in patients consulting
      at the Orthogeny Centre of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. Results of this work will
      allow us to have a better knowledge of the natural history of M. genitalium infection.
