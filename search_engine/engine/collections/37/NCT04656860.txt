      forgetfulness have the potential to delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
      However, few studies have examined the feasibility of Encapsulated Fruit and Vegetable Juice
      Concentrates in robust clinical trials; this limitation prevents investigators from
      determining the real value of these supplements. Therefore, we propose to enroll 150 adults
      aged 55 and older to a 24-month randomized placebo-controlled trial. Participants enrolled in
      the experimental condition will be encouraged to consume 6 Encapsulated Fruit and Vegetable
      Juice Concentrates capsules per day and 33 grams of a soy-based beverage power per day, which
      included 5 grams of fiber. Participants enrolled in the controlled condition will receive six
      placebo capsules and encouraged to maintain an adequate diet. Primary outcomes will include
      objective measures of cognition, and a panel of inflammatory markers, peptides, enzymes, and
      other biological markers known to be associated with cognitive decline.
