    
      In this pilot we propose to recruit 88 older (65 - 79 yrs) men (n=48) and women (n=40) at
      risk for disability and with indications for weight loss according to NIH guidelines. All
      will be enrolled in a dietary intervention designed to generate a caloric deficit of 500
      kcal/day for a 4 month period. All will receive supplemental vitamin D and calcium. These
      participants will be randomized into one of 4 groups:

      Group 1 - Hypocaloric diet (and placebo) Group 2 - Hypocaloric diet and resistance training
      designed to maximize muscular power (and placebo) Group 3 - Hypocaloric diet and a PPAR- γ
      agonist (pioglitazone/Actos™) Group 4 - Hypocaloric diet and resistance training and
      pioglitazone/Actos™

      The specific aims of the pilot are:

        1. In both men and women, to determine whether randomization to resistance exercise is
           associated with an increased retention of appendicular non-bone lean mass compared to
           those not undergoing power training.

        2. In both men and women, to determine whether randomization to the pioglitazone group is
           associated with an increased loss of visceral adiposity relative to randomization to the
           non-pioglitazone group.

        3. Assess the feasibility of the recruitment, assessment and intervention strategies

        4. To estimate adherence to the weight loss, exercise training, and drug interventions;

        5. In this population, to determine measurement characteristics of the functional outcomes
           that will be considered as primary end-points of the larger study.

        6. To obtain pilot data on a subset of participants to determine the feasibility,
           acceptability and measurement characteristics of muscle samples (biopsies) to quantify
           intramyocellular lipid in this study population.
