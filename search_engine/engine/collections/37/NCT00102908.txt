      population. HIV-associated bone loss may be a result of antiretroviral treatment (ART), but
      can also be caused by the infection itself. To date, treatment for this bone loss has not
      been established. Before prescribing drugs to treat bone loss, physicians must take into
      account patients' already demanding ART schedules and potential nonadherence. This study will
      evaluate the efficacy of a single IV dose of zoledronate, an investigational bisphosphonate,
      in treating HIV-associated bone loss.

      This study will last 1 year. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive zoledronate or
      placebo at study entry; their assigned intervention will be given in a 20- to 30-minute
      infusion on an outpatient basis. There will be 7 study visits: at screening, study entry,
      Week 2, and Months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Blood collection will occur at all visits. Medical
      history, a physical exam, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure bone
      density, and a nutrition evaluation will occur at selected visits.
