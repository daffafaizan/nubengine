    
      Aim 1: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding handwashing in OCD and control
      populations

      Hypothesis 1: Control participants will spend less time washing their hands, will wash them
      less frequently, and will be less preoccupied with the sink when doing other activities.

      Aim 2: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding organizing a cluttered area.

      Hypothesis 2: OCD participants will be more disturbed by the presence of clutter and more
      compelled to organize the items than control participants

      Aim 3: To observe and compare childhood behaviors regarding turning on/off light switches

      Hypothesis 3: OCD children will be more likely to exhibit compulsive repetitive behaviors
      regarding the light switch than control participants
