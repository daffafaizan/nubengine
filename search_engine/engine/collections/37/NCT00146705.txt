      infection and effective in about one third of patients. Recently, in the HBV 99-01 study,
      pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PEG-IFN) has been shown to be effective in HBeAg-positive
      patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this study, 266 patients were randomized to receive
      PEG-IFN in combination with either lamivudine or placebo for 52 weeks.

      Thirty-six percent of patients receiving monotherapy and thirty-five percent receiving
      combination therapy had lost serum HBeAg at the end of the 26 week post-treatment follow-up
      period and there was no difference between treatment groups (P = 0.91). More patients on
      combination therapy initially seroconverted (44% of patients, compared with 29% on
      monotherapy; P = 0.01) at the end of treatment but relapsed during follow-up. Similar
      response patterns were seen when response was assessed by DNA suppression and change in ALT
      levels.

      In contrast to nucleoside analogues, such as lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil, the
      virological and biochemical response to standard alpha-interferon has been shown to be
      durable after treatment discontinuation.In addition, standard alpha-interferon leads to
      improved survival and reduction of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B
      patients.Pegylated interferons have shown to be effective in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis
      B patients, but the durability of the response and long-term outcome of treatment have yet to
      be established.
