      be included in the study. The open wedge HTO will be performed in the well known biplanar
      technique and the TomoFix plate will be used as fixation plate. To analyze the peak pressure
      and if the patients are able to reassemble the partial weight bearing/ the full weight
      bearing the OpenGo Sensor Insole (Moticon) will be used during the first 12 weeks after
      surgery. In addition, x-rays will be analyze for the alignment and angles and clinical scores
      will be gathered to investigate patient reported outcomes.
