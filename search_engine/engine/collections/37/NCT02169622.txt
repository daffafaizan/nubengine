      incidence of AF in our post-CABG patients. The Reveal XT has been shown to be superior in
      comparison to the more commonly used sporadic ECGs.6 Unfortunately, the occurrences of
      arrhythmias tend to be "unpredictable" and often paroxysmal. Observers are unlikely to have
      the opportunity to record ECGs at the time of event until it is too late. The ability of the
      Reveal XT to continuously record ECGs over long periods of time has made it a superior and
      powerful diagnostic tool in patients with arrhythmias and arrhythmia related complications.

      This was evident in the large multicenter PICTURE study whereby a large number of diagnostic
      tests were undertaken in patients with unexplained syncope without providing conclusive data,
      but in the same study with the Reveal ILR, the mechanism of syncope in the vast majority of
      these patients were established often at first onset of an arrhythmia.7

      "The equivalent efficacy", if not superiority, of Reveal ILRs above conventional ECGs and
      Holter-monitors in detecting AF was established in the "XPECT" trial.8 Its sensitivity in
      detecting events not seen with ECGs and Holter monitoring post COX MAZE procedure (surgical
      procedure for AF) and post ablations for paroxysmal AF and persistent AF is well established.
