      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The primary outcome is the fraction of
      patients who maintain any form of anti-retroviral therapy, including enfuvirtide monotherapy,
      through day 60 post-transplant. If patients are unable to take oral anti-retroviral
      medications, but are able to tolerate subcutaneous enfuvirtide monotherapy this will be
      considered maintenance of ART. Failure to maintain ART will be defined as â‰¥ 24 hours without
      any anti-retroviral therapy.
