      this study is to assess the impact of preoperative inspiratory muscle training on
      postoperative overall morbidity. The question is, whether inspiratory muscle training prior
      to elective abdominal surgery reduces the number of post-operative complications and their
      severity grade.

      Furthermore, the impact of preoperative inspiratory muscle training on postoperative
      physiotherapeutic performance as surrogate of convalescence is assessed, too.

      Patients will be instructed by physiotherapists to perform inspiratory muscle training
      containing of 30 breaths twice a day for 14-18 days before surgery using PowerÂ®Breathe KHP2.

      Primary outcome is Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) at 90 days after surgery. The CCI
      expresses morbidity on a con-tinuous numeric scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death) by
      weighing all postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification for
      their respective severity.
