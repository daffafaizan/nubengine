      expression of real growth restriction (small for gestation age/SGA, 9.9%) than the
      application of the percentile curve for typical children (SGA, 24.1%). These differences were
      also noted in the evaluation of other anthropometric measures. Cephalization index (CI)
      proved to be the only predictor from the considered auxological parameters and indexes with
      minimal predictive value in the prediction of heart defects type ASD II and VSD.

      The presence of comorbid disorders in newborns with DS did not have a significant predictive
      role on growth indicators and nutritive status of the newborn, but we noted a strong
      association between preterm births and white matter injury (WMI).
