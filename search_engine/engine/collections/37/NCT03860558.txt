      of obesity and diabetes. Obesity risk can be transmitted across generations, from parents or
      grandparents to children. Genomic variation explains only a portion of this risk. Epigenetic
      modulation through DNA methylation, histone modification, or by noncoding RNAs, provide
      mechanisms to regulate gene activity independent of DNA sequence by determining which genes
      are turned on or off in response to environment or disease. Epigenetic changes can be stable
      over the lifespan providing a mechanism through which environmental exposures may impart
      long-term effects on gene expression and phenotypic outcome.

      The maternal intrauterine environment is now well recognized to modify obesity and T2D
      disease risk of offspring. Fetuses carried by women who are obese, diabetic or suffer from
      suboptimal nutrition are at increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, T2D, and
      cardiovascular disease risk as adults. Studies in rodents also show that the health,
      metabolism, and prior environmental exposures of the male can also influence health of his
      offspring. Existing data provide powerful support for the hypothesis that current metabolic
      health of males can alter epigenetic marks in sperm and suggest a novel modifiable mechanism
      of transmission. However, much less is known about how human sperm epigenetic patterns change
      with nutritional and metabolic health, and whether these may ultimately impart differences in
      health of future generations.
