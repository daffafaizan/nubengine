      particularly among disadvantaged populations. Despite the presence of therapies proven in
      NEI, randomized controlled trials that can be delivered by more than 18,000 ophthalmologists
      and 34,000 optometrists, almost nothing is known about the content and quality of glaucoma
      care delivered by non-MD providers such as optometrists. With the numbers of people with
      glaucoma expected to more than double in the next twenty years in the face of no more than a
      15% increase in the supply of eye care providers, methods to better support appropriate and
      high-quality care for chronic eye diseases such as glaucoma delivered by optometrists will
      become as critical, if not more so, as techniques to enhance quality care among
      ophthalmologists.

      Our study is a community-based, randomized, controlled trial that evaluates the suitability
      and effectiveness of a technology-based (tablet computer) intervention within the context of
      a novel partnership between optometrists and patients with glaucoma to improve the process
      quality of care and ultimately outcomes of care. By using successfully implemented technology
      in novel applications,and by building on the success of ongoing community-based quality
      improvement projects in our region, the study provides a means for rapid translation into
      community care if the intervention is successful.
