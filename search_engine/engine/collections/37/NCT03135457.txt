      will be allocated to either infusion of 300mL saline with a subsequent autologous RBC (cell
      saver) transfusion of 300 mL at a rate of 10mL/min, or the same in the reversed order. Prior
      to start of the intervention, 15 minutes following start of infusion and a the end of
      infusion, the investigators will measure right-ventricular pressure and wedge pressure
      (PCWP), as well as extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and CO estimation through PICCO®
      and Pulmonary Artery Catheter. The investigators will identify fluid responsiveness by
      performing a passive leg raise test (PLR). The investigators aim to measure total vessel
      density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV),
      microvascular flow index (MFI), and blood vessel diameters (Øbv) from the oral
      microcirculation by CytoCam microscope system. The investigators will estimate the effective
      circulating blood and plasma volume through dilutional infusion of indocyanine green prior to
      initial infusion, between and at the end of subsequent infusion.
