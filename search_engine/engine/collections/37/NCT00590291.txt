      or Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM). Many human diseases are inherited or passed from parent
      to child in families. These diseases occur because of damage to a gene(s), the genetic
      material that is also called DNA. Scientists can now use modern molecular techniques to
      locate and to find certain genes within the DNA (genetic material) of a person, and to follow
      their inheritance in a family. To find these disease-causing genes requires studies of many
      affected with the disease and their family members. The purpose of this study is to locate
      and to find the genes for coronary artery disease (CAD) which occurs when one or more of the
      arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to the rest of your body develop
      blockages; or, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) which causes abnormal vascular connections
      between arteries and veins, particularly near the heart. Findings of the genes causing CAD
      and AVM will have far-reaching effect on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of coronary
      artery disease and arteriovenous malformation. These studies will lead to possible genetic
      diagnosis, early detection of persons at risk for developing CAD or AVM (even in the absence
      of symptoms), development of effective drugs, more rational and specific therapeutic
      interventions, treatments and ultimately, prevention of coronary heart disease. Approximately
      3-5 years are required to find one human disease gene.
