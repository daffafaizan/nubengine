    
      This protocol describes a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of switching from fixed dose ABC/3TC to fixed dose FTC/TDF in
      virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected subjects maintained on a PI/r-containing ARV
      regimen.

      Subjects were stratified based on the PI/r (ie, lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r] versus other
      boosted PIs) in their regimen, and the presence versus absence of comorbidities at screening
      (diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, coronary artery disease,
      hyperlipidemia, history of myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease,
      congenital heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or arrhythmias). Subjects were
      randomized 1:1 to switch to FTC/TDF+PI/r or to continue on their existing regimen.

      Subjects received study treatment for 48 weeks.
