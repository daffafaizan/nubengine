    
      Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is an uncommon, disabling form of cranial dystonia, involving
      involuntary movements of the lower facial, masticatory, and lingual muscles. This can cause
      jaw movements including opening, closure, protrusion, retraction, or deviation. Common
      additional facial movements involve grimacing or lip pursing. When there is tongue
      involvement, it usually presents as tongue protrusion or curling. Such patients are impaired
      in relation to eating, speaking and swallowing

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low dose of Dysport® deemed
      tolerable during phase 1 in subjects with oromandibular dystonia (OMD).

      Participants will be injected with Dysport® only, with an unblinded open-label disclosure.
      The safety and efficacy pf receiving Dysport® will be recorded for all subjects that undergo
      injection. All subjects will be examined and videotaped at the injection visit, then at 6 and
      12 weeks after injection with a standardized protocol. The primary outcome will be blinded
      examination scores of the videos performed after the study is complete.The evaluators will be
      three different movement disorders experts, not otherwise involved in the study, who will
      review the videotaped examinations, presented in a random order, using the Global Dystonia
      Rating scale (GDS). Evaluators will rate the dystonia at baseline (injection visit) and 6
      weeks after injection.
