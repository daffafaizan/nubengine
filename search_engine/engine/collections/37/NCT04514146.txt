      whole-plant-food diet free of added salt, oil, and sugar on body composition with a
      particular focus on visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The study will also extend a previous
      study assessing the effects of fasting and refeeding on Homeostatic Model Assessment of
      Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values and markers of cardiovascular health and inflammation by
      following participants for an additional 6 weeks.
