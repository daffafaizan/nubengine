      patients with type 2 diabetes with suboptimal glycemic control despite metformin and a
      second-line glucose lowering agent. The basis of this recommendation is due to the side
      effect profiles of these two medications (i.e. reduced risk of hypoglycemia, some weight loss
      with GLP-1RA), convenience (once weekly injection) and the fact that the price of insulin has
      skyrocketed in recent years. Prior head-to-head randomized trials (EAGLE, LEAD 5) comparing
      select GLP-1RA and basal insulin have found mixed results. In EAGLE, adding either insulin
      glargine or liraglutide to patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes found no
      differences in the primary outcome (percentage of people reaching HbA1c < 7%). In LEAD 5,
      liraglutide was associated with a slightly greater HbA1c reduction than glargine, however the
      dose of insulin was approximately 50% less than the dose used in EAGLE. The objective of this
      observational study is to describe the comparative effectiveness and safety of newly
      initiating a GLP1RA versus basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes using metformin and
      another oral glucose lowering medicine.
