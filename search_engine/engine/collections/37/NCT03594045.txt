      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved apixaban as a treatment
      option for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      HIT and HITT are common and severe complications of heparin therapy. Once patients are
      diagnosed with either one of these, they are typically switched to a non-heparin
      anticoagulant (a type of drug that thins your blood). As of now the only drug that is FDA
      approved for HIT or HITT is argatroban, which is administered continuously through an IV over
      multiple days and is extremely costly.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching the activity and tolerability of
      apixaban in participants with HIT or HITT. The investigators believe that apixaban will work
      just as well as argatroban and will be more convenient for this population. The oral route of
      apixaban allows for the potential outpatient treatment of HIT or HITT which is both
      convenient and less expensive than treatment with argatroban.
