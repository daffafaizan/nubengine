      prevention of neurocognitive diseases, cancer and cardiovascular disease. The proportion of
      dietary folate that is absorbed and becomes available for metabolic processes in the body has
      been estimated between 30 and 98%, but an accurate figure is lacking. Since subjects
      generally differ a lot in their folate or homocysteine response upon a change in dietary
      folate intake, the between-person variability in these responses is high. Therefore,
      bioavailability estimates derived from these responses have large confidence intervals. With
      this trial the researchers want to determine folate bioavailability with a higher precision
      than previous trials. A good estimate of folate bioavailability from the general diet is
      necessary to construct reliable dietary reference intakes for folate.
