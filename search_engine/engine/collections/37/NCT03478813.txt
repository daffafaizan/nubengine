      examination and guidance. If the child have daytime incontinence or enuresis during the
      yearly visit at the age of 5 or 6, he or she is eligible for participating the study aiming
      to implement and evaluate the Voiding school intervention.

      In the Voiding school the children are educated in groups of 4-6 children with child-oriented
      methods highlighting learning by doing in order to achieve better bladder control. Usual care
      includes individual advice concerning voiding habits and general life-style advice.
