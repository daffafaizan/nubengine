      shown reduction of plaque for patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).
      However, there is no accepted noninvasive method to determine if treatment for
      atherosclerosis results in reduction of coronary artery plaque.

      Coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA) is noninvasive and can accurately determine the degree
      of coronary artery stenosis. In addition, the extent of calcified and noncalcified plaque may
      be directly measured using this technology at low radiation dose using state-of-the-art CT
      scanners. Several retrospective studies have previously suggested that CCTA may be able to
      show plaque regression in the coronary arteries due to statin therapy.

      The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the change in coronary artery plaque volume
      in individuals treated with high intensity statin therapy as defined by 2013 ACC/AHA
      Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk
      in Adults.

      Men and women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo CCTA examination for
      the presence or absence of coronary artery plaque. Individuals with evidence of noncalcified
      coronary plaque by CCTA and who meet criteria for HMG-CoA reductase (statin) therapy will be
      evaluated for a total of 36 months. The change of coronary artery plaque (progression or no
      change, or regression) in individuals with noncalcified plaque at baseline will be measured
      by CCTA at yearly intervals.
