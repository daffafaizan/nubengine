    
      Phase one : A double blind randomized placebo controlled trial of rosiglitazone

        -  64 pts with biopsy proven NASH will be randomized to receive either rosiglitazone 8
           mg/day or placebo for one year.

        -  after one year of treatment patients will undergo a liver biopsy then a 4 month follow
           off treatment

      Primary endpoint: improvement of at least 30% of the histological score of steatosis
      Secondary endpoints: improvement in ALT values, in necrosis and inflammation and fibrosis

      Phase II extension open label trial

      All participants to the phase one regardless of the drug received in the first year will be
      treated with rosiglitazone for 2 additional years. A liver biopsy will be performed at the
      end of these two additional years in order to find out whether prolonged rosiglitazone
      therapy further results in improvement of liver injury in NASH patients.
