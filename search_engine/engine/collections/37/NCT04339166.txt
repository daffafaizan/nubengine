      implantation failure and pregnancy loss in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.
      Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) by comprehensive chromosome
      screening (CCS) has been widely applied in IVF practices to select embryos with normal
      ploidy. Although multiple clinical trials have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with
      PGT-A, it's in controversial for whether PGT-A is truly worthwhile to be offered to all IVF
      patients. One of the main concerns is that it involves an embryo biopsy procedure, which is
      invasive and the long-term safety issue of the embryo biopsy remains to be fully
      investigated.

      In recent years, researchers have found that the spent medium of embryo culture contains
      trace amount of cell-free DNA, which may reflect the ploidy of the embryo. The non-invasive
      chromosome screening (NICS) approach utilizing spent culture medium samples has been
      evaluated in studies. However, the clinical value of NICS as a new effective indicator to
      evaluate embryo competence so far has not been justified by randomized clinical trials.

      The main purpose of this project is to verify whether NICS can be used as a new effective
      indicator for evaluating embryo developmental potential through multi-center, randomized
      clinical trials
