      and cancer risk, has proven remarkably difficult in traditional medical practice settings,
      and successful medical trials have been costly and labor intensive. This proposal aims to
      utilize a self-monitoring device, i.e., carbon monoxide monitor to foster smoking cessation
      among pregnant women who smoke. Investigators hypothesize that women who have access to a
      self-monitoring device more frequently (i.e., at home) and receive feedback about their
      carbon monoxide level will have greater reductions in smoking as determined by declining
      serum cotinine levels over the course of the study compared to women who do not have access
      to a self-monitoring device and do not receive feedback about their carbon monoxide level,
      but only receive text messages.
