      incidence of approximately 10.2 per million children. Initial staging of the disease and
      monitoring of the treatment response can be performed with different imaging modalities that
      include contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), bone scintigraphy and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy.

      Another potential target for neuroblastoma imaging is the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) that
      is present in many neuroendocrine tumours (NET). The superior PET imaging technology used
      with new radiotracers (such as 68Ga-DOTATATE) enables imaging at advantageous resolutions
      well below what is possible by current clinical SPECT systems that are used for 123I-MIBG.

      Design: Prospective single-arm non-randomized clinical trial (phase II) - pilot

      Objective: 1) Assess the feasibility and safety of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging in patients
      with neuroblastoma or suspected of having neuroblastoma. 2) Compare lesion-by-lesion the
      uptake of 68Ga-DOTATATE and 123I-MIBG in the same participant.

      Study population: Children and adults with biopsy-proven or suspected neuroblastoma

      Procedure and Follow-up: Few days after 123I-MIBG scan, participants will undergo a
      68Ga-DOTA-cTATE PET/CT scan (duration 2 hours). Clinical data will be collected from this
      imaging and from the participant's medical record (demographic, treatment, medication,
      pathology, lab test results) for a 2-year follow-up period.
