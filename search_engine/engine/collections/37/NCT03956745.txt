      general and sleep medicine. The study is designed to assess the levels of different
      biomarkers in the blood taken from frequent samples across three separate sleep-wake
      conditions - Conventional/Normal sleep-wake conditions (baseline), extended wake/acute sleep
      deprivation (constant routine), and during irregular sleep-wake conditions (inverted day).
      Participants will be asked to complete medical, psychological, and sleep-wake evaluations
      prior to the study. Upon completion of screening, if eligible, participants will stay 7
      consecutive days and nights in the sleep research laboratory within the hospital.
