      and test feasible, sustainable interventions to improve the outcome of women and children and
      to develop research capacity in resource-poor settings. Because most of the sites have weak
      health care systems, unacceptably high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and lack
      birth and death registries, they lack precise data on outcomes and measures of care.
      Information from a vital registry system will allow the Global Network to document maternal
      and neonatal mortality, design trials to address the major causes of poor outcome, assess the
      outcome of our interventions, and ultimately disseminate the results as the basis of public
      health policy.
