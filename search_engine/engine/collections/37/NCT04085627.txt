    
      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Area under cover (AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ ) .Secondary
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: tmax and t1/2. The method of judging bioequivalence of
      three-cross-section repeating experiment design: first of all, the calculation of the SWR of
      the AUC and Cmax, if SWR≥0.294, the use of RSABE analysis; if Swr<0.294, the average
      Bioequivalence analysis method with Non-scale (bioequivalence limit is 80%~125 %）.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
