        -  Determine the response rate of women with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the
           breast treated with sulindac and docetaxel.

        -  Determine the time to progression of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over
      1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed within 3-4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
