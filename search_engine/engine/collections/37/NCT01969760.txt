      high risk behaviors such as tobacco and substance use and resulting cardiovascular and
      chronic disease. In this study we modified a tobacco and substance use risk prevention
      program to develop a tailored intervention (Healthy Families DC) that also included promotion
      of physical activity (PA) for DC middle-school students referred by school staff as
      over-weight and at risk for problem behaviors. The program included an initial family
      assessment, a family feedback session with family PA goal setting and 6 phone/text based
      booster sessions. A pilot study with 18 families, comprised of at least one caregiver and
      target child, was conducted to examine feasibility, acceptability, and trends in preliminary
      outcomes such as PA via self-report and accelerometry, health risk behaviors (e.g., tobacco
      use), health goal setting, and changes in family functioning (e.g., youth positive behaviors,
      parenting).
