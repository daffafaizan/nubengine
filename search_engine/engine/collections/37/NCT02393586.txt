    
      WBA is an ex vivo model for measuring the combined effects of administered drugs, host
      factors and strain factors on mycobacterial killing. If performed in parallel with PK
      measurements, the method can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing
      cycle. The aim of this trial is to investigate the bactericidal activity of faropenem
      administered with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (augmentin) using the WBA model. We will also
      explore whether there is any additive effect or synergy with rifampicin in this model. The
      activity of faropenem on WBA by different strains of M. tuberculosis will be compared and the
      relationship between the host immune profile and WBA will be assessed.
