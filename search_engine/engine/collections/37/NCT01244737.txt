      to morbidity and mortality in children. Tumor staging, detecting recurrent tumor, and
      assessing the response to therapy are critical in the treatment of brain tumors, but current
      imaging methods have major limitations in providing such information. The objective of this
      study is to validate 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18] fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) as a measure of tumor
      proliferation and to demonstrate the utility of 18F-FLT as a PET imaging agent in children
      with central nervous system tumors. The proposed studies will evaluate 18F-FLT PET in three
      groups:

        1. Children with a new diagnosis of central nervous system tumor.

        2. Children in whom conventional imaging has raised concern for possible recurrence of a
           central nervous system tumor.

        3. Children receiving post-operative chemotherapy for a central nervous system tumor.

      In these three groups, correlation of 18F-FLT uptake with tumor histopathology and patient
      outcome will be used to assess the utility of 18F-FLT for grading tumors at diagnosis, for
      accurate identification of tumor recurrence, and for early assessment of the response to
      chemotherapy.
