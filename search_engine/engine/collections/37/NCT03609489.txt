      was postoperatively treated with apatinib combined with capecitabine for adjuvant therapy of
      biliary cancer, and the control group was treated with capecitabine alone.

      Progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), objective
      response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), EORTC QLQ-C30, HCC-18 and drug safety: vital
      signs, laboratory indicators, adverse event (AE), and serious adverse event (SAE),
      drug-related AE and SAE and their specific AE (such as hypertension, proteinuria, and
      hand-foot syndrome) were followed for research in the two groups to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the two regimens for the treatment of biliary tract cancer according to the
      standard of NCI-CTCAE V4.0.

      A rigorous, randomized and prospective study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety
      in treating biliary cancer between the combined use of apatinib mesylate plus capecitabine
      and capecitabine alone, with a view to improving the survival outcome and life quality of
      patients with biliary tract cancer.
