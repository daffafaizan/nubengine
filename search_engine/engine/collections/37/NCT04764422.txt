      tolerability and immunogenicity COVID-19 vaccine (NDV-HXP-S) administered at different doses
      levels (1, 3, and 10 µg) without adjuvant, and at two different dose levels (1 and 3 µg) with
      the adjuvant CpG 1018 among healthy adults, (age 18-59 years, 210 subjects). NDV-HXP-S or
      placebo (0.9% normal saline for injection) will administered IM according to a repeat
      vaccination schedule (given 28 days apart). In addition, as exploratory objectives, a total
      of 36 subjects will be randomly selected (1:1:1 ratio) from placebo and two high-dose groups
      i.e. NDV-HXP-S 10 µg and NDV-HXP-S 3 µg + CpG 1018, to provide additional blood at V1, V5 and
      V7 for assessment of T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI). An interim analysis of Phase 1 data will
      be conducted as the basis for decisions about advancement to Phase 2 of the study and about
      treatment group down selection.

      In the Phase 2 study, 250 subjects aged 18-75 years will be randomized (1:2:2) to placebo
      (0.9% normal saline for injection), or one of two selected formulations of NDV HXP S being
      evaluated in Phase 1 will be enrolled to Phase 2 study. Twelve subjects in each of the three
      Phase 2 groups (distributed among the two age strata) will be will be randomized to provide
      additional blood at V1, V5 and V7 for assessment of T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI).
