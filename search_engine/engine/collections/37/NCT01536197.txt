      mechanisms responsible for decreased food intake are incompletely understood. One possible
      mechanism that could account for decreased food intake is changes in taste perception.
      Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to provide a better understanding of the
      effects of bariatric surgery-induced weight-loss on taste perception.
