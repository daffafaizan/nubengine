      it takes for the body to remove the study drug. Information about any side effects that may
      occur will also be collected. Participants will continue their usual diet and exercise
      program and may remain on their physician-prescribed dose of metformin.

      Each part of the study is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks on average, not including
      screening. Participants may only enroll in one part.
