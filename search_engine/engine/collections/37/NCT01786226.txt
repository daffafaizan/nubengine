      were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg or 10 of mifepristone.

      The diminishing of prevalence of symptoms attributable to uterine fibroids is the most

      are slight and women's adherence to treatment is remarkable. Also the reduction of the
      volumes of the uterus and fibroids contribute to enhance the wellbeing of subjects.
