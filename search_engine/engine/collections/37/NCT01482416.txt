      change in vascular pattern at various levels. As a result, several side effects might appear
      and interfere with women's quality of life and health. The use of hormone replacement therapy
      has contributed to the improvement in these effects. It has been observed vascular beneficial
      effects of sex steroids in premenopausal women, and of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in
      climacteric women, on the central retinal arteries. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of conjugated equine estrogen on flow-mediated dilation of the brachial
      artery.
