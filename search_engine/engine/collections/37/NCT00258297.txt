      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant gefitinib in patients with
           resectable stage I-III esophageal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the epidermal growth factor-receptor expression in tissue samples obtained at
           diagnosis and surgery from patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily beginning between days -21 and -14 and continuing
      until day -1. Patients undergo tumor resection on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
