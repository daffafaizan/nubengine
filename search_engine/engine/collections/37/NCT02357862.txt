      seems incomplete. Because both atrioventricular valves are closely connected to each other by
      means of the cardiac fibrous skeleton, the geometry of the tricuspid valve is likely to be
      distorted after ring-annuloplasty of the mitral valve. This could lead to the development of
      functional TR, or to an increase in TR severity. To test this hypothesis, a prospective study
      will be started in patients undergoing isolated mitral valve annuloplasty.
