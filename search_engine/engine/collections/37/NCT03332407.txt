      surgery. Informed consent was obtained from both parents and children on the day of
      pre-anesthetic evaluation visit. The child and his or her parents were questioned on
      preoperative patient's sleep quality based on Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Surgery
      was performed under the same anesthesia as usual. After the operation, extubation was
      performed and patient was moved to post anesthesia recovery room (PACU). During the stay in
      PACU, one investigator measured degree of ED by Watcha and PAED (Post anesthesia emergence
      delirium ) scale to minimize bias. One day after the surgery, the investigator mede a phone
      call to the parents of the patient to obtain information for postoperative PSQI.
