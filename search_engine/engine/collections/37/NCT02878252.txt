      mortality. Around 15% to 20% of COPD patients would present with features of asthma and are
      considered to have the overlap syndrome of COPD and asthma, commonly called asthma-COPD
      overlap syndrome (ACOS). In Asia, specifically Taiwan, the overall prevalence of ACOS in
      patients with COPD is approximately 17.4%. COPD patients with asthma symptoms represent a
      relevant clinical population because they have worse health-related quality of life.

      Given the increased morbidity among COPD patients with asthma overlap, it is critical that
      these patients are properly characterized to aid the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The
      Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
      Disease (GOLD) guidelines have given joint recommendations on the identification, diagnosis
      and treatment of these patients. These recommendations have been adapted for use in the Asia
      Area countries. The primary objective of this study is to determine the proportion and
      clinical characteristics of patients with ACOS as defined by the joint GINA and GOLD
      recommendation amongst diagnosed COPD patients seen at the out-patient clinics.
