    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover study (method used to switch
      participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) to compare the oral
      bioavailability of JNJ-47910382 formulated as an uncoated tablet and as a suspension, in
      healthy participants. The study consists of 3 phases, including, a screening phase, an
      open-label treatment phase, and a follow up phase. The screening phase will be within 21 days
      before administration of the first dose of study medication. After screening, participants
      will be randomized according to a classical 2 sequence (ie, treatment sequence AB [where the
      participants will first receive treatment A and then treatment B] and sequence BA [where the
      participants will first receive treatment B and then treatment A]), 2-period crossover design
      to receive the study medication in the treatment phase. In each session (Session 1 or Session
      2), participants will receive either Treatment A: 200 mg dose of JNJ-47910382 formulated as a
      suspension, or Treatment B: 200 mg JNJ-47910382 formulated as an uncoated tablet. There will
      be a washout period (period when participant is not receiving any study medication) of at
      least 7 to 14 days between the 2 sessions. The follow up phase will include 2 follow up
      visits after intake of study medication in last treatment session. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical
      examination, and specific toxicities will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of
      the study will be at least 11 to 18 days (screening and follow up phase not included).
