    
      Objective 1: Characterization of the Gut Associated Lymphocytes (GALT) in HIV, HCV and
      coinfected patients regarding the role of Th17 and cytokine profiles.

      Hypothesis 1a: HIV and HCV/HIV coinfection is associated with changes in Th17 numbers and
      functions in GALT.

      Hypothesis 1b: HIV and HCV/HIV coinfection is associated with changes in cytokine profiles in
      intestinal mucosa.

      Objective 2: Identify the relationship between changes in Gut Associated Lymphocytes (GALT)
      in HIV, HCV and coinfected patients and markers of microbial translocation.

      Hypothesis 2a: Changes in GALT are associated with increase in microbial translocation in
      HIV, HCV and coinfected patients.
