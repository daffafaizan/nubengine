      I. Determine change in viral load at day 6 compared to baseline between two regimens to treat
      COVID-19 and a contemporaneous control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to resolution of symptoms (symptom questionnaire)

      II. Change in the fever curve resulting in shorter time to afebrile for 48 hours

      III. Normalization of vital signs

      IV. Time to discharge (if hospitalized)

      V. Assessment of agent toxicity as measured by standard metrics

      VI. Collection of throat swab and blood for viral load, presence of IgM or IgG antibodies

      VII. If feasible on samples collected for quantitative PCR decrease in virus shedding (in
      oropharyngeal secretions)

      VIII. Measures of cytokines in blood including IL6, IL-8, TNF, INF

      IX. Routine standard of care labs obtained as part of the care of these patients such as
      differential white count, CRP, troponin and LFTs will be analyzed for correlative trends
