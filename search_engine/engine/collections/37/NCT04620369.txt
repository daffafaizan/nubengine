      I. To determine the ability of rose geranium in sesame oil nasal spray to alleviate nasal
      vestibulitis in patients undergoing systemic, antineoplastic therapy when compared with
      isotonic nasal saline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess toxicities related to rose geranium in sesame oil nasal spray in this study
      situation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients instill rose geranium in sesame oil nasal spray, 1 spray in each nostril
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients instill isotonic nasal saline, 1 spray in each nostril BID on days 1-14 in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After 2 weeks, patients may instill rose geranium in
      sesame oil nasal spray as in Arm A for an additional 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.
