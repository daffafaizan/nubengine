    
      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety (Primary Endpoint) along
      with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation (Secondary Endpoint).

      The main objectives of the study are :

        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day
           follow up period.

        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device (3 and 6 months follow up).

        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in improving MR.

      Primary endpoints:

      • Safety: Acute safety. Rate of device related SAE including device related mortality,
      stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and non-elective
      cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  • Safety: Safety at 3 and 6 months. Rate of SAEs and device related SAEs at 3, 6 and
           12months.

        -  Effectiveness: MR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3 and 6 and 12
           months. Improved NYHA class and 6MWT distance at 30 days, 3 and 6 and 12 months.
