      Administration of low-dose adrenaline activates the coagulation system and may decrease
      intraoperative and immediate postoperative bleeding. Thus, the aim of this study is to
      evaluation whether intraoperative IV-administration of low-dose adrenaline reduces bleeding
      in elective total hip arthroplasty.
