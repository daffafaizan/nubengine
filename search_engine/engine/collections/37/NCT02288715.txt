      (AR) in patients with sepsis is considered related to Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
      As AR is important in stabilizing the cerebral perfusion pressure, whether greater
      variability of CPP is related to SAE and mortality or not remains unclear. We conduct this
      study to evaluate the relationship between them.
