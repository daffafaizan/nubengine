      the use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
      in preterm infants. Results of these studies are not yet published and will be forthcoming
      Spring 2006. However, there is evidence to suggest that for patients with BPD, treatment with
      iNO may improve oxygenation2 and improve pulmonary blood flow by relaxing pulmonary vascular
      tone. 3 Also, there is a recent primate study that suggests in the face of existing BPD,
      treatment with iNO may decrease oxygen and ventilation requirements through a mechanism that
      helps preserve surfactant protein.4 Taken together, this preliminary work suggests there may
      be clinical benefit in treating established BPD with iNO. However, as few data exist on the
      clinical course of BPD patients treated with iNO, further description is necessary to
      evaluate iNO as a potential treatment modality for BPD. Since iNO has been used as adjunctive
      therapy for neonates at PCMC with serious respiratory disease, useful information on the
      relationship between BPD and iNO treatment may exist within our own patient population
