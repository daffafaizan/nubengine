      in another study using translation and back translation in concordance with the international
      guidelines. The questionnaire is administered to a total of 102 patients either directly or
      via telephone. Reproducibility will be tested through test and retest as one sub-group will
      be administered the questionnaire twice with an interval of 1 to 2 weeks. Patients will also
      be administered the questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC) : QLQ-C30.

      The validity of the LARS and WEXNER score will be tested by using the indicators of
      discriminant validity and convergent validity which will be determined in this study by
      computing the correlations between the LARS and WEXNER scores to the EORTC QLQ-C30.

      For discriminant validity testing, variables used will be factors known to affect bowel
      function after colorectal surgery such as gender, age, neoadjuvant therapy, distance of the
      tumor from the anal verge, prior temporary stoma, length of postoperative period, the need
      for a reintervention and the occurrence of complications.

      We recruited for our study patients treated in the National Oncology Institute of Rabat and
      in the Al azhar oncology center in the surgical department of Pr. Souadka Abdelilah with a
      minimum post operative interval of 6 months.

      The validation of a moroccan dialectical version of the LARS score and WEXNER score will
      allow a better understanding of the bowel function post surgery and thereby the
      identification of patients with the highest scores which will allow a better understanding
      and possible inclusion of these tools in patient outcome assessment.
