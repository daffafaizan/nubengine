    
      Tested hypothesis: For essential resistant hypertension, a new regimen based on intensive RAS
      blockage is non inferior to the recommended regimen based on intensive sodium depletion.

      Primary objective: To demonstrate non-inferiority (i.e difference between the two regimen
      less than 5 mmHg for the mean day-time SBP at week 12)

        -  One treatment arm including irbesartan 300 mg, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5mg,
           amlodipine 5 mg, ramipril 10mg and bisoprolol 10 mg

        -  One treatment arm including irbesartan 300 mg, HCTZ 12.5mg, amlodipine 5 mg,
           spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 40 mg and amiloride 5 mg.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess clinical and biological safety and efficacy of these regimen

        -  To evaluate predicted factors of controlled or uncontrolled BP

        -  To evaluate compliance to treatment

        -  To compare the cost of the different strategies

        -  To compare the two strategies in terms of endothelial function and left ventricular
           diastolic filling

      Study design:

        -  Period 1 from week-4 to week 0 : 4-week treatment for all patients with irbesartan 300
           mg, HCTZ 12.5mg, amlodipine 5 mg. At the end of this period, an ABPM will be performed:
           only patients with a mean day time SBP>135 and/or DBP>85 mmHg will be randomized for a
           further 3 months treatment

        -  Period 2 from week 0 to week 4: patients will be randomized in two groups, the first one
           receiving spironolactone 25mg and the second one receiving ramipril 5 mg as add-on
           therapy (on top of the previous tri-therapy).

        -  Period 3 from week 4 to week 8: Patients with BP controlled at week 4 (i.e mean home
           blood pressure measurement (HBPM) <135/85 mmHg at week 4) remain on the same treatment.
           For those uncontrolled (i.e. mean HBPM >135/85 mmHg at week 4), furosemide 20 mg will be
           added in the first group and ramipril will be titrated to 10 mg in the second group

        -  Period 4 from week 8 to week 10: Patients with BP controlled at week 8 (i.e. mean HBPM
           <135/85 mmHg at week 8) remain on the same treatment. For those uncontrolled (i.e. mean
           HBPM >135/85 mmHg at week 8), furosemide will be titrated to 40 mg in the first group
           and bisoprolol 5 mg will be added in the second group.

        -  Period 5 from week 10 to week 12 (end of the study): Patients with BP controlled at week
           10 (i.e mean HBPM <135/85 mmHg at week 10) remain on the same treatment. For those
           uncontrolled (i.e mean HBPM > 135/85 mmHg at week 10), amiloride 5 mg will be added to
           the previous treatment in the first group and bisoprolol will be titrated to 10 mg in
           the second group.

      Reasons for treatment discontinuation:

        -  Patient decision

        -  Informed consent withdrawal

        -  SBP>180 mmHg or <100 mmHg (HBPM) whatever the time during the trial

        -  Adverse events related to treatment or not
