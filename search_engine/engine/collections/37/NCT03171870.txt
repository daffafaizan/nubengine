      chronic exertional dyspnea, and commonly presents with cough, bibasilar inspiratory crackles,
      and finger clubbing.

      High resolution chest computed tomography is an essential component of the diagnostic pathway
      in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. usual interstitial pneumonia is characterized on high
      resolution chest computed tomography by the presence of reticular opacities, often associated
      with traction bronchiectasis.

      Patients with interstitial lung disease have poor health-related quality of life. However,
      whether health-related quality of life differs among different subtypes of interstitial lung
      disease is unclear.

      There is limited research on the health-related quality of life of Idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis patients.

      Health-related quality of life deficits should be monitored in clinical practice with
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and considered when investigating new therapies
