      Besides alterations in the basal ganglia, substantial evidence identifies cerebellar
      dysfunction as a possible cause for dystonia. Pathophysiological findings suggest that the
      cerebellar influence on the primary motor cortex is modified in patients with different forms
      of dystonia. The objective of this study is to find out whether this cerebellar influence
      plays a role in dystonic disorders.

      Study population

      20 patients with blepharospasm, 20 patients with focal hand dystonia, 20 patients with DYT-1
      Primary generalized dystonia and 60 healthy volunteers age and sex matched.

      Design

      Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be performed at rest and during
      tonic activation of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI). The conditioning stimulus (CS)
      will be applied to the ipsilateral cerebellum using different intensities and will precede
      the test stimulus by intervals from 3 to 10 ms, respectively. The test stimulus (TS) will be
      applied over the motor hot spot of FDI in the primary motor cortex.

      Outcome measures

      The primary outcome measure will be the motor evoked potential (MEP) in FDI after a
      conditioning cerebellar stimulus in relation to the unconditioned MEP size. Each different
      patient group will be compared separately to the age- and sex-matched healthy controls and
      between each other. Secondary outcome parameters will be the influence of different
      interstimulus intervals and different stimulation intensities of the conditioning stimulus on
      the MEP.
