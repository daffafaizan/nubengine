      antibacterial drug therapy. The use of an ophthalmic solution containing the combination of a
      steroid and an antibiotic is routinely used in clinical practice; however, treatment duration
      could favour the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The study treatment associating a
      broad-spectrum antibiotic with a highly effective corticosteroid that can be used for a short
      period of time (one week) is therefore of considerable interest.

      The aim of this study is to measure the concentrations of levofloxacin and dexamethasone in
      the aqueous humour after topical application of the combined ophthalmic solution and its
      single components.
