      replacement surgery.4 Large, prospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in mortality
      rate, median length of stay, and blood transfusion rates with no change in re-admission
      rates.5,6 However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the application of ERAS principles
      in other orthopaedic subspecialties, especially elective spine surgery. With over 35,000
      cervical spine procedures performed in 2011, almost 200,000 elective lumbar fusion surgeries
      performed in 2015, and 83.7 million people estimated to be â‰¥ 65 years old in 2050, the demand
      for elective spine surgery is high and will continue to grow placing a significant economic
      burden on the health care system.This increasing demand in conjunction with prolonged
      hospital stays, extensive postoperative pain regimens, and the advent of minimally invasive
      procedures provides a compelling argument for the suitability of ERAS protocols in elective
      spine surgery.

      While distinct components of the ERAS pathway have been investigated in spine surgery
      including preoperative education, multimodal pain management, surgical approach, nutrition,
      and physical therapy, few studies have investigated the collective application of these
      interventions. Furthermore, these studies have been retrospective in nature, limiting their
      generalizability.The goal of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of oral versus intravenous medications
      preoperatively. The investigators also plan to evaluate the effect of the implementation of
      the standard of care ERAS principles on the outcome of patients undergoing elective spine
      surgery.
