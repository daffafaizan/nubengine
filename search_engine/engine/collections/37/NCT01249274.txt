    
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether postpartum women with a history of cocaine abuse or
      dependence use less cocaine if they are randomized to progesterone than placebo.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to women who are randomized to placebo, those assigned to progesterone
      will use less cocaine as measured by urine toxicology results and self-reported days of use.

      Specific aim 2: To obtain information about the safety and tolerability of progesterone
      treatment in the postpartum period.

      Hypothesis 2: Side effects for progesterone will be similar to those of placebo.
