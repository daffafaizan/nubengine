      (LV) function is a challenging clinical entity as data on the recommended treatment strategy
      for these patients are scarce and conflicting, which is reflected in current guidelines.
      European guidelines advocate a more conservative strategy i.e. watchful waiting, with yearly
      echocardiography, whilst American guidelines are more in favour of early surgery to
      reconstruct the MV, i.e. MV repair (in contrast to MV replacement) in order to prevent future
      LV dysfunction and complaints.

      A number of non-randomised trials show a favourable outcome of early surgery and the early
      surgery strategy has shown to be associated with improved long-term survival, decreased
      cardiac mortality and decreased morbidity compared with the conservative management
      [citations 1-3]. On the other hand, non-randomised trials describe also that a conservative
      strategy (i.e. watchful waiting) can be safely accomplished. If facilitated surgery is
      performed in this population it has proven to be eventually associated with good
      perioperative and postoperative outcome in 50% of the patients at 10 years when careful
      follow-up is being carried out [citation 4]. Non-randomised trials inherently have a number
      of drawbacks. A randomised trial comparing both strategies and objectivising the best
      treatment strategy has never been performed.

      The Dutch AMR (Asymptomatic Mitral Regurgitation) trial is a multicenter, prospective,
      randomised trial comparing early MV repair versus watchful waiting in asymptomatic patients
      with severe organic MV regurgitation and preserved LV function [citation 5, 6].
