      as both self- and parent-report questionnaires. During their yearly visit to St. Jude,
      eligible patients who agree to participate will undergo a single neurocognitive evaluation.
      This evaluation will take place in the Psychology Clinic. The administration time for the
      assessment battery is estimated at 2.5-3.5 hours, with variability depending on the age of
      the patient and the speed of completion of the tasks. All measures selected for the study
      have well-established psychometric properties, including acceptable reliability and validity.
      All measures were standardized on large, representative samples of children and adults and
      have age-specific norms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To examine and describe psychological outcomes in long-term (> 5 years) survivors of
      allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (SCT) in childhood. This will be
      conducted in a one-time cross-sectional assessment using both performance based measures and
      survey questionnaires. Comparisons will be made to established normative data on well
      validated standardized instruments and to control participants in the community without a
      history of serious illness, matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

        -  To describe global cognitive and academic outcomes in this SCT cohort using measures of
           intelligence and academic achievement.

        -  To examine performance in specific neuropsychologic domains, including working memory,
           processing speed and other executive functions.

        -  To examine psychosocial function and quality of life among long-term SCT survivors using
           both self- and parent-report.
