      people who have stable schizophrenia. This study will look whether motivation/reward deficits
      observed in schizophrenia are attenuated and whether cognitive impairment associated with
      schizophrenia is improved in people who take TAK-041 in addition to standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment sequences -which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need) to receive either TAK-041 40 mg or Placebo first and then will be
      crossed over to receive the opposite Intervention.

      All participants will be asked to take oral suspension on Day 1 of each Period. There will be
      a wash-out Period of 35 days between the dosing days in Period 1 and 2.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 126 to 154 days. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic plus a final visit 77 days after receiving their last dose of drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
