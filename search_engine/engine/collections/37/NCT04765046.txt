      improve the current BIS algorithm in the elderly adult population. The BIS system will be
      used on-label as approved in the respective study site countries to monitor and
      non-invasively measure and interpret brain wave activity directly related to the effects of
      anesthetic agents. The study's purpose is to evaluate the relationship between BIS
      parameters, age, and depth of anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery under general
      anesthesia.
