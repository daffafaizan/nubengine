      intervention visits, participants will wear an Omnipod to deliver insulin and a Dexcom G6 CGM
      to measure glucose. The CGM system will provide sensed glucose data every 5 minutes. Sensed
      glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) from the Dexcom
      G6 transmitter to the Samsung master controller every five minutes. The smart phone will
      wirelessly communicate via BTLE to an Omnipod through an Omnipod PDM. During one of the
      studies, glucose will be controlled using the MPC AP. During another study, glucose will be
      controlled using the FMPD AP. The AP system will receive activity data through a Polar M600
      watch worn by the participant.

      Participants will arrive at the clinic at approximately 7am for the inpatient visits.
      Participants will eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in the clinic. Participants will perform
      activities of daily living and exercise using an aerobic exercise video. Participants will
      discharge at 7pm to go home for the remainder of the study visit and perform one exercise
      video session at home. Participants will return to OHSU on Day 4 for removal of all devices.
      The exception to this is for the first 8 participants using the MPC AP. These participants
      will stay at the research clinic during the day and go home to sleep each night (7pm-7am).
