      of them will die as a consequence of this disease.

      Treatment consists of resection of the primary tumor, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in
      some patients. The chemotherapeutical agents, however, are only moderately effective with
      regard to increase of survival. New treatment modalities are therefore desirable.

      Radioimmunotherapy using radioactive labelled antibodies have proven to be effective in
      hematologic malignancies. Due to slow absorption in solid tumors however an effective
      radiation dose is not yet achieved.

      The aim of our study is to bypass this slow tumor uptake by the use of pre-targeting. We
      therefore use an unlabeled bispecific antibody infusion. This will be followed several days
      later by the infusion of a radiolabeled peptide that binds to the bispecific antibody.

      We hypothesise that this small peptide will be readily absorbed by the tumor which is
      pre-saturated by the bispecific antibody. As a consequence a higher radiation dose can be
      given with a lower toxicity.
