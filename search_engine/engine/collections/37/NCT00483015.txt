      alone an estimated 160,440 patients died of lung cancer 2004[1]. It is well known that
      tobacco smoking is a major risk factor and accounts for the majority of all lung cancer
      cases. But there is a sub group of patients with lung cancer who have never actively smoked
      tobacco. This group exhibits certain unique characteristics which separates them from lung
      cancer in smokers. It has been shown that never- smokers with adenocarcinoma have better
      outcomes in terms of overall survival as well as lung cancer specific survival when compared
      to current smokers with adenocarcinoma of the lung[2]. Also patients who are current smokers
      at diagnosis have decreased survival when compared to people who quit smoking[3]. The
      improved survival in never smokers could be due to several reasons. Such as increased
      incidence of co-morbid factors in smokers as result of exposure to tobacco smoke, differences
      in metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents or a reflection of differences in the underlying
      molecular biology of the tumor.

      It has been demonstrated that chromosomal abnormalities are common in lung cancer patients
      with a smoking history when compared to never- smokers[4]. Gene mutations such as p53
      mutations are more frequent in never- smokers than in previous smokers[5]. In addition
      mutations that are specific only to lung cancer in never smokers have been discovered,
      demonstrating the possibility of a separate or overlapping carcinogenesis pathway for lung
      cancer in never smokers vs. smokers [6].
