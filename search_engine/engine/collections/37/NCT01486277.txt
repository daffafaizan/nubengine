    
      This is a single-arm (group), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      and multicenter study. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within
      28 days prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (participants will receive
      quisinostat) and follow-up phase (30 days after the last dose of study medication until death
      or clinical cutoff). Clinical cut-off is defined as when the last participant will be
      assessed with progressive disease or died, or 6 months after the last participant enrolled,
      whichever occurs first. However, if any participants are still receiving study treatment at
      the time of clinical cut-off, these participants will enter a long-term extension phase and
      will continue to receive study medication until a reason for discontinuation is met (ie,
      disease progression, toxicity, availability of other effective medications that the
      participant may receive, or treating physician advice). The long-term extension phase will
      continue for a maximum of 2 years beyond the clinical cut-off for primary analysis. Safety
      will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination,
      12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored in this
      study. Any participants responding to treatment at the end of the 2-year long-term extension
      phase will be able to continue to receive quisinostat as long as they are assessed by the
      investigator as not meeting treatment discontinuation criteria; during this time, only
      information related to serious adverse events will be collected.
