      of these patients acquire hospital-acquired infections compared with 5% of other hospital
      in-patients without cirrhosis.It is associated with a mortality rate of 38% with a four-fold
      increase compared to individuals without cirrhosis.

      Cirrhotic patients have a high risk for antimicrobial resistance because of chronic use of
      prescribed antibiotics like quinolones in secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial
      peritonitis. In addition, undergoing invasive procedures and recurrent hospital admissions
      encourage both increased occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the spread of resistant
      pathogens in these patients.

      Epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes of MDR infections have raised a special
      attention in cirrhosis. Some studies reported bacterial resistance in about 50% of examined
      patients and it is associated with treatment failure, septic shock and hospital mortality
      especially in nosocomial and healthcare related infections
