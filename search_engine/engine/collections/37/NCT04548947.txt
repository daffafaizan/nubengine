      as the main risk factors for the development of CRC in patients after a colonoscopy. Between
      7% and 9% of all newly diagnosed CRCs are estimated to be such "interval cancers," occurring
      after a previous colonoscopy and before the next surveillance examination. The vast majority
      of interval cancers are caused by incomplete detection or resection during colonoscopy
      examination. The contribution of incomplete resection towards interval cancer has recently
      been pointed out by a panel of experts as one of the cornerstones of CRC prevention that need
      to be addressed in future research studies. The primary aim of this study is to examine the
      incomplete adenoma resection rates when performing a cold snare polypectomy in conjunction
      with a submucosal injection for endoscopic resection of 4-20 mm non-pedunculated colorectal
      polyps. The subjects are patients, men and women, aged between 45-80 years old that are
      scheduled for a colonoscopy. The secondary aims are to identify procedure-related
      complication rates and patient-, polyp-, and endoscopist-related factors associated with
      incomplete adenoma resection.
