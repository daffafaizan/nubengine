      chronic low-grade inflammation. Some probiotics have an anti-inflammatory properties.
      Ingestion of probiotics might therefore, due to this property, increase sensitivity to
      insulin.

      In this study type 2 diabetics (N=24) and healthy control (N=24) are given the probiotic
      bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus NCFM for four weeks. The anti-inflammatory effect is
      examined by evaluating the inflammatory response (White blood cell count, plasma-cytokines)
      to an iv injection of endotoxin (0,3 ng/kg) before and after the intervention. Also the
      insulin-sensitivity is measured with an hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp before and after L.
      acidophilus NCFM.
