      donor and recipient sites.

      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biomaterial that creates a favorable environment for wound healing
      due to its unique hydroscopic and viscoelastic properties, and it is important for wound
      healing activities.HA induces angiogenesis following degradation and improves the wound
      healing environment.HA supports a mechanism that induces proliferation of capillaries, and
      components produced after HA degradation increase vascularization.Laser Doppler flowmetry
      (LDF) technique is frequently used in the field of plastic surgery for monitoring
      microvascular blood flow to detect insufficient circulation in the skin transplants and flaps
      in the early period and to thereby prevent and predict possible surgical complications.
