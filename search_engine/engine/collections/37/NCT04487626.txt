      colonoscopy. Adequate bowel preparation is essential to guarantee a clear vision of colonic
      mucosa, complete inspection of entire colon and improves the adenoma detection rates(ADRs).
      Therefore, the quality of bowel preparation should be evaluated accurately and objectively.
      However, current bowel preparation quality scales depend on memories and subjective decision
      of endoscopists. Recently, articifial intelligence system based on deep learning algorithm
      has been used widely in medical fields. But, few studies have been reported to evaluate the
      performance of AI system based on deep learning in bowel preparation quality scoring. This
      study aims to develop and train an AI system to assess bowel preparation quality using the
      BBPS, and validate the AI system to improve the quality of colonoscopy.
