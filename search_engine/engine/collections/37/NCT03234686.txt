    
      This Phase II study is designed as a randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled,
      multi-centre study for subjects with evidence of amyloid positive pAD or mAD.

      Participants will be assigned randomly to two groups (Group 1 Deferiprone (15mg/kg BID
      orally), Group 2: Placebo). Participants will have a 2 in 3 chance to be placed in the
      Deferiprone group.

      The study will enrol approximately 171 participants over 4 sites in Australia. The overall
      duration for patients will be 54 weeks. This includes a 55-day screening period, and visits
      on Day 1, weeks 13, 26, 38,52, and a two-week follow-up visit.

      Participants will be screened for the study after signing the approved informed consent form.
      As part of the 55-day screening phase, subjects will undertake an extensive medical and
      neurological assessments as well as a PET scan.

      At the baseline visit, following the screening phase, blood and urine will be taken for
      safety monitoring and for measuring APOE-4 gene status. Baseline signs and symptoms will be
      collected. An MRI will be performed All patients will start with study medication at the
      Baseline visit.

      Participants will return to the centre on Weeks 13, 26, 38, 52 (or early termination) to
      undertake a neurological examination as well as an assessment of blood samples taken at the
      visit.

      Participants must also attend weekly blood tests.

      SAE's, AE's and changes to concomitant medications will be observed and evaluated throughout
      the study. Each study visit will have a 7-day window after the due date to account for
      scheduling conflicts/holidays/weekends.

      Participants will be given additional study product to account for the 7-day window.

      Participants must attend the weekly pathology visits with a 3-day window of the scheduled
      date or risk termination from the trial.
