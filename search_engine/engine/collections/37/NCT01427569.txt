    
      This is a multi center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 80
      patients will be randomized according to a 1: 1 randomization schedule. To participate in the
      trial, patients must have a current Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) for between 60 days to 2 years
      at the screening visit. In the 2-week period between screening and baseline visit, the
      patient's DFU must not have healed by 30% or more, in wound area, while being treated with
      SWT twice a week during this screening period.

      During the treatment period of 4 weeks all patients will be examined on a weekly basis by the
      site staff. Treatment with SWT plus the study gel (IZN-6D4 Gel or placebo gel) (including any
      necessary debridement) will be administered at these weekly visits. In addition, the patient
      or caregiver will be trained to perform SWT plus the study treatment at home once midweek
      between visits.
