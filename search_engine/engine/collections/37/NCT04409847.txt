      cardiovascular system involvement. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic
      cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes,
      macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial
      dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque
      instability, and myocardial infarction. While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, it is
      unclear if the use of the common antihypertensive drugs ACE inhibitors or angiotensin
      receptor blockers alter prognosis.
