      effects which are comparable to conventional strength training. Therefore EMS could lower the
      barrier to physical activity. The present study focusses on psychological and physical
      effects of an 8-week EMS workout. Physical activity is notably important for mental and
      physical health, but is on average far too rarely implemented. Therefore
      EMS-whole-body-workouts could provide an opportunity to generate positive psychological and
      physical effects through a less (subjective) cost-intense strength training.
