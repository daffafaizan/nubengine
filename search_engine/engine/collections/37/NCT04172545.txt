      being systolic arterial pressure, fluids transfused and intra abdominal pressure used are
      recorded.

      After removal of stapled stomach during surgery, thickness of stomach wall and thickness of
      staple line are measured and compared to evaluate quality of staple formation.

      the closer the staple height to the wall thickness the better the quality of stapling.
      Because no one has ever analyzed this relationship, and certainly not under different
      anesthetic conditions it is not clear yet if any relationship will be found.

      the analysis will help to understand the relation and help to start perhaps a randomised
      trial to learn what conditions are best to improve staple quality.
