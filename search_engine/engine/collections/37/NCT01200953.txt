      postal system, increased attention has been paid to the evaluation and management of
      bioterrorism-related illness. Similarly, the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, Ebola virus disease in
      both 2013-16 and 2018-20, and, most recently, the global advent of SARS-CoV-2 infections in
      2019, coupled with the ongoing threat of global influenza pandemics, have fostered intensive
      interest in the evaluation and management of emerging infections both in the US and
      internationally. Data to this end are often limited, however, in that while many such
      diseases exist in nature, human illness may only occur rarely or sporadically. The primary
      purpose of this protocol is to characterize the clinical course and determine the underlying
      pathophysiology of infection with the causative agent of any disease of bioterrorism concern
      (whether of natural or deliberate origin), agents under study in biodefense-related research
      laboratories, or emerging infectious disease pathogens of public health concern via the
      evaluation of infected or exposed persons, close contacts of potentially infected or exposed
      persons, as well as those who have recovered from illness. Other goals include the
      characterization of immune responses to such diseases; the evaluation of diagnostic tests for
      the rapid identification of the causative agents of such diseases in clinical specimens; and
      the

      observation, follow-up, and simulation training of medical staff involved in the care of the
      above categories of patients. The ultimate goal is that further knowledge about diseases of
      bioterrorism concern and emerging infectious diseases may lead to more effective forms of
      therapy and improve disease-related morbidity and mortality.
