      of radiologic procedures on children. Procedures such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs)
      require that the patient remain still for the duration of the test. Propofol has become the
      drug of choice for many sedation services due to its rapid onset of action, rapid recovery
      time, ability to achieve sedation reliably and favorable safety profile. Dexmedetomidine, a
      selective alpha-2- adrenergic agonist, has also gained popularity with sedation services. Its
      main advantage over propofol is that it has minimal respiratory complications when compared
      to propofol. The sedative effect from dexmedetomidine preserves a natural sleep pattern and
      induces cooperative sedation in which patients are easily arousable. In pediatric studies,
      the most frequent adverse effect have been related to its potential to cause hypotension and
      bradycardia, which resolve with dose reduction. Additionally, dexmedetomidine does not seem
      to have as much impairment of cognitive function and has an opioid sparing effect.
      Dexmedetomidine, however, has a longer onset of action and longer recovery time compared to
      propofol, which has limited its use with many sedation services.
