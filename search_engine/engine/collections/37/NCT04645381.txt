    
      This study is a descriptive, cross-sectional pilot study. The trial subjects will have their
      hands imaged by conventional radiography. The 2nd and 3rd digit metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
      joint will be scanned by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
      (HR-pQCT). Patients with RA (n = 10) will be included and bone samples from MCP joints
      analyzed using microcomputed tomography (ÂµCT) and histology.

        -  Age > 18 years.

        -  Participants diagnosed with RA according to the ACR/EULAR (2010) classification criteria
           or American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for the patients who were
           diagnosed before 2010.
