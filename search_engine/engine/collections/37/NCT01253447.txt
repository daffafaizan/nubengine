    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the proportion of patients achieving Morphologic Complete Response (CR),
      Morphologic CR with incomplete count recovery (CRp) or Partial Response (PR) as best response
      within 3 cycles of therapy with MK-2206.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the disease-free survival of patients that achieve CR/CRp.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of single-agent MK-2206 in this patient population.

      III. To determine the biologic effects of MK-2206 on leukemia cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive AKT inhibitor MK-2206 orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
