    
      This is a prospective pilot study whose primary aim is to determine whether investigational
      FLT imaging can detect and distinguish non-engraftment from delayed engraftment after
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in populations at highest risk for graft
      failure. The investigators will enroll 50 patients undergoing myeloblative transplantation on
      this trial (15 pediatric and adult recipients of cord blood stem cells, 15 pediatric and
      adult recipients of haplo-identical HSCT, and 20 recipients of these two stem cell sources
      who have not engrafted by day 28). The planned length of this trial is 5 years and it will be
      conducted at 3 centers: Emory/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (pediatric and adult),
      University of Oklahoma (adult), and University of Michigan (pediatric and adult).

      For all pediatric and adult patients undergoing cord blood HSCT, three FLT images will be
      taken: first, one day prior to HSCT and second and third, on days 9 and 28 after HSCT. For
      recipients of haplo-HSCT, the FLT images will be taken one day prior to HSCT and then on days
      5 and 28 after HSCT. Pediatric and adult patients who have not engrafted by day 24 after cord
      or haplo-identical HSCT will undergo a single FLT PET/CT image within one week, to determine
      if this scan can identify graft failure versus delayed engraftment. Blood samples will also
      be collected from all patients for blood biomarker analysis, including thymidine kinase-1
      (TK1). Each patient will be in this study for one year.
