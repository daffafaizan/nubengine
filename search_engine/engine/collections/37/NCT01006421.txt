      might give better results than using either one alone. This might improve repigmentation as
      well as patients' quality-of-life. (QOL).

      This will be a prospective double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.
      One-hundred-sixty Vitiligo patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups( 80 patients per
      group).

      One group will receive oral GB (2 tablets of 60 mgs twice daily) with NBUVB twice weekly.

      The other group will receive placebo tablets( identical in size, shape and color) to GB twice
      daily with NBUVB twice weekly.

      Both groups will be treated for 6 months. Standard protocol of phototherapy will be used for
      both groups.

      Our aim here is to see whether adding GB to NBUVB will lead to better repigmentation than
      placebo or not.
