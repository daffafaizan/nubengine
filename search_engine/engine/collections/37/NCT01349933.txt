      I. To determine the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months along with
      the confirmed response rate as a dual primary endpoint..

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate best response and duration of response for patients treated with MK2206 (Akt
      inhibitor MK2206).

      II. To evaluate the overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated
      with MK2206.

      III. To evaluate safety and tolerability of MK2206.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MK2206 in Asian patients. II. To study the
      pharmacodynamic effect of MK2206 using biomarkers and correlation with cancer-related
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacogenomic and pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for up to 3 years.
