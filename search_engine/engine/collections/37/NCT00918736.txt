      treatment option in knee osteoarthritis. Previous studies reported that five weekly
      hyaluronate injections were safe and effective for the treatment of ankle osteoarthritis.
      However, the effect of three weekly injections has rarely been investigated. Besides, no
      study to date has assessed whether balance function would change after HA injections in
      patients with ankle OA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      three weekly injections of sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan) in patients with unilateral ankle
      osteoarthritis. Pain, physical function and balance will be assessed as parameters for the
      effectiveness.
