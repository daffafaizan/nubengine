        -  Compare event-free survival of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed high-grade
           gliomas treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by temozolomide and
           lomustine with historical controls.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate MGMT and p53 expression in tumor tissue with outcome in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate polymorphisms in GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genes and GSTP1 protein expression in
           tumors with survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42. Patients
           also undergo concurrent radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33,
           and 36-40. Patients who did not undergo prior gross total resection also undergo boost
           radiotherapy once daily on days 43-47.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Four weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
           receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and oral lomustine on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 42 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
