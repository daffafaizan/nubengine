    
      Patients performing endoscopy procedures under sedation at the gastro clinic will be
      monitored by SafeSed in addition to being monitored by capnography, used by an anaesthetist.
      All patients will be monitored using the same two techniques (SafeSed and Capnography). No
      clinical decisions will be made based upon the data generated by the SafeSed system.

      The data from all sources will be compared (post factum) to validate SafeSed performance.

      The data collected on the SafeSed prototype will not be used for treatment of the patient.

      The comparative analysis will be free vto be used by the sponsor.
