      percentage of individuals undergoing surgery and anesthesia will experience a postoperative
      decline in mental abilities. These cognitive changes can range from postoperative delirium to
      more subtle and longer lasting (weeks to months) impairments; these latter changes are often
      referred to in the literature as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). While the
      precise causes of POCD remain nebulous, a clear epidemiological risk factor is advanced age -
      a demographic group that accounts for an increasing percentage of elective surgeries in North
      America. Several RCTs have attempted to link specific aspects of anesthesia, such as depth of
      anesthesia, regional vs general anesthesia, hemodynamic parameters, specific anesthetic
      agents, etc., to the risk of developing POCD in both the elderly and general populations.
      Results have often been conflicting and, based on current evidence, it is difficult to
      identify any specific anesthetic strategy that clearly reduces the risk of POCD. The present
      study aims to establish the incidence and neuropsychological characteristics of POCD in the
      investigator's local patient population as well as to establish the feasibility of pre- and
      postoperative cognitive testing with assessment tools adapted to and validated for Quebec
      francophones in order to lay the groundwork for future studies by the research group of
      interventions targeting specific anesthetic techniques and monitoring modalities.
