      immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies. Confirming the diagnosis is
      rarely accomplished as invasive procedures are impaired by neutropenia and low platelet
      count. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures or galactomannan (GM) regularly yield negative
      results thus suggesting the need for improving diagnostic tools. Therefore the performance of
      an established Aspergillus-specific nested PCR assay in CSF samples of immunocompromised
      patients with suspicion of CNS IA will be evaluated.
