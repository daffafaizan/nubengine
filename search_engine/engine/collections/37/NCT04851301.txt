      acute) pain. An approach to pain management utilizing VR presents opportunities for reducing
      pain and suffering by using immersive, aesthetic, and multisensory stimulation. Investigator
      will analyze the behavioral and neural mechanisms of active VR against sham VR as two methods
      that investigate descending pain modulation. Thus, the central hypothesis is that those who
      respond to placebos will likely respond to active VR. If VR-induced analgesia depends upon
      the release of endogenous opioids.

      In this project, the investigators will determine the effects of VR at the neural and
      clinical levels directly for TMD participants, inviting participants from an existing Colloca
      Lab-based cohort phenotyped for diagnosis, grade, and low/high impact pain profiles and
      prospective TMD participants in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. These
      participants have agreed to be recontacted for further research. Investigator will determine
      the role of the opioid tone (AIM1). In Aim 1, the investigators will determine the role of
      the endogenous opioid tone for VR-induced hypoalgesia in TMD participants using VR, tonic
      painful stimuli, and naloxone given intranasally with established mu-opioid receptor
      occupancy to determine how the opioid tone shapes VR-induced hypoalgesia.
