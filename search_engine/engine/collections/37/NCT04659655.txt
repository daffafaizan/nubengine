    
      This study is a clinical, single-center pilot-study to evaluate safety and performance. 30
      Patients (n=20 aortic valve replacement/ n=10 mitral valve replacement) with aortic and
      mitral valve pathology, highly likely for prosthetic valve replacement, who are planned for
      surgery at the Vienna General Hospital (AKH) will be included in this study with respect to
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will undergo aortic or prosthetic mitral
      valve replacement using a specified automated annular suturing system for placement of the
      annular pledgeted sutures.
