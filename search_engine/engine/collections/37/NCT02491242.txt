      patients continue to need new antiretroviral strategies, such as dual therapies, because of
      different end-organ involvement (kidney, bone, cardiovascular..), intolerance or toxicity. To
      date, only a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen was able to permit the use of dual
      therapies (two antiretrovirals), especially in case of patients with history of virological
      failure to other regimens. However, the recent license of Dolutegravir, a integrase inhibitor
      with high genetic barrier, could help to clinicians to manage patients with intolerance or
      toxicity to nucleoside analogues without putting in risk virological suppression.
