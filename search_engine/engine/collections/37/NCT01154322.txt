      of the upper airway during sleep. Features of OSA include snoring to upper airway resistance,
      which could be mild to severe. While OSA has been studied extensively in an adult population,
      research indicates that OSA is prevalent in a pediatric population as well, though the
      options for treatment are not as varied as that for the adult population. The study seeks to
      determine if a mask made for a pediatric population effectively treats their OSA.
