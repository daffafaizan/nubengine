      at Skjold Garrison will be enrolled in a 9-day, randomized controlled study. Using dietary
      analysis, body composition assessments, stable isotope methodologies, basic biochemical
      techniques, and measures of physiological strain, the effects of supplemental energy in the
      form of carbohydrate and protein on indices of muscle mass and physiological status will be
      assessed.

      We hypothesize that consuming supplemental energy will attenuate the effects of severe energy
      deficit on inflammation, androgenic hormones, and whole-body protein retention, thereby
      protecting skeletal muscle mass. We expect that consuming PRO will promote a more favorable
      recovery than consuming CHO, as indicated by measures of increased whole-body protein
      synthesis and greater conservation of skeletal muscle mass.
