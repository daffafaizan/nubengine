    
      In this prospective randomized study, the cases whose fetal weight predicted by
      ultrasonography (USG) between the 28th and 37th weeks of gestation are below 10percentile
      according to the World Health Organization (WHO) normograms. The cases will be divided into
      two groups as group 1:weekly and group 2:bi-weekly (twice-weekly) The cases will be evaluated
      by fetal Doppler, amniotic fluid volume, nonstress test (NST) and maternal preeclampsia
      tests.Maternal severe hypertension/preeclampsia, category 3 NST, oligohydramnios (after 37
      weeks amniotic fluid index <5; after 34 weeks single deepest pocket <2 cm) ,pathological
      doppler (before 34 weeks reverse flow in an umbilical artery , after 34 weeks absent
      end-diastolic flow in an umbilical artery) in cases of birth decision will be taken. Cases
      without the above mentioned complications will be delivered between 38 weeks 3 days and 39
      weeks.
