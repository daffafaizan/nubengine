      Stroke is the third leading cause of global death, the leading cause of acquired disability
      and contributes substantially to dementia, cognitive decline, and healthcare costs. Global
      epidemiological studies such as INTERSTROKE and the Global Burden of Disease study estimated
      that hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke, with a population
      attributable risk of approximately 50%. Recurrent vascular events (stroke, coronary events,
      vascular death) cause significant morbidity in ischaemic stroke survivors, affecting
      approximately 30% at 5 years. Blood-pressure reduction is a proven, inexpensive strategy to
      prevent stroke with benefits widely-generalizable in developed and developing countries. No
      randomised trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of SBP reduction to prevent
      secondary vascular events after ischaemic stroke to levels of about 120mmHg compared with
      130-139mmHg. Consequently, most guidelines recommend reduction of systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) less than 140mmHg.

      Aim:

      The aim is to conduct an initial pilot randomised trial in Ireland and 7 leading European
      centres involved in the European Stroke Organisation Trials Alliance. This feasibility study
      will assess key design aspects and establish trial governance, data management, and
      procedures in preparation for a larger definitive trial.

      Methods:

      Design: Prospective, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed (PROBE) randomised, parallel-group
      pilot trial, comparing safety, efficacy, and other feasibility measures of two target SBP
      goals (intervention 115-125 mmHg, control 130-139 mmHg).
