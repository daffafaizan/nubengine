      (A) group or non-acupuncture (NA) group. In both groups, sitz markers were inserted in
      duodenum or jejunum during surgery for detection of postoperative remnant sitz markers by
      Xray. In the A group, acupuncture treatment was given once daily for up to 5 consecutive days
      starting on postoperative day 1. The acupuncture points which were used were based on
      traditional Korean medicine. No acupuncture treatment was performed in the NA group.
