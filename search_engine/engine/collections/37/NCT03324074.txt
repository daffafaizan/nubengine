      To evaluate the motor activity of pyloric sphincter using Endo FLIP in the form of pressure,
      diameter, cross-sectional area (CSA) and distensibility in the healthy volunteers.

      Methods 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited by local advertising, hospital staff and
      hospitalised patient's relatives. They will be screened for evidence of organic or functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, if found to have any will be excluded. Subjects on any medication
      that is known to affect gastrointestinal function will be excluded.

      EndoFLIP method

      The subjects will be fasting for at least 8 hours prior to the study. The study will be
      performed under sedation using monitored anesthesia using propofol in the left lateral
      decubitus position. Initial endoscopic examination will be performed up to the antrum without
      traversing the pylorus using (160 Olympus).An EndoFLIP catheter will be passed through biopsy
      channel into pylorus under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic visualization.

      Pylorus will be assessed using EndoFLIP at 20, 30, 40 and 50 cc balloon volume distentions.
      Pressure will be measured by pressure transducer inside the balloon. CSA will be measured
      using impedance planimetry by Ohm's Law. Distensibility will be calculated as minimum CSA
      divided by pressure at each balloon fill volume. These measurement will be assessed after the
      balloon inflated at each balloon distension for minimum of 5 seconds. The length of the
      pylorus will be assessed visually from EndoFLIP images. Once the EndoFLIP measurements
      completed at rest, Injection hyoscine 10mg intravascular will be administered, and same
      measurements will be repeated. Thereafter remaining endoscopic exam will be completed.

      This is an observational study with no intervention.
