      including the risk of developing Atrial Fibrillation (AF), one of the most commonly diagnosed
      types of arrhythmias. Paradoxically, despite the cardioprotective effects of exercise, middle
      aged endurance athletes are at 5 fold risk of developing AF compared to active individuals.
      Long standing endurance training induces significant changes to the heart- collectively known
      as the 'athlete's heart.' While these changes may be beneficial for performance, they may be
      conducive in promoting the risk of AF in this cohort. The aim of this study is to compare
      cardiac structure and function in endurance athletes diagnosed with AF (n=17) and in healthy
      aged matched endurance athletes (n=17). Male subjects between ages 45 and 65 years old with a
      long-standing history of endurance training and competition will be recruited. Heart
      structure and function will be compared at rest and during submaximal exercise. Participants
      will also complete fitness assessments and questionnaires that characterize their lifetime
      involvement in exercise training. This study will address the gap in the literature regarding
      the interaction of endurance training and AF risk.
