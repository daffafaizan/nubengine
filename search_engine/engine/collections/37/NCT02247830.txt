      of cream based urea three times a day, concomitant radiotherapy, would present the following
      hypotheses:

        -  Null: equal incidence and severity of radiodermatitis when compared to the control group
           (usual care);

        -  Alternative 1: low incidence and severity of radiodermatitis when compared to patients
           who comprised the control group (usual care).

        -  Alternative 2: lower incidence and severity of radiodermatitis between the experimental
           groups (urea and chamomile).
