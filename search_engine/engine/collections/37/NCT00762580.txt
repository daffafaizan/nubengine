      increasing with age. While most people remain asymptomatic, it is unknown why some develop
      symptoms. In symptomatic patients, surgical repair of a torn rotator cuff fails in 30-50% of
      patients, yet the majority of patients have a significant reduction pain despite failure of
      the repair. Nonoperative treatment has reported successful outcomes in 25-82% of patients yet
      it is not known which patient-related features predict success with nonoperative treatment.
      The general aim of this research effort is to identify patient features (historical
      information, physical examination findings, and MRI-based pathology) that would predict
      success (defined by reduction in visual analog pain scale, and patient satisfaction) with the
      nonoperative treatment of rotator cuff tears. The proposed study design is a prospective
      cohort study of patients with rotator cuff tears who will follow a standard physical therapy
      program derived from an evidence based medicine (EBM) systematic review of Level 1 and Level
      2 studies.

      Study the effect of historical information on predicting success (as determined by pain
      relief and patient satisfaction) of nonoperative treatment using the EBM based physical
      therapy program in treating patients with rotator cuff tears.

      Study the effect of physical examination findings on predicting success of a nonoperative
      treatment using the EBM-based physical therapy program in treating patients with rotator cuff
      tears.

      Study the effect of the severity of the rotator cuff pathology (using standardized magnetic
      resonance imaging protocols) on predicting success of nonoperative treatment for patients
      with rotator cuff tears using the EBM-based physical therapy program.
