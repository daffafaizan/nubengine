      the clear lifesaving effects of Impella and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (VA ECMO), serious adverse hematological events such as bleeding and thrombosis create
      substantial morbidity and mortality and remain major barriers for further expansion of this
      technology. In particular, thrombosis is a devastating adverse event during CF pump support
      as it can lead to stroke, device stoppage, and hemodynamic collapse. Although the annual
      incidence of pump thrombosis has been reported to range from 8 to nearly 30%, the
      pathobiological mechanisms of thrombus formation during CF pump support with ongoing
      anticoagulation remain elusive. Our preliminary data associates hemolysis, which is inherent
      to such devices due to high shear stress, with subsequent formation of thrombosis and stroke,
      possibly through increasing platelet activation and aggregation. Our prelim data and drawing
      from a body of literature from diseases of intravascular hemolysis such as sickle cell anemia
      suggest that free hemoglobin released during hemolysis, which reduces NO levels, may be
      activating platelets. In retrospective analysis, we have noted a significant reduction in
      mean platelet volume (potential in-vivo marker of platelet activation), thrombosis and stroke
      with concurrent sildenafil administration. However, this mechanism and efficacy of NO
      signaling enhancers such as sildenafil remains to be proven during CF pump support.

      Aim: To conduct a randomized placebo controlled study to test the hypothesis that platelet
      activation and aggregation, endothelial dysfunction and pro-thrombotic inflammation during
      ongoing low level hemolysis in outpatients on chronic CF pump support can be reduced by
      sildenafil.
