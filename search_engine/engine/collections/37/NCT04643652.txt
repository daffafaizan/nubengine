      The introduction is done by a stepped wedge cluster randomized design. The study will be
      carried out in seven units of the department of intensive care medicine of the Radboud
      University Medical Center, a 950-bed university hospital in the Netherlands. The study focus
      on health care providers in the ICU.The research consists of the introduction of an
      intervention bundle to reduce noise and therefore interruptions during their daily work
      activities.

      Inclusion:

      All health care providers present at the ICU, during the study period (about 350) are asked
      to participate. They will recieve information about the aim, content and relevance of the
      study and will be asked for participation.They are free to refuse to participate in the study
      (e.g. part of observations, survey).

      Methods:

      The data collection focuses on quantitative noise measurements at the predetermined locations
      in ICU units during the study period. In addition, during the entire study period (control
      and intervention), we analyse the amount and type of alarms. Thirdly, we collect data with
      regard to disruptions during the daily work process of healthcare professionals (e.g. during
      "high-risk moments", such as: medication preparation) by observations.

      Finally, health care providers are asked about their perceived emotional impact e.g.
      annoyance, as a result of ambient noise (questionaires). Items in the questionnaires are e.g:
      degree of annoyance as a result of alarms, conversation, equipment, pagers/telefoons.

      Data analysis will be supported with the use of Phyton and MatLab.
