    
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the feasibility to detect hemodynamic changes
      induced by supra-ventricular or ventricular tachycardia (SVT or VT) using tissue perfusion.
      Patients with a standard indication for either an electrophysiological study or an
      implantable cardioverter defibrillators(ICD) implant can be included into this study. Tissue
      perfusion and arterial blood pressure will be monitored and recorded throughout the
      electrophysiological procedure or ICD implant testing.

      The study will be conducted in two consecutive phases. After completion of study phase I the
      study phase II will commence. Study phase I will be an acute non-invasive study in patients
      with an indication for an electrophysiological study, in whom tissue perfusion will be
      measured non-invasively with an epi-cutaneous tissue perfusion sensor. Phase II will be an
      acute invasive study in patients with an indication for the implantation of an ICD, in whom
      the tissue perfusion sensor will be placed in the surgically prepared device pocket on the
      muscular pectoralis or between the muscular pectoralis major and muscular pectoralis minor.
