      million chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers worldwide Therefore, early recognition and
      effective management of the disease can modify its natural history

      . There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that treatment will help reduce liver
      inflammation, may reverse liver damage (scarring),slow down disease progression and improve
      symptoms and quality of life. All of these factors are important reasons to seek HCV medical
      treatment Identifying host-viral factors that predict the likelihood of SVR prior to
      initiating therapy would be a very useful clinical tool that could help reduce costs and
      avoid unnecessary exposure to therapy with significant side effects Little is known about
      predictors of failure to achieve SVR with DAAs. Although numerous clinical parameters
      predicted poor response to pegylated IFN treatment , none of them have been shown to be
      associated with virological relapse after DAA based therapy

      Treatment response terms:

      The ultra rapid virological response (uRVR) is a new endpoint that we defined as an
      undetectable serum HCV RNA at the end of 1st week of therapy.

      The very rapid virologic response( vRVR )defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA level at week
      2.

      The rapid virological response (RVR) defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA after 4 weeks of
      treatment sustained virological response (SVR), which is defined by the undetectable serum
      HCV RNA 12-24 weeks after the end of treatment Relapser was defined as undetectable viral
      load at the end of DAA treatment but subsequent detectable viral load at 12 weeks after
      treatment end.
