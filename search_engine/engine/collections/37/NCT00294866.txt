      C-reactive Protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are excellent biomarkers for inflammation,
      and high levels are predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this population.
      Both uremia and the dialysis process itself contribute to this inflammatory state. It is our
      hypothesis that paricalcitol therapy decreases the biomarkers of inflammation which may have
      implications for future studies of morbidity and mortality in this population.
