      children aged 3-6 years, visiting a preschool, and the prevention of clinical ADHD symptoms.
      The 3-6 years old children will be identified by a combined parent and teacher rating
      ADHD-symptoms questionnaire (FBB-ADHS-V). Children with ADHD symptoms >90th percentile will
      participate in a following diagnostic process. The children (n = 150) will be randomised
      doubleblind to a control group (taking every day four capsules Equazen eye q, containing 400
      mg fish oil and 100mg evening primrose oil - EPA (372mg), DHA (116mg), GLA (40mg) and vitamin
      E (7.2 mg) ) or placebo group. The study is divided into two phases with four months each.
      After unblinding after the first phase pre-school children taking placebo receive
      Omega-3/Omega-6 Fatty Acids. Children (n = 75) taking verum during first four months will be
      randomised doubleblind to verum or placebo. In this way the progress of the behaviour
      symptoms will be evaluated after a significant period of time (eigth months). Clinical
      examination (questionnaires, intelligence test, medical examination) and evaluation of ADHD
      symptoms through parents and teachers with several questionnaires will be used before
      beginning, after four months and after eight months. In addition the pre-school children will
      be taken a blood sample (finger prick test) to measure the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids
      levels. Additionally regular phone calls will be implemented. Medical examinations and
      meetings will taken place if required. If symptoms increase, children will be treated medical
      and/ or psychotherapeutically.
