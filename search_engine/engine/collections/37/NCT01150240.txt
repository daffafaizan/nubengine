      immunodeficiencies (PID) in order to improve diagnosis, classification, prognosis and
      therapy. The online technology offers features not available in former databases such as
      access control,security functionality, and maintenance of data integrity during transactions
      and system errors, online back up, online optimization, scalability and online SQL-queries as
      well as a long term documentation of patients.

      Furthermore the database can be used for the submission and storage of molecular diagnostic
      results and thus allow the compilation of genotype and phenotype observations, which is of
      essential and immediate use for the patient himself and patient care. An attending physician
      may gain information on similar cases of a rare PID disease in Switzerland and European
      countries and use these insights for therapy. In addition, it will be possible to obtain an
      insight on side effects. Thus, the system also meets the requirements of an optimal platform
      for Phase IV studies of post-licensing drug surveillance-programs.
