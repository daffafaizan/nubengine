      to the hospital with lower GI bleeding improves their outcome.

      Patients who are admitted with bleeding from their rectum and clinical evidence of a
      significant bleeding episode (elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, or need for blood
      transfusion) have immediate upper endoscopy (examination of the stomach with a flexible
      rubber tube with a light and video camera on the end). If this shows no source of bleeding,
      the patients are randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive a colonsoscopy (examination of
      the large intestine with a flexible rubber tube with a light and video camera on the end)
      either as a emergency (within 12 hours) or as a routine procedure (36 hours after admission).

      Patients are followed during their hospitalization to see if they have further bleeding, if
      they require blood transfusions, if they need other diagnostic tests, if they need surgery or
      other treatments, and how long they stay in the hospital.
