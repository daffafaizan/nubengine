      HF should be offered a 7-day post-discharge outpatient clinic visit as a way to increase
      engagement with care and reduce risk of poor outcomes. Unfortunately no-show rates for the
      7-day post-discharge outpatient visit in this population are high, suggesting poor
      engagement. The investigators have previously observed a 76% no-show rate at the Cleveland
      Clinic Main Campus. This study is to evaluate whether use of 7-day post-discharge virtual
      visit versus in-person visit can improve adherence with post-discharge appointment.
