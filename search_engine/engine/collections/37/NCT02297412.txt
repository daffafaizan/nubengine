      I. To estimate whether minocycline hydrochloride (minocycline) can alleviate
      paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.

      II. To estimate whether minocycline can alleviate paclitaxel acute pain syndrome (P-APS).

      III. To examine the possible relative toxicities related to minocycline therapy in this study
      situation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive minocycline hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 7 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive a placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 7 days for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up every month for 6 months.
