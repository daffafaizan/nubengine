      travel. Hypobaric chamber exposure is the ideal test but is not widely available. In clinical
      practice, the HAST has been recommended as the preferable test for pre-flight evaluation, and
      is used with increasing frequency. The oxygen dose during air travel has been recommended
      titrated during HAST. In the study, supplemental oxygen titration during hypobaric chamber
      exposure is compared to oxygen titration during HAST, to evaluate if HAST can be used with
      confidence to titrate the amount of supplemental oxygen needed during air travel.
