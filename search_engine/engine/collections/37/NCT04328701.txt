      cognitive-behavioral treatment to determine the feasibility of this intervention and its
      potential benefits. The study includes 6 total contacts, 1 visit before surgery and 3 after
      surgery, and 2 phone calls. The last visit will be about 6 months after surgery. The study
      includes evaluation of peoples' pain, physical functioning, medication use, and physiological
      responses to sensory stimuli such as heat and cold. The research takes place at the Brigham &
      Women's Pain Management Center, 850 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill.
