      assisting in clinical diagnosis for muscle, tendon and ligament injuries, providing direct
      guidance for joint injections, or assessing the adequacy of a reduction in the emergency
      department. However, proficiency in sonography is not a requirement for certification in
      orthopedic surgery in Canada, and orthopedic trainees are rarely exposed to the subject. This
      project aims assess the usefulness in clinical education of a newly implemented MSK-US course
      in an orthopedic surgery program.

      An MSK-US course for orthopedic surgery residents has been developed. An online survey
      covering the level of training of the resident, their prior experience with ultrasound
      (number of times used by month) and their comfort level with different parts of the
      examination (numeric analog scale - NAS), was filled by the participants prior to the course.
      A pre-course written and practical test was also given to the residents. Following the
      course, the participants were reassessed with the same tests and surveys on the same day as
      the course, and at 6 months post. Change in frequency of use, comfort level and test scores
      were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and post-hoc Wilcoxon tests.

      It was expected that residents' frequency of use, comfort level and tests scores would
      improve following the implementation of the course. The results were expected to be
      maintained at the 6 months endpoint.
