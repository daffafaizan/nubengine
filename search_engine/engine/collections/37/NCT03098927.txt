      platform. Hypothesize that this will enhance the cortical signals necessary for operating a
      non-invasive EEG-based BCI. Specifically, designed training paradigms will activate "mirror
      neurons" associated with performance of movement, observation of movement, and motor imagery.
      Mirror neuron network (MNN) activation induces cortical plasticity, and may therefore enhance
      cortical signals generated during BCI use. Plan to assess the effect of training paradigm on
      cortical signals generated during motor imagery, using EEG. Also, investigate
      neuropsychological factors that play a role in a subject's ability to generate vivid motor
      imagery.

      Eight subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) will be recruited during the sub-acute phase
      (3-6 months following injury). Four participants will immediately undergo motor imagery
      training in an immersive virtual reality environment at NASA. EEG assessments and motor
      function testing will be performed at intervals during the 3-4 week motor imagery training
      period to assess improvement in cortical signature generation and motor recovery. The other
      four participants will undergo the same protocol after a 6 week delay, in order to assess the
      effect of training timing after injury in both cortical signature generation and motor
      function recovery.
