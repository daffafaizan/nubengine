      known to be involved in executive functioning and cognition using 18F-FTC-146 PET. We will
      then compare S1R density in areas ROIs not involved in executive functioning and
      cognition.This will provide a framework for predicting functional impairment based on
      brain-behavior relationships.

      The study has two aims. The first aim is to evaluate the reliability of 18F-FTC-146 brain
      uptake in healthy controls under test and retest conditions to establish a baseline measure
      of S1R density and quantify regional brain uptake of radiotracer in five healthy adults. The
      second aim is to characterize S1R density in brains of young adult males with FXS which will
      then be compared to healthy volunteers.

      This would be the very first PET study to image sigma-1 receptor density in participants with
      fragile X syndrome, thereby testing whether altered receptor density is present in brain in
      fragile X syndrome patients when compared to healthy volunteers. If confirmed, the current
      study would provide compelling clinical-translational support for an important
      pathophysiological mechanism of cognition and executive function. The current study has
      considerable potential for advancing the neurobiological understanding of fragile X syndrome
      in humans.
