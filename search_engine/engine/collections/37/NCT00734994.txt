      chemotherapeutic agent, drug uptake and intracellular distribution of drug within malignant
      cells is improved due to increased cellular permeability. Further, hyperthermia inhibits
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair as a result of increased reaction between DNA and
      chemotherapy. By heating bladder tissue and accelerating the necessary series of reactions to
      link agents such as mitomycin C to cell DNA, this effect may be optimized. Depending on the
      extent of resection (and location, size, and depth of invasion of remaining tumor) after
      transurethral resection of the bladder tumor(TURBT), recommended adjuvant therapy consists of
      intravesical chemotherapy. MMC has been studied at doses as high as 80 mg without producing
      significant or irreversible side effects. The most commonly used dose of mitomycin is 40 mg.2

      This pilot study proposes to use Mitomycin C at a dose of 40 mg in conjunction with deep
      hyperthermia to enhance the effect intravesical chemotherapy as second-line treatment of
      recurrent TCC (Stage Ta, T1, or Tis) of the bladder after surgical resection and standard
      adjuvant therapy.
