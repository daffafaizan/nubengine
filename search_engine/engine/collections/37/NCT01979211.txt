    
      This is a Phase II trial to characterize the feasibility of treating patients with locally
      advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck with post-operative
      radiotherapy and cetuximab. Cetuximab has previously been given safely in conjunction with
      head and neck radiotherapy for mucosal squamous cell carcinoma in multiple phase III trials,
      and so Phase I data is not necessary here.
