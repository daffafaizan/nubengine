      pneumothorax that has been treated. Treatment for pneumothorax may consist of high-flow
      oxygen therapy in the case of very small or "occult" pneumothorax, or tube thoracostomy
      ("chest tube") in the case of larger pneumothorax. Treatment for pneumothorax will be at the
      discretion of the attending trauma surgeon. Once the pneumothorax has radiographically
      resolved, the chest tube, if used, has been removed, and prior to discharge from the
      hospital, subjects will undergo a two hour stay in a hypobaric chamber. In the first phase of
      the study, they will undergo a two hour stay in a hypobaric chamber at a barometric pressure
      of 565mm Hg, simulating the change in pressure from Salt Lake City to a cruising airliner. If
      subjects in the first phase do not suffer any adverse events, the investigators will proceed
      with the second phase. In the second phase of the study, subjects will undergo a two hour
      stay in the hypobaric chamber at a barometric pressure of 471mm Hg, simulating the change in
      pressure from sea level to a cruising airliner. Prior to the hypobaric exposure, and at the
      conclusion of the two hours under hypobaric conditions, single view chest radiographs will be
      performed.
