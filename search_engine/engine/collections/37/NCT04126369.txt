      related to psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety and depression). The management of these
      comorbidities is therefore essential in patients with drug resistant epilepsy, Ideally
      through non-drug management to minimize the side effects of molecules.

      The goal of mindfulness interventions in pathology is to learn to better live with a chronic
      disease by reducing the stress resulting from the disease, by increasing benevolence towards
      oneself, the acceptance of the disease and reducing the ruminations linked with the
      pathology.

      Mindfulness therefore seems to be a good way for these patients to improve the management of
      their emotions and thus improve their quality of life what the investigators propose to
      evaluate in this study.

      The study consists of two phases

        1. First phase: comparative randomized study (primary endpoint):

             1. After inclusion, a 2 months baseline follow-up is carry to collect the judgement
                criteria without intervention.

             2. At the end of this period, patients will be randomly assigned to the mindfulness
                intervention group or the control group with the psycho educative programme. Both
                programmes will takes 3 months.

             3. Then a 6-months post-intervention follow-up period for both groups

           Patients will have assessment visits every 3 months. They will also complete a daily
           notebook including the number of seizures they have done and a scale of their "interior
           weather".

        2. Second phase (optional):

      At the end of the first phase, patients in the control group will be able to benefit from the
      mindfulness programme and will be followed at the end of the programme for 6 months.
