      individualized care across different levels of service providers, from primary care to the
      specialist health care services. Among the known threats to a prolonged remission are
      negative emotional states because they can trigger the urge to use drugs. An integrative
      approach is warranted aimed to address the physiological, psychological and social aspects of
      the disorder during the rehabilitation period.

      Patients with a SUD diagnosis in an outpatient clinic will be randomized to either 1) 20
      sessions of symptom-based NF training in conjunction with traditional therapy or 2)
      conventional counseling. The primary outcome is QoL at the end of treatment and at a 3 and 12
      month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include alcohol and drug use, mental distress,
      sleep quality and cognitive function. The optimal quantity of the intervention will be
      assessed with a cost-benefit approach.

      The proposed study will provide new knowledge about how NF can be best utilized in SUD
      treatment, potentially improving QoL and relapse rates.
