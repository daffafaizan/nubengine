    
      This exploratory Phase II study has been designed to examine the safety and tolerability
      profile, and to compare the activity of the novel V1a vasopressin antagonist (SRX246) against
      placebo, in adults with DSM-5 Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED).

      Adult Male and Female subjects with a current DSM-5 diagnosis of IED will be enrolled. All
      subjects will undergo systematic diagnostic assessment for DSM-5 Axis I and II disorders.
      Subjects with DSM-5 IED (without current, co-morbid, DSM-5 Major Depression) whose: (a) Life
      History of Aggression (LHA) score is > 12, (b) Overt Aggression Scale Modified (OAS-M)
      "Irritability" score is > 6 and, (c) screening OAS-M "Aggression" score is > 15, will be
      entered into a two-week baseline lead-in phase.

      After the lead-in phase, study subjects who continue to meet OAS-M criteria will be
      randomized to one of the two (2) treatment conditions and stratified by gender so that equal
      numbers of males and females are assigned to SRX246 and Placebo Groups. Those who do not meet
      the criteria will exit the protocol at that time. Treatment Conditions: (a) 8-week course of
      SRX246 (4 weeks at 120 mg bid, and 4 weeks at 160 mg bid) or (b) 8-week course of Placebo,
      followed by a one-week "taper" to withdraw subjects from study medication.

      IED subjects in all conditions will have structured diagnostic interview sessions and
      questionnaires administered throughout the trial. Blinding to treatment condition will be
      maintained by using different personnel for these activities. Analysis of a change from
      baseline in the diagnostic measures will be performed.
