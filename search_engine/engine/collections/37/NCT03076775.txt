      There is a fundamental gap in understanding the adverse metabolic effects of antenatal late
      preterm steroids (ALPS). In 2016, an important randomized clinical trial of 2827 late preterm
      pregnancies showed that antenatal betamethasone (BMZ) significantly reduced neonatal
      respiratory complications compared with placebo. However, those neonates exposed to BMZ were
      also more likely to have hypoglycemia at birth. This unexpected adverse outcome raised
      concern among both obstetricians and neonatologists and remains an important knowledge gap to
      be filled. The rationale for the proposed research is that steroid-induced maternal
      hyperglycemia leads to transient fetal hyperinsulinemia, which causes hypoglycemia in
      neonates that are delivered during this time-period. Thus, the fetal metabolic consequences
      and subsequent neonatal hypoglycemia observed after exposure to BMZ in utero can be prevented
      by achieving maternal euglycemia prior to delivery.

      This protocol describes a randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether screening for and
      treatment of steroid-induced hyperglycemia in non-diabetic women treated with BMZ in the late
      preterm period can decrease the rate of fetal hyperinsulinemia, thus reducing neonatal
      hypoglycemia and improving short-term neonatal outcomes.

      This study was formerly approved as Institutional Review Board #16-3200.
