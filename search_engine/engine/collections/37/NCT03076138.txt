      standards for diseases and pathological conditions characterized by maxillofacial bone
      defects and/or alveolar ridge atrophy. Bone grafting procedures as part of the surgical
      treatment will be performed with the use of investigated medical device. The safety and
      efficacy of the implanted gene-activated bone substitute will be evaluated by clinical
      examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, and computer tomography within 6 months after
      surgery.
