      patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear which modality of exercise reports
      better health benefits.

      Aim: To compare the effects of three different modalities of exercise (aerobic, strength,
      aerobic-strength) on psychological and physiological variables in patients with
      schizophrenia.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial
