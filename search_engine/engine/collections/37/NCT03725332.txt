      enrolled mothers (n>200) have reduced relapse, increased treatment compliance, and improved
      neonatal outcomes when compared to non-enrolled OUD mothers. However, at this
      time,UK-PATHways is only available at our main healthcare campus in Lexington, KY. Many
      eligible patients reside great distances from our clinical home and some current patients
      travel hours to access this valuable resource. While Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) has
      become increasingly available in our region, many of the components of the UK-PATHways
      program are not readily accessible in rural Central and Eastern Kentucky and the quality of
      programming with MAT treatment is not standardized in these locations. Furthermore, rural
      patients continue to face challenges related to stigma of their OUD and transportation
      difficulties if they desire more comprehensive services. The proposed study will evaluate the
      introduction of essential components of the UK-PATHways program into rural communities, and
      identify the optimal intervention strategies for expansion of services and to improve the
      treatment of OUD for rural patients. Specific aims include the following: Aim 1) Conduct a
      randomized cluster trial using a 'hub and spoke' study design, comparing two delivery modes
      (local GROUP care vs TELEMEDICINE) for the delivery of a PATHways based patient education
      curriculum at participating rural regional sites. Each regional site will be randomized to
      support one of two study arms: 1) Prenatal group care led by a Perinatal Nurse Facilitator
      and Peer Support Specialist (GROUP arm); or, 2) Telemedicine consultation with substance
      abuse counselors, perinatal nurse educators, and/or Peer Health Specialists based at the
      'hub' site (TELEMEDICINE arm); and Aim 2) Evaluate the relative effectiveness of each study
      arm on primary and secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes as compared to the established
      PATHways program (UK-PATHways: Hub) at the University of Kentucky.
