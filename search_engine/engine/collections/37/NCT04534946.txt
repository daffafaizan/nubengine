      help the patient and the health care providers keep a tab on what is working to help manage
      OAB symptoms. Tracking urination patterns can actually help patients normalize their bladder
      problems. By focusing on certain behaviors and habits that contribute to their OAB and
      changing those behaviors, patients can effectively control OAB symptoms. The Oabi mobile
      application has been created with the goal of helping patients learn more about their
      day-to-day symptoms as well as track and self-manage their symptoms. Additionally, the Oabi
      app connects patients with their HCP via a clinician portal to boost communication, and
      encourage patient-provider interaction. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the
      usability and acceptability of the Oabi mobile app.
