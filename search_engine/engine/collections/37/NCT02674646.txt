      in patients undergoing irradiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy (RCHT). Patients
      suffering from these symptoms are constricted severely in their daily life and their quality
      of life (QOL) is often reduced. As examined several times, acupuncture can cause an
      amelioration of these specific disorders. Especially for pain symptoms several groups have
      shown efficacy of acupuncture. To what extent a difference between traditional acupuncture
      (verum-acupuncture) and false acupuncture (sham-acupuncture) can cause reduction of side
      effects and improvement of QOL is not clarified. Therefore, the ROSETTA trial is a randomized
      trial with two treatment arms.

      The verum-group receives "real acupuncture" , while the Sham-group is treated with sham-
      acupuncture points. These points are "nonsense" needlepoints, which do not have any correlate
      in TCM.

      Patients are going to get standardized questionnaires (EORTC QOL C-30) before their first,
      after their fourth and after their last acupuncture treatment. Patients will be questioned
      about their condition by the investigator. The answers will be documented according to the
      standardized scoring system CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events).
