      preliminary efficacy of voruciclib in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies
      and AML after treatment with standard therapy. Escalation to the next higher dose level will
      depend on demonstrated safety and tolerability at each dose level.

      Subjects may continue to receive voruciclib while there is evidence of clinical benefit and
      acceptable toxicity as judged by the investigator.
