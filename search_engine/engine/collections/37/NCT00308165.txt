      because of side effects and delivery limitations. Because they are locally invasive and
      rarely metastasize, malignant gliomas have features that make them uniquely amenable to new
      strategies of regional drug delivery. Intracerebral clysis (convection-enhanced delivery) is
      a novel drug delivery strategy that uses a microinfusion pump to establish a pressure
      gradient in the brain via implanted catheters. The pressure gradient produces convective
      forces that distribute a therapeutic agent throughout the tumor and surrounding brain tissue.

      Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods of monitoring drug distribution and
      treatment response have been developed to maximize the clinical applications and minimize
      complications associated with treatment risks.

      Study participants will be taken to the operating room to have 2 catheters surgically placed
      into their tumor and surrounding tumor bed. These catheters will then be connected to small
      infusion pumps which will slowly infuse topotecan continuously over 4-5 days. Patients will
      have daily MRI scans while in the hospital. Upon completion of the experimental treatment,
      patients will be discharged and will be followed up in the outpatient clinic.
