      trauma centres, already providing endovascular service for the management of critical limb
      ischaemia (CLI).

      Recent campaigns have shown little is done to improve flow to the lower limbs (legs) of
      patients to avoid amputation rates. During this time many devises have been used and
      available on the market. The 'Indigo' system by Penumbra was originally designed from the
      acute stroke system "ACE". Similar principles were applied in designing the 'Indigo' system.
      This is currently being used in many centres to manage acute clot causing lower limb
      ischaemia, however no official registry or international clinical trial has been done to show
      its significance in managing this disease.

      The investigator groups, have created this to come up with enough data to evaluate the Indigo
      system in the management of (ALI) and offer tips and tricks to other clinicians. The aim is
      for a single arm, multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients in whom (ALI) was performed
      with the Penumbra/Indigo System (study device), and gather greater data and information than
      the PRISM trial in 2013-2014 which obtained only 79 patients.
