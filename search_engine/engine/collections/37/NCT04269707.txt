    
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, multi-national, non-randomized study that
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one course treatment with FCM in participants who
      had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron in study 1VIT17044.

      Subjects will have an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Day 35) from the 1VIT17044 study to qualify
      for entry. Subjects will then be screened, meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria
      and have a baseline evaluation. Based on the successful completion of the baseline
      evaluations, subjects will be enrolled and will receive the first dose of FCM (Day 0). The
      second FCM dose will occur 7 days from the first dose. Subjects will return to the clinic 14
      and 28 days post their first dose for laboratory and safety assessments, and at 35 days post
      the first dose, participants will return to the clinic for final safety and efficacy
      assessments. Once all assessments are complete the participant will exit the study.

      An unsatisfactory response to oral iron (i.e., an increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) of <1 g/dL
      from baseline) will be defined as non-responders to oral iron treatment. Non-responders who
      continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb <11 g/dL) and none of the exclusion
      criteria will receive 1 course of FCM.
