      tool, our study aims to 1) evaluate how many surgical cases have left over tissue amenable to
      homogenization and 2) pilot homogenization across multiple tumour types. The molecular
      profile of the homogenate will be compared to that obtained from the diagnostic specimen
      using next generation sequencing techniques.
