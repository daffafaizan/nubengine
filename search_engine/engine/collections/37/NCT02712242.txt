      by the de-epithelialization of a free gingival graft in both groups. Three different
      hemostatic treatments were randomized; PRF with cyanoacrilate adhesive (PRF group, n:42),
      cyanoacrilate adhesive alone (BC group, n:42) and sterile wet gauze compression (WG group,
      n:41). Immediate and delayed bleeding, pain, epithelialization, feeding habits and sensation
      scores were recorded for different time points.
