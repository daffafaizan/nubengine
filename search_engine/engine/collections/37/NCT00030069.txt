      bone marrow transplantation, none have proven superior to supportive measures alone.
      Preclinical investigations have indicated the potential therapeutic role for vitamin D in the
      treatment of MDS. However, because of the dose-limiting toxicity of hypercalcemia, past
      clinical trials with vitamin D have been forced to utilize low doses, with promising but
      inconsistent results.

      This study utilizes a dosing schema of dexamethasone (Dex) and calcitriol (the active form of
      vitamin D) that augments the therapeutic index of calcitriol, and allows for safe
      administration of 5-10 times higher dose of calcitriol than previously has been used in
      clinical trials for MDS. Patients will receive dexamethasone 4 times per week and calcitriol
      3 times per week. This schedule will continue weekly until patients are off study. The dose
      of calcitriol will be increased until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. History
      and physical examination, blood monitoring, urinary ultrasounds, and bone marrow aspirations
      and biopsies will be used to assess disease response.
