      is exposed to a high concentration of cigarette smoke constituents, we reasoned that airway
      vascular endothelial dysfunction could be present in healthy smokers without systemic
      endothelial dysfunction.

      The purpose of this study was to compare airway and systemic endothelial function and measure
      markers of systemic inflammation in lung-healthy current smokers. Since endothelial
      dysfunction in smokers has been related to systemic inflammation, we also investigated its
      response to an inhaled glucocorticosteroid (ICS).

      Vascular endothelial function was assessed in the airway by the airway blood-flow (Qaw)
      response to inhaled albuterol (ΔQaw) and in the extrapulmonary circulation by brachial
      arterial flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Venous blood was collected for C-reactive protein
      and IL-6.

      Qaw was measured with a noninvasive inhaled soluble gas uptake technique. The uptake of the
      gas from the anatomical deadspace reflecting airways perfused by the airway circulation was
      quantitated.

      Qaw was express as μL/min normalized for anatomical deadspace: μL/min/mL.
