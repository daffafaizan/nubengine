      during parenteral nutrition administration, and these samples were divided into three groups
      according to complications of enrolled patients at sampling time: asymptomatic group, central
      catheter-related blood stream infections group and liver injury group. 7 healthy infants with
      supplementary food were enrolled as control. Fecal microbiota, sIgA and calprotectin, bile
      acids and short chain fatty acids were also detected by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA)
      gene sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and liquid/gas chromatography.
