      and the cavity access and provisional closure of the aperture. The characteristics of both
      interventions will be described in detail in order to homogenize the procedures. The patient
      will be conveniently informed before requesting his/her Informed Consent for his/her
      voluntary participation in the study. Their identification data will be treated in accordance
      with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of
      April 27, 2016, and the Organic Law 3/2018 of 5/12, currently in force, will remain in
      custody at the Center where they receive treatment and will not be shared by the other
      centers of the study.

      The patient will not be aware of the type of procedure he has been assigned for and will
      express in a numerical scale according to his perception of the pain on 4 occasions: before
      starting treatment, at 8-12, 24 and 72 hours after treatment. Likewise, right after receiving
      the treatment, he will answer some questions related to the degree of comfort during the
      treatment and about his perception of the time of the intervention.

      Data sheets will be collected and treated statistically.
