      assessed (Mylius, Borckardt and Lefaucheur, 2012). Further, it is unknown how multichannel
      tDCS acts on tonic cutaneous pain for approximately 24 hours.

      The main objective of these projects are to study and characterize quantitatively the effects
      of multichannel tDCS in the development of prolonged pain.

      It is hypothesized that multichannel tDCS of left M1 resting-state network will reduce the
      severity of experimentally prolonged pain over the m. first dorsal interosseous (FDI), will
      increase descending pain control, might possibly increase pain thresholds and simultaneously
      will modulate the peak-to-peak amplitude of SEPs to electrical painful stimulation. Further,
      it is hypothesized that descending pain modulation of M1 tDCS will be related to interference
      with the suppression of cortical excitability
