    
      This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, repeat-dose Phase 2 study to evaluate the
      degree and duration of action of multiple doses of CAM2038 q1w in blocking the effects of a
      mu opioid agonist (hydromorphone) in patients with moderate or severe opioid use disorder.
      The study will involve 4 phases: Screening, Qualification, Treatment, and Follow-up.

      The study will enroll a sufficient number of subjects to ensure that at least 48 subjects
      complete the study (24 subjects per group with at least 16 females in total). Replacement
      subjects may be added at the discretion of the sponsor with the agreement of the
      investigator.
