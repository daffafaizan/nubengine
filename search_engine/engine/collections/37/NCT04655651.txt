      patients who need surgery is gradually increasing. Elderly people often have comorbidities,
      malnutrition, and other conditions leading to an increased risk of anesthesia. What's more,
      there could be a big difference in the health status of the elderly with the same age.
      Frailty is considered to be highly prevalent with increasing age and to confer high risk for
      adverse outcomes. A complete evaluation of elderly patients before surgery may help improve
      the prognosis. Some studies have found that preoperative frailty assessment and comprehensive
      geriatric assessment (CGA) of the elderly can improve clinical outcomes, but there has been
      no valid assessment established in China. In this study, we plan to use a comprehensive
      preoperative frailty assessment and follow up for 30 days after surgery to explore the effect
      of preoperative frailty on postoperative complications in the elderly after major surgeries.
      To better evaluate the postoperative complications, we choose comprehensive complication
      index (CCI), which integrates all complication of the Clavien-Dindo classification and offers
      a metric approach to measure morbidity.
