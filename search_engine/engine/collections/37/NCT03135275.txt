    
      An investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, two-arm, open-label study of consecutive
      patients presenting with STEMI and MVD in stable hemodynamic conditions, undergoing after
      successful PCI of the culprit lesion either (1:1 randomization) immediate revascularization
      of all additional target lesions during the index procedure or staged PCI of all additional
      target lesions (within 19 to 45 days) using the Boston Scientific Synergy™ stent.

      The goal of this trial is to compare two treatment strategies that are currently performed in
      clinical practice: immediate complete revascularization versus staged complete
      revascularization in patients with STEMI and MVD.

      Patients randomized to immediate complete revascularization will have treated during the
      index procedure, after revascularization of the culprit lesion, all significant non-culprit
      coronary lesions.

      Patients randomized to staged complete revascularization will have treated during the index
      procedure only the culprit lesion, and they will be hospitalized after 19-45 days for
      complete revascularization of all significant non-culprit coronary lesions.

      For both groups, lesion are considered significant when causing a ≥70% diameter stenosis by
      visual estimation in at least two projections on the coronary angiogram.
