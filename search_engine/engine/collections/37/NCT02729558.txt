      single brain metastasis of solid tumors using fractionated local stereotactic radiotherapy,
      whilst maintaining neurological functioning, neurocognition and quality of life. The study is
      performed in the form of a multicenter randomized phase III, with at least three high-volume
      Dutch centers participating in the trial. Stratification will be performed on primary tumor
      type and age. A total of 70 patients will be included. Inclusion is restricted to patients
      who underwent a complete resection of a single brain metastasis, confirmed by an early (i.e.
      within 72 hours) postoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Patients will
      be randomized between observation alone (standard arm) and local stereotactic radiotherapy in
      three fractions of 8 Gy to the surgical cavity (study arm).The main study parameters are:
      local control rate at 6 months (primary outcome measure) and local control rate at 12 months,
      neurological functioning, freedom from clinical neurological progression, performance status,
      quality of life, toxicity, steroid use, neurocognition and overall survival (secondary
      outcome measures). Follow up will be performed at three-monthly interval during the first two
      years, including MRI scans. Quality of life questionaires and neurocognitive functioning
      tests will be performed at fixed intervals during follow-up.
