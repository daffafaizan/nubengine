        -  To determine the proportion of the cell of origin subtypes (germinal center B-cell-like
           [GCB] vs non-GCB) and expression levels of prognostic genes previously identified in
           diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in patient biopsy samples from SWOG trials of
           limited- and advanced-stage DLBCL, and to assess the association between the results and
           progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  To assess the association between these marker results and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue are analyzed for gene expression
      profile by quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA) and immunohistochemical analyses.
      Results are then compared with each patient's progression-free survival and overall survival.
