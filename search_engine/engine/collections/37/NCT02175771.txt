    
      This was a stratified, randomized, open-label, active drug-controlled Phase 3 study.

      Patients who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the
      screening visit completed a 14 day (Â±2 days) pretreatment run in period. During the run-in
      period, patients continued using their current asthma medications (ie, inhaled corticosteroid
      and/or other controller therapies) except for their SABA, which was replaced by the
      sponsor-provided albuterol (salbutamol) hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhaler to be used as needed
      for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during the run in and treatment periods.

      Patients were assigned to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or inhaled
      corticosteroid/long acting beta2 agonist (ICS/LABA) combination therapy and then to a mid- or
      high-treatment strength based on their current asthma maintenance therapy regimen. Patients
      in each strength of the ICS monotherapy cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution
      to either the Fp MDPI or FLOVENT HFA treatment arm. Patients in each strength of the ICS/LABA
      combination cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution to either the FS MDPI or
      ADVAIR DISKUS treatment arm. There was a total of 8 treatment arms following randomization.
