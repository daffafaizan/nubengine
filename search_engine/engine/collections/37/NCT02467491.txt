      participate in a physical activity program using a new technology called Jintronix. Jintronix
      is an easy-to-use virtual physical activity platform designed for physical and occupational
      therapy. It combines common exercise movements, virtual games and motion sensing cameras to
      offer a fun and effective tool for physical activity. The exercises will be performed by each
      participant autonomously in the living room of the residential community following a specific
      schedule. The duration of the exercise program will be of 30 minutes for two days a week for
      a total of four weeks. The participants will be trained prior the beginning of the program in
      order to enter autonomously in the Jintronix platform and perform the exercises.
