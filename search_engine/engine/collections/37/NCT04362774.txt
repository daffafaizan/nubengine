    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label study of the safety and effectiveness of
      ORBERA365™ for use as an adjunct to behavioral modification for obese adults (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2
      and BMI ≤ 50 kg/m2) or for pre-surgical weight reduction in obese and super-obese adults (BMI
      ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities). All study subjects will participate in a
      behavioral modification program for 52 weeks, which will include a low calorie diet as well
      as nutritional and behavior modification counseling. Subjects will have ORBERA365™ placed for
      up to 52 weeks.

      Evaluations while on treatment will be performed at baseline (pre-placement), Day 0
      (ORBERA365 placement) and during monthly clinic visits during the 1st 6 months of device
      therapy and at months 9 and ORBERA365 removal. All subjects will have a final study visit at
      12 months, or study exit, whichever comes first. Device removal will occur at 52 unless
      removed early by subject request and/or physician recommendation. Reasons for early removal
      may include, but are not limited to, adverse events, subject dissatisfaction or achievement
      of weight loss goal.
