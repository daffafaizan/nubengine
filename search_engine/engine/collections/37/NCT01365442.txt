      cause of mortality and morbidity in India. The availability and recent licensure of the
      modified bivalent killed whole cell OCV in India provides hope that the disease may be
      controlled in areas where the disease is a problem. On April 10, 2009, a meeting was
      organized by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the Department of Biotechnology
      and the IVI. The recommendations from the meeting are as follows:

        -  As the modified WC vaccine is safe, effective, and cost-effective, it was suggested that
           the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) should consider
           recommending introduction of the vaccine in public health programs targeted to
           appropriate populations in India.

        -  Vaccination should be initiated in selected highly endemic and/or slum areas such as
           known areas in West Bengal or Orissa. The pilot vaccination programs will be monitored
           and evaluated. Further expansion to other areas and wider policy changes will be made in
           a step-by-step fashion based on the pilot programs. Logistical and operational issues
           need to be defined.

      The aim of the study is to conduct a pilot introduction of the modified killed oral cholera
      vaccine in a public health setting in a population of ~50,000 before implementing in a larger
      scale.

      Primary objective:

      To determine the feasibility, acceptability and costs associated with pilot introduction of
      the modified killed whole cell oral cholera vaccine in India when given in a public health
      setting.

      Secondary objective:

      To identify challenges to mass oral cholera vaccine implementation.
