      nerve, but also involved the visual pathway, including the optic chiasm, optic beam, lateral
      geniculate body, optic radiation and visual cortex. Furthermore, the central nervous system
      changes may be earlier than visual field and the optic nerve morphology change. Tomography
      (OCT), laser polarimetry 0ptical (SLP), evoked potential scanning (VEP) can not accurately
      reflect the central nervous system changes caused by glaucoma.

      In recent years, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), blood oxygen level
      dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI- BOLD) and voxel-based Morphometry（VBM)
      is widely used in clinical practice. The differences in the density and volume of brain
      tissue could be analyzed with VBM which had the advantages of comprehensive, objective and
      repeatable. Studies have indicated that patients with POAG can lead to a wide range of
      changes in the cerebral cortex which are associated with the severity of glaucoma.

      Participants in the study will be assigned to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients or
      healthy volunteers. Two groups will be received 3.0T functional magnetic resonance
      imaging（fMRI) and eye examination including visual acuity, visual field, intraocular
      pressure, anterior chamber angle, corneal thickness and optic nerve fiber thickness. We hope
      this trial will reveal the patterns and structural differences of brain function
      abnormalities between the POAG patents and the normal people. And the same time, the
      correlation between brain gray changes and visual field and retinal nerve fiber layer
      thickness will be analysed.
