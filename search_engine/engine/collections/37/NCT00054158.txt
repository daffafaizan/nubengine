        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with newly diagnosed stage I, II, or III
           multiple myeloma treated with vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and low-dose
           thalidomide.

        -  Determine the ability to collect peripheral blood stem cells in patients after treatment
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive vincristine IV and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 1-4 and oral
      dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. Patients also receive low-dose oral thalidomide
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed until disease progression or bone marrow transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
