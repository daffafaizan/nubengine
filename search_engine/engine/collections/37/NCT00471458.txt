      RAI between 1969 and 2002 in Tampere University Hospital, and among 2611 reference subjects.
      A reference group was randomly selected, with an age- and gender-matched control subject
      identified for each patient from the Population Register Centre. The control subject had to
      be alive at the time when the patient received the first RAI treatment.

      The causes of hospitalization as well as the diagnosis and date of hospital admission were
      obtained from the nationwide Hospital Discharge Register (HILMO) maintained by the Research
      and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) using a computerized record linkage,
      with the personal identification number as the key. The HILMO database covers all dates and
      causes of hospitalization (hospital admission requiring an overnight stay) of the Finnish
      citizens since January 1969. New events were analyzed as the main outcome, including only the
      first hospitalization due to a given indication. The special focus was on the cardiovascular
      morbidity.
