      be PET scans following an alcoholic beverage and following a non-alcoholic beverage.
      Participants will also have a baseline session prior to the scans where they will complete
      various cognitive tasks and questionnaires. During each PET scan, subjective drug effects as
      well as heart rate, blood pressure, blood alcohol content and cortisol levels will be
      collected. The change in PHNO binding potential between the two scan conditions will be the
      primary outcome measure.
