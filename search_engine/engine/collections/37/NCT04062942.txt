      and Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test to measure and classify the disease burden, and to determine
      their relation to already established subjective patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)in
      patients treated with either interlaminar epidural steroid injection (ESI) or transforaminal
      epidural steroid injections (TFESI) for lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). No research
      has so far determined its validity to determine OFI in a cohort of patients managed
      conservatively. We want to use an existing smartphone-applications for the 6WT and TUG test.
      Applying self-measurement of the 6WT within the context of a two center observational study
      will determine OFI in patients before and after (TF)ESI. The results of this study add to the
      understanding of achievable objective outcomes after steroid injection applied to patients
      with DDD.
