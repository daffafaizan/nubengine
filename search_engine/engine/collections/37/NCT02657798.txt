      disease and poorer prognosis after cardiac events, however the mechanisms that mediate these
      links are poorly understood. Inflammatory and neuroendocrine processes are thought to play an
      important role in this relationship. In addition, antidepressants have been shown to improve
      cardiac outcomes and have anti-inflammatory effects, whilst inflammation has been shown to be
      elevated in patients who do not respond to treatment. Several possible biomarkers for
      antidepressant resistance have also been demonstrated to be cardiovascular risk markers.
      These include acute phase inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysregulation.

      Design: This will be conducted alongside a larger pharmacological trial, PANDA, where
      participants will be recruited from primary care and randomized to sertraline (SSRI) or
      placebo. The RESIST study will compare inflammatory cardiovascular risk factors between
      depressed patients taking sertraline, depressed patients taking placebo and healthy controls.
      This will be achieved by investigating the pharmacological effect of antidepressants on gene
      expression, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor function and regulatory T cell
      (Treg) profiles.
