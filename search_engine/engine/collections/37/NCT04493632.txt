    
      OSPREY is a post-market, global, multicentre, observational, prospective registry in which
      data is recorded from patients who undergo OncoSil™ device implantation.

      Countries intended for initial commercial distribution include Australia, Belgium, France,
      Germany, Italy, Singapore, Spain, & the United Kingdom.

      Only patients who are intended to undergo treatment with the OncoSil™ device in the
      commercial (sales) setting will participate in this Registry.

      Every patient who is prescribed OncoSil™ in the commercial setting will be approached by the
      Treating Physician to consent to participate in the OSPREY Patient Registry.

      Patients who choose not to consent to participate in the OSPREY Patient Registry will not be
      excluded from being treated with the OncoSil™ device.

      Five hundred patients (implanted with OncoSil™) will be recruited into the OSPREY Patient
      Registry. It is anticipated recruitment will be over a five-year period, subject to the rate
      of commercial adoption of the OncoSil™ device in the market.

      To adequately collect data relating to the performance and safety of the OncoSil™ device,
      data will be collected from patients over a prescribed 12-month period from enrolment, the
      cohort is then followed to death or to 24-months post the date of the last enrolled patient
      implanted with OncoSil™.

      Therefore, the Registry is expected to run for a seven-year period. Relevant observational
      data will be collected via medical record review.
