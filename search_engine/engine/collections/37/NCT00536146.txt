      and the body's behavioral and physiologic responses to stress, recovery, and adaptation. Both
      mental trauma and chronic alcohol use may produce disturbances in the HPA response to stress.
      Thus, changes in this system during a period when there is no alcohol intake may impair the
      body's ability to mount an appropriate response to environmental stressors, heightening the
      probability of additional alcohol intake. However, the relationship between trauma, stress,
      and HPA axis disturbances requires further study. In this study, the NIH investigators will
      attempt to determine if the sensitivity of glucocorticoid gene induction varies with stress.
      Blood samples will be obtained at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (TSMC)
      in collaboration with the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (VA) at Dallas, Texas under a
      protocol and consent forms approved by TSMC IRB. Only samples collected as described in the
      TSMC protocol will be studied at NIH.
