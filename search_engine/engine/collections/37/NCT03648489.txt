      resistant to platinum chemotherapy. Weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy is standard for these
      women, but there is a need to provide more effective treatments. TAK228 is an unlicensed oral
      drug that blocks the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is important to the survival and spread of
      cancer cells. When TAK228 is combined with paclitaxel in the laboratory, the anti-cancer
      effect of both is increased. The DICE trial will show whether using TAK228 in combination
      with weekly paclitaxel is more effective at treating the patient population than weekly
      paclitaxel alone. DICE will also look for 'biomarkers' that measure the activity of the
      cancer and the effects of treatment. This may help us understand which women might benefit
      from receiving TAK228 and weekly paclitaxel in future.

      Randomisation will be to one of 2 groups (63 women in each). Treatment is divided into 4 week
      'cycles':

      Group 1: weekly paclitaxel for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest each cycle

      Group 2: weekly paclitaxel (see Group 1) plus TAK228 for 12 days each cycle

      Women will stop treatment when the cancer grows significantly, there are unacceptable side
      effects, or the investigator and/or patient decides to stop. Women will be followed up until
      6 months after the last patient receiving study treatment stops that treatment.
