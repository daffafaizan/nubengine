      patients to the risk of developing drug dependence on these psychoactive drugs with loss of
      control of their use. In general medicine as well as in algology consultation, the
      identification of an addiction to opioid analgesics (and even misuse as a gateway to
      addiction) have thus become strong recommendations for the purpose of improving the
      management of the patients. However, the success of the patient's clinical management, in
      terms of analgesia and treatment of drug dependence, rests on the acceptance of this
      management by the patient himself.

      The discrepancy between the assessment of drug dependence on analgesic drugs by the
      algologist and the perception that the patient has of this dependence will be investigated
      through a multicentre cross-sectional descriptive survey performed in pain treatment centres
      in France.

      In addition to opioid analgesics, other pharmacological classes used for analgesic use will
      be investigated as they are concerned with the development of drug dependence. This is
      particularly the case for gabapentins.
