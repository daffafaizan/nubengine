      not explain all aspects of the reduced QoL of those with MD. Previous research suggested that
      a cognitive behavioural approach using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) would best
      suit those with MD. A pilot study of this approach in seven participants with MD was
      promising, and has led to this definitive trial of ACT. The aim of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of an ACT intervention to improve the QoL of individuals with MD.

      Patients with one of the following muscle diseases will be recruited: limb girdle muscular
      dystrophy, dystrophinopathies resulting in a Becker' muscular dystrophy phenotype,
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and inclusion body myositis. Patients will be
      recruited primarily through muscle clinics at King's College Hospital (KCH) and The Royal
      London Hospital (RLH) but also via Muscular Dystrophy UK (MDUK) and UK registries of patients
      with these muscle diseases.
