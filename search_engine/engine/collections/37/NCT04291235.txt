      stroke, and infection. These patients are usually not fully awake and need help with their
      breathing and with preventing them from choking on their secretions. This is done with a
      breathing tube inserted through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing
      machine. As patients recover, It is often unclear when the best time is to remove the
      breathing tube. Doctors might decide to remove it relatively early, or they may wait until
      the patient is more fully awake, or they may perform a tracheostomy (neck surgery to insert a
      new tube directly into the windpipe (trachea), replacing the temporary breathing tube). Each
      of these approaches has risks and benefits. This trial in brain-injured patients will test
      which of the following will lead to better patient outcomes: (1) an airway management pathway
      consisting of daily assessments and removal of the breathing tube as soon as patients can
      breathe on their own and appear able to protect their airway; versus (2) the usual treatment
      patients would have received if they were not enrolled in this trial.
