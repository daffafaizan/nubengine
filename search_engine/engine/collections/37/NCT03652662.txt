      adapted from previous respiratory muscle strength training (RMST) training regimens,
      consisting of 1) five training days/week using combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle
      training, consisting of breathing in and out against a combine inspiratory and expiratory
      muscle strength trainer (IMST/EMST), 2) individualized, progress-based text message training
      reminders and prompts related to timing and intensification calibration, and 3) use of a
      Fitbit for remote monitoring of physical activity and hours slept at night. Similar to other
      muscle strength training programs, exercises are done at regular intervals during the week (5
      breaths, 5 times a day, 5 days a week; the participant will receive graphical illustration of
      RESP-FIT training frequency and intensity achieved, and based on their training regimen, will
      be prompted and/or reinforced via SMS text messaging). As the use of an accelerometer or
      remote tracking device alone may affect physical activity, a control group will receive only
      the Fitbit. This study proposes to assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of RMST by
      obtaining estimates of variability in fatigue secondary to dyspnea, using a
      technologically-enhanced RESP-FIT intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that a training
      regimen consisting of RMST along with technology-enhanced symptom-tracking will decrease
      dyspnea, dyspnea-related activity avoidance, and fatigue. Additionally, this application
      proposes to further develop Smartphone Airway Monitoring System (SAMS) which currently
      integrates EMA probe questions covering COPD symptoms and preventive care use with the new
      functions, use in an adult population with COPD, video captured training technique and
      logging of RMST training sessions. Up to thirty adults with COPD (age over 40) will complete
      the study and use the SAMS app for 6 weeks in the natural environment. We will evaluate the
      acceptability, feasibility, adherence, and performance of RESP-FIT + SAMS through
      quantitative methods to further optimize the app and related study procedures for the next
      phase of testing (i.e., large scale efficacy RCT).
