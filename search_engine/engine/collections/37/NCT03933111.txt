      imaging. All subjects are scanned by Fuji film su-9000 ultrasonic system. After the lesions
      are found, local sound velocity measurement technology will be used to measure the sound
      velocity in the lesions. Pathology diagnosis or clinical follow-up results will be regard as
      diagnostic gold standard to divide the patients into pancreatic cancer and pancreatic cancer
      group. The investigators will compare the sound velocity value if there is statistically
      significant difference between the two groups, build the receiver operating characteristic
      curve, calculation of pancreatic benign and malignant lesions of sound velocity threshold,
      and and the investigators will calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive
      predictive value and negative predictive value, to evaluate local sound velocity measurement
      in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer clinical application value.
