      personality trait knowledge, associated affective valence and person-trait associations. We
      propose using parametric event-related fMRI in addition to classical reaction time measures,
      to answer the question of whether a specialized neural system is involved in semantic
      processing of personality trait concepts. We will apply methods that have been used in
      previous investigations to identify category-specific semantic (meaning) systems for living
      and non-living objects.

      Study Population. Healthy, normal adult, right-handed volunteers will be studied during
      functional neuroimaging and in behavioral pre-tests.

      Design. Behavioral pre-tests (N=200 subjects) are used to obtain psycholinguistic stimulus
      parameters used in the fMRI experiments. Three parametric event-related functional MRI
      experiments (for a total of 104 subjects) using personality trait concept words as main input
      stimuli will be conducted.

      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of questionnaire results, behavioral
      measures of cognitive performance and corresponding fMRI images. The results gained from this
      protocol will be of value in advancing the neuroscience of person perception and social
      cognition.
