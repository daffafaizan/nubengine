      Among patients with multiple injuries because of blunt trauma, 5%-16% sustain injuries to the
      pelvic ring, resulting in a mortality rate of 11%-54% primarily due to hemorrhagic shock. In
      theory, the reduction and stabilization of the pelvic ring can decrease bleeding from the
      fracture site, as reduction of pelvic volume has been shown to reduce the extent of
      hemorrhage from such injuries.The application of a pelvic binder has become part of the
      emergency care of all trauma patients with suspected pelvic fractures, in both the
      pre-hospital environment and emergency department (ED). The present study aimed to assess the
      effectiveness of the early use of pelvic binders to treat patients with a suspected high risk
      of pelvic bleeding from blunt force pelvic fractures.
