    
      The objectives of this three stage mixed methods study is to:

        1. Develop a new physical literacy framework, with the help of health professionals and
           end-users that promotes optimal physical functioning for adults.

        2. Develop a population-based health intervention using rehabilitation strategies that are
           delivered virtually to increase physical literacy for adults.

      The first 2 qualitative studies will be used to inform the third quantitative intervention.

      First, an on-line consensus approach with physiotherapy leaders, rehabilitation researchers
      and public health experts will be used to identify a new physical literacy framework as it
      relates to adults.

      Second, virtual semi-structured interviews with working adults who are living with 2 or more
      chronic conditions will determine how aging adults frame physical literacy in their life,
      specifically with the management of chronic conditions.

      Lastly, working adults with 2 or more chronic conditions will participate in a 5-week
      physical literacy program. Multifaceted knowledge translation strategies including; "walk and
      talk" with a neighbour or friend, podcasts and on-line mobility challenges will be utilized.

      It is anticipated the intervention will improve important physical literacy outcomes such as;
      physical competence, function, mobility, motivation, awareness, and self-efficacy.
