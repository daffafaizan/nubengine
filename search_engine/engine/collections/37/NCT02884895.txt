      Tracheal intubation an action that allows the insertion of a tube through the vocal cords and
      fixation by the balloon inflation is a definitive airway.

      Tracheal intubation is usually achieved by a direct laryngoscope. This method is taught both
      in the training of doctors and paramedics training. Although it is an effective method
      requires experience and skill demanding a long learning time The use of the Laryngeal Tube
      Suction for fast control of the airway is known for many years. The Laryngeal Tube Suction
      and others similar devices are known as Supraglottic Airway Devices and are inserted blind in
      the oropharynx and allow a fast oxygenation and ventilation of the patients.

      The new generation of these devices allows perform blind intubation directly through a
      special channel. One of these devices is the Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction

      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the Intubating Laryngeal Tube
      Suction to achieve a definitive airway by unskilled practitioners in anesthetized patients
      with the head in neutral position (trauma model).

      The hypothesis is that definitive airway obtaining with Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction
      will be more success and faster compared to the standard way of direct laryngoscope. If the
      hypothesis is proven, this research will be very important implications for the management of
      the airway describing pre-hospital and in particular military scenarios.
