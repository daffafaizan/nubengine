      Department of Acute Internal Medicine of Turku University Hospital in Turku, Finland between
      April and September 2017 were included in the study. Patients were assigned to two groups
      according to the prevalent heart rhythm (sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation). A smartphone
      equipped with an inbuilt accelerometer and a gyroscope was placed on the patient's chest to
      obtain a seismocardiographic recording. Simultaneous telemetry electrocardiography was
      obtained to assess the reliability of seismographic rhythm recordings. Results will be
      analyzed to describe the specificity and sensitivity of the method.
