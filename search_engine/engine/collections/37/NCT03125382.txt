      multicenter randomized study, is to assess the safety, functioning and costs of remote CID
      monitoring when compared to traditional in-clinic follow-up. It will evaluate aspects such as
      the clinician and patient acceptance and satisfaction with the reviewing device data via the
      website, the complexity for troubleshooting calls to the support center, the utilization of
      emergency resources by symptomatic patients, the percentage of the unscheduled appointments
      after a remote interrogation, the levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life, and the
      main consumed resources with CareLink System.
