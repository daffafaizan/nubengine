      adolescent patients with migraine and 27 healthy volunteer (HV) adult subjects will be
      enrolled so that a total of 24 evaluable subjects complete in each group. The treatment
      procedures for these two groups are almost identical but some flexibility has been allowed
      for the timing of some of the PK samples in adolescents. All subjects will be required to
      attend a screening visit within 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Each
      subject will participate in one dosing session with one of the 3 doses of sumatriptan/
      naproxen sodium. Sequential PK samples will be collected through 48 hours after dosing and
      the PK parameters will be compared between these two groups and between doses.
