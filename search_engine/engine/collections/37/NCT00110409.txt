      Many urban asthma emergency room patients lack effective self-management. Most current
      training programs are administered in outpatient settings and have low attendance rates for
      emergency room patients. There is a great need to develop effective programs that can be
      easily administered in the emergency room for patients who, in many cases, are not present in
      other settings to receive education. This proposal builds on preliminary studies and is
      tailored to provide emergency room patients with basic education during "a teachable moment"
      when they may be most receptive to asthma information.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients will be recruited from two New York City urban emergency rooms or inpatient settings
      and randomized to the intervention or control groups. Intervention patients will receive a
      protocol focusing on asthma self-management, education, self-efficacy, and social support,
      with telephone reinforcement for 8 weeks. Control patients will receive standard emergency
      room education about asthma.
