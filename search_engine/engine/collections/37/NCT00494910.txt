    
      To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Meaning-Centered Group
      Psychotherapy (MCGP) versus a standardized Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP) in reducing
      psychological distress (depression and anxiety), end-of-life despair (hopelessness, desire
      for hastened death, and suicidal ideation), and improving spiritual well-being and overall
      quality of life in a sample patients with advanced cancer.

      To assess the relative impact of Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy on different aspects of
      spiritual well-being (e.g., a sense of meaning and purpose versus spirituality linked to
      religious faith).

      To examine clinical and demographic variables that may correspond to differential responses
      to Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (e.g., potential mediating and moderating influences
      such as illness severity, religion and religiosity, level of education, race/ethnicity, level
      of pre-intervention social support, presence of pain and physical symptom burden).
