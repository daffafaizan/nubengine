    
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two injections of HEPLISAV™ in subjects
      11 to 55 years old. About 200 subjects will be included in the study. Once subjects have been
      consented and screened, they will receive a total of two injections over a 28-day period,
      with follow-up visits at 8, 12 and 28 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by
      occurrence of adverse events, periodic laboratory tests, vital signs, and local/systemic
      reactogenicity.

      Comparison: This study does not include a control treatment; all subjects will receive
      treatment with HEPLISAV™.
