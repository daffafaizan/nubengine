      dexamethasone plus thalidomide (DT). Unfortunately, the use of conventional doses of DT is
      associated with significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality, which is comparable to
      that observed with conventional chemotherapy. Hence, for safety reasons, patients frequently
      receive lower than conventional doses of DT (i.e. dt), and potentially experience a poorer
      anti-MM effect. The highly-potent aminobisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (Z), has been shown in
      pre-clinical mouse models to exhibit an impressive anti-MM effect. It is therefore possible
      to combined dt with Z (i.e. dtZ) to enhance the efficacy of (lower dose) dt. In addition, the
      anti-tumor effect of dtZ may potentially be augmented by using Z at a higher (three-weekly)
      dosing frequency.
