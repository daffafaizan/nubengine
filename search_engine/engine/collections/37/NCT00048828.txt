      disorder occurs in childhood or adolescence, the consequences in terms of functional
      impairment, loss of developmental opportunities, and family and societal burden are
      particularly dramatic.

      Evidence supports the improved efficacy and/or side effect profile of atypical antipsychotic
      medication in adults. Thus, it is essential to examine whether the potential benefits of
      these agents can be extended to children, particularly children who have failed standard
      treatment.

      Patients are randomly assigned to receive either clozapine or olanzapine daily for 12 weeks.
      Patients meet with the study team once a week to discuss progress and record side effects.
      Three parent meetings take place during the study. During these meetings, questions are
      discussed and support and education about schizophrenia are given to parents. Various scales
      to measure psychotic, manic, aggressive, and depressive symptoms are used to assess patients.
