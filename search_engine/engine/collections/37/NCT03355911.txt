      2016. Patients aged > 18 years and with an indication for posterior lamellar graft surgery,
      such as Fuchs dystrophy, were included. Exclusion criteria included a history of penetrating
      keratoplasty in the study eye and a need for a penetrating keratoplasty following endothelial
      graft failure. Visual acuity, central corneal thickness (CCT) and graft thickness were
      measured preoperatively, and at postoperative day 7 and months 1, 3 and 6.
