    
      The investigator will question the practice of palliative care physicians in several centers
      regarding the use of antipsychotics.

      When a patient meeting the inclusion criteria has been identified by an investigating
      physician. The participant fills out a questionnaire containing some general information
      about the investigating physician and the patient, followed by a first questionnaire, called
      A Form (to be completed on D0, when the antipsychotic is introduced) with 8 questions on the
      prescribing symptom, antipsychotic used and associated therapies.

      Seven days later, the same physician will fill out a second form, called B Form (to be
      completed on D7), with 9 questions on treatment efficacy, possible modifications and
      associated treatments.

      Each investigating physician includes a maximum of 4 patients over the 6-month inclusion
      period.

      Once the 4 questionnaires have been completed (Form A and Form B), he / she returns it to the
      principal investigator of the study, by e-mail to etudeneuropal@gmail.com, or by mail: Dr
      Marie LEPOUPET, Mobile Pain-Palliative Care Unit CHU, CÃ´te de Nacre Avenue, 14,000 CAEN.
