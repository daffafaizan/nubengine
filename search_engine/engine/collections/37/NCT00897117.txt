        -  Develop statistical and computational methods for modeling the relationships between
           multiple variable protein and RNA expression data and clinical endpoints using both
           supervised and unsupervised classification and pattern recognition approaches.

        -  Determine protein and RNA expression fingerprints on completely resected non-small cell
           lung cancer without prior chemotherapy.

        -  Correlate protein and RNA expression fingerprints with T-stage and nodal involvement at
           the time of surgery, and collect outcome data to allow correlation with recurrence
           (local and/or distant) and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Any excess tissues removed from surgery and would otherwise be discarded (tissues not used
      for diagnosis and/or treatment decision making) are obtained for this study. Tissue are
      analyzed for molecular features that predict biologic behavior. Quantitation of RNA, gene
      expression profiles, and protein expression patterns are assessed by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy and microarray analysis.

      Medical records are reviewed to obtain information about results of tests associated with
      cancer diagnosis. Further progress in cancer treatment and tumor behavior after surgery are
      followed via record review.
