    
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the treatment failure-free survival rate in
      high-risk elderly patients, identified by geriatric assessment, treated with either a
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel or single agent
      nab-paclitaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment failure-free survival is the
      most appropriate primary outcome as it captures excessive toxicity due to chemotherapy in
      addition to death and disease progression.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate grade 3-5 toxicities, overall response rate,
      progression free survival, symptom assessment, and overall survival between the two
      randomization arms.
