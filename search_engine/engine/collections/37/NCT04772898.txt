      decade. The latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that 1 in
      59 children are being diagnosed with ASD and it is four times more prevalent in boys than
      girls. Common treatments for children with ASD are applied behavioral therapy, occupational
      and speech therapy, which are used solely or in combination. Hippotherapy (HPOT) is another
      treatment option that has been shown to positively impact various aspects of behavior. This
      pilot project aims to determine the effects of a 6-week HPOT program on movement and social
      behavior of children with ASD and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of why HPOT is
      successful for ASD through the coupling of physiological and temperamental responses between
      horse and rider. The approach involves examining these skills pre, during, and post HPOT
      intervention in children diagnosed with ASD. A group of aged matched children with typical
      development will serve as the control group. Innovative measures of physiological coupling
      and temperament between horse and rider as well as objective and quantitative measures of
      movement and social behavior and caregiver perception will be collected. The investigators
      anticipate that following completion of the proposed study, they will provide the necessary
      foundation to understand the mechanisms of HPOT, and thus provide a new framework to test
      clinical trials of HPOT and human-animal interaction, and ultimately improve the lives of
      those diagnosed with ASD and their families.
