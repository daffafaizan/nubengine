      group therapy compared to individual ACT-therapy for adult cancer patients suffering from
      psychological distress. Participants will be recruited from referrals to the Cancer
      Rehabilitation Unit at Helsingborg Hospital, Sweden. A total number of 12-20 participants
      will be assigned to either the experimental group, receiving ACT group therapy, or the Active
      Control group, receiving individual ACT therapy. Both therapy interventions aim at increasing
      psychological flexibility. Sociodemographic as well as Medical information regarding their
      somatic disease will be collected at baseline assessment.
