        -  Determine the feasibility of administering induction chemoradiotherapy comprising
           cisplatin and etoposide followed by surgical resection and adjuvant docetaxel in
           patients with non-small cell lung cancer involving the superior sulcus (Pancoast
           tumors).

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine confirmed and unconfirmed and complete and partial response during induction
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and
           29-33 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo
           concurrent radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      Within 2-4 weeks after completion of induction chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo disease
      evaluation. Patients with no evidence of local or overall disease progression undergo a
      thoracotomy within 3-7 weeks. Patients who do not qualify for surgery proceed to
      consolidation chemotherapy within 3-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy is complete.

        -  Consolidation chemotherapy: Within 3-8 weeks after thoracotomy, patients with no
           evidence of disease progression receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
