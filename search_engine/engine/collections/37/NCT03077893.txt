      clinical trial conducted on subjects with bilateral symmetrical diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy. Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with Type 1
      or Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in both feet
      despite treatment. Eligible subjects will receive two active treatment devices (one for each
      foot, to allow simultaneous treatment) and treat at home, twice daily for 60 days after which
      they will return to the clinic at Day 61 for a response assessment. Subjects that are
      determined to be responders at Day 61 (subjects that achieve a 1-point decrease in the
      average pain score over the last 24 hours using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)) will be
      randomized 1:1 to either active treatment or inactive sham devices and will continue treating
      through Day 120. Subjects that are determined to be non-responders at Day 61 will continue
      treating with the active devices given at enrollment and will return to the clinic at Day 75
      and Day 91 for a response assessment. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 75,
      they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or inactive sham and will
      continue treating through Day 120. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 91,
      they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or sham and will continue to
      treat through Day 120. If a subject continues to be a non-responder at Day 91 they will be
      terminated from the study.
