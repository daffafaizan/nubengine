    
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy. This study was performed to
      determine the value of terminal latency index, residual latency and median ulnar F latency
      difference to investigate their sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of this
      syndrome.

      We retrospectively determined the 160 patients. We evaluated the nerve conduction studies of
      patient and healthy arms. We recorded all nerve conduction study values.
