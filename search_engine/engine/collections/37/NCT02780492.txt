      of DMD natural history. This study aim to assess the natural history of DMD through a
      composite assessment tool capable of capturing disease progression linking ambulant and
      non-ambulant phases of the disease.

      With a recruitment target of 80 DMD patients across 5 centres (London, Newcastle, Paris,
      Leiden, Nijmegen), subjects are assessed 6 monthly according to a shared protocol.
      Assessments include 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA),
      Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) and MyoSet (myogrip, myopinch and moviplate). Both ambulant
      and non-ambulant subjects undergo upper limb evaluation and respiratory function test
      including forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures
      (MIP/MEP). A subgroup of patients performs annual whole body DEXA scan. An imaging sub-study
      will aim to characterize muscle (upper/lower limb) and brain MRI.

      The investigators will analyze the longitudinal data for the different assessment tools and
      explore correlations among them.

      This study will offer a comprehensive natural history of DMD including novel outcome
      measures, allowing to capture disease progression and explore the relationship between
      different assessment tools.
