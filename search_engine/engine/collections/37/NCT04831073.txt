      multicentre observational registry (ERTAAD), which will enroll consecutive patients who
      underwent surgery for acute TAAD from January 2005 to March 2021. The investigators will
      compare patient's comorbidities, condition at referral, surgical strategies and perioperative
      treatments in patients with and without early and late adverse events. The primary clinical
      outcome will be in-hospital mortality, late mortality and reoperations on the aorta.
      Secondary outcomes will be stroke, acute kidney injury, surgical site infection, reoperation
      for bleeding, transfusion of blood products and length of stay in the intensive care unit.
