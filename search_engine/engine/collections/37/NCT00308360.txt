      challenge for clinicians. Hostile behavior is a frequent reason for psychiatric admission,
      and is an obstacle for the successful reintegration of patients back into the community.
      Current treatment approaches have generally not been assessed under controlled conditions.

      Method: This is an eight-week open-label randomized parallel group clinical trial focusing on
      the comparison of risperidone alone with risperidone plus valproate among hospitalized adult
      patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who also exhibit problems with hostility. Patients may
      have already been receiving risperidone or valproate (but not both) at study entry. Patients
      not receiving valproate at study entry were randomized to receive either risperidone alone or
      risperidone with valproate. For patients already receiving valproate at study entry, their
      antipsychotic medication(s) was switched to risperidone, and they were followed for a
      four-week lead-in period prior to baseline assessment and randomization to receive
      risperidone alone or continue with risperidone and valproate. Blinded raters completed a
      battery of assessments, including the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Buss-Durkee
      Hostility Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the Overt Aggression Scale. We
      hypothesized that risperidone alone has an antiaggressive/antihostility effect, and that this
      effect is augmented by the co-administration of valproate.
