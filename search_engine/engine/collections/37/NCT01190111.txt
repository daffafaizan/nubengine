    
      This was a phase IIa study assessing weekly doses of CYT107 in addition to antiviral
      treatment (HAART) in adult patients with HIV.

      CYT107 were administered at the dose of 20 Âµg/kg based on the patient's weight, in 3 weekly
      administrations. CYT107 Subcutaneous injection administered at the clinic or day hospital

      Patients were followed every 3 months for primary and secondary biological activity criteria
      as well as safety up to 24 months long term follow-up with quarterly visits.

      A cycle = 3 weekly administrations; D/d0; D/d7; D/d14 For all patients there will be a
      maximum of 3 cycles over 12 months and a maximum of 4 cycles over 21 months, for a total
      duration on study of 24 months.

      All patients were receiving and continued to receive combination antiretroviral therapy while
      on-study.

      Pre-medication was not be used systematically but might be administered if needed according
      to standard clinical practice.

      During the study visits the following may be done:

        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood tests every visit.

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Chest x-ray study

        -  Liver/spleen imaging

        -  Blood sample collections at frequent intervals for laboratory tests (Virology: HIV RNA
           &HIV DNA;Pharmacodynamics/Immunology;Bacterial translocation )

        -  Urine tests several times during the study.

      PBMCs collections for immunological testing

      An optional substudy on gut biopsy performed prior and at month 3 after the first CYT107
      cycle to evaluate T cell homing
