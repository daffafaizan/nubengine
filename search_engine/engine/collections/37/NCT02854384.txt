      brain activity (EEG) and cognition (P300) together with the effect over the unstable brain of
      the epileptic patients. Exposure to mobile-phone radiation has been reported to increase the
      spectral power of electroencephalograms (EEGs), particularly in the alpha band, during both
      the waking and sleeping states. The tendency toward electrical instability of the neural
      networks of epileptic patients suggests that these individuals may be especially sensitive to
      electromagnetic fields espcially mobile-phone radiation (MPR). The short-term effects of
      exposure to electromagnetic (EM) fields on a number of cognitive variables such as memory,
      attention and speed of decision-making could be assedsed by P 300 latency and amplitude.
