      trial aims to contribute evidence on viable approaches to implementation as high mortality
      countries consider this intervention to improve child survival. From a pool of eligible rural
      and peri-urban communities in the Dosso Region in Niger, 80 will be randomly selected and
      randomized to receive door-to-door or fixed-point delivery of a single dose of azithromycin
      distribution to children 1-59 months of age via community health workers. Treatment coverage,
      costs and cost-effectiveness, and feasibility and acceptability will be compared by arm.
