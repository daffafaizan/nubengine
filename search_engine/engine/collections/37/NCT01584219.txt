    
      : Identification of proangiogenic myeloid cell populations in human placentas. Placental
      myeloid cells from different stages of pregnancy will be analyzed, using flow cytometry.

      Aim 2: Characterization of the physiology of myeloid cells identified. Cells will be
      isolated, cultured and tested for proangiogenic properties using Matrigel plug assays,
      endothelial tube formation assays, etc. Immune tolerance will be analyzed in vitro using T
      cell proliferation studies, cytokine production, etc.

      Aim 3: The role of placental myeloid cell populations in pathologies of pregnancy.

      Placentas from human pregnancy pathologies that involve placental dysfunction, such as
      preeclampsia, pre-term labor, intrauterine growth restriction, will be analyzed using the
      methods mentioned above
