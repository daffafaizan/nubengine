      cancer (HRPC). Recent data indicate, that chemotherapeutics given at MTD induce, besides
      their cytotoxic effects, mobilization of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and -
      progenitors (CEP) in drug-free breaks of each cycle. In preclinical models, mobilized CEC/CEP
      result in tumor vasculogenesis and progression of disease.

      We hypothesize that treatment with sunitinib, an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      in between 3 weekly docetaxel disrupts CEC/CEP spikes following docetaxel leading to
      chemosensitization and reduced tumor re-growth in HRPC patients responding to docetaxel.
