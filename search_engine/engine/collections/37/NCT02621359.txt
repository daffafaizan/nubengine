      important target of current research.

      Unfortunately, the most frequently used "rescue" or "salvage" therapy is bismuth quadruple
      therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), tetracycline, metronidazole, and bismuth
      [11]. This rescue therapy is inexpensive, and relatively effective with average eradication
      rate of 70% when used as second-line therapy. However, disadvantages of bismuth based
      quadruple therapy include the large daily number of pills (sometimes exceeding 18 pills),
      increased dosing frequency (four times daily), and frequent side effects.
