      glucose sensing. The testing for each patient includes fingerstick and alternate site
      capillary blood measurements taken nearly simultaneously with a series of near-infrared
      spectra collected via a novel, proprietary fiber-optic probe. Simultaneously, subjects will
      be wearing a commercial continuous glucose measuring system (Medtronic iPro 2). The spectral
      data are converted to a prediction of tissue glucose using a proprietary pre-defined
      universal algorithm. Subjects are tested every 20 minutes for up to 12 hours per day and up
      to 6 visits per patient over a period of up to 4 months.
