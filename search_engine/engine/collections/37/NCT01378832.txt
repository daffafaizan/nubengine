      inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective
      curative surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (intra-abdominal irrigation
      with normal saline) and Group 2 (intraperitoneal irrigation with a solution of 240 mg
      gentamicin and 600 mg clindamycin). The occurrence of wound infections and intra-abdominal
      abscesses were investigated. Following the anastomosis, a microbiological sample of the
      peritoneal surface was obtained (sample 1). A second sample was collected following an
      irrigation with normal saline (sample 2). Finally, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with a
      gentamicin-clindamycin solution and a third sample was obtained (sample 3).
