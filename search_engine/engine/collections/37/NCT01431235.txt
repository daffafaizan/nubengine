      with substance use disorders (SUD). The prevalence of ADHD in patients with SUD is estimated
      23%, and ADHD is associated with an untoward prognosis of SUD. However, adequate treatment
      programs for patients with ADHD and SUD are not available. Results of medication trials for
      patients with ADHD and SUD are disappointing, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has not
      yet been investigated in this population. In patients with ADHD without comorbid SUD, the
      results of CBT in randomized trials are positive. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      if CBT is effective in treating ADHD symptoms in patients with ADHD and SUD.
