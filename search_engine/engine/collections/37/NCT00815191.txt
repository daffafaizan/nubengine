      warming will have the circulating-water sleeve applied to an arm that will not require
      intravenous access. An esophageal temperature probe will be inserted and connected to the
      anesthesia machine monitoring system. Intravenous fluids will be warmed to 40-42째C.

      As soon as practical after induction, the vitalHEAT warmer will be activated in the
      appropriate patients and set to "high" which is 42째C

      An upper-body forced-air warmer will be positioned over the upper body and exposed arms on
      patients assigned to forced-air heating. The forced air blower will be set to "high" which is
      43째C and activated as soon as practical, usually after prepping and draping.

      Patients in both groups will be otherwise draped per surgical routine. Ambient temperature
      will be maintained near 20째C. Active warming will be maintained until just before extubation.
      The esophageal temperature probe will be removed, and the patient extubated after emergence
      from anesthesia. This will conclude the study and subsequent management will be at the
      discretion of the attending anesthesiologist
