      escalation, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CORT125134 for the treatment of
      endogenous Cushing's syndrome. CORT125134 was administered orally once daily for 16 weeks
      with dose escalations occurring every 4 weeks.

      Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles were generated at every dose level. A data review committee
      reviewed PK and safety data and recommended the final plan for dose escalation in Group 2.
