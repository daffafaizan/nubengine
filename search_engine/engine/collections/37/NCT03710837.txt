      professionals as 'woefully inadequate'. Pain Neurophysiology Education (PNE) can improve
      undergraduates' pain understanding/management, however previous RCTs used single discipline
      groups and immediate follow-up. Investigation of the effectiveness of this education on
      students across the multi-professional team with medium-to-long-term follow-up will provide
      important new information on the generalisability of existing data and whether or not any
      changes in pain understanding/management are maintained over time.

      This study aims to contribute to the development of neuromusculoskeletal physiotherapy by
      identifying whether or not this education, which aims to up skill healthcare professionals of
      the future, is effective and can change their behaviours in practice to enhance patient care
      in chronic pain management. PNE has been shown to be useful in patient care in conjunction
      with other treatment methods. If this intervention is successful in altering pain attitudes
      and knowledge in keeping with modern science then students may feel more confident and able
      to manage pain post qualification. The findings of this study will support or refute the
      addition of PNE into healthcare professional undergraduate programmes.
