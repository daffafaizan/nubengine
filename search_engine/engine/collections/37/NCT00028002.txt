      I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with primary or recurrent potentially
      resectable malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      imatinib mesylate.

      II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine
      the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression. Patients with disease progression are considered for
      immediate surgical resection. Otherwise, after 8 weeks, patients undergo surgical resection
      to debulk all gross tumor. Two to four weeks after surgery, patients receive oral imatinib
      mesylate once daily for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
