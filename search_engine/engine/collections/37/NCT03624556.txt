      (extracted form green tea) on children from 6 to 12 years old with Intellectual Development
      Disorder (Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the benefits of the EGCG on attention, memory,
      executive functions, language and adaptive behaviour of these children. Dyrk1A and
      homocysteine in plasma will also be quantified, using them as biomarkers of efficacy.
