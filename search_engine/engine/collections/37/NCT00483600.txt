      Fondaparinux is cleared from the body mainly by the kidneys. Therefore in patients with
      kidney diseases, full doses of fondaparinux could cause bleeding problems. The correct dose
      of fondaparinux that should be used in patients with kidney disease is not known. The purpose
      of this research is to determine the PK and safety of a preventative dose (2.5mg
      subcutaneously every other day) of fondaparinux for patients with kidney disease.
