      compared to the general population and promote the development of a state of undernutrition.
      Conversely, the absorption of glucose by transperitoneal route could contribute to the
      occurrence of a metabolic syndrome.

      The main objective is to compare DE and its variations according to the conditions (rest,
      sleep, meals, physical activity) in patients treated with automated DP compared to controls,
      in a calorimetric chamber.
