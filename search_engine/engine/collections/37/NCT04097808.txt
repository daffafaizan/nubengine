    
      The absorption (blood) of collagen peptides from bovine, fish and porcine source in different
      sizes and administered together with foods of different polyphenol content will be assessed.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-6h, Cmax and Tmax) after oral single dose administration
      will be determined to estimate the impact of different sources, different peptide sized any
      food matrix.

      The following objectives will be evaluated exploratory by comparison of pharmacokinetic
      parameters from the concentration time curve of hydroxyproline, a key marker of collagen type
      I, between:

        -  different sources of collagen peptides (bovine, fish, porcine)

        -  different sizes of collagen peptides from cattle

        -  food matrices impact on uptake of bovine collagen peptides (dissolved in water vs. food
           matrix 1 vs. food matrix 2).

      Additionally, concentration time curves of further amino acids will be assessed
      descriptively.
