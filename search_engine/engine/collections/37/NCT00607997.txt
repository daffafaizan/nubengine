        1. Assess the safety of treatment with vosaroxin, including the 30 and 60 day all-cause
           mortality

        2. Assess leukemia free survival (LFS), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS),
           and duration of remission (DR).

        3. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of vosaroxin in this patient population.

        4. Evaluate potential stratification biomarkers by evaluating DNA-damage and apoptotic
           pathways in bone marrow samples before and after treatment with vosaroxin
