      collected prior to the change in study design. The STRIDE study became STRIDE2 (NCT03583138).
      Those individuals originally enrolled in the STRIDE RCT will be followed for 12 months.

      STRIDE2 will assist in identifying and monitoring individuals' HIV risk behaviors and provide
      resources to seek treatment for their HIV care and substance use. The goal of STRIDE2 is to
      examine if there are differences in HIV, drug use, and other outcomes between individuals
      receiving treatment versus individuals actively using, not actively using and not in
      treatment, and individuals on Methadone, Suboxone, or in some other treatment.
