      and a follow-up phase (Visit 2 to Visit 3 (7-12 days post Visit 2)). During the primary phase
      patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either Solosec or placebo. Patients will
      return to the clinic for the "test of cure" (TOC) visit to be conducted on Days 6-12 (Visit
      2). After all Visit 2 study procedures have been completed, patients will receive the
      opposite treatment (placebo patients will receive Solosec and vice versa). Patients with V2
      cultures that are subsequently positive for T. vaginalis will return to the clinic for Visit
      3 (V3) assessments and investigator assessment of need for additional therapy (an additional
      Visit 4 may be scheduled at the investigator's discretion if culture at V3 is positive).
