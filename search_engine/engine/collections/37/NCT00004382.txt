      birth. Patients are stratified by gestational age, clinical status, and age at treatment.

      One group receives tin mesoporphyrin. Patients are crossed to phototherapy if the plasma
      bilirubin concentration reaches the treatment threshold.

      The second group receives phototherapy with Special Blue fluorescent lamps for at least 24
      hours. Patients receive a second phototherapy course if the plasma bilirubin concentration
      reaches the treatment threshold within 24 hours of the first course.
