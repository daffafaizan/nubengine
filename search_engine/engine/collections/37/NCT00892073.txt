      tumor and are currently followed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Approximately
      50% are obese (BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile for age and gender assessed from the updated Centre for
      Disease Control growth charts), all of whom have panhypopituitarism requiring hormone
      replacement therapy. These children are assessed regularly in Endocrine Clinic and also are
      invited to attend a comprehensive care clinic for evaluation by an endocrinologist (Principal
      Investigator), neurosurgical clinical nurse practitioner, dietitian, exercise physiologist,
      psychologist and social worker to provide multi-disciplinary dietary and exercise
      consultation and psychological counseling for weight related concerns. This clinic will
      provide the infrastructure for recruitment and follow-up of study patients. Recruitment of
      eight subjects for this pilot study will occur over 6 months from patients attending the
      comprehensive clinic. This number was chosen as it is equivalent to the number chosen in the
      pilot study of octreotide by Lustig which showed beneficial changes in body mass index with
      treatment.

      This study evaluates a novel combination therapy in children with hypothalamic obesity at
      very high risk for complications. Evaluation of insulin resistance and metabolic changes on
      therapy will allow a better understanding of how insulin secretion relates to weight gain in
      this population. Successful therapy in a pilot setting will provide necessary data for a
      larger randomized trial in individuals with hypothalamic obesity including children with
      craniopharyngioma and others with damage to the hypothalamus secondary to other tumors,
      surgery or cranial irradiation.
