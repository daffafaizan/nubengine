      I. The primary objective of this study is to assess outcomes when high-dose cyclophosphamide
      (CY) is administered on days 3 and 4 followed by cyclosporine (CSP) after human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated mobilized blood cell transplantation with
      total-body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan (BU)-based conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The secondary objective of this study is to assess hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT) outcomes when withdrawal of CSP is accelerated in patients without acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      OUTLINE: Patients' conditioning regimens are determined by the Clinical Coordinator after
      consultation with the attending physician. Based on disease, patients receive either TBI or
      fludarabine and busulfan.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive TBI twice daily (BID) on days -4 or -3 to -1. Some
      patients also receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) daily on days -5 to -2 and busulfan IV
      over 3 hours once daily (QD) or over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -5 to -2. Patients may
      also undergo central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, testicular irradiation, and/or
      involved field irradiation as per standard practice.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      (PBSCT) on day 0 per standard practice.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4. Patients
      also receive cyclosporine IV every 12 hours or every 8 hours beginning on day 5 with taper on
      days 56-126.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 180 and then annually
      for 5 years.
