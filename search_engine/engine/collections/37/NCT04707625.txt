    
      Ten patients, 5 with branch retinal vein occlusion and 5 with central retinal vein occlusion,
      will receive stand of care anti-vascular endothelial growth factor over the course of 52
      weeks while undergoing a paracentesis prior to each treatment. During the paracentesis
      anterior chamber fluid will be removed to evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor levels
      along with other cytokines present in the anterior chamber fluid. Ocular coherence tomography
      will also be collected at each visit to evaluate macular thickness which will be used to help
      determine treatment windows along with levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Patients
      with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and the presence of macular edema on
      ocular coherence tomography will be treated every four weeks. Once vascular endothelial
      growth factor levels are reduced along with improvements of macula edema treatment windows
      will be extended to 8 weeks and then to 12 weeks once levels are normal and edema is no
      longer present.
