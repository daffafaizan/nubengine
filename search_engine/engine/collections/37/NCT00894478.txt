      children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD compared to normal controls;
      and secondly to determine if the location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the
      epileptogenic zone as defined using magnetoencephalography (MEG) dipole clusters. Our
      hypotheses are firstly DTI can demonstrate the anatomic delineation of white matter
      abnormalities in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and the alteration in DTI indices are similar
      in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD, which is the positive control; and
      secondly the anatomical location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the
      epileptogenic zone as defined by MEG dipole clusters. The long-term goal of this study is to
      improve detection of subtle lesions in children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy so as to
      improve the surgical outcome of these patients who undergo epilepsy surgery for seizure
      control.
