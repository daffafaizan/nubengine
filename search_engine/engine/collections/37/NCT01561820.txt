      will inform the design of a larger, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Specifically,
      the investigators aim to:

      2.1 Determine the feasibility of recruiting persons with MCI and a buddy for an exercise
      intervention.

      - For MCI participants who do not identify a buddy, the investigators will determine the
      interest and feasibility of recruiting volunteers from the community to be an exercise buddy.

      2.2 Determine the effects of having an exercise buddy on:

        -  adherence to the protocol

        -  400 meter walk time, an objective measure of improved physical fitness

        -  retention and satisfaction for both participant with MCI and buddy

      2.3 Establish a scientific partnership with a community based exercise facility.
