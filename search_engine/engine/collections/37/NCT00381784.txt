      throughout the target community. The role model stories are brief publications that depict
      personal accounts from individuals in the population of focus who have made or are planning
      to make a risk-reducing behavioral change. The messages in the role model stories are
      reinforced by interpersonal communication with trained peer advocates.

      MPowerment: is a community level HIV/STD prevention program that relies on peer advocates
      from the community to lead outreach activities including discussion groups (M-groups),
      venue-based outreach, social events and a publicity campaign. Sites will adapt MPowerment for
      local use remaining faithful to the core elements.
