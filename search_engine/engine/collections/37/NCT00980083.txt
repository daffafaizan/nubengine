    
      Two experiments were performed in random order in 12 healthy subjects. After a 50-min basal
      period subjects ingested a 412 kcal mixed semisolid meal containing 30g oatmeal, labelled
      with 99mTc-Sn-colloid. Gastric emptying was measured by high-resolution scintigraphy until
      210 min after meal ingestion. Saline (SAL) or Ex(9-39) at 900 pmol/kg/min was intravenously
      infused during the two experiments. In addition, in 6 of the 12 subjects gastric motility was
      measured by antroduodenal manometry and gastric barostat. AUC: pp incremental area under the
      curve. Lag period (LP): time to 10% emptying.
