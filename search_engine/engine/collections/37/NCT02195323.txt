      CKD. A total of 10 patients with CKD IV injection of high doses 2Ã—106/kg of autologous MSCs
      t, which will be derived from biopsies of their bone marrow. Assessments will be performed at
      1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after cell injection. Changes in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
      were evaluated by scan isotope.
