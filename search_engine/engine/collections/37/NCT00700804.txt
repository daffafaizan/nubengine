      of bone metabolism. It is a controlled feeding trial with a randomized crossover design (2x2
      Factorial), studying 34 healthy post-menopausal women. The women are blocked on Body Mass
      Index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)and randomly assigned to a
      high calcium (HC,1500 milligrams per day) or low calcium (LC, 600 milligrams per day) group,
      and consume both low protein (LP,10% protein) and high protein (HP, 20% protein) diets for 7
      weeks each. There is a 3-week "washout" between dietary periods, during which the subjects
      consume self-selected diets. After 3 week equilibration to each diet, the 2-day rotating menu
      is extrinsically labeled with a Calcium-47 radiotracer and retention is monitored for 28 days
      by whole body scintillation counting. In addition to Calcium retention, other endpoints
      include urinary indices of acid excretion and urine serum indices of bone resorption.
