      be obtained, including MRI/MRA (including DWI, PWI and T2 imaging) and plasma surrogate
      biomarkers. Clinical outcome will also be assessed at 7days, 30 days and 90 days
      post-treatment. At each of these visits, mortality and neurological assessments (NIHSS,
      Barthel index, mRankin scale) will be performed. In addition, vital status will be assessed
      vial a telephone contact at 60 days post-treatment.

      The trial will investigate three dose regimens of microplasmin, all of which are within the
      range of doses previously evaluated in a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers; the planned
      sample size for the trial is approximately 40 patients.

      The study will consist of 3 phases - the Baseline, In-hospital Phase and Follow up Phase.
      Baseline is from study entry through randomisation; the In-hospital phase is from treatment
      with study drug through hospital discharge or day 7, whichever occurs first. The follow up
      phase consists of visits to the hospital 30 days (+ 3 days) from the day of study drug
      administration. Hospital discharge is defined as the end of the discharge from the acute
      hospital setting. Discharge may be to home, to a rehabilitation setting or to a non-acute
      hospital setting.
