      presents an increased risk for patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. Prevention or
      reduction of this increment is important for hemodynamic control. In this randomized single
      blind study, the aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic responses of two different
      laryngoscopy techniques with Glidescope and Macintosh laryngoscope in coronary cardiac bypass
      surgery patients. After induction with our institutional protocol for cardiac bypass surgery,
      hemodynamic data including heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure data will be
      recorded. Time for intubation, age, sex, ASA status data will also be recorded.
