      appropriate screening. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either before meal group or after meal group.
      Subjects will be stratified into two groups according to Los Angeles classification grades
      (LA grades) A/B or C/D, as determined by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Subjects will
      visit the site at Week 2 for endoscopic assessment. Subjects whose mucosal breaks have
      completely healed will be prematurely withdrawn and considered to have reached end of
      treatment. Subjects whose mucosal breaks have not healed will continue to receive IPs for an
      additional 2 weeks and will visit the site for endoscopic assessment at Week 4.
