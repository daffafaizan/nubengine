      Randomization will be done by the hospital pharmacy department whom will be the only
      unblinded participants. Patients will receive 200mg thiamine in 50mL of 5% dextrose or
      matching placebo (50mL 5% dextrose) once daily for 7 days or until discharge from the
      intensive care unit. The drug will be mixed by the pharmacy. Administration will be done in
      the patients room in the intensive care unit by the patient's assigned nurse. Blood will be
      collected on admission to the hospital in order to determine baseline lactate level and study
      eligibility. The measurement of lactate is standard of care in patients with sepsis. Thiamine
      level will be collected upon enrollment into the study. The ICU nurse or emergency room nurse
      taking care of the patient at the time of enrollment will draw the blood sample. Standard
      procedure for measuring thiamine levels will be maintained including protecting the blood
      sample from light and keeping it on ice while it is delivered to the lab. Serum lactate will
      be measured daily for 7 days or until discharge from the intensive care unit. The serial
      measurement of serum lactate is considered standard of care in patients with sepsis.
