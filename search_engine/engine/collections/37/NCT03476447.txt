      period will be utilized to collect baseline microbiome samples and for the completion of
      daily and weekly feeding and health logs. Subjects that meet eligibility criteria on Day 7
      will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment arms. Supplementation will begin on Day 8 and will
      continue for a total of 28 consecutive days. Subjects will be followed for an additional 4
      weeks after the cessation of the supplement. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 9 weeks. Infant stool and urine samples, as well as maternal breast milk
      samples, will be collected on multiple occasions during the study. Mothers will be asked to
      complete questionnaires and health logs during the course of the study as well.
