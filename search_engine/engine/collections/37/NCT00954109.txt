      examination, as well as determination of body composition and fitness. Participants will be
      asked to complete 5-10 days of supervised exercise training and will undergo testing to
      assess cardiovascular and metabolic responses to an oral glucose tolerance test, including
      muscle sympathetic nerve activity, blood flow, and circulating glucose and insulin
      concentrations at baseline and following training. In addition, day-to-day variations in
      blood glucose will also be monitored. The overall aim of the project is to determine whether
      or not acute exercise training influences postprandial metabolic, vascular or autonomic
      nervous system responses in individuals with insulin resistance or T2D.
