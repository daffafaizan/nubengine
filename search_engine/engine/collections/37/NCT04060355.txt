      14 million by 2050, and the number of family caregivers who maintain these persons in the
      community will rise proportionately from 15 million at present. Several psychoeducation
      programs, including Savvy, have successfully ameliorated the adverse effects of caregiving,
      but these programs are only minimally available and accessible.

      The study goal is to develop a web-based system that uses distance education methods and
      provides manuals and protocols to train, certify, and monitor the performance of
      interventionists to deliver the Savvy Caregiver program (Savvy), an evidence-based dementia
      family caregiver psychoeducation program. The system has a potential to increase the
      scalability of Savvy.
