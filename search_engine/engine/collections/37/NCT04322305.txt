    
      In a 10-week double-blind placebo controlled outpatient clinical trial, the safety and
      efficacy ofpregabalin will be tested in 50 outpatients with Alcohol Use Disorder.Participants
      will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive pregabalin or an identical-appearing, inert
      placebo. All study medication (placebo and pregabalin) will be over-capsulated with
      riboflavin to assess compliance. Pregabalin will be administered in 75 mg and 100 capsules;
      placebo capsules will appear identical to the pregabalin capsules. Participants in both study
      arms will receive the same number of capsules. Pregabalin will be titrated over a 3-week
      period to the FDA maximum (600 mg per day) or the maximum tolerated dose.

      Study visits will occur daily for the first 4 days of the study period, then approximately
      every other day for the remainder of week 1, for a total of 5 study visits (study days
      1,2,3,4, and 5 or 7). During the second week, study visits will continue every other day for
      a total of 3 study visits (study days 8,10, and 12). During the remainder of the 8-week
      medication study period, study visits will occur twice weekly. There will be two visits
      during a post-study taper week (week 9) and a follow-up visit during week 10. One visit per
      week will be with the research psychiatrist. All participants will have a weekly supportive
      behavioral treatment session with the research psychiatrist using a manual designed for
      pharmacotherapy trials in subjects with alcohol use disorders
