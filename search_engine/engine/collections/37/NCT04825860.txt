    
      A Phase 2/3 Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel-group, Placebo-controlled, Fixed-dose,
      Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SEP-363856 in Acutely Psychotic
      Patients with Schizophrenia, Followed by an Open-label Extension Phase.

      The double-blind phase is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of SEP-363856 (50
      and 75 mg/day) versus placebo over 6 weeks in acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia.
      This phase is projected to randomize approximately 480 subjects to 3 treatments (SEP-363856
      50 mg/day, SEP-363856 75 mg/day, placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The completers of the
      double-blind phase will be able to enroll into the 12-week open-label phase during which the
      long term safety and effectiveness of-SEP 363856 will be evaluated.
