      Specific aim: to determine if extended release nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis
      administered to patients performing clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) after
      pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery decreases the incidence of
      symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with placebo.

      Study Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

      Methods: Consented patients who undergo urogenital surgery and fail their post-operative
      voiding trial will be randomized to either extended release nitrofurantoin 100mg or an
      identical appearing placebo capsule to be taken daily while performing CISC and for three
      subsequent days after stopping CISC. Catheterized urine specimens will be sent for culture
      and sensitivity when women report symptoms consistent with cystitis. Symptomatic UTI will be
      defined using strict culture-based definitions. We anticipate that the study will end within
      6 weeks of starting CISC.

      Data Analysis: Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated with Student t test and
      Fisher exact test.

      Sample Size: Assuming a decrease in symptomatic UTIs attributable to nitrofurantoin
      prophylaxis from 33% to 10%, with 80% power, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and a 10% dropout
      rate, we should recruit a total of 108 patients.
