      trials using asynchronous Internet-mediated text-dialogue for psychotherapeutic purposes.

      Single patients in differing treatment phases, conditions, age and sex categories are
      interviewed after using Internet-contact as a supplementary tool in psychotherapy. Their
      therapists are interviewed as well.

      The purpose is systematically gathering single-case experiences with the tool, to build a
      hypothesis for research and preliminary guidelines for experimental clinical use of
      Internet-mediated psychotherapy.
