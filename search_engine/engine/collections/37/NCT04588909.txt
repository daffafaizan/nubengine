      COVID 19 pandemic. Based on information suggesting that India was faring better compared to
      the west [1] and that oncology patients were likely to get deferred care with significant
      implications [2], the department of general surgery (colorectal division) took a conscious
      decision to continue offering elective cancer surgeries albeit in less numbers.in this study
      we will try to collect 30 day post operative outcome data of elective colorectal cancer
      resections at our department and discuss the implications of our decision.

      Such reports are still sparsely reported from Covid hotspots around the world.

      Methods:

      We will analyze the prospective database of the department of colorectal surgery at Sheri
      Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, a tertiary referral centre and a high volume
      centre for colorectal cancer surgeries ( with more than 300 colorectal cancer surgeries
      performed every year) in North India wef 23rd March to 22nd September 2020 (6 months).and
      report outcomes of all elective colorectal cancer surgeries. Each patient will be followed up
      for 30 days, thereby last follow up will end on 22nd October 2020.

      All colorectal cancer patients subjected to elective and emergency surgeries during COVID 19
      pandemic will be included. Patients who were positive for SARS CoV2 (Severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2) infection and underwent surgery for colorectal cancer will be
      excluded.

      The data will be statistically analysed using Statistical Product and Statistical
      Solutions(SPSS) sotware v 23. All categorical variables will be shown in the form of
      frequency and percentage. Continuous variables will further be analysed by independent t test
      and using multivariate analysis.
