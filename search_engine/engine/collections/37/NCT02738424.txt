      analyze in conventional MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could be an additional
      diagnostic feature. However, according to the literature, there is heterogeneity in normal
      bone marrow of the quantitative parameter that it provides, called apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC). Histological and technical factors appear to be the cause, but the
      possible influence of the employed post-processing software has never yet been evaluated. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if there is variability in lumbar bone ADC related to
      the post-processing software.
