      for prevalence vary between 0.2 and 9.9 percent. The methods used to detect the aneurysms
      markedly influenced the proportion of aneurysms. Retrospective autopsy studies probably give
      an underestimation and prospective angiography studies an overestimation of the actual
      prevalence. Accurate data on the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms are essential in
      evaluating the results of screening programs for aneurysms in general population.

      During the past decade, MRA, as a preferred accuracy modality for noninvasive intracranial
      vascular imaging at most centers, is playing an increasing role in the evaluation of patients
      suspected of having intracranial aneurysms. In recurrent study, we have tested that MRA at 3T
      has excellent sensitivity, accuracy, and correlation with DSA and is comparable to catheter
      cerebral angiography for the evaluation of patients with intracranial aneurysms (Stroke, in
      press). Therefore, we examined trends in intracranial aneurysm prevalence with the use of MRA
      at 3.0T to determine the true prevalence of cerebral intracranial aneurysms in the general
      middle-aged or elder population.
