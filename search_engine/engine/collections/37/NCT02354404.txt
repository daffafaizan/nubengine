    
      Study Design: This Phase 1b, open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity of investigational Ebola vaccines is conducted in two Parts. In Part 1
      subjects are randomized to receive either the cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ vaccine at two different
      dose levels. In Part 2, participants from Part 1 may receive a booster injection with the
      MVA-EbolaZ vaccine; all at the same dose level. The hypotheses are that the study vaccines,
      cAd3-EBO, cAd3-EBOZ and MVA-EbolaZ, will be safe and will elicit immune responses to Ebola
      glycoprotein (GP). The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      study vaccines administered as intramuscular (IM) injections. The secondary objectives are
      related to immunogenicity.

      Study Products Description:

      VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP (cAd3-EBO) is composed of two recombinant cAd3 vectors in a 1:1 ratio
      that express Ebola WT GPs from Zaire and Sudan strains. It is formulated at 2x10(11) particle
      units (PU)/mL.

      VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP (cAd3-EBOZ) is composed of a cAd3 vector that expresses Ebola WT GP from
      the Zaire strain. It is formulated at 1x10(11) PU/mL.

      VRC-DILADC065-00-VP (diluent) is the vaccine formulation buffer and will be used when needed
      to prepare the correct dosage of cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ.

      VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP (MVA-EbolaZ) is composed of a MVA vector that expresses Ebola WT GP from
      the Zaire strain. It is formulated at 3.2x10(8) PFU/mL.

      Part 1 Study Plan:

      Group 1: 60 volunteers will be randomized: 15 in each of the two dosage groups for
      VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP [2x10(10) PU or 2x10(11) PU] and 15 in each of the two dosage groups for
      VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP [1x10(10) PU or 1x10(11) PU].

      Group 2: up to 30 volunteers that previously participated in the RV 247 clinical trial who
      received the investigational product VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP will be randomized to receive one of
      the two dosage groups for VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP.

      The two groups will be enrolled simultaneously. If less then 30 participants enroll into
      Group 2, additional participants may be enrolled into Group 1 for a total of 90 participants
      overall. Participants will be evaluated by 9 clinic visits over 48 weeks.

      Part 2 Study Plan:

      Part 1 participants who received a study vaccination and have completed at least 36 weeks of
      follow-up, who are eligible and consent may receive a booster injection with the
      VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP vaccine at 1x10(8) particle forming units (PFU). Participants will be
      evaluated by 11 clinic visits over 48 weeks after beginning Part 2.
