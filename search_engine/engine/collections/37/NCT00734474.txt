      Phase 3 studies (dose-finding portion) and to evaluate efficacy and safety of selected doses
      of LY2189265 in comparison to Sitagliptin (100 milligrams) up to 104 weeks and Placebo up to
      26 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus on Metformin (confirmatory, Phase 3
      portion). The primary objective is to show non-inferiority of the higher LY2189265 dose (if 2
      doses are selected) to Sitagliptin with respect to change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      at 52 weeks. The final endpoint is 104 weeks.

      Participants are randomized to receive Placebo, Sitagliptin, or 1 of 7 initial LY2189265
      doses until a dose decision is made based on quantitative analysis of the benefits and risks
      of each LY2189265 dose. A clinical utility index (CUI) that applies predicted values for
      change from baseline in HbA1c at 12 months and change from baseline in weight, diastolic
      blood pressure, and pulse rate at 6 months for each LY2189265 dose will be used toward this
      end. After the dose decision, participants in the selected LY2189265 arms and the comparator
      arms (Sitagliptin and Placebo/Sitagliptin arms) will continue the study, and additional
      participants will be randomized to the selected and comparator arms. Regardless of the timing
      of randomization relative to the dose decision point, all participants in the selected and
      comparator arms are planned to receive treatment for 104 weeks; participants in the
      Placebo/Sitagliptin arm will receive Placebo treatment for 26 weeks followed by Sitagliptin
      100 mg for 78 weeks for blinding purposes only, and participants in the selected and
      Sitagliptin arms will receive the same treatment for 104 weeks. All participants will remain
      blinded to their study treatment throughout the study. Participants in the non-selected arms
      will discontinue from the study after the dose decision
