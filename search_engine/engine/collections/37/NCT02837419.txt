      compare predicted mortality for every patient based on validated scoring systems at the
      initiation of ECLS treatment with the actual outcome, so every patient is his own control.

      Primary outcome is HRQoL assessed with the EQ-5D questionnaire at 1 year. Healthcare costs
      and costs from a societal perspective are prospectively measured.
