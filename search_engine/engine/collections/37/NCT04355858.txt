      mutation, FDGFRb mutation PAM pathway mutations, CD8 and AR, as long as an epigenetic therapy
      cohort and a combined immunization cohort were initially set up based on gene expression
      profiles and molecular pathways, . The main purpose is to screen valuable treatment cohorts
      and prepare for subsequent randomized controlled phase III clinical studies with larger
      sample size.
