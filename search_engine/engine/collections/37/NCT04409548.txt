      spatiotemporal gait parameters was performed using the "Win-Track" gait analysis platform
      system for two groups. In addition, the analysis of spatiotemporal gait parameters of 60
      participants who had the planned lumbar discectomy surgery, was tested before and 15 days
      after surgery. The pain intensity of the patients was recorded by the Visual Analog Scale
      (VAS) immediately before performing the analysis. After then participants completed ten
      passes on the "Win-Track" Gait Analysis Platform at their self-selected walking speed. The
      arithmetic mean of the three flawless walking data was used for analysis.
