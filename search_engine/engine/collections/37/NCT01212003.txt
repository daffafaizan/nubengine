      millions of persons worldwide, but only leads to disease in 10% or less of these individuals.
      It typically causes pneumonia, however dissemination to almost any other organ is possible.
      Drug resistance of the organism, co-infection with HIV, and paradoxical reactions upon
      treatment are all factors that may complicate treatment.

      Host defense against mycobacterial infections is important. Specific defects within the
      innate immune system lead to Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals and persons treated with anti-tumor
      necrosis factor antibodies are highly susceptible to tuberculosis infection. Genetic
      influence on susceptibility to TB disease is complex and does not seem to be confined to a
      single gene or pathway.

      Advancement in molecular techniques has expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis and
      epidemiology of M. tuberculosis. Identification of gene mutations that confer antibiotic
      resistance are being exploited as alternatives to conventional drug susceptibility testing.

      The natural history of all forms of TB disease (including co-infection with HIV and other
      infections) will be followed, and M. tuberculosis isolates and blood from 100 infected
      patients will be obtained in order to study organism virulence and host immune function and
      genetic/epigenetic factors. While it is recognized that the number of tuberculosis cases that
      occur in the Washington, DC area and nationally is low, it is imperative that a mechanism is
      in place to evaluate and treat these patients at the NIH Clinical Center. This protocol will
      allow NIH infectious diseases trainees to manage challenging cases of tuberculosis.
