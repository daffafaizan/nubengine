      of centers and countries, with the objective to collect long term safety and performance data
      in patients undergoing ICD/CRT-D device implantation (first implant, replacement or upgrade).

      The safety and performance of the ICDs can be evaluated through the collection of multiple
      parameters such as, but not limited to:

        -  Clinical parameters, like patient demographics and history, procedural and hospital
           discharge data, as well as the short and long term serious adverse events (death and
           hospitalization)

        -  Device parameters, such as delivered shocks, ATP, or other device therapies

      Worldwide selected centers will be invited to participate in this prospective study and
      include their "real-world" patients treated with Sorin Group commercially available ICDs and
      CRT-Ds devices.
