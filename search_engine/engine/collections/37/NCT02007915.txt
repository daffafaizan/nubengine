      pediatric patient population leading to degenerative arthritis and significant disability.
      Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults with
      avascular necrosis of the femoral head. For children and adolescents however, there is
      currently no effective treatment that prevents collapse of the femoral head. Some patients
      with proven avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis are treated with bisphosphonates
      (intravenous pamidronate) at the The Hospital for Sick Children. The main aim of this study
      is to prospectively collect data on HSC patients receiving bisphosphonate treatment and
      thereby report the effectiveness of this treatment in the prevention of femoral head
      collapse.
