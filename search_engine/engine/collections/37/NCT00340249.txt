      specimens and clinical information collected by the investigators prior to their joining the
      intramural program. The samples have been gathered under the sponsorship and approval of the
      Human Investigations Committees at Yale University, Wayne State University and Pennsylvania
      Hospital in the United States, the Sotero del Rio Hospital, the Hospital of the Universidad
      de Chile and the Universidad Catolica de Chile , in Chile. The investigators have generated a
      bank of amniotic fluid, maternal blood and urine, and fetal blood obtained at the time of
      delivery (from the umbilical cord and by cordocentesis), neonate s urine and sonographic
      examinations of the fetus, including echocardiography, stored on videotapes. Clinical
      information with patient identifiers is available for these samples and sonographic
      examinations.
