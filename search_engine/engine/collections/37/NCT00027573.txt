        -  Determine the overall response rate and overall and disease-free survival of patients

           cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity and treatment-related mortality of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of donor chimerism in patients treated with this regimen.
