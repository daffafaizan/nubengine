      cohort design where active TIP and TIP/Placebo cyclical (3 capsules o.d [Cohort A], 5
      capsules o.d. [Cohort B] or 4 capsules b.i.d. [Cohort C]) versus Placebo were administered
      for a total of 112 days.

      Novartis decided to close the recruitment of new subjects into this study earlier than
      scheduled. Subjects who had a signed informed consent form and entered screening by
      10-Sep-2018 still participated in the study. The latest possible randomization was on
      08-Oct-2018. All subjects enrolled in the study (107 enrolled subjects out of 180 planned)
      continued as planned through to their last scheduled visit. The early recruitment halt of the
      study was not due to safety or lack of efficacy.
