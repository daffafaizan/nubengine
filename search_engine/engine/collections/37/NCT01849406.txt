      microphones will be suspended at a distance of 1 m approximately above the surface of the
      patient's bed. This arrangement allows a non-invasive measurement of snoring that simulates
      the distance between sleeping bed partners. Before every study the system would be
      acoustically calibrated using a reference noise produced by a noise generator (86 dB). The
      signal would be sent at a sampling rate of 12 KHz through an analogue-digital converter to a
      computer system for subsequent analysis. All digitized signals will be recorded in the hard
      disk of a personal computer. A noise analyzer (Praat; Boersma 2005) will be used for the
      intensity analysis of snoring sound (Boersma, 2005).
