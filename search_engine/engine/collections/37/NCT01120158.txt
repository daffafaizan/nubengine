      more likely than younger women to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of breast cancer.
      However, when treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease they derive similar benefits
      to their younger counterparts. Preference should be given to chemotherapeutic drugs with
      safer profiles regimens, such as weekly taxane, according to the SIOG recommendations.
      Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab
      demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone
