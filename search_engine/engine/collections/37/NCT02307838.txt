      study. Patients did not receive any protocol specified treatment. The original D2201 study
      sites who agreed to participate in this study were required to locate their patients who were
      randomized in Study D2201 and asked them to return for a 10-year assessment, regardless of
      their current treatment status. Locating the patient may have required the use of search and
      advertising strategies to find those patients currently lost to follow-up, in accordance with
      local privacy legislation. Patients currently being followed within Study FTY720D2399
      (NCT01201356) were asked to participate in Study FTY720D2201E2 and if patients gave consent,
      were enrolled concurrently in both studies.
