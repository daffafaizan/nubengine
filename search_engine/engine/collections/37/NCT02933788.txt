      these vascular complication, antithrombotic drug may be administered. Representative
      antithrombotic agents are aspirin and cilostazol. However, recent studies suggested that
      aspirin did not have sufficient effect to prevent vascular complications of diabetes. For
      that reason, it have been reported that antithrombotic effects of aspirin were falling in
      diabetes patients, so-called 'aspirin resistance.

      On the other hand, cilostazol used as the control drug inhibits atherosclerosis in diabetes
      patients in the studies of Asia including Korea, and it is effective to inhibit the risk of
      various cardiovascular disease. Therefore, cilostazol is likely to use drugs as substitute
      for aspirin therapy.
