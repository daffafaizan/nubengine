    
      The present study consists of screening period (2 weeks before randomization), DB phase (6
      weeks), OL phase (8 weeks) and follow-up visits at Week 3, Week 6 and Week 14. Participants
      who are eligible will be randomized to receive 1g MAX-002, 1g CanasaÂ® and placebo suppository
      once daily in the DB phase. Participants who complete or discontinue the study at Week 6 will
      either receive 1g MAX-002 suppositories on a voluntary basis, standard care treatment as per
      investigator's discretion or no treatment during the next 8 weeks of the OL phase. Total
      duration of treatment will be of 14 weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by percentage
      of participants who show response as per Mayo DAI Score at Week 6. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
