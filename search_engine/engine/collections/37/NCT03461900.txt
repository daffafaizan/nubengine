      control to the intervention at regular intervals:

        -  Control periods: Patients receive a usual optimization fluid management according to
           surviving sepsis campaign guidelines.

        -  Interventional periods: Patients receive a pragmatic, protocolized and individual
           optimization fluid management according to validated components of a hemodynamic
           challenges called Mini-Fluid Challenge (MFC).

      Except fluid therapy in interventional group, management of sepsis will be at the discretion
      of the attending physician. The use of international guidelines for all therapeutic
      interventions is recommended in all patients whenever their group.

      All patients will be followed from enrolment to death or hospital discharge. If alive but not
      in the hospital after 28 days since septic shock, clinical outcomes will be evaluated by a
      visit with an intensivist or, if a physical examination is not possible, by a telephone
      interview performed by an intensivist. To ensure the same data collection in all centers,
      visits were planned: D0 (inclusion), D1 to D10 (in ICUs), D28 and D180.

      Classical blinded methods cannot be used in case of evaluation of an optimization protocol.
      Investigators are unblinded to which arm patient is randomized. To ensure the same evaluation
      for all patients and in all centers, all events recorded will be evaluated by an independent
      clinical event committee.

      All primary endpoints will be analyzed according to a hierarchized analysis to ensure
      comparison of multiple issues without considering type I error inflation. Secondary outcomes
      will be analyzed as exploratory analysis.
