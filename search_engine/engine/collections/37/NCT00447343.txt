      population. Arthritis of the spine is the most common cause of acquired spinal cord
      dysfunction and can manifest in subtle symptoms, such as diminished balance and dexterity, or
      profound symptoms, such as paralysis and incontinence. In cases where dysfunction results in
      severe spinal cord compression, surgery is performed. However, surgical outcomes are not
      always beneficial. Past research has reported that approximately one-third of surgery
      patients improved, one-third remained the same and one-third worsened. Currently, there are
      no reliable tests that can predict outcome following surgery. We are hoping that this study
      will change that.

      Twenty-five patients will undergo 45 minute imaging sessions pre-operatively and six months
      post-operatively. Ten controls will undergo 45 minute imaging sessions twice to provide a
      baseline comparison and reproducibility. During each session, one motor task (finger tapping)
      and 1 sensory task (hand brushing) will be performed for 2 minutes at 10 second intervals. We
      wish to compare the change in volume extent, and location, and intensity of brain activation
      levels before and after surgery. We will also compare fMRI signal response differences
      between controls and patients. We hypothesize that the degree to which brain activation
      shifts towards normalcy (that of controls) will correlate with the degree of neurological
      recovery postoperatively.

      Data will be analyzed using software developed at the Robarts Research Institute.
