      efficacy of AZD9833 (next generation oral SERD) in combination with palbociclib versus
      anastrozole in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of patients with ER-positive
      breast cancer. The goal of the study is to demonstrate superiority of AZD9833 over
      anastrozole in the context of combination with palbociclib in first line setting.
