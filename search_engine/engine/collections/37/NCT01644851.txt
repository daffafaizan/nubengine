      achieve optimal response to current first-line behavioral and pharmacologic treatments.
      Neurocognitive research points to the potential of novel treatments targeting dorsal
      prefrontal function and inhibition, attention, and working memory processes. This study
      investigates effects of computer-based training in executive functions compared to word games
      on cognitive and emotional aspects of combat-related PTSD. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires,
      interviews, computer-administered testing, and magnetic resonance imaging will be complete
      before and after the intervention. Results from this pilot study will provide information
      concerning feasibility and treatment potential of cognitive training for PTSD.
