      expiration, including a plateau exhalation valve. As exhaled gases was vented out the plateau
      exhalation valve at a constant rate, during exercise, with the increase of exhalation flow,
      single-limb circuit with a plateau exhalation valve might cause carbon dioxide(CO2)
      rebreathing. Therefore, our aim in the present study was to evaluate whether CO2 rebreathing
      occurs in COPD patients ventilated during exercise assisted by the single-limb circuit with a
      plateau exhalation valve and estimate a potential threshold for predicting CO2 rebreathing.
