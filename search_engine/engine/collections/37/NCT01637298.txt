      proteins, MCM proteins, high-risk HPV types, and E6 and E7 mRNA/oncoproteins, as adjunct
      tools to anal Pap smear in identifying HGAIN and to study the impact of HIV infection on the
      characteristics of anal cytology (by anal Pap smear) and biomarkers. To fulfill these goals,
      in addition to routine practice, it will be necessary to follow 450 MSM (315 HIV-positives
      and 135 HIV-negatives) over 60 months, and perform HRA and biomarkers on all clients at
      baseline and every 12 months. Information from this study would inform AIN screening and
      follow up approaches in HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM in both resource-limited and
      resource-rich settings.
