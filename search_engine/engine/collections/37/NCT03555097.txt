      ventilation, we will measure the relevant parameters of lung volume, respiratory flow,
      diaphragm electromyogram, neural respiratory drive mechanical and other baseline index. Then
      incremental pressure support will be applied to investigate the effects of different levels
      of BIPAP ventilation on respiratory mechanics and neural respiratory drive.
