      participants must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and return tactile sensitivity scores
      within protocol-specified parameters at both the screening and baseline visits.

      Run-in will consist of a 2-week period during which participants will use a sodium fluoride
      dentifrice. At the start of the first phase, participants will attend a Screening Visit. They
      will participate in the informed consent process, complete a medical/dental history, and be
      evaluated for tactile sensitivity to Yeaple probe and response to a cold air stimulus.

      Participants who qualify through screening will begin a run-in period that will last
      approximately two weeks. The run-in period will be followed by a Baseline visit. Participants
      who continue to qualify through Baseline will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups.

      During the four-week treatment period, all participants will brush their teeth twice daily
      for at least one minute in their usual manner, with their assigned toothpaste. After
      brushing, participants will rinse with water, and then rinse with 10 mL of their assigned
      experimental mouth rinse for 60 seconds.

      The study duration is approximately six weeks with each participant visiting the clinical
      site four times.

      Adverse events will be observed and collected by querying each participant at each visit for
      new or continuing symptoms.
