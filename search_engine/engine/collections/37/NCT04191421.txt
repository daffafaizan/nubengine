    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of spartalizumab and
      siltuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of the recommended phase II dose of
      spartalizumab and siltuximab.

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of spartalizumab and siltuximab in previously
      treated patients with pancreatic cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the combination on the immune profile in the serum and in tumor
      biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of siltuximab.

      Participants receive spartalizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and siltuximab
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150
      days, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
