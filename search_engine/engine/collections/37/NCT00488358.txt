      abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with an FDA approved stent-graft (Zenith). This study does
      not require any change in clinical protocol to the the way the AAA procedures are currently
      done. Utilizing the catheters already employed in this procedure, intravascular blood
      pressure measurements will be documented at various times and at various anatomic levels
      prior to and after deployment of the stent-graft.

      As the compliant aortic aneurysm acts as a capacitor, expanding during systole and
      contracting during diastole, it is our hypothesis that endovascular AAA repair using a
      non-compliant stent-graft changes the aortic pulse profile.
