      used in this study. The study will last approximately 36 months and comprises three phases.
      The first phase is a 6-12 weeks waiting list/baseline phase during which participants will be
      repeatedly assessed with the main outcome measures and putative mediators. In the second
      phase participants will receive up to 75 individual sessions of SFT for chronic depression
      depending on the individual progress in therapy. Upon completion of the intervention phase,
      participants will have monthly follow-up assessments for the next 12 months.
