      cause of death from malignant tumors in China. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) includes
      squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and large cell carcinomas and accounts for about
      80-85% of all lung cancers. NSCLC cancer cells divide slowly in a diffusive manner and
      metastasize at a relatively late stage compared to small cell carcinomas. A majority of
      patients with NSCLC are already in advanced stages and have a low 5-year survival rate.

      Treatments for advanced NSCLC include chemotherapy ,targeted therapies and immunotherapy. The
      microwave ablation is the good choice for patients who cannot tolerate surgical resection. A
      large number of studies have shown that local minimally invasive ablation therapy within a
      certain temperature range can stimulate the body to produce an immune response to varying
      degrees. The study found that for a variety of malignant tumor models, thermal ablation local
      treatment of in situ tumors, while the disappearance of other metastatic lesions, and treated
      mice are resistant to secondary vaccination of the same tumor, proving that thermal ablation
      therapy stimulates long-lasting Anti-tumor immunity. Pembrolizumab are representative drugs
      for immunosuppressive agents, and its indications have been approved in various types of
      tumors, including advanced melanoma, advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer, advanced
      renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and late recurrent head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma patients. Whether the combination of the two can cause a stronger
      anti-tumor immune response in the body. However, the flexibility, safety and efficacy of
      using Microwave Ablation combine with Pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients are still unclear.
