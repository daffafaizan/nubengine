    
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a prospective, randomized, comparative
      effectiveness clinical trial to evaluate the role of non-invasive nocturnal ventilation in
      addition to usual care, compared to usual care alone in the management of adult COPD patients
      with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. The study will focus on the primary end-points
      of time to hospital re-admission for acute exacerbation of COPD and/or an episode of acute on
      chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, in addition to other clinically relevant outcomes
      including patient health-related quality of life, sleep quality indices, and gas exchange
      parameters. Approximately 300 BIDMC adult patients will be recruited and each patient
      monitored over a period of 12 months.
