      risk for PE will receive a bilateral LCUS before possible CTA/VQ imaging. The LCUS of the
      entire proximal leg including the popliteal fossa will be performed by an emergency medicine
      resident provider in conjunction with their attending. All positive studies will then be
      confirmed with a second ultrasound by the Albany Medical Center's vascular laboratory
      service. Patients with confirmed acute positive studies identifying a DVT will be treated for
      a presumed PE, which is the same treatment as that for the DVT. No CTA will be ordered from
      the ED. They will be anticoagulated and admitted to the hospital, with further management as
      per the inpatient hospital team. Patients with a negative emergency department LCUS done by
      the resident will receive either a CTA or a VQ (ventilation/perfusion) scan as per the
      initial treatment plan established by the attending physician.

      According to this protocol, patients discharged home by default must have had a negative CTA
      or VQ scan, and so PE was effectively ruled out. Therefore they will not require further
      follow up after discharge. However, we will follow patients who were admitted throughout
      their admission course. Through review of medical records, we will take note of any
      complications such as any issues with starting anticoagulation treatment without a CTA,
      misdiagnoses, whether a CTA was ordered later as a part of their course and why, and further
      details.
