      who are otherwise uncontrolled on first-line, oral antihistamine therapy. The skin lesion
      pathology in CIU shows a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes (both Th2 and Th1),
      eosinophils, and basophils, and closely resembles an allergen-induced late-phase reaction.
      Further, murine studies show that the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed
      on Th2 (CRTh2) pathway is important in leukocyte recruitment following allergen challenge of
      the skin. Our proposed hypothesis is that AZD1981 in CIU will reduce CRTh2-expressing,
      leukocyte recruitment to the skin and reduce leukocyte activation through CRTh2, thus
      reducing the signs and symptoms in CIU refractory to control with antihistamines.
