      undergo baseline clinical evaluation, echocardiography and cardiac CT imaging using a
      contrast-enhanced cardiac-gated method with a 64-section scanner. Trans-axial CT images
      comprising the whole heart volume will be exported in DICOM format. CT image processing will
      be performed and will be used to delineate the LV endocardial and/or epicardial geometries.
      These data will be imported into the RAPID-VT software and the 3D-electranatomical mapping
      system for image integration.

      During the VT ablation procedure, VT(s) induction will be performed. The VT(s) 12-lead ECG
      will be acquired by the RAPID-VT software and will be localized to the scar margin using the
      RAPID-VT software. Catheter ablation will be attempted at software-determined sites.

      Post procedure, patient will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months. That will include
      Remote ICD follow-up and telephone study visits. Follow-up at 6 months will include a clinic
      visit for assessment of heart failure status, ECG, ICD interrogation and changes in
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
