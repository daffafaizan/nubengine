      diabetic patients with bilateral critical limb ischemia (ankle-brachial index, ABI from 0.30
      to 0.60) and at least with one foot ulcer, but without malignant tumor or gangrene above the
      ankle and/or severe coronary, cerebral and renal vascular disease, were eligible for the
      participation in this trial. Eligible patients took part in this study on a voluntary basis.
      They were randomized into the A and B group by use of a randomization table. One lower limb
      in A group or in B group was selected randomly for BMMSCs or BMMNCs transplantation as BMMSCs
      or BMMNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected for placebo（normal
      saline ,NS）injection as NS group. The whole procedures of this clinical trial were blinded to
      both patients and investigators.
