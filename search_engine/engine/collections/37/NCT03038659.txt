      in clinical trials aimed at determining the success of interventions that lower risk factors
      for atherosclerosis and associated diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral
      artery diseases, like disease of cavernosal artery). The investigators hypothesized that the
      IMT of cavernosal artery would add to the predictive value of vasculogenic erectile
      dysfunction risk and outcomes. This study seeks to evaluate these hypotheses with our
      experience, investigating the predictive accuracy of Cavernosal Doppler ultrasound findings
      for discriminating patients with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.
