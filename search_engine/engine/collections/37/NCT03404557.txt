      AIEC.

      Investigator aimed to 1) better understand the differences between macrophages of CD
      patients, UC patients and healthy volunteers but also the impact of AIEC infection on these
      macrophages to provide key informations to detect and characterize the defect of these
      macrophages; 2) highlight one or several protein in CD macrophages that could represent, in a
      long term, a potential therapeutic target of CD.
