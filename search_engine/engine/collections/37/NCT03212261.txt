      Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. The 3RP is a group program that-through a
      variety of mind-body approaches, such as imagery, relaxation, and yoga-seeks to buffer stress
      and promote psychological resiliency and physical well-being.

      The 3RP has not yet been carried out with individuals who have recently completed treatment
      for lymphoma. As such, the investigators have adapted the standard 3RP program to target the
      specific needs of lymphoma patients who are transitioning off active treatment. The
      investigators are conducting this study to see if the adapted program, the 3RP-Lymphoma, is
      effective at reducing stress and stress-related symptoms for people who have completed
      treatment for lymphoma within the past two years. To develop the 3RP-Lymphoma, the
      investigators conducted interviews with patients who had recently completed treatment to
      learn about their experiences and their preferences for topics they would want to include in
      a program tailored to their specific needs. The current phase of the feasibility study will
      examine if the adapted program is feasible, acceptable, and helps promote stress management
      among lymphoma survivors who are in the early stages of completing cancer treatment.
