        -  the level recovery of the spine on the vertical axis (vertical displacement C7, cm)

        -  standing time, defined by the time between the start of the forward flexion and the
           beginning of the vertical stabilization phase (seconds)

        -  the success rate of the verticalization of the patient (the attempt is considered
           successful when the vertical position is held for 10 seconds).
