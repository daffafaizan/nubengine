    
      Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is a common and significant source of chronic low back pain. It
      has been broadly defined as pain located in the area of the SIJ that can be elicited by
      various pain provocation tests and relieved after infiltration of the joint with local
      anesthetic.

      Essentially, a patients own blood is collected and spun at varying speeds until it separates
      into 3 layers, one of which is the platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      injections are commonly used in various conditions including chronic tendinopathy, soft
      tissue injuries, and ligamentous injuries. More recently, there has been a greater interest
      in examining the efficacy of PRP as a treatment for musculoskeletal conditions affecting
      joints, such as osteoarthritis (OA). To the investigators' knowledge, there are currently no
      reported studies evaluating the efficacy of PRP for SIJ pain. Given the previously discussed
      application and evidence behind the use of PRP in the knee and hip joints, the investigators
      propose that PRP can also provide a similar solution for treating SIJ pain.
