      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of single agent decitabine and its toxicity using
      this schedule in this population of patients with solid tumors or lymphomas.

      II. Definition of the dose at which tumor DNA demethylation is optimum. III. Definition of
      the dose at which peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMN) demethylation is optimal.

      IV. Definition of decitabine pharmacokinetics and correlation of plasma concentrations with
      hypomethylation effects.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary assessment of decitabine efficacy (objective response).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 or on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.
