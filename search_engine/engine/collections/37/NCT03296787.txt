    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will evaluate the effect of
      varying degrees of renal function on the PK of TAK-954 following single-dose IV
      administration and to investigate the impact of hemodialysis on the PK of single IV doses of
      TAK-954.

      The study will enroll approximately up to 40 participants. Participants will be enrolled in
      one of the 5 treatment groups based on their renal impairment which will be determined based
      on Cockcroft and Gault (CG) equation as follows:

        -  Group A TAK-954 0.2 mg: Healthy Participants

        -  Group B TAK-954 0.2 mg: Mild Renal Impairment

        -  Group C TAK-954 0.2 mg: Moderate Renal Impairment

        -  Group D TAK-954 0.2 mg: Severe Renal Impairment or End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
           Without Hemodialysis

        -  Group E TAK-954 0.2 mg: End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) With Hemodialysis

      All participants in groups A to D will receive a single dose of TAK-954 and two single doses
      in Group E.

      Enrollment in Group B (Mild) and Group E (ESRD requiring dialysis) will be based on
      assessment of safety and available PK data from Group C and Group D respectively.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Czech Republic and Hungary. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 8 weeks. Participants in Groups A to D will remain
      confined to clinic for 3 days. For both treatments, participants in Group E requiring
      dialysis will remain confined to clinic for 3 days. All participants will make a final visit
      to the clinic 10-14 days after receiving their last dose for a follow-up assessment.
