        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of sargramostim (GM-CSF) by cytogenetic examination of
           the bone marrow in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who are not
           in complete cytogenetic remission after initial therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 3 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving no response
      receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or
      better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a
      partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an
      additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic
      response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
