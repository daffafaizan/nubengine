      potential future lager scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in Fragile X Syndrome.

      We hypothesize that aripiprazole will be effective in decreasing aggression, SIB, agitation,
      and interfering repetitive behavior commonly observed in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome.
      We also hypothesize that aripiprazole will be well tolerated.
