      Five hundred patients will be enrolled in the prospective portion of the study, all of whom
      will receive AVONEX. Patients will join the study by signing the attached Informed Consent
      Form (Appendix 1) at their doctor's office at the time of prescription. Innomar will provide
      the drug to approximately 40 new patients per month, so it will take about twelve to fourteen
      months to enroll all of the study subjects, assuming that all agree to participate. Once the
      recruitment period is over, it will take another 22 months to complete the study to the
      22-months point for the last subject.

      In the retrospective arm of the study, 500 chart reviews will be completed for patients who
      had participated in the MS Alliance program two (2) to three (3) years ago to determine
      persistence to therapy over a similar 22 month period.

      Study Objectives

      Primary Objectives:

      - To assess patients' compliance (as defined above) with AVONEX therapy in the prospective
      arm using self-reported patients questionnaire, as well as to compare patients' persistence
      on therapy (as defined above) between prospective and retrospective arms.

      Secondary Objective:

      - Evaluate patients' satisfaction with new MSA program.

      Patients and Methods

      Only patients enrolled in the MSA program will be included in this study. There will be no
      interventions above the current standard of care with the MSA program. Two distinct patient
      arms will exist for this study: the prospective arm and the retrospective (chart review) arm.
