      (i.e., 10cubes game difficulty level). The patients will perform five exergaming sessions,
      each session lasting for 1 hour, on five consecutive working days within the period of two
      weeks. The 10cubes task requires that all 10 cubes are moved within 2 minutes. Each patient
      will perform the task 5 times in succession with 1-2 minute breaks. The patients will be
      assessed using the Box & Blocks Test, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Delis-Kaplan
      Executive Function System (D-KEFS) and Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) before the first
      session and after the last session. In addition, the patients will fill in the Intrinsic
      Motivation Inventory (IMI) after each session. Based on statistical sample size calculations,
      the study plan is to include 80 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with
      multiple sclerosis randomising them separately, so that the groups will be balanced in terms
      of size and diagnosis.
