      a complex process. Different options carry with them different profiles of risks and
      benefits, and choosing the "right" therapy depends upon the patient's understanding of these
      risks and benefits and a consideration of the risks and benefits according to the patient's
      values and preferences. Studies have shown that patients' preferred therapy frequently
      disagrees with what is recommended by disease management guidelines.

      The purpose of this study is to examine an intervention to improve the quality of
      decision-making for NVAF compared to usual care. The intervention has several components,
      including: a) educating the patient about why values and preferences are important to the
      decision-making process, b) providing an individualized assessment of the risks and benefits
      of each of the treatment options, c) exploring patients' values and preferences as they
      relate to the risks and benefits of each of the treatment options, d) preparing the patient
      to discuss his/her preferences with the physician.
