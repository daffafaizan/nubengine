      hyperventilation was advocated for the treatment of PPHN. Newer therapies such as alkali
      infusion have been introduced without the support of randomized trial. In addition, in 1993,
      large controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide were in the planning stages. There is a lack
      of knowledge about how these diverse management styles impact patient outcome.

      Given the large number of treatments used in neonates with PPHN, we wished to document
      treatment of PPHN and outcomes of those treatments. Therefore, we performed a prospective,
      observational study to document prevalence of PPHN, the treatments and outcomes in a large
      population of infants treated at the 12 centers of the National Institute of Child Health and
      Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network. Further, we sought to compare treatment
      with hyperventilation to treatment with alkali infusion.
