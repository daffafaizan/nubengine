    
      Prospective enrolment of all patients with mitral valve insufficiency and restricted movement
      of leaflets during systole into a multicentric registry. Exact analysis of the underlying
      pathology using TTE with analysis of tenting parameters. In patients without
      contraindications, functional preoperative MRT to determine the functional reserve of
      ventricular function. Documentation of the quality of life of the patients using the SF12
      questionnaire before and after intervention. Documentation of follow-up data (SF12, TTE,
      NT-pro BNP) at 6 months, 1 and 2 years. Development of operative strategies to improve
      long-term outcomes in patients with severe LV dilation (typically accompanied by function
      mitral insufficiency type IIIb).
