        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and serum levels of caspofungin acetate in
           immunocompromised children with new-onset fever and neutropenia.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      age (2 to 11 vs 12 to 17).

      Patients receive caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily for 4 to 28 days in the
      absence of the need to start standard empirical antifungal therapy, a breakthrough fungal
      infection, any deterioration of patient condition, or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 16 patients (8 per stratum) receive caspofungin acetate at 1 of 2 dose levels.
      Caspofungin acetate is escalated to dose level 2 if no more than 1 of 8 patients experiences
      dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 1.

      Patients are followed at 14 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-64 patients (16 per dose level (cohort), 8 per stratum) will
      be accrued for this study.
