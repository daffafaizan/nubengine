      tissue, new techniques have been evaluated. The conventional systemic hemodynamic and
      oxygenation parameters are neither specific nor sensitive enough to detect regional
      perfusion. A more complete evaluation of tissue oxygenation can be achieved by adding
      noninvasive assessment of perfusion in peripheral tissues to global parameters. Noninvasive
      monitoring of peripheral perfusion could be a complementary approach that allows very early
      application throughout the hospital and interventional research. Orthogonal polarization
      spectral (OPS) is a non invasive technique that uses reflected light to produce real-time
      images of the microcirculation. The technology has been incorporated into a small hand-held
      videomicroscope which can be used in both research and clinical settings. OPS can assess
      tissue perfusion using the functional capillary density (FCD), i.e., the length of perfused
      capillaries per observation area (measured as cm/cm2).

      FCD is a very sensitive parameter for determining the status of nutritive perfusion to the
      tissue. So far, one of the most easily accessible sites in humans for peripheral perfusion
      monitoring is the mouth. OPS produces excellent images of the sublingual microcirculation by
      placing the probe under the tongue. Movement artifacts, semiquantitative measure of
      perfusion, the presence of various secretions such as saliva and blood, observer-related
      bias, and malfunction of the apparatus are some of the limitations of the technique.

      In the present study we will investigate the impact of postprandial insulin release on
      microvascular recruitment in the oral cavity.
