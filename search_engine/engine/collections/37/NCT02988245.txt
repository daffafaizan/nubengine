    
      Specific Aim:

      To determine the efficacy of genetically guided therapeutic options for pharmacologic
      treatment of essential hypertension, when compared to conventional standard of care (JNC 8
      guideline directed therapy).

      Hypothesis A: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly reduced time to optimal blood pressure control compared to conventional
      standard of care.

      Hypotheses B: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly greater absolute blood pressure reduction compared to conventional standard of
      care.

      Hypothesis C: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have to
      take fewer classes of blood pressure medicines in order to achieve blood pressure control.

      Secondary Aim:

      To determine if genetically guided blood pressure therapy reduces number of medication
      changes in patients with hypertension.

      Hypotheses: Patients randomized to genetically guided blood pressure therapy will have
      significantly less medication changes.
