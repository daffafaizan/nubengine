      HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to deliver
      a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to
      85-90°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted
      area.

      In a previous european feasibility study performed at 4 sites (France and Bulgaria), 51
      fibroadenomas in 42 patients were treated. The HIFU treatment was well tolerated and showed
      efficacy (mean volume reduction of 72.5% +/-16.7 at 12 months follow-up.
