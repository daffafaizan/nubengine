      Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are believed to be the dominating antigens causing
      bronchospasm and anaphylaxis during anaesthesia. Avoidance of these drugs, however, renders
      compromised intubating conditions and higher morbidity with conventional Macintosh
      laryngoscopy. Thus, we compared Macintosh laryngoscopy with Bonfils intubation fibrescope
      without administering NMBDs.

      METHODS:

      Eighty male and female patients scheduled for elective surgery, aged 15 to 60 years, ASA
      class II or I, non-obese, with lower risk for difficult intubation were enrolled in this
      study. They were randomly allocated into the Bonfils group or the Macintosh group (40 each).
      Following adequate hydration and preoxygenation, midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 was administered,
      followed by alfentanil 20 Âµg kg-1, lidocaine 1.5 mg kg-1, and propofol 2 mg kg-1
      intravenously. Tracheal intubation was then carried out using Bonfils intubation fibrescope
      (Bonfils group) or employing conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy (Macintosh group). The
      primary outcome measure was the intubating condition, with mean arterial blood pressure and
      heart rate as secondary outcomes.
