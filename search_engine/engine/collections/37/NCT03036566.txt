      as requiring replacement of a single tooth. All the bridges will be made from the same high
      strength ceramic material (emaxCAD/Ivoclar) using a computer to make the entire bridge. All
      the crowns will be cemented using the most current marketed version of the manufacturer's
      adhesive resin cement (MultiLink Automix/Ivoclar). At each recall appointment an evaluation
      of the bridge will be completed as well as clinical photographs, an intraoral digital scan,
      and impression of the bridge. The purpose of the study is to measure how well the high
      strength bridges function over an extended period of time.
