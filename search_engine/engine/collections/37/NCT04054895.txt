      echocardiographic response to that obtained with biventricular therapy. Activation time
      shortening with permanent physiological pacing has not been studied.

      This study will randomize 70 patients to a strategy of: biventricular pacing versus
      physiological pacing.

      LEVEL-AT study will analyze the following parameters in the 2 groups: shortening of the QRS,
      activation time with electrocardiographic imaging, echocardiographic asynchrony and
      ventricular function and clinical parameters (NYHA functional class, mortality and heart
      failure hospitalization).

      Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic imaging follow-up
      will be performed for 1 year.
