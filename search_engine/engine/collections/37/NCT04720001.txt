      Florbetaben F18 is a radioactive tracer that binds to particles in your brain. This process
      displays activity in the brain. Florbetaben F18 is a PET amyloid imaging agent approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to estimate the amount of beta-amyloid
      plaque in adult patients who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of
      cognitive decline. The purpose of this research is to better understand how dementia affects
      activity in different parts of the brain. Currently, the scientific community is limited by
      how well it can see inside the brain. The use of a PET scan better helps us understand what
      the brain looks like in a diseased state. Participation in the study will help to understand
      what brain activity looks like, especially around language regions.
