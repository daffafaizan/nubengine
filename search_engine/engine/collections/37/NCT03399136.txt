      (AEX) training in older HIV-infected adults. Funding was provided by K23 AG024896 (PI,
      Oursler) and the UMB Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center P60 AG12583 (PI,
      Goldberg).

      The central hypothesis was that high-intensity AEX training is well-tolerated and
      significantly increases aerobic capacity in older HIV-infected adults.

      The study met its objectives:

        1. Scientific AIMS met:

             1. High-intensity AEX training significantly increases aerobic capacity

             2. Both moderate-intensity and high-intensity AEX training improve ambulatory function
                and endurance.

             3. Activity of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes is reduced, and associated with
                aerobic capacity.

        2. Feasibility Objectives met:

             1. AEX training is safe and well-tolerated in older HIV-infected adults.

             2. Skeletal muscle punch biopsy is safe and well-tolerated in older HIV-infected
                adults.

             3. Preliminary data was collected on plasma biomarkers of inflammation.
