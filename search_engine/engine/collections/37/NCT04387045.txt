      thoughts are part of both. The biological correlates of psychological and emotional life are
      not yet fully clarified, so in this study we wonder about the association between tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, cortisol, and peripheral glucose levels with depression stress,
      measured negative thoughts, and induced guilt.This is a randomized intervention study. At
      baseline, participants complete the Beck Depression Inventory, the Automatic Negative
      Thoughts Scale (ATQ-N), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). The intervention consists of
      a written task about situations that involved feelings of guilt or neutral situations. Saliva
      and dextrostix samples are taken before the 20-minute written task, at the end, dextrostix
      and saliva samples are performed again, finally a blood sample is taken.
