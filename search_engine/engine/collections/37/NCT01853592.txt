      coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is improved by using a higher versus a lower
      dose of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. We will compare two doses of an intravascular
      contrast agent (Gadofosveset, 0.03 and 0.06 mmol/kg) in this pilot dosing study. Healthy
      participants will be recruited who do not have a clinical indication for MR angiography but
      do have safety clearance for IV gadolinium contrast and MR scanning.

      Subjects will be evaluated in order to determine if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and
      contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of the coronary arteries is increased for the higher dose
      contrast agent. Parameters will be compared with paired t-testing for significance.
