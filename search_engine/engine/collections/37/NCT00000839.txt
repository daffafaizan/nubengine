      HIV infection. Although ddI has been approved for use in HIV-infected adults and older
      children, the safety and pharmacokinetics of ddI in pregnant women has not yet been
      determined.

      Patients receive a single IV dose of ddI on day 1 and pharmacokinetics values are determined.
      At least 48 hours but no more than 1 week after the IV dose, patients receive an oral dose,
      and oral pharmacokinetics are obtained for 8 hours. Oral ddI is then administered every 12
      hours until labor commences and then after delivery, every 12 hours until 6 weeks postpartum.
      During labor and delivery, patients receive a loading dose of ddI followed by continuous
      infusion. Pharmacokinetics are obtained during infusion and also at 6 weeks postpartum. AS
      PER AMENDMENT 11/24/97: Maternal IV pharmacokinetic studies will not be performed after ddI
      IV formulation has expired (11/30/97). Maternal and cord samples will be required regardless
      of whether mother has received continuous IV ddI during labor.
