      stiffness, limited joint mobility, muscle weakness, foot deformities, thus leading to
      excessive plantar pressure . The presence of an increased plantar pressure and the loss of
      sensation is a serious risk factor in the risk of development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
      Therefore, appropriate shoes and insoles are recommended to redistribute high peak pressure
      (PP) and reduce pressure time integral (PTI). Shoe modifications and insoles, when used, is
      effective to prevent the recurrence of plantar ulcer.

      Patients presenting with mild or absence of neuropathy have lower PP compared to those having
      more severe stages of neuropathy. However, these findings are not unambiguous. In a study
      patients walked in a standardize speed of 1.2 m/s, and it was only under the first metatarsal
      phalangeal joint that the group with neuropathy had higher PP compared to patients with
      diabetes without neuropathy. In the remaining parts of the foot sole, there was no
      difference. In a study comparing custom-made insoles and prefabricated insoles used in a
      walking shoe, a cohort of patients with no history of foot ulcers was studied and there were
      no differences in PP for the sub groups with and without neuropathy.

      More knowledge is needed regarding risk factors such as neuropathy, gait deviation and
      differences in kinematics and kinetics in order to prevent the onset of the "first" plantar
      ulcer.
