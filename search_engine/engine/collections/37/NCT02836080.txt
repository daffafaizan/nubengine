    
      This study is a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) with random allocation occurring
      within each hospital site to either treatment as usual (TAU) (4 out-patient hospital sites)
      or treatment at one of 3 community-based Integrated Collaborative Care Teams (ICCTs). A total
      of 500 youth aged 14-18 with mental health and/or addictions (MHA) concerns, referred for
      out-patient services at one of four local hospitals, will be randomized to receive ICCT care
      versus TAU. For each youth, a primary caregiver will also be recruited into the study, if
      available.

      With wide inclusion criteria and a design meant to emulate a "real world" setting, this study
      will rigorously evaluate a service delivery model composed of multiple interventions for
      youth presenting with a broad range of MHA problems. The ICCT is expected to result in better
      MHA outcomes, show better performance indicators, and be more cost-effective than TAU.
