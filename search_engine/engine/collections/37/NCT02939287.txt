    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority phase 3 study conducted to determine an
      appropriate anti-emetic regimen for patients receiving melphalan for an autologous stem cell
      transplant (SCT). Candidates for this trial will include patients aged 18-80 years with
      hematologic malignancies receiving high dose melphalan as part of a conditioning regimen for
      an autologous stem cell transplant. Patients will be enrolled in 3 arms. Patients in Arm A
      will receive an aprepitant containing anti-emetic regimen. Patients in Arm B will receive an
      olanzapine containing anti-emetic regimen. Patients in Arm C will receive an aprepitant plus
      olanzapine containing anti-emetic regimen. Patients must be able to tolerate oral
      medications.

      Patients will be carefully monitored for rates of emesis, nausea, and mucositis. Any adverse
      events will be recorded. Impact on quality of life will also be assessed. A total of 184
      patients will be accrued to each arm. It is anticipated that the accrual period will last
      approximately 2-3 years. The primary endpoint of this study is a complete response, defined
      as no emesis and no rescue therapy within 120 hours of melphalan administration.
