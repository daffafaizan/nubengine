      the opportunity to receive treatment from their pediatric primary care provider. Providers
      will either use their existing anxiety approaches or will use those approaches combined with
      extra communication skills designed to promote patient and parent engagement in care.
      Children will be seen for up to 4 30-minute visits at 2 week intervals, with a follow-up
      telephone call 3 months later to asses the impact of treatment. Children with more severe
      anxiety (or those whose parents so desire) will be referred for specialized mental health
      care.
