      healthy volunteers. Subjects will have an initial screening visit where they will have the
      opportunity to sign informed consent. Those who choose to do so will undergo a series of
      screening tests to determine whether they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study.
      Those who qualify will return in 1-7 days for a baseline set of assessments which will
      include: having MRI imaging carried out on the first day (structural MRI, fMRI during the
      Monetary Incentive Delay Task, and Resting State Connectivity fMRI), and on the second day
      having an arterial line placed; undergoing a [11C]-Carfentanil (a synthetic, highly specific
      mu opioid receptor (mu-OR) agonist) PET mu opioid receptor occupancy study; undergoing a
      LY2879788 ( radioactive biochemical substance (in particular, a ligand) that is used for
      diagnosis or for research-oriented study of the receptor systems of the body) PET Kappa
      Occupancy Study with a single blood sample taken prior to the scan, a sample during the scan,
      and samples taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 minutes after the scan to determine
      whole blood radioactivity, plasma radioactivity, and un-metabolized tracer fraction over time
      which are needed to determine the input function to the kinetic model for analysis of
      parameter estimation needed to compute receptor occupancy from the PET scan data; completing
      a SHAPS; and undergoing a PRT. Note that arterial line placement and serial blood samples are
      only needed for the LY2879788 scans because, unlike for [11C]-Carfentanil, there is no
      accepted reference region in the brains of humans for this ligand which necessitates the
      development of a kinetic model for scan parameter estimation. The next day subjects will
      begin taking LY2456302 10 mg daily at 11 am and return to the research unit 6 days later for
      a safety assessment visit. Subjects will then return to the research unit 7 days later during
      which they will undergo interval history and safety assessments, take their medication at 11
      am, and then have MRI imaging at 1:30 pm. A blood sample to determine LY2456302 level will be
      obtained immediately before and after the MRI imaging session so that we can determine the
      relationship between ventral striatal activation during the task and serum level of
      LY2456302. They will then return to the research unit the following day where they will take
      their last dose of study medication at 11 am and at 1:30 pm will undergo a [11C]-Carfentanil
      PET mu opioid receptor occupancy study. A blood sample to determine LY2456302 level will be
      obtained immediately before and after the PET imaging session so that we can determine the
      relationship between receptor occupancy and serum level of study drug. The following day
      subjects will have an arterial line placed and undergo LY2879788 PET Kappa Occupancy Study at
      9:30 am with a single blood sample taken prior to the scan and samples taken at 15, 30, 45,
      60, 75, 90, and 120 minutes after the scan to determine whole blood radioactivity, plasma
      radioactivity, and un-metabolized tracer fraction over time which are needed to determine the
      input function to the kinetic model for analysis of parameter estimation needed to compute
      receptor occupancy from the PET scan data. A blood sample to determine LY2456302 level will
      also be obtained immediately before and after the PET imaging session so that we can compute
      the relationship between serum level and receptor occupancy. Subjects will then return 6 days
      later for a safety assessment after which their participation in the study will end.
