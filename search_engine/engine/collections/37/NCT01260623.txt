      corticosteroid drugs early in the course of the exacerbation. These drugs decrease symptoms,
      provide faster time to recovery and improve of quality of life. However, there is 100%
      variability in a child's response to corticosteroids at a standard dose which is based on
      primarily on adult studies. The pharmacokinetic analysis or the process by which a drug is
      metabolized by the body is the first step to determine the proper dose.

      Patients between the ages of 2 and 16 years with asthma exacerbations will be recruited from
      the pediatric emergency department. After the patients get the drugs, blood samples will be
      drawn over 8 hours to get the following parameters: maximum concentration reached in the
      body, the time for the drug to be eliminated from the body, how long the drug stays in the
      body, how much of the drug is found in the urine after it is given, and concentration of
      metabolites or breakdown products in urine and blood. These are the parameters needed to make
      the pharmacokinetic profile and is the first step towards appropriate dosing of these two
      medications for asthma exacerbations in children.
