      program that targets patients with symptomatic chronic respiratory disease. PR integrates
      exercise and training interventions into a personalized treatment program. PR has become an
      important component of the general treatment strategy in patients with high-risk surgical
      diseases such as lung resection. It helps patients return to normal not only physically, but
      also emotionally and mentally. In patients with lung cancer, preoperative PR increases
      exercise capacity, decreases post-operative morbidity and mortality. Although it is reported
      that the PR program applied in the post-operative period increases physical performance and
      improves the quality of life, referral of patients in need of the PR unit is less than 25%.
      There is a need to increase the awareness of both pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons about
      the benefits of the PR program, which is a non-pharmacological and effective intervention.

      The investigators have had two objectives in this study. 1- To examine the effectiveness of
      PR applied after lung resection in patients with lung cancer, 2- To determine whether the
      respiratory exercise training given to patients who could not participate in the PR program
      is effective.

      An 8-week comprehensive outpatient PR program will applied to half of 66 patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer who underwent lung resection, and the other half received
      respiratory exercise training. After the intervention, the results of both groups will
      compare.
