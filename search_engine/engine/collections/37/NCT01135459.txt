      beginning with a baseline visit in which randomization was completed and study drug treatment
      began (visits 2 through 7), and a final assessment was performed 4 weeks after the last dose
      of study drug (visit 8 [week 24 or early termination]). Patients were randomized to receive
      either CEP-33457 or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Plasma samples for measurement of
      study drug concentration were collected in a subset of patients and study drug was
      administered at each study visit until the final visit. The dose of background steroid
      medication may have been increased, if needed, to treat the patient for minor fluctuations in
      lupus disease activity. One interim analysis was conducted when at least 80 patients
      completed week 12 or had been withdrawn from the study. Patients who completed the treatment
      period returned to the study center 4 weeks after the last dose had been administered for
      final procedures and assessments. Final procedures and assessments for patients who withdrew
      from the study before 20 weeks of treatment were performed at the last visit. Final
      procedures and assessments for patients who participated in the study beyond week 24 were to
      be performed at the next regularly scheduled visit. Patients who complete the study will be
      eligible for participation in the 12-month open-label study (study C33457/3075; herein
      referred to as study 3075) to assess continued effectiveness and safety of the CEP-33457
      treatment.
