    
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      combination therapy with cobimetinib and hydroxychloroquine, with or without atezolizumab in
      patients with KRAS-mutated advanced malignancies. Given that the pre-clinical and clinical
      benefit from this combination is from within poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (PDAC)
      animal models and human subjects with PDAC and duodenal cancer, we will include at least 12
      of the 18 evaluable subjects from PDAC and/or colorectal malignancies. The phase 2 portion of
      the study will be amended after preliminary safety and efficacy results from phase 1 and
      other ongoing clinical trials have been analyzed and a summary incorporated within the
      protocol as an amendment including a rationale of the cohorts to be tested.
