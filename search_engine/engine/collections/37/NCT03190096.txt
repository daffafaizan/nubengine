      enrolled in our study. After PVI is obtained and proven by entrance- and exit block, the SVC
      will be mapped for potentials. If the SVC exhibits electrical activity, isolation will be
      attempted performing a single maximum 180 seconds balloon application. A single 180 seconds
      application is known to produce a durable lesion. Performing a combined approach (PVI
      together with SVC isolation) using the same cryoballoon requires no additional vascular
      access. Therefore no significant raise in complications is to be expected. During a second
      generation CBA the described rate of complications is to be estimated around 2%. Transient
      phrenic nerve palsy in 7.2 %, but reversible in virtually all patients within the end of the
      procedure.

      To prevent nervous injury the phrenic nerve (PN) will be tested during ablation of the SVC,
      in the same fashion as performed systematically during ablation of the right sided pulmonary
      veins.
