      variable of therapeutic failure and adverse events, associated with voriconazole. A total of
      146 patients with risk of undergoing invasive aspergillosis who potentially will receive
      voriconazole will be recruited, and CYP2C19 will be genotyped. If the patient receives
      voriconazole finally, he will be randomized (1:1 experimental/control). In the experimental
      arm patients receive dose according to pharmacogenetic algorithm including CYP2C19 genotype
      and clinical and demographic information. In the control arm patients receive dose according
      to clinical practice guidelines. In addition, a Spain national health system (NHS)
      point-of-view cost-effectiveness evaluation is going to be done. Direct costs calculation of
      each arm will be done.
