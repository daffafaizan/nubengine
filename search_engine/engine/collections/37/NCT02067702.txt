      performed.

      Three non-pharmacological assessments will be performed at different temperature to the upper
      limbs. The first will be a baseline assessment with upper limbs maintaining a normal body
      temperature (96-98°F). The second assessment will be performed with upper limbs at a
      temperature of 59°F and the third will be performed at a temperature of 80°F for a period of
      10 minutes. At the end of 10 minutes, tremor measurements will be 15, 40, and 60 minutes.

        1. Assessments will include the Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), Handwriting Assessment Battery
           (HAB) and the Functional Dexterity Test (FDT).

        2. The Bagnoli and Trigno EMG systems will record surface EMG signals from muscles and
           accelerometer readings.
