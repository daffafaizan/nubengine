    
      Main objective is the economic comparison Intrabeam® system versus EBRT, in terms of real
      costs. Costs will be taken into account:

        -  of equipment,

        -  of staff,

        -  of transport.

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  Compare local-regional survival without recurrence with conventional irradiation

        -  Analyze the rate of early and late complications

        -  Impact of intraoperative irradiation on the esthetic outcome and quality of life of
           patients

      Schedule of the visits :

      RIOP arm : Surgery with Intrabeam®. A first visit will be scheduled at 2 months from surgery
      then at 6 months then every 6 months for 5 years, then every year after 5 years.

      RTE arm: surgery, EBRT over 33 sessions then visit at 6 months then every 6 months 6 for 5
      years, then every year after 5 years.

      In RIOP ARM, additional EBRT may be performed +/- chemotherapy if the treatment received is
      insufficient.

      Quality of life will be assessed in each treatment arm at inclusion before randomization, 2
      months after surgery, every 6 months for 5 years and every year after 5 years using quality
      of life questionnaires: Euroqol EQ 5D, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC)-QlQ-C30 and BR23 module specific for breast cancer.
