      obstructed, making it difficult to breathe. Millions of people in the United States have
      COPD, and it is the fourth leading cause of death in the country. Symptoms include coughing,
      excess mucus production, shortness of breath and wheezing. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis
      are illnesses associated with COPD. Emphysema is usually the result of many years of
      cigarette smoking, but it remains unknown exactly how cigarette smoking causes emphysema. The
      purpose of this study is to examine current and former smokers who have emphysema and those
      who do not have emphysema to determine if certain biomarkers or genetic factors are
      associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. Specifically, study researchers
      will examine various genes and two proteins, membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase
      (MT1-MMP) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), to determine the role
      they play in the development of emphysema.

      Participants will attend one study visit, which will include a medical history review, a
      blood collection, lung function testing, a 6-minute walk test, and a chest computed
      tomography (CT) scan. A portion of blood will be stored for current and future genetic
      research. Participants will also complete questionnaires to collect information on
      activities, health, and quality of life. Some participants will be invited to return for a
      bronchoscopy, which is a procedure that allows a doctor to sample the inside of the lungs.
      Study researchers will contact all participants at the end of the study to collect follow-up
      medical information.
