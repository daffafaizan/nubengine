      asymptomatic, but can also lead to anaemia, pain and pressure symptoms. It is the commonest
      indication for hysterectomy, especially abdominal hysterectomy. Currently, the use of
      hormonal treatment is associated with side effects including gastrointestinal upset,
      bloating, weight gain and thromboembolic risks. The main stay for treatment relies on
      surgery.

      Furthermore, the use of minimal invasive surgeries is limited by the size of the fibroids.
      Preoperative use of Gonadotrophic Releasing Hormone analogues (GnRHa) is effective in
      shrinkage of the uterine leiomyomas and reduction of uterine bleeding. However,
      postmenopausal symptoms including hot flushes, vaginal dryness are profound.

      Ulipristal acetate (UPA), previously named CDB-2914, is a selective progesterone-receptor
      modulator (SPRM). It binds to the progesterone receptors with high affinity. It inhibits
      follicular development and ovulation, while it has no significant effects on estradiol levels
      and antiglucocorticoid activity. Preoperative use of Ulipristal for symptomatic uterine
      fibroids has been investigated in randomized controlled study with improvement in terms of
      uterine bleeding, fibroids volume, pre-operative anaemia and symptoms severity. However there
      is still lacking evidence in terms of long term safety and efficacy. Also there is lack of
      evidence in Chinese population.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect and safety on preoperative use of
      Ulipristal on fibroid.
