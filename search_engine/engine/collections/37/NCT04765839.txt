      conducted prior to widespread vaccine availability to the general public. Four CLs and social
      networks (cluster of 10 per network) will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention
      immediately or after a delay of 2 weeks. Intervention participants will be invited to a
      closed social media group on the platform of their choice. CLs, selected for trustworthiness
      within vulnerable populations, will disseminate community-informed COVID-19 vaccine messages
      to members of their social networks and engage in bidirectional communication with CEnR
      partners to refine messages. At baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, participants will be surveyed
      to assess knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines, including intention to be
      vaccinated.
