      life threatening haemorrhage and death from rupture. This involves a small cut in the femoral
      artery in the groin and under imaging guidance, the insertion of wires and a stent into the
      thoracic aorta.

      Prior to insertion into the patient, stents are flushed with saline to remove air and prevent
      air reaching the brain that can cause a form of brain injury known as vascular brain
      infarction (VBI). However, our preliminary clinical data suggests that saline flushing is not
      effective at de-airing stent-grafts used in TEVAR.

      Carbon-dioxide has been used extensively in cardiac surgery to displace air from the chest
      cavity to prevent peri-procedural cerebral air embolisation. We hypothesise that flushing the
      stent-grafts with carbon-dioxide may be better at removing air from the stent-grafts than
      saline flush.

      Patients undergoing TEVAR will be approached to participate in this study. After written
      consent is obtained, participants will be randomised to undergo (TEVAR) with carbon dioxide
      or saline flushing of stent-grafts. Pre-operatively, participants will undergo a
      diffusion-weighted MRI brain scan, full neurological examination and neurocognitive testing.
      Intra-operatively, participants will undergo continuous transcranial doppler monitoring (TCD)
      of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to look for cerebral air embolisation at stent-graft
      deployment phase of TEVAR. Post-operatively, particpants will undergo another
      diffusion-weighted brain MRI within 72 hours post-procedure, neurological examination for the
      first 7 days, and neurocognitive tests prior to discharge, and at 6-weeks and 6-month
      follow-up.
