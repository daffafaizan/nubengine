      observational cohort study. Enrolled in the Second Division of Liver Diseases, Beijing Ditan
      Hospital, Capital Medical University, via interferon combined with ribavirin (PR) antiviral
      therapy (PR treatment for 6 months or more) and / or direct acting antivirals (DAAs ) For
      patients with chronic hepatitis C treated, collect baseline, antiviral treatment and
      discontinuation follow-up data of patients before antiviral treatment, and follow-up
      observations of patients enrolled every 3-6 months. Collect clinical data such as clinical
      biochemistry, HCV RNA and serological indicators (anti-HCV), AFP, and liver imaging (liver
      ultrasound) during the study period. The virological response and clinical outcomes of
      chronic hepatitis C antiviral therapy were observed for at least 144 weeks. The incidence of
      liver cancer and decompensated liver cirrhosis after discontinuation of the drug was the main
      evaluation index. The aim is to explore long-term virological response and clinical outcomes,
      and elucidate its influencing factors.
