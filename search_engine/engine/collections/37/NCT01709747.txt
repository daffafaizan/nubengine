    
      This is an open-label, single-arm safety study to evaluate the safety of hydromorphone
      hydrochloride given by continuous intrathecal infusion using an implantable pump device. This
      study will enroll both subjects on a current opioid intrathecal medication as well as na√Øve
      subjects now current on intrathecal opioid medications. All subjects currently on intrathecal
      opioid treatment will be converted from their current intrathecal therapy to intrathecal
      hydromorphone hydrochloride according to standard medical practice. After an optimal dose for
      pain relief is achieved, subjects will remain on therapy for a total of 12 months or until
      discontinuation from the study. During this continuous dosing period, dose adjustments (up or
      down) are permitted to manage pain or side effects provided a maximum dose of 10 mg/day is
      not exceeded. Subjects will be assessed for pain intensity using a visual analog scale of
      pain intensity (VASPI) instrument at each study visit.

      Subjects will be evaluated for side effects and clinical complications associated with the
      use of intrathecal hydromorphone. Events will be classified by intrathecal drugs used and
      concentrations.
