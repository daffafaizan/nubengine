      2:2:1:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of talaporfin sodium activated by light at one of
      two light doses or placebo (saline) with light at either dose. Follow-up is planned for 52
      weeks from the day of treatment, with assessment at 12 weeks for change in International
      Prostate Symptom Score and continued follow-up during the remaining 40 weeks to assess
      duration of effect, need for any intervention, and longer-term safety.
