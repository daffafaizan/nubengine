      psychological and economic consequences. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the
      usefulness of an intervention utilizing the NintendoTM Wii console in order to improve
      balance, thereby decreasing both the fear of falling as well as the number of falls, and to
      evaluate the correlation between balance as determined by the console and the value obtained
      in the Tinetti tests and the one foot stationary test.

      Methods/Design: This is a controlled, randomized clinical trial of individual assignment,
      carried out on patients over 70 years in age, from five primary care centers in the city of
      Matar√≥ (Barcelona). 380 patients were necessary for the intervention group that carried out
      the balance board exercises in 2 sessions per week for a 3 month period, and 380 patients in
      the control group who carried out their usual habits. Balance was evaluated using the Tinetti
      test, the one foot stationary test and with the console, at the start of the study, at the
      end of the intervention (3 months) and one year later. Quarterly telephone follow-up was also
      conducted to keep track of falls and their consequences.

      Discussion: The study aimed to connect the community with a technology that may be an easy
      and fun way to assist the elderly in improving their balance without the need to leave home
      or join rehabilitation groups, offering greater comfort for this population and decreasing
      healthcare costs since there is no need for specialized personnel.
