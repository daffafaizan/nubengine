      trial which will assess the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma given
      from the 3rd to 14th day of illness after the onset of symptoms in preventing ICU admission
      among hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to standard of care. Consecutive patients with
      COVID-19 admitted to the UP Philippine General Hospital will be offered participation into
      the study. Patients in the intervention group will receive one dose of type-specific
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (500 mL collected by whole blood donation or standard
      pheresis at the UP-PGH blood bank from a volunteer who recovered from COVID-19). The primary
      safety endpoints include serious adverse events judged to be related to convalescent plasma.
      The study also aims to compare anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and rates, levels, and
      duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR between the intervention and
      control groups.
