      before and after CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy elicits cellular and humoral immunity to
      pneumococcus in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphomas. All the participants
      will receive the same treatment. Immunoglobulins (IgG) against pneumococcal serotypes not
      included in the vaccine will be served as an internal control. Treatment includes the same
      dose (0.5ml) of PCV13 one time prior to apheresis followed by two times after CAR T cell
      therapy
