      methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, and patients survival is challenging for gliomas. With
      the development of artificial intelligence, much more potential lies in the preoperative
      conventional/advanced MR imaging (T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging, FLAIR,
      contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging),
      and in the histopathology images of HE slices of gliomas could be excavated to aid prediction
      of molecular pathology and patients' survival of gliomas. This study aims to collect
      clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and genetic data including detailed clinical
      parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular pathology (1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT
      methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, etc) and genetic data (Whole exome sequencing, RNA
      sequencing, proteomics, etc), and seeks to construct and refine algorithms that able to
      predict molecular pathology or clinical outcomes of glioma patients based on MR images and
      histopathology images, as well as revealing related mechanisms from genetic perspective.
