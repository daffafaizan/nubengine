      characteristics, management and outcomes of patients treated with Rivaroxaban. The RIVER
      registry is observational, decisions on patient management are determined by the health care
      professional and the patient and not by the protocol. Patients are therefore treated
      according to normal local practice and the drug label/relevant product information of any
      drugs administered to them.
