      the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was obtained and each patient was
      subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological examination. All patients were informed
      about the nature of the study, the surgical procedure involved, potential benefits and risks
      associated with the surgical procedure and written informed consent were obtained from all
      patients.

      All the patients were treated with immediate implants. The injectable -PRF was coated on
      implants as well as injected in the socket in both the maxillary and mandibular anterior
      region. The clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, three months and
      six months postoperatively.
