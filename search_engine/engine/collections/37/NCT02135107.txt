    
      This is randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that investigates the
      efficacy and safety of rabeprazole 10mg twice daily over a period of 52 weeks. The 8-week
      Treatment Period (unblinded) was followed by a 52-week Maintenance Period (blinded).
      Participants with cure (modified Los Angeles Classification Grade N or Grade M) at the final
      endoscopy of the Treatment Period were entered into the Maintenance Period. Participants
      without cure were discontinued from the study. The participants in the Treatment Period were
      randomized to take Arm C or Arm D at a ratio of 1:1. The non-recurrence rate as
      endoscopically confirmed at 52 weeks shall be the primary end point, and this shall be
      examined through a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that
      investigates the efficacy and safety of rabeprazole 10mg twice daily over a period of 52
      weeks.
