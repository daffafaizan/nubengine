      undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer to examine the feasibility of a 12-week
      lifestyle intervention that addresses diet and physical activity and to explore the impact on
      behavioral, biological and psychosocial outcomes.

      Procedure Summary. Patients who are eligible are consented by the research coordinator, after
      which a baseline assessment will be scheduled. The baseline assessment requires 60 minutes
      and includes questionnaires, height/weight, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and
      phlebotomy. Participants will also wear the Fitbit for one week to establish baseline
      activity level. After the baseline assessment, women are then randomly assigned to: the
      12-week "Stay on Track" lifestyle intervention or the 12-week self-guided control. Both
      groups complete a post-intervention and a 3-month follow-up visit identical to their baseline
      assessment. Self-guided controls can utilize their Fitbit and will receive informative
      binders 24 weeks' post-intervention.
