    
      Background:

        -  Disorders of T-cell proliferation and/or dysregulation (TCP/D) can lead to T-cell
           lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmunity, infection, and aberrant immune activation
           with resulting organ dysfunction, morbidity, and mortality.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure disorders
           of TCP/D.

        -  Subjects with TCP/D may be at higher risk for graft rejection and/or disease relapse.

      Primary Objective:

      - Separately by arm: To estimate the percentage of recipients with >50% donor T cell
      chimerism and graft-failure free survival at day +180 post-HCT

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years

        -  TCP/D deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant HCT that meets at least one of
           the criteria below:

             -  Identified germline T-cell activating mutation in the PI3k pathway

             -  Identified ADA2 deficiency (biallelic mutations in CECR1 (ADA2) and/or
                phenotypically with low ADA2 level) leading to neutropenia requiring chronic GCSF
                therapy or to transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia

             -  T-cell infiltration of liver, spleen, lymph nodes, marrow, lungs, gut, or other
                organs by T cells, as evidenced by laboratory, radiographic, and/or anatomic
                pathology evaluation, resulting in organ dysfunction and/or organomegaly

             -  Latent herpesvirus infection in T lymphocytes

             -  History of or active evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

             -  Recurrent or prolonged fevers attributed to immune dysregulation

             -  T-cell population in blood and/or marrow with immunophenotype of large granular
                lymphocytes (LGL), with or without clonality or lymphocytosis

             -  T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of an underlying immune defect

             -  Immune-mediated cytopenias of one lineage requiring transfusion or GCSF support or
                of 2 or 3 lineages with or without transfusion or support

             -  Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

        -  At least one potentially suitable 7-8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an
           HLA-haploidentical related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  HIV negative

        -  Disease status: Subjects with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation
           if possible, although the aggressive nature of many of these diseases necessitates the
           potential need to enroll subjects onto study and treat with standard therapies before
           proceeding to protocol therapy (HCT)

      Design:

        -  There will be two arms that vary in conditioning intensity - an immunosuppression-only
           conditioning (IOC) arm for high-risk subjects and a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
           arm.

        -  IOC arm: equine anti-thymocyte globulin (e-ATG) 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13,
           pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days -9 and -5, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on
           days -9 through -2

        -  RIC arm: e-ATG 40 mg/kg/day IV on days -14 and -13, pentostatin 4 mg/m^2/day IV on days
           -11 and -7, low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV,
           pharmacokinetically dosed, on days -3 and -2.

           -- Subjects will be assigned to the IOC arm if there is significant end-organ
           dysfunction present and it is felt that a conditioning regimen that includes busulfan
           would likely be associated with intolerable or life-threatening toxicities for the
           subject. Subjects will also be assigned to the IOC arm if they possess a DNA repair
           defect, telomere maintenance defect, or familial cancer predisposition syndrome that
           necessitates limiting chemotherapy as much as possible to prevent future cancer risk.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cells are the preferred graft source, although bone marrow is
           permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis:

             -  PTCy on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day on RIC arm and 25 mg/kg/day on the IOC arm,
                with the option of 25 mg/kg/day on the RIC arm), tacrolimus on days +5 through +90,
                and MMF on days +5 through +25.
