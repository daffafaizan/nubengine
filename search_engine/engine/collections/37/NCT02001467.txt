      and obstetricians but shifts in responsibility in patient care may result in lack of
      continuity of care. This may, in turn, result in threats to patient safety and delays in
      initiation of treatment due to long wait times.

      This study examined the effects of simulation-based ultrasound training on the management of
      women with symptoms of pre-mature onset of labor. 12 midwives were randomized to
      simulation-based ultrasound training focusing on cervical assessment or no training
      (controls). The midwives in the intervention group were trained to an expert criterion on a
      high-fidelity transvaginal ultrasound simulator. Once this level was attained, they continued
      clinical training until proficiency in performing cervical scans independently. Proficiency
      was determined using a previously validated assessment instrument (the Objective Structured
      Assessment of Ultrasound Skills) and by sending in pictures for the Fetal Medicine Foundation
      certification programme.

      The number of responsible health care practitioners providing care for pregnant women with
      acute onset of symptoms of premature onset of labor is registered along with time from
      arrival at the hospital to medical assessment and treatment is commenced. Differences between
      patients treated by the two groups of midwives are compared over a period of 6 months. During
      this period all patients with symptoms of premature onset of labor are included, of which
      only a small proportion are admitted for further examinations and treatment. The vast
      majority are expected to be scheduled for ambulatory follow-up.
