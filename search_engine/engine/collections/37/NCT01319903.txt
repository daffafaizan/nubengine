      sepsis and various other acute inflammatory diseases, represents a powerful mechanisms which
      can lead to destruction of host tissue and severe organ dysfunction. CaCP29 was developed to
      lower the complement mediated acute inflammatory response and thereby control the extend of a
      strongly activated often times self-destructive inflammatory response by controlling
      activation of a key inflammatory mechanism.
