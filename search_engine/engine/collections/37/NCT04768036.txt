    
      Investigators, plan to do a study using a pragmatic, randomized design as part of a Quality
      Improvement (QI) project as a substudy within the existing NIH R18 proposal of creating a
      universal "SMART on FHIR" platform of the IMPROVE VTE CPR for key Northwell Health hospitals.
      Investigators, aim is to assess whether an EHR-embedded CPR for VTE prevention - the IMPROVE
      VTE CPR - ultimately tied to electronic order entry will increase the proportion of
      hospitalized medical patients at risk of VTE who receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis, both
      at hospital admission AND at hospital discharge, compared to UMC. Investigators, secondary
      aims are to assess whether key adverse outcomes such as symptomatic VTE and hospital
      readmission for VTE are reduced and whether health -resource utilization metrics are
      improved.
