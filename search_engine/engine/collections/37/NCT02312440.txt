      Patients in this project are randomly divided into three groups , one group is a blank group
      and the rest two groups receive either the topical or the intravenous form of tranexamic acid
      during unilateral THA(total hip arthroplasty).The total blood loss(TBL) will be calculated as
      the primary outcome for efficacy while the events of Deep Vein Thrombosis、Pulmonary
      Embolism、Acute Myocardial Infarction 、 Acute Kidney Infarction and Cerebral Infarction will
      be recorded to assess the safety of the tranexamic acid during a six-week follow-up for each
      patient.

      All surgery are under general anesthesia, through direct lateral approach with cementless
      prosthesis. For all patients, the drain tube is clamped and closed completely for 2 hours;
      then the clamp is fully opened.
