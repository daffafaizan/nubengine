      commercial-ready mobile neurofeedback technology and test its feasibility among patients
      using opioids to treat chronic pain. Specific Aim 1 is to develop a commercial-ready mobile
      neurofeedback app and will be built according to commercial standards of robustness and
      maintainability. Specific Aim 2 is to test feasibility of the commercially available mobile
      app in N=30 patients with chronic pain prescribed opioids. Participants will be recruited for
      a baseline interview with the Duke Behavioral Health & Technology Lab after passing a
      preliminary telephone screen. After providing informed consent, participants will provide
      data on demographics, pain symptoms, and opioid consumption. Each participant will download
      the mobile neurofeedback app to their smartphone and be instructed to use the intervention
      for 10 minutes a day, 4 times a week for 12 weeks. Study coordinators will conduct four
      teleconference sessions (weeks 1, 3, 6 and 9) to reinforce training, troubleshoot
      difficulties, and support intervention utilization. After the 12-week mobile neurofeedback
      intervention, the investigators will collect follow-up data, including pain measures, mobile
      app (usage, satisfaction, & usability), and user feedback on the human-computer interface.
      Data from these will inform further app refinement preparing for STTR Phase II.
