      hemodialysis.Instilation of CLS containing antibiotic-anticoagulant solution in the end of
      each dialysis session till the next dialysis ,can prevent Catheter related bacteremia
      (CRB).In previous study in our department, Taurolock-TM decreased the rate of CRB but
      increased the incidence of catheter malfunction.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of of Heparin addition to CLS-Taurolock-
      TM ( Taurolidine &citrate 4%) in prevention of catheter patency problems in HD patients with
      TCC, in addition to CRB prevention.

      Methods : Patients with newly inserted TCC for HD enrolled and randomized to receive one of
      three CLS types : group 1- Taurolock-TM, Group 2 - Taurolock-TM and Heparin , Group 3-
      Heparin .Patients were followed for 6 monthes.

      The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of Taurolock TM with heparin on the
      rate of CRB and vascular patency.
