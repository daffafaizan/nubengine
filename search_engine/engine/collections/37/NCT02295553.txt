      that is inserted while the patient is under under deep sedation or general anesthesia. The
      most common method of providing general anesthesia for upper endoscopy is intravenous
      administration of medications such as propofol, often in combination with other medications
      such as fentanyl, midazolam, remifentanil or ketamine. One study found that the combination
      of propofol and ketamine provides better conditions (less patient movement, more stable heart
      and breathing) but more side effects afterwards compared to propofol and fentanyl.
