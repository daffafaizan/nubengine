      of patients have LOS of less than 5 days and no re-admission within the first 30 days after
      discharge.

      The study is designed as a non-inferiority study with a two-sided 5% significance level, 80%
      power and a non-inferiority level of 5%, resulting in 2 x 725 patients (1500 in total
      including drop-outs).

      A 30-day re-admission period was chosen to detect complications that could be assumed to have
      occurred as a consequence of the potential earlier PACU discharge The study will also
      investigate Length of stay, incidence of failed anesthesia, and reason for stay in PACU after
      THA and TKA 24.11.2016 A substudy based upon the un-published data from the time in PACU will
      be performed to analyse factors related to adverse events occuring during the PACU stay, and
      description of specific organdysfunction based upon the recordings from the modifed Aldrete
      discharge criteria.

      Preoperative demographic data are collected from charts and the Lundbeck Centre for
      Fast-track Hip and Knee Replacement database, (LCDB), intraoperative data from anesthesia
      charts.

      A logistic regression analysis will be performed with the YES/NO outcome of moderate/severe
      adverse PACU events at any time during PACU stay, and pre- and intr operatie variables.
