      years will be up to 90%. An increase of 3% in disease-free survival (DFS) is expected in the
      arm of Fulvestrant plus Anastrozole, i.e a DFS of up to 93%. They will be required 1358
      patients per treatment group (i.e, 2716 patients in total) to give 80% power, alfa bilateral
      0.05, and OR 0.6888. Assuming 5% screening failures 2852 patients are required to enter the
      study. In Jun-2010 the recruitment was stopped due to lack of support of the financier based
      on the result of Faslodex® and Arimidex® in Combination Trial (FACT-trial), comparing
      Fulvestrant + Anastrozole vs Anastrozole alone in 1st relapse showed no difference in time to
      progression at more than 40 months follow-up.
