      fractures in older women are related to osteoporosis. Calcium intake and physical activity
      are two modifiable behaviors associated with peak bone mass. Interventions targeting these
      behaviors among youth have tremendous public health potential for preventing osteoporosis.
      This study will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a 2-year behavioral program
      designed to increase calcium intake and physical activity among girls ages 9 to 11.

      Thirty Girl Scout troops will be recruited for the study. Girls will be randomized either to
      the eating and exercise behavior change program or to a control group. Program components
      focus on behavioral skills development, goal setting, and self-monitoring for dietary calcium
      intake and physical activity. The program also works to increase social support from peers
      and parents. The program will take place during 10 weeks of both the 5th and 6th grade years.
      The program also includes supporting programs during winter and summer breaks. Outcome
      assessments will be conducted at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will
      include dietary calcium intake, physical activity, and bone mineral density.
