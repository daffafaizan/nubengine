      insufficient levels have been observed in critically ill patients. The high variabilities
      between the pharmacokinetic parameters in different patients argue for a therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM) in intensive care units. TDM may lower the risk of overdosage with possible
      adverse and toxic effects as well as the risk of underdosage with possible insufficient
      therapeutic effects and development of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate variabilities of pharmacokinetic parameters of different widely used antibiotics and
      to correlate them with clinical and laboratory parameters. Therefore, numerous clinical and
      laboratory parameters including serum, urine and dialysate concentrations of 6 different
      antibiotics will be determined in 100 - 200 critically ill patients of the Department of
      Anaesthesiology, University Hospital of Munich. Laboratory parameters (e.g. inflammatory
      parameters) will be quantified by facilities of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine,
      University Hospital of Munich. Concentrations of antibiotics will be determined by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We expect that correlations between antibiotic
      serum concentrations and clinical and laboratory outcome parameters will be found.
