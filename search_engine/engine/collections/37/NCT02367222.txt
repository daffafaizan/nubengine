      Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS) and the hospital, physician, and prescription claims
      databases of the Manitoba Health (MH) Database System will assess if Arepanrixâ„¢ vaccination
      during the 2009 pandemic was associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) and
      other demyelinating conditions not ultimately leading to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis in
      Manitoba, Canada.

      The data will be collected form the following linked databases:

        -  Manitoba Health (MH) administrative databases

        -  Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS)
