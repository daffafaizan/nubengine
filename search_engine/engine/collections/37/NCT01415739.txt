      I. To validate a novel 4-protein signature's ability to subtype non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) in a treatment-naive, multi-institutional cohort, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
      9761.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the NSCLC misclassification rate in a multi-institutional clinical-trial
      setting for stage 1 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell).

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC).
