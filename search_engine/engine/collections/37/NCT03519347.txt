      (Medtronic LINQ) device implanted. Subjects will be given a transmitter/charger and a Patient
      Care Assistant which they will be required to keep for the duration of their participation in
      the study. ILR tracings will be uploaded automatically and reviewed by the study team for the
      occurrence of clinically significant arrhythmia.

      Following ILR implantation, subjects will have 1 month of standard dialysis and will
      crossover in random order between four month-long periods of dialysis guided by the results
      of the point of care testing. Whole blood will be obtained by dialysis staff and immediately
      tested on a point of care chemistry analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol prior
      to each dialysis session. The randomized intervention periods will include algorithms that
      alter the potassium bath in order to a) maximize potassium removal or b) minimize potassium
      removal as well as a second set of algorithms that alter the bicarbonate bath in order to c)
      limit acidosis or d) limit alkalosis.
