    
      This is a cross-section observational study. Outpatients presenting with acid reflux or heart
      burn are interviewed with standardized questionnaire to quantify severity of symptoms. The
      eligible patients undergo upper endoscopy to diagnose erosive esophagitis and further
      classify the degree of erosions according to Los-Angels classification. Enrolled patients
      receive anthropometric measurements to record body weight, body height and waist
      circumference on the day of enrollment.

      Two outcomes are studied: the severity of GERD symptoms and the Los-Angels Classification of
      erosive esophagitis.
