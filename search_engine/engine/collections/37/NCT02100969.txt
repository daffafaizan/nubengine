      because the immune system attacks the connection between the nerves and the muscles.

      Hizentra is a subcutaneous (under the skin) immunoglobin (SCIg). An immunoglobin is a blood
      protein. Hizentra is being studied for the treatment of patients with MG. Hizentra is
      administered by an injection into the skin through a portable infusion pump, which may be
      easier for patients to administer than the current treatments.

      Participants will be asked to complete 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone calls. It could take
      up to 30 weeks to complete all study visits.
