      complications like myocardial infarction or stroke. Pharmacological interventions reducing
      vascular inflammation are thought to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetic and in
      non-diabetic patients.

      Intervention with ACE inhibitors like ramipril is an established and widely used treatment
      for patients with high blood pressure, proven to reduce cardiovascular risk. Treatment of
      non-diabetic patients with pioglitazone has shown to improve the cardiovascular risk profile
      in non-diabetic patients beyond its effect on blood glucose levels.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects on low grade inflammation and vascular
      function of pioglitazone in non-diabetic, hypertensive patients with pre treatment with
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (that will be replaced by the study medication at
      time of randomization).
