      stress, alteration in sleep, and increased discomfort or pain. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the benefit of therapeutic music in the ICU on patients, their families, and ICU
      staff. The results of this study will inform clinicians on best practices for redesigning,
      implementing and evaluating a patient and family focused therapeutic music program in the
      ICU.
