      but there is little published data on their effect in primary hip arthroplasty. We
      hypothesized that isolated use of local periarticular levobupivicaine injection during
      primary hip arthroplasty would improve post-operative pain control. A double blinded,
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial on patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty was
      performed. Patients were randomised in theatre to receive either a periarticular infiltration
      of 150mg levobupivicaine in 60mls of 0.9% Saline, or a placebo consisting of 60mls 0.9%
      Saline. Morphine and analgesic consumption was recorded for each patient, while the modified
      McGill pain scale was used to determine the adequacy of analgesia and the benefit of the
      peri-articular infiltration. 91 patients were recruited, with 45 patients in the treatment
      group and 46 controls. The results were assessed after one year, once all the information
      from both treatment groups was collected.
