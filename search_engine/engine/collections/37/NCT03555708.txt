      cerebral palsy (CP) after undergoing physical therapy. The specific aims of the study will:
      (1) determine the changes in the sensorimotor cortical activity after physical therapy, (2)
      determine the mobility, participation and muscular performance improvements after therapy,
      and (3) determine the changes in a child's participation in activities outside of the
      laboratory environment. The study consists of a cohort of children with CP that will undergo
      an action-perception training protocol, a cohort that will undergo a high velocity power
      training protocol and a cohort that will undergo body weight supported treadmill training.
      Participants will be between the ages of 9-18 years and have gross motor function
      classification score levels between I-III. All participants will complete final initial
      baseline measures of their brain activity, mobility, muscle performance, and participation
      activity outside of the laboratory. After completing these tests, the children will undergo
      the respective physical therapy protocols for 8-weeks (3 days a week). After the 8-weeks of
      therapy, both groups will repeat the same tests that were completed at baseline. Follow-up
      assessment will consist of a physical therapist scheduling a time to visit the family at
      their house and ask them questions about the child's participation in activities.
