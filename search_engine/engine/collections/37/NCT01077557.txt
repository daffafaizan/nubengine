      Managed Care Benchmarked Database, a health insurance claims database. The study has two
      analytic components. The first is a retrospective cohort study comparing subjects without HIV
      infection to subjects with HIV infection for the incidence of and risk for fracture,
      including the use of anyARV drugs in persons with HIV infection. The second is a nested
      case-control study limited to persons with HIV infectiion within the cohort. Cases are those
      with incident fractures occurring after the diagnosis of HIV infection, and controls those
      without a fracture. Cases and controls will be compared for risk factors for incident
      fracture including ARV drug exposure. The drug exposures will include individual nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (as permitted by sample size) and the other ARV drug
      classes.
