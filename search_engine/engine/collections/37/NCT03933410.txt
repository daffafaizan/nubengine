      of care with elevated ammonia levels. The planned treatment duration is eight weeks, with a
      primary endpoint of proportion of subjects who achieve a â‰¥15% reduction from baseline in
      fasting ammonia at the end of treatment. Patients will also be followed for safety and
      tolerability. This clinical trial is intended to allow us to evaluate efficacy of KB195 in
      reducing ammonia in UCD patients.
