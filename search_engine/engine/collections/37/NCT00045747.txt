        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
           gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with UCN-01 and
           fluorouracil.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients
      also receive UCN-01 IV continuously over 72 hours (course 1 only) beginning on day 2. In
      subsequent courses, UCN-01 is infused over 36 hours. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-13
      months.
