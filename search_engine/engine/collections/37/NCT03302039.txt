      (CD). Phenylephrine (PE) is the most popular vasopressor for prevention of post-spinal
      hypotension (PSH) during CD; however, the most appropriate protocol for PE administration is
      still unknown. The most common PE protocols used for prophylaxis against PSH are: single
      shot, fixed infusion, and variable infusion. A recent study reported that a dose of 1.5
      mcg/Kg is the most suitable single-shot dose for prophylaxis. Another randomized controlled
      trial compared four doses of PE infusion and reported that 25 mcg/Kg/min and 50 mcg/Kg/min
      doses were the best doses for fixed infusion with accepted incidence of both PSH as well as
      reactive hypertension. Using variable infusion rate of PE had been recently introduced in
      another study with a starting dose of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min. The variable rate infusion showed very
      good results regarding PSH. In this study, the investigators will compare variable infusion
      of PE (at a starting rate of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min) with fixed rate (0.75 mcg/Kg/min which will
      stop if reactive hypertension occurred) and single shot protocol (1.5 mcg/Kg).
