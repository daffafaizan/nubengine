      Effectiveness Endpoint is the occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any
      peri-device flow > 5mm demonstrated by TEE/CT/MRI at First Follow-up.The primary safety
      endpoint is the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and
      within 7 days following the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever is later: all-cause
      death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring
      open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV
      fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the
      occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 12 months from the time of implant.
