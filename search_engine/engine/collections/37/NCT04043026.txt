      first study will assess the relationship between lipids/lipoproteins and fibrin clot
      properties among anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients with and without renal
      dysfunction. The second study will assess the effects of statin therapy on
      lipids/lipoproteins and fibrin clot properties in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients
      with renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction is defined as an estimated glomerular filtration
      rate below 50 ml/min/1.73m2 for the purposes for this trial.
