      patients with serious mental illness with a waiting list control group. The main hypothesis
      is whether psychoeducation in groups has effects on the stress experience and coping style in
      the relatives. The relatives will receive group education in 6 weekly sessions. We will
      measure stress experience, coping style and the relatives' health condition before the
      sessions, after the sessions and at one year follow-up.
