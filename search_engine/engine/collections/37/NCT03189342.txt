      a cognitive and a motor task. Previous studies demonstrated that dual task training is more
      effective than single task training in reducing falls among elderly. These studies
      demonstrated that the improvements in balance and gait speed resulted in a decrease of fall
      frequency. Although dual task training has been shown to reduce the risk of falls more than
      single task training, to date, there have been no studies which compared the effects of
      single task training, dual task training and asynchronous cognitive, balance exercise
      training during same day on the risk of falls among healthy older individuals. Therefore, the
      aim of this study was to investigate differences among the effects of single task training,
      dual task training and exercise-cognitive activity combined training on balance and gait
      performances and fall risk in elderly at risk of fall.
