      that have better relationship functioning and more social support will have greater odds of
      achieving optimal health during and after pregnancy. The study further hypothesizes that the
      couples-based intervention will improve interpersonal dynamics, such as communication, and in
      intrapersonal factors, such as women's mental health, which will mediate intervention effects
      on HIV care and treatment outcomes. The study will test the hypotheses through two specific
      aims: (1) compare service utilization and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)
      outcome indicators in two study conditions; and (2) establish the effect of the intervention
      on intra- and inter-personal mechanisms influencing outcomes.
