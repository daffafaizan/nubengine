      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; a safe non-invasive method for modulating the
      activity of specific brain regions) when applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is able
      to modulate impulsivity in obese volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that tDCS applied
      to the OFC, in comparison to sham tDCS, will significantly reduce impulsivity and enhance
      decision making as measured by computerized neurocognitive tasks. For this study the
      investigators will enroll 30 obese individuals aged 18-65 years. Participants will be
      assessed with a battery of computerized tasks as well as self-reported questionnaires on
      eating, impulsivity, mood and anxiety. Assessments will be carried out before, during, and
      after a single 20-minute 2mA tDCS session.
