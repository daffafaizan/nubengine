      suppression and inflammatory responses and secondly to prevent fibrotic effects making it
      more likely to be effective in early stages of BOS. Early development of BOS, which mostly
      will not be diagnosed, and acute organ rejections are strongly patho-physiological
      associated. Prevention of the very early development of chronic rejection by L-CsA post LTX
      may be the ideal starting point for IMP application.
