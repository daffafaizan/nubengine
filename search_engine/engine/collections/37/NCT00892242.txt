      this malignancy is less than 5%. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine carries a response rate of
      approximately 25%. Resection offers the only potential for cure; however, even with
      resection, the great majority of patients will die with metastatic disease. Substantial
      improvements are needed in the treatment of this malignancy.

      Patients with this disease process have clearly developed a tolerance to their pancreatic
      tumor. This is evidenced by an increased number and activity immunosuppressive cells
      including MDSC and Treg in patients with pancreas cancer. An intervention that inhibits this
      population of MDSC and Treg may be highly useful in the treatment of this disease process.

      A novel treatment of pancreas cancer, in this setting, would be to deplete circulating and
      tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells prior to resection. This would facilitate the host
      to mount a greater immune response against the tumor. The eventual goal would be to combine
      neoadjuvant zoledronic acid with gemcitabine, another agent which synergizes with zoledronic
      acid to target MDSC. When combined with current adjuvant chemoradiation, the use of
      zoledronic acid in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, it is hoped that the patient could
      mount a greater immune response leading to increased overall survival through the prevention
      of local disease and distant metastasis.
