      Primary

        -  To compare disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with muscle-invasive urothelial
           carcinoma of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node
           dissection (PLND) or standard pelvic lymphadenectomy.

      Secondary

        -  To compare overall survival (OS) of patients randomized to extended PLND versus those
           randomized to standard pelvic lymphadenectomy.

        -  To evaluate operative time; whether or not nerve sparing was performed, intraoperative,
           peri-operative and 90-day morbidity and mortality; length of hospital stay; histology
           (pure urothelial versus mixed); lymph node counts and lymph node density; adjuvant
           chemotherapy received; and local and retroperitoneal soft tissue recurrence in patients
           randomized to extended PLND versus those randomized to standard pelvic lymphadenectomy.

        -  To collect peripheral blood and two paraffin-embedded blocks of the primary tumor for
           translational medicine studies, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and markers of
           epithelial and mesenchymal transition, and correlate these findings with pathologic T
           stage and node metastasis as well as DFS and OS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior neoadjuvant
      therapy (yes vs no), clinical stage (T2 vs T3 vs T4a), and Zubrod performance status (0-1 vs
      2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radical cystectomy and standard pelvic lymphadenectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.

      Blood and tumor specimens may be collected periodically for translational studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 6 years.
