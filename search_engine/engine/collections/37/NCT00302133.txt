      disorders. This complex clinical presentation is asociated with severe disabilities,morbidity
      and heightened risk for suicide. There is a significant gap in our knowledge regarding
      effective treatment interventions for this high risk clinical population. This proposal will
      test the efficacy of a promising pharmacological approach for the treatment of comorbid
      alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder. We propose a randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled 12-week trial to test the efficacy of valproate plus naltrexone vs. valproate
      alone in decreasing alcohol use and stabilizing mood symptoms among patients with comorbid
      alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder. All participants receive supportive psychosocial
      treatment.
