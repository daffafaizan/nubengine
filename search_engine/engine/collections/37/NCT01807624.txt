    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of tetracaine,
      para- butylaminobenzoic acid (PBBA), and oxymetazoline after intranasal administration of the
      highest Phase 3 dose of Kovacaine Mist (Tetracaine Hydrochloride with Oxymetazoline
      Hydrochloride) to healthy volunteers.

      This is an open-label, single-treatment, single-dose study in healthy volunteers in which all
      subjects will receive the highest Phase 3 dose of Kovacaine Mist on one occasion. No
      randomization is necessary for this single treatment, single dose study. A single study
      center will participate.

      Each subject will receive a single dose of Kovacaine Mist (3% tetracaine HCl with 0.05%
      oxymetazoline HCl) consisting of 3 sprays (each 0.2 mL) in one nostril not taking longer than
      8 minutes, for a total 0.6 mL dose containing 18 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.3 mg oxymetazoline
      HCl.

      The total dosing period will be 8 minutes. Subjects will be required to fast 10 hours prior
      to dosing and for four (4) hours after dosing. Water will be allowed ad lib during the study
      except for one (1) hour prior through one (1) hour after dose administration. Subjects will
      be admitted to the study unit no later than 2100 hours of the evening prior to drug
      administration and will remain in the unit until the 24 hour blood sample is collected and
      discharge procedures are completed.
