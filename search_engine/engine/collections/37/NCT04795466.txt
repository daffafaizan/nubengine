    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, participant- and investigator-blinded study in
      participants with either mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease with evidence
      of peripheral inflammation. This study is using a platform design to be able to investigate
      different agents (therapies) in a perpetual manner. Each unique investigational agent will
      have a unique cohort of participants assigned. New cohorts of participants may be enrolled to
      investigate additional agents at unspecified timepoints throughout the study.

      There are three periods in the study: screening period of 60 days that includes a baseline
      period of 5 days, a treatment period (20 weeks) and a follow-up period (28 days) and an
      additional follow-up visit for therapies with a longer washout.
