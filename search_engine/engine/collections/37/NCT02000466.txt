      (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports
      will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 3 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD from
      30 November 2013 to 31 May 2018.
