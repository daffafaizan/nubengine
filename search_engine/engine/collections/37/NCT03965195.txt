      92,000 over the age of 65 years, of whom 64,500 are long-stay NH residents, will be recruited
      for each of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 influenza seasons. Participating facilities will be
      randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to RIV4 or IV4 vaccine for their residents. Also, all staff
      must be offered the same vaccine in both allocation groups, in order to eliminate differences
      in transmission of influenza through staff to residents related to differences in
      vaccine-related protection of staff and will reduce heterogeneity between clusters. The
      Minimum Data Set from the NH resident assessment instrument will be evaluated from all
      evaluable facilities meeting inclusion criteria and will be cross-referenced to Medicare
      claims and drug use data.
