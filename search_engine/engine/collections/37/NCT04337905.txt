      adolescent psychiatry field because the main diagnostic tool is only based on psychiatry
      interview and observation. Using Diagnostic tool can help a confirmation towards specific
      clinical diagnosis, provide more evidence for eliminating one diagnosis versus another,
      provide more evidence for parents, or to rule out the differential diagnosis. Even though
      psychiatric examination is the main approach on ADHD diagnostic procedure, however the
      laboratory testing or imaging examination is also used especially to rule out the general
      medical condition or to find out any medical conditions that mimic ADHD but not to facilitate
      the ADHD diagnosis per se. Nowadays, the expand study in biological psychiatry has found a
      lot of biological markers in ADHD as well; but none is really sensitive and specific for ADHD
      diagnostic test. Therefore, there should be another approach for developing diagnostic tool
      in ADHD. VR is one of the best approach bacasue these days, because VR as an ADHD diagnostic
      tool could create and replace real stimuli, recreating experiences, which could not be
      observed by the clinician at the out-patient clinic.
