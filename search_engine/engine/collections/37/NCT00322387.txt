      to be treated with peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) autologous transplantation. The only
      change to the standard of care was the addition of plerixafor to a mobilization regimen of
      chemotherapy and G-CSF. Patients were first given a mobilizing regimen of chemotherapy as per
      local practice guidelines and G-CSF (at customary doses) and apheresis was performed. After
      the first apheresis, plerixafor was given at 10PM, 10-11 hours before the second apheresis
      the next day or in the morning of the second day, 6 hours before the second apheresis. The
      change in the patient's peripheral CD34+ cell count between the plerixafor dose and the start
      of apheresis was measured. The apheresis yields on Day 1 and Day 2 were compared.

      This study was previously posted by AnorMED, Inc. In November 2006, AnorMED, Inc. was
      acquired by Genzyme Corporation. Genzyme Corporation is the sponsor of the trial.
