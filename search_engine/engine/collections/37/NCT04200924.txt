      with a toe-toe gait pattern in the absence of any known cause. When the literature is
      examined, it is reported that a possible neuromechanism of idiopathic toe walking is related
      to postural disorder and a deterioration of sensory information coming from the
      proprioceptive, vestibular, visual and / or tactile systems. The most important function of
      the posture is to maintain the balance during the initiation and continuation of the
      movement. Postural control regulates maintaining the balance and keeping the center of
      gravity within the body's stability limits. It includes resistance to gravity forces and
      mechanical support during movement. Postural control is an integral part of achieving
      targeted action. Although there are few studies showing the possible relationship, no studies
      have been found to evaluate postural control by computerized posturography in these children.
      In this study, we aimed to evaluate postural control in children with idiopathic toe walking
      using computerized dynamic posturography (Biodex Balance System).
