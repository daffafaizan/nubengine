    
      This is a randomized controlled study, comparing 2 interventions with a placebo. The
      interventions will be use of propranolol, at different doses, to achieve specific plasmatic
      concentrations.

      80 patients will be required to find a difference of 20% in the primary outcome.

      The primary outcome to be measured is the postoperative use of opioids in the post anesthesic
      care unit.

      Secondary outcomes, will be the amount of opioids used in the following 24 hours to the
      surgery, the time to the first dose of analgesia in the post anesthesic care unit, and the
      change in the pain thresholds, evaluated as pain by pressure and by tactile sensitivity,
      before and after surgery.

      Also, as a secondary outcome, in a group than will not receive the study drug, we will
      evaluate the temporal changes in opioid induced hyperalgesia, by pain sensitivity measured in
      the postoperative hours 2, 4 and 24. 10 patients receiving placebo will be part of this
      additional measures.
