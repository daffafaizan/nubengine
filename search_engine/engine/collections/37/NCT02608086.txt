      intervention for people affected by recent traumatic events, especially in the aftermath of
      natural disasters. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that PFA neither prevents
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) nor other post-traumatic disorders or symptoms of
      distress.

      Objective: This project aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Psychological First Aid
      for the prevention of PTSD and other post-traumatic disorders and/or symptoms.

      Population: Investigators will perform a 1:1 randomized-controlled trial of 200 adults
      recently affected (<=72 hours) by a non-intentional trauma who consult to the emergency room
      of a public hospital. Investigators estimated a sample size of 200 individuals in order to
      detect a 50% Relative Risk Reduction (RRR), with a power of 80%, a statistical significance
      (alpha) of 5% and 34,4% of PTSD prevalence in the control group, what is consistent with
      prevalences observed in a similar sample by Fullerton, Ursano, Epstein, Crowley, Vance et al.
      (2001).

      Intervention: In the emergency room, undergraduate psychology students, previously trained
      and certified in PFA, will search and randomize suitable patients to either PFA or treatment
      as usual (TAU). They will provide PFA according to a protocol based on the WHO PFA Operation
      Guide to those patients included in the active group. Everyone correctly randomized will be
      followed and clinically evaluated one month after the intervention (endpoint).
