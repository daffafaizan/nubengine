      adequate postoperative recovery, assess additional patient concerns, and to identify and
      manage any delayed postoperative complications. There is limited literature addressing
      short-term postoperative follow up for benign gynecologic surgery, particularly those
      performed through a minimally invasive approach.

      The benefits of minimally invasive surgery includes shorter operative time, reduced hospital
      stay, improved cosmesis, and faster recovery especially when combined with enhanced recovery
      after surgery (ERAS) protocols. However, this does not negate the need for follow up.
      Although no consensus exists on the appropriate frequency and number of postoperative
      appointments, there is no debate on its value.

      Due to lack of evidence on this issue, the number and frequency of postoperative appointments
      is currently dependent on surgeon preference, type of procedure performed and complications
      encountered intraoperatively and postoperatively, which could lead to patient confusion and
      unnecessary cost and hassle.

      For this reason, investigation of outcomes based on the number and frequency of postoperative
      follow up visits may improve optimal patient satisfaction, improve compliance and provide
      early detection of postoperative complications. Such knowledge could serve to mitigate
      efforts to develop and implement protocols to improve compliance with postoperative follow-up
      care, potentially reduce emergency room visits, readmissions, empower patients and reduce
      cost.
