      hemorrhagic complications in neurosurgical patients. They are diagnosed more often in
      emergency on a PT value less than 60% and so they should be corrected as soon as possible.
      Two therapeutic strategies are proposed by French or international recommendations:
      transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or administration of prothrombin complex
      concentrates (PCC).

      This prospective, randomized, multicenter study with blinded assessment of the primary
      endpoint, is performed to determine whether PCC confers any benefits over FFP in the
      neurological patients with coagulation disorders.
