      (LSCP) alone or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) plus posterior repair (PR). Participants
      will be randomized with equal probability to the LSCP only arm or LSCP plus PR arm.

      The surgical technique for LSCP will be similar to that described by Paraiso et al. for LSCP
      [14] and by Elliott et al. for robot-assisted LSCP [15], with minor variations. A Y-shaped
      polypropylene mesh graft, 10 cm in standard length and tailored to each patient's anatomic
      specifications during surgery, will be used with all SCP procedures.

      PR is performed by midline fascial plication. Plication of superficial perineal muscles
      (perineorrhaphy) is performed in conjunction with PR. All repairs are performed using
      polydioxanone 2/0 for fascial repair and 4/0 polyglactin suture for skin closure.

      Participants will also complete questionnaires and undergo an endovaginal ultrasound (using a
      9-16 MHz, 360Â° rotational transducer, type 8838, BK Medical, Peabody, MA) prior to surgery
      and three months following surgery.
