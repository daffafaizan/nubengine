      absence of antivenom treatment in pediatric patients. This was done to establish historical
      control data on the time from sting to the time of resolution of signs of envenomation. These
      historical control data are intended to be used for comparison with Alacramyn treated
      patients in two prospective studies being conducted in Mexico and the U.S.for which a control
      population could not otherwise be established.

      The total duration of clinically important systemic signs of envenomation was determined
      based upon overall investigator assessment of the last signs of any respiratory compromise,
      any pathological agitation or other indicator of continuing illness (e.g., continuing need
      for sedative administration).

      To facilitate comparison of these historical data with prospective open label trials,
      periodic assessments of the overall presence or absence of clinically important signs was
      performed. Periodic assessments were also performed for each individual component indicator
      of respiratory compromise and of pathological agitation, when available.

      A research nurse reviewed hospital discharge diagnoses for all pediatric charts coded for
      "scorpion sting". For these cases demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were entered
      on the case report form (CRF) as well as data necessary to assess compliance with study
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      A physician subinvestigator reviewed the research nurse's findings for the key outcome
      indicators, which consisted of clinically important systemic signs of scorpion envenomation
      and adjunctive sedation treatment (dose and timing of dose) when medical judgment was
      required.
