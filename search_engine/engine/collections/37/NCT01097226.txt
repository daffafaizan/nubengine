      apple flavanols and the effects on nitric oxide products, a surrogate marker for changes in
      endothelial function. Each test phase will comprise a 3 day period of intervention which will
      be identical in nature (except for the test product consumed) and separated by a minimum of 1
      week. On days 1-3 of each test phase volunteers will consume a low flavanol diet. After
      consumption of the test product on the morning of day 2, blood and urine samples will be
      collected at regular intervals for the next 24h.
