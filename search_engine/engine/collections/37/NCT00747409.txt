    
      This is a single centre, long term (24-48 months), therapy controlled and randomised study
      with blinded analysis of the ultrasound data in 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      and with previous insulin therapy. After recruitment and informed consent, patients are
      randomized to two treatment arms according to a randomisation protocol which takes into
      account age and absence or presence of cardiovascular events in each patient's history.

      In one treatment arm, the intensive insulin therapy is based on human insulin (insulin NPH
      and regular human insulin) while in the other arm, the intensive insulin therapy is based on
      analogue insulin (insulin detemir and insulin aspart). Both treatment arms will be titrated
      to identical glycemic goals (fasting blood glucose <110 mg/dL and post prandial blood glucose
      <150 mg/dL).

      All patients will be updated in their skills of self medication by the departmental diabetic
      teaching programme und will receive life style instructions during each visit. Furthermore,
      they are encouraged to keep records of any episode of hypoglycemia throughout the study.
      Outpatient visits for metabolic control are every 3 months and ultrasound and blood tests
      every 6 months.
