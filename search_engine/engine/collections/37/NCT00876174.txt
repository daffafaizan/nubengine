      this purpose, formation of complexes between STAT1 and its negative regulator, PIAS1
      (immunoprecipitation, Western blot) will be examined. In comparing subjects on standard
      therapy vs the addition of betaine, (under separate studies) we will assess whether the
      formation of STAT1-PIAS1 complexes is due to impaired methylation on STAT1 on arginine
      residues which may be over come by the addition of betaine.
