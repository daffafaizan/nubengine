      randomised, active drug condition, within-group, placebo-controlled experimental fMRI study.
      Each participant will be assessed in baseline measures during a pre-assessment visit. Then
      the patient will be scanned 3 times under each of these 3 drug conditions: GXR, LISDEX, and
      placebo. Every patient will receive a single typical clinical weight-adjusted dose of GXR
      (0.05mg/kg rounded down to the closest dose of 1mg, 2mg, or a maximum of 3mg), LISDEX (for
      participants aged 8-9 years 20mg regardless of weight; for participants aged 10-20 years the
      dose will be calculated at 0.5mg/kg rounded to the closest 30, 40, or 50mg, middle doses,
      e.g. 35mg, will be rounded down) and placebo (10mg Vit C) in one of the scans, in a
      randomised order. Patients will perform a battery of cognitive tests 3.5 hours after drug
      administration, after which the will undergo an fMRI scan. The scan will start 4.5 hours
      after drug administration where drugs have shown to have maximum plasma concentration.
      Participants will be scanned 3 times, one week apart, under each drug condition.
