    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts : a) Single
      Ascending Dose part and b) PK-Food Effect part. Part 1 is a randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the
      treatment), sequential cohort, single ascending oral dose study. Part 1 will assess the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of single ascending doses of JNJ-54416076 in healthy male
      participants. It will consist of 8 cohorts of 8 healthy participants. Within each cohort, 6
      participants will be randomly assigned to JNJ-54416076 treatment, and 2 participants will be
      randomly assigned to placebo treatment. The total study duration for each participant in Part
      1 will be up to approximately 5 weeks. Part 2 is a randomized, open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), 2-period crossover study. Part 2 will assess the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54416076. Each participant in Part 2 will receive 2 doses
      of JNJ-54416076 (one dose in the fasted state and an identical dose in the fed state). The
      dose selected for Part 2 will be selected based on the preliminary safety and PK data in Part
      1. The total study duration for each participant in Part 2 will be up to approximately 7
      weeks. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
