      canalicular stent was inserted. If the stent insertion failed, the subject was rescheduled
      for insertion at the Day 2 visit. If the stent insertion was not successfully completed by
      the end of the Day 2 visit, the subject was discontinued from the study. Any subject who had
      the stent inserted but lost the stent (noticed or unnoticed) after the Day 2 Visit was
      considered to have completed the study.
