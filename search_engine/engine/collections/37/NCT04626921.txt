    
      This open-label, long-term extension study is only available to participants who have
      completed CNMAu8.201 (VISIONARY-MS). The Week 48/End-of-Study Visit for study CNMAu8.201
      (VISIONARY-MS) will serve to establish the Baseline for electrophysiological, functional,
      morphological vision testing, as well as the neurological and outcome assessments.
      Participants will receive open-label CNM-Au8 throughout the study. All participants will
      receive a daily dose of 30 mg CNM-Au8 for the entire open-label, long-term extension study.
      The dose for participants may be adjusted once efficacy and safety data from study CNMAu8.201
      becomes available, which may occur after participants have already started this study. Based
      upon a review of data and Sponsor or PI recommendation, this open-label, long-term extension
      study may be discontinued once each participant reaches her/his 48-week visit.
