    
      Purpose:

      To compare effects of preoperative and postoperative use of topical ketorolac tromethamine
      0.4% versus placebo in uncomplicated cataract surgery.

      Methods:

      This will be a masked single-center, randomized clinical study comprising 80 patients
      undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Patients scheduled to undergo
      phacoemulsification and with no recognized cystoid macular edema (CME) risks (diabetic
      retinopathy, retinal vascular disease or macular abnormality) will be randomized to receive
      either topical prednisolone acetate 1% 4 times daily (QID) plus dextran 70/hypromellose QID
      (placebo group;n=40) or topical prednisolone 1% QID plus ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% QID
      (ketorolac group;n=40) for three days preoperatively and four weeks postoperatively. In both
      groups topical gatifloxacin will be administered to the treated eye QID, starting three days
      before surgery and continuing for seven days. The primary outcome 5 weeks after surgery will
      be angiographic cystoid macular edema. Other included outcomes will be best corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), CME incidence, retinal thickness as measured by
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).
