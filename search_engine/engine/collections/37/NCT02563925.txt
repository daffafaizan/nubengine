      efficacy. A maximum of 17 subjects will be accrued to the efficacy arm. After the first 3
      patients are enrolled in the efficacy arm, a 6 week enrollment hold will be conducted in
      order to ensure safety before additional patients are enrolled. An interim assessment will
      then occur after the first 9 subjects have enrolled, and the accrual to this arm will proceed
      only if a pre-specified futility threshold is met. Patients not requiring continuation of
      HER2 directed therapy, such as trastuzumab, will be enrolled in this arm.
