      experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing
      thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck.
      Robotic thyroidectomy which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree
      of patient cosmetic satisfaction. In this study, we designed a prospective study comparing
      the cosmetic satisfaction and the postoperative body image change which associated with
      patient self-esteem between robotic thyroidectomy and conventional open thyroidectomy group.
