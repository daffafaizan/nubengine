      symptoms of urgency, frequent urination, urge incontinence, and nocturia, and impacts the
      lives of millions of men. OAB symptoms are most often treated with pharmacologic therapies
      (alpha-blocking agents and/or antimuscarinic agents) or behavioral treatments. Although drug
      therapies (even combined drug therapies) and behavioral treatments reduce OAB symptoms, few
      patients are completely cured with either treatment alone. Therefore, there is a need to
      improve interventions for this common problem. The primary purpose of this study is to test
      the effectiveness of combining behavioral treatment and drug therapy as a way to improve
      outcomes in the treatment of OAB symptoms in men. This is a 3-site, 2-stage, 3-arm randomized
      clinical trial of behavioral treatment, drug therapy, and combined drug + behavioral therapy
      for men with OAB, to examine the efficacy of combined therapy and whether it yields higher
      success rates than either therapy alone. 204 men with OAB were enrolled and randomized to 1)
      drug therapy alone followed by combined therapy, 2) behavioral treatment alone followed by
      combined therapy, or 3) combined therapy as initial treatment.
