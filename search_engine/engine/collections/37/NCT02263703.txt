      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in three groups of immunosuppressed children: recipients of
      allogenic bone marrow transplant, recipients of renal and liver transplants, and patients
      with juvenile chronic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune conditions
      who are on longterm immunosuppressive therapy.

      Significance: Immunosuppressed populations are diverse in terms of degree, type and duration
      of immunosuppression. The study compares several groups in order to address the heterogeneity
      of immunosuppression and how this affects vaccine response. BMT patients have extreme, severe
      immunosuppression in the short term, but recover immune function with time. In contrast,
      solid organ transplant recipients have ongoing, chronic immunosuppression. Although
      successful cessation of immunosuppressives in liver transplant patients has been reported,
      most patients require ongoing treatment. The inflammatory bowel disease group of patients
      represents a non-transplant group who require ongoing, often low level immunosuppression,
      often with corticosteroids. Our study will compare these three groups, followed up for five
      years for duration of immunity. Time of vaccines, time of serological measures of immune
      response are as follows.

      Serum collections:

      0 - Baseline (before HPV vaccine dose 1); 2 months - At the time of receipt of HPV vaccine
      dose 2 (to measure response to dose 1); 6 months - At the time of receipt of HPV vaccine dose
      3 (to measure response to dose 2); 7 months - 1 month after HPV vaccine dose 3; 12 months -
      after HPV vaccine dose 1; 2 years after HPV vaccine dose 1; 3 years after HPV vaccine dose 1;
      4 years after HPV vaccine dose 1; 5 years after HPV vaccine dose 1.
