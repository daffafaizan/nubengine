      palsy. Perinatal global hypoxic ischemic associated with Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE) results
      in multi-organ dysfunction which may persist in later childhood. In addition perinatal
      inflammation has been associated with neonatal brain injury and implicated in adult
      neuropsychiatric conditions.

      The investigators aim to examine multi-organ dysfunction in early childhood in children who
      had NE by examining detailed cardiac, renal, neurological, haematological and
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. The investigators have previously defined detailed multi organ
      dysfunction (MOD) in this cohort in the neonatal period in infants with NE including organ
      outcomes as well as serum, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. They are now
      age-appropriate for detailed neurocognitive assessment and correlation with these biomarkers
      and the investigators plan to compare with age- matched controls. Immunological markers such
      as the inflammasome and microRNAs are altered in the neonatal period and may persist in early
      childhood. The investigators will modify negative inflammatory responses in vitro with
      specific antagonists as well as correlating these immune biomarkers with outcomes.

      Quantifying multiorgan dysfunction in the neonatal period to ensure appropriate follow-up of
      all organs is merited. This would help in advanced clinical planning and long term follow up.
      In addition, understanding, the immune response in these children with NE and exploring
      systemic inflammation holds promise for future development of immunomodulatory adjunctive
      therapies and biomarkers to predict outcomes.
