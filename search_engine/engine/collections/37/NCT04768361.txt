      the world, often leading to a decrease in productivity and the departure from work
      activities, which generates economic impacts to the own health system. Between 2005 and 2015,
      an increase of almost 20% was identified in cases of depression worldwide. The impact of the
      disease on the world economy between 2011 and 2030 is expected at US $ 5,36 billion.

      Behavioral Activation (BA) and interventions with mindfulness are recognized as effective for
      depression. On the other hand, as currently the BA is complemented with strategies of the
      Third Generation Therapies, including mindfulness, no study has compared a protocol strictly
      behavioral with any treatment and there is also insufficient data to affirm if the BA has
      better benefits than interventions that include or are based on mindfulness or vice versa.

      The aim of this study is is to compare, in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for
      major depression, the effects of BA strictly behavioral with a BA protocol that includes
      mindfulness practices. The two intervention are face to face, in group (8 weeks), by a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our main hypothesis is that la intervencion BA with
      mindfulness practices will be more efficacious to improve the symptomatology depressive,
      compared to a group with only BA the end of treatment. 150 participants diagnosed with
      depression will participate in the RCT.
