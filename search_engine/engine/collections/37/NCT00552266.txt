    
      Thirty children and adolescents aged 6-18 years, diagnosed with ADHD and trichotillomania,
      will receive MPH monotherapy treatment for a period of 12 weeks, targeting both ADHD and
      trichotillomania symptoms as rated by the ADHD- rating scale (ADHD-RS) and by the
      Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity
      (CGI) scale. The rating scales will be assessed at baseline and at the endpoint (after 12
      weeks).The side effects will be monitored via weekly spontaneous self reports by each
      participant. All results will be expressed as mean Â±SD. Student's paired t-test and ANOVA
      test will be used as appropriate.
