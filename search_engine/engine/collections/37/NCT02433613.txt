    
      This registry will collect data prospectively on patients with paroxysmal, persistent and
      longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (hereafter "AF") undergoing Phased RFA treatment.
      Phased RFA will be applied according to the 'Intended Use' in CE mark (European Conformity)
      release and product packaging.

      The treatment will be performed according to routine hospital practice and no additional
      tests are required specific to the registry. This registry will serve as a tool to collect
      clinical data in order to expand the knowledge base of safety, effectiveness and
      functionality of the Medtronic Phased RFA System in a real world patient population.

      The key measures collected for the patients will be inclusive of, but are not limited to,
      clinical data pertaining to AF and individual disease state(s) characterized by form of AF
      and underline diseases, Phased RFA procedure details including timing and catheters in use,
      procedure and system related adverse events, AF recurrence, re-ablations and left atrial
      flutter rate after the index Phased RFA procedure. Additionally, this study will provide
      further information in the evolving anticoagulation strategies (e.g. continuous versus
      bridging and vitamin K antagonist versus novel oral anticoagulants) in the setting of AF
      ablations. Patients will be followed minimum for 12 months and maximum for 14 months after
      the Phased RFA ablation procedure. The twelve month follow-up can be done by telephone if it
      is not standard of care in the hospital's practice. During the twelve month follow-up
      patients will be interviewed with a quality of life questionnaire and results will be
      compared to the quality of life questionaire completed before the procedure.
