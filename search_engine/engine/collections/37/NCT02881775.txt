      eligible participants will attend 3 sessions in the laboratory. Session 1 is to collect data
      for Aim 1. Sessions 2 and 3 will include the rTMS interventions and data collection for Aim
      2.

      Aim 1 is a descriptive study to compare the neural (cortical and corticospinal) excitability
      of the quadriceps in the symptomatic knee to the asymptomatic knee in participants with knee
      osteoarthritis. The investigators will examine the associations between neural excitability
      and clinical measures of pain, strength, function, and coping styles.

      Aim 2 is a double blind, crossover study design. Each participant will partake in two testing
      sessions, spaced 1 week apart. The investigators will evaluate outcome measures prior to and
      following the "true" intervention versus the "sham" intervention. The true intervention is
      rTMS + exercise. The sham is sham rTMS + exercise. The primary outcome measures are
      quadriceps strength, as measured from a maximal isometric voluntary contraction, and
      quadriceps central activation ratio (CAR), as calculated from the torque values from the
      voluntary strength measurement and a brief, intense electrical stimulus. Secondary measures
      evaluate effects of the intervention on 1) clinical measures of pain and functional
      performance, 2) corticospinal excitability, and 3) intracortical inhibition and facilitation.
