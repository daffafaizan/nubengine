      diagnosis of respiratory tract viral infections by increasing its sensitivity and the
      diversity of viral species detected. However, there are few data concerning respiratory tract
      viral infections amongst hematology and oncology patients. Especially, the duration of viral
      shedding following an infection has not been much studied whereas it is a source of
      inter-individual transmission between immunocompromised patients who are more likely to
      develop severe disease.

      Studies conducted so far concerned mainly hematology patients. They have shown that viral
      carriage could last up to one month and a half in some patients with hematological
      malignancy.

      The aim of this study is to determine the duration of the viral shedding in patients from
      hematology and oncology units after a respiratory tract viral infection for the ten main
      viruses involved in order to better manage these infections and to better prevent their
      transmission.
