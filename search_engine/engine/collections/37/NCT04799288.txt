      In this single center, single arm, open label, baseline versus treatment pilot clinical
      trial, sixteen subjects with HAM/TSP will receive teriflunomide 14mg by mouth once a day in
      an initial 9 month treatment phase, followed by a 3 month post treatment follow-up phase.
      Outcome measures will be collected every 3 months for the duration of the study.

      Objectives:

      We will determine the effects of teriflunomide, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis, on immune
      activation markers in patients with HAM/TSP and the correlation of these with virological,
      radiological and clinical measures of disease burden .

      Endpoints:

      The primary outcome measure is ex vivo spontaneous lymphoproliferation in HAM/TSP patients
      receiving teriflunomide. Secondary outcome measures will include determination of immune
      activation patterns of PBMC and CSF using multicolor flow cytometric analysis and HTLV-I
      proviral load in blood and CSF. Safety and tolerability of teriflunomide will be assessed by
      tabulation of adverse events, clinical exam, standardized neurological disability scales
      (EDSS, IPEC, HAQ-DI), MR imaging of brain and spinal cord and clinical laboratory studies.

      Study Population:

      Up to 24 adults with HAM/TSP, targeting at least 16 participants who complete 9 months of
      treatment with teriflunomide
