      termed idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). IOP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of
      <200,000 affected premenopausal women in the United States.

      Denosumab, a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, leads to continuous
      gains in both trabecular and cortical bone mineral density (BMD). Moreover, denosumab is not
      retained in the skeleton, and may thus be preferable for use in young women who may be
      contemplating future pregnancies. The investigators hypothesize that denosumab, initiated
      after completion of two years of TPTD, will maintain or improve central and peripheral areal
      and volumetric BMD, microstructure and stiffness in premenopausal women with IOP.
