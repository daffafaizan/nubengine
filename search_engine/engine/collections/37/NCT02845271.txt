      medication, the study period for each patient will be 84 Â± 7 days up to the end-of-study
      visit.

      Total duration for one patient will be up to 16 weeks (up to the end-of-study visit), not
      including the long-term observational safety follow-up phone call for 12 additional weeks.

      The collection of primary endpoint data up to Week 4 for futility analysis is optional.
      Assuming a possible step-down in dose due to safety/tolerability reasons, the total expected
      maximum number of included patients could be increased up to a maximum of 182 patients.
