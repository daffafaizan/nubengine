    
      This is a prospective interventional study focused on a cohort population.

      The included patients will be those affected by a severe ARDS (Berlin definition) requiring
      an aggressive mechanical ventilation and whom a high-flow ECCO2R was implemented.

      The high-flow ECCO2R will be proposed in all patients with inclusions criteria with the 15
      first days following their admission. The day of initiation of the high-flow ECCO2R will
      considered as Day 0 in our study.

      A data collection will be focused on the respiratory parameters, clinical complications until
      ICU discharge and outcome, extracted from medical records.

      The main endpoint will be the perrcentage of patients whom an ultraprotective ventilation
      could be applied successfully during more than 12h. Ultraprotective ventilation is defined in
      our work as follows: Tidal volume ≤ 3 mL/kg and respiratory rate ≤ 16/min associated with a
      PaCO2 ≤ 45mmHg and a PaO2 ≥ 55 mmHg.

      The secondary endpoints will be durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and
      hospitalization, as well as rheological behavior of extracorporeal circulation, respiratory
      parameters under high-flow ECCO2R, specific complications and mortality.
