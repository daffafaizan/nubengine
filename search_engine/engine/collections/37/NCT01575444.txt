      papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical cancer screening. The main objective is to estimate
      the successful screening completion rate among a sample of Somali women who have not
      undergone cervical cancer screening for three or more years. Women will be randomized to
      either home vaginal bio-specimen collection or referral to undergo a clinic-based Pap test.
