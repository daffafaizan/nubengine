      neurodegenerative diseases in middle age. The most prominent early manifestations of bvFTD
      ("behavior variant" FTD) are not the memory and other cognitive deficits typical of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) but, rather, disturbance in social or interpersonal behavior. A
      basic manifestation of this disorder is a disturbance in the emotions and motives that drive
      social and moral behavior. In fact, bvFTD is an incredible window to the neuroscience of
      social behavior. This study will help clarify the neurobiological substrates of sociomoral
      emotions and their associated clinical features. The findings of this proposal can have major
      implications for understanding the interaction between brain and social behavior and for
      designing future research on the basic mechanisms of social neuroscience. This research aims
      to document the loss of sociomoral emotions (SME) compared to primary emotions in patients
      with bvFTD vs. patients with AD and normal controls. We need to show that these findings are
      specific to bvFTD and not present in Alzheimer's disease or normal controls. The project
      consists of three integrated parts: 1) behavioral measures that include observations in
      naturalistic settings, behavioral experiments, and behavioral scales; 2) psychophysiological
      reactivity (i.e., measures of heart rate, blood pressure changes, galvanic skin response,
      facial electromyography, and facial temperature) to social and emotional stimuli; and 3)
      brain localization of changes in sociomoral emotions with magnetic resonance imaging
      technology.
