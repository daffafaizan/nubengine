      disagreement exists among studies regarding the influence of exercise on muscle function and
      redox homeostasis in the elderly. A specific exercise protocol will be applied (the repeated
      eccentric model) to produce long-lasting and extensive changes in redox biomarkers and to
      examine more easily the potential effects of aging. Ten young men and ten elderly men will
      underwent an isokinetic eccentric exercise session, which will be repeated after three weeks.
      Muscle function indices and redox biomarkers will be assessed in urine, plasma or
      erythrocytes pre exercise, immediately post exercise, 2 and 4 days post exercise.
