      Fenretinide is given in capsules, very little of the drug is absorbed through the intestines
      into the body. This means patients have to take many capsules of fenretinide by mouth several
      times a day. In this study, a new oral preparation of fenretinide (called 4-HPR/LXS oral
      powder) is being tested to see if more fenretinide can be absorbed into the body. 4-HPR/LXS
      oral powder has been tested previously in a limited number of both children and adult cancer
      patients.

      Ketoconazole, commonly used to treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in
      the body by interfering with the body's ability to break down fenretinide. Ketoconazole will
      be given at the same time as the fenretinide powder.

      There is preclinical data that shows that combining fenretinide and vincristine prolonged
      survival in animal models, therefore, it is hoped that giving the vincristine with
      fenretinide will work better against the neuroblastoma that either drug given alone.

      About 70 children with neuroblastoma have been treated with various versions of the
      fenretinide powder to date, including about a dozen children that also took the fenretinide
      powder with ketoconazole, and no toxicities have occurred that limited the dosage and no
      serious or unexpected side effects occurred. However, vincristine has never been given with
      fenretinide or fenretinide plus ketoconazole before. Vincristine has been been given before
      with ketoconazole to both children and adults with neuroblastomas and other cancers.
