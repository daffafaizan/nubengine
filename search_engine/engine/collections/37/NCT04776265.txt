      characteristics of patients with relapsed refractory cHL who undergo ASCT, who receive
      consolidation with BV, and to study the factors that determine BV consolidation after ASCT in
      real world setting.

      This study will evaluate the treatment approach in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who
      undergo ASCT. All consecutive adult patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who undergo ASCT,
      regardless of the prior indication to receive or not BV consolidation therapy, will be
      included in this study and prospectively followed according to local practice.

      Patients will be treated and monitored by their physicians according to local clinical
      practice and guided by the local approved label for patients receiving BV consolidation.
      Usual follow-up will be determined by the treating physicians' standards of care, and no
      scheduled patient visits are required for the conduct of this study. There are no visits or
      specific procedures planned by protocol, however, baseline and follow up data will be
      gathered every time the patient's response to treatment is assessed or has a medically
      important event.

      All patients that undergo ASCT will be included in final analysis of the primary objectives
      (Full study population). Patients that receive BV consolidation or not (Non-BV consolidation)
      will be included in the analysis.

      Patients included in the study are expected to be recruited during 24 months and followed up
      to progression, death, lost to follow or end of study (12 months after the inclusion of the
      last patient), whatever occurs earlier.
