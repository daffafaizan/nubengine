    
      A prospective, double blind, randomised controlled trial was performed. Consenting patients
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised, by envelope, to a laparoscopic
      guided 2-point blockade (subcostal transversus abdominis plane and rectus sheath) using
      either ChirocaineÂ® 2.5mg/ml (LaGRA) or 0.9% Saline (Placebo) after specimen extraction.

      Primary endpoints were post-operative pain in the first 6 hours. Secondary endpoints were
      analgesic/anti-emetic usage and day case and re-admission rates. Data was analysed using
      GraphPad Prism (V7).
