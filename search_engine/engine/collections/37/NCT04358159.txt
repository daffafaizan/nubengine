      There are several factors which can increase the risk of incisional hernias, e.g. surgical
      technique, truncal obesity and other co-morbidities.

      Repair with mesh-reinforcement is considered standard for the treatment of incisional
      hernias. Onlay and sublay mesh placements are the most commonly used methods. There are many
      different types of mesh available to use. Despite the widely use of composite ventral-patch
      Ventralex, there are few studies with small numbers of patients showing the advantage and
      disadvantage of ventral-patch. Some studies show that the onlay mesh-reinforcement remains a
      good alternative to the sublay mesh technique, while others showing fewer recurrences with
      the sublay mesh technique. The Ventralex mesh is usually placed on the peritoneum as a Intra
      peritoneum onlay mesh (IPOM). In this study intend to compare pre peritoneal VentralexÂ® mesh
      in sublay position with ProGrip self-fixating onlay mesh.
