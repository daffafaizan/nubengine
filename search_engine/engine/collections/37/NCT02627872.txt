    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an umbrella diagnosis defined by obstructive
      lung function impairments, and is likely to be caused by a multitude of etiologies including
      environmental exposures, genetic predispositions and developmental factors. Due to the
      heterogeneity of the disease, molecular and mechanistic sub-phenotyping of COPD represents an
      essential step to facilitate the development of relevant diagnostic and treatment options for
      this constantly growing patient group. In the Karolinska COSMIC study, the investigators are
      investigating molecular sub-phenotypes of smoking-induced COPD. A particular focus relates to
      recent epidemiological indications of gender differences in both incidence and severity of
      disease, with post-menopausal women being at greatest risk. The study encompasses profiling
      of mRNA, miRNA, proteomes, metabolomes and lipid mediators of from multiple lung compartments
      (airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, exosomes, and bronchoalveolar exudates) using a
      range of 'omics platforms, in combination with extensive clinical phenotyping of early stage
      COPD patients, never-smokers, and smokers with normal lung function from both genders. The
      primary objective of the study is to identify molecular sub-phenotypes of patients with COPD,
      specifically by correlating clinical phenotypes multi-molecular 'omics profiling from
      multiple lung compartments of early stage COPD patients compared to healthy and at-risk
      control populations. Secondary goals involve identification of subsets of
      prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers for classification of the defined subgroups, as well as
      relevant pharmaceutical targets.
