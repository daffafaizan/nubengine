    
      Stress-induced hyperglycemia is a well-known phenomena that occurs during cardiopulmonary
      bypass surgery. Hyperglycemia increases the incidence of major adverse events and mortality
      in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Remifentanil, an ultra-short acting opioid analgesic, has been shown to reduce the stress
      response to cardiopulmonary bypass when compared to intermittent fentanyl and inhalation
      anesthesia. This in turn, will reduce the occurence of perioperative hyperglycemia, glycemic
      variability and insulin requirements in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Primary Outcome changed on 06/15/2015-Change Approved by University of Pittsburgh IRB on
      06/22/2015- First patient enrolled January 2016.

      Primary outcome measure; Percentage of patients with two or more than two intraoperative
      blood glucose levels more than 180 mg% in both groups will be estimated and the difference in
      this parameter between the two groups will form the primary outcome measure of this study.
