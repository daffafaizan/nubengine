      pregnancy loss usually occurring in the first trimester of gestation and its rate is quite
      high (15-20% even in full reproductive period) . In 2012, the American Society for
      Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee issued a statement that defined recurrent pregnancy
      loss as a disease distinct from infertility defined by two or more failed consecutive
      pregnancies.approximately 40% of couples will have an etiology identified that could be
      associated with their loss.Thrombophilia is the tendency to develop thromboses due to
      inherited defects in the coagulation system.Thrombophilia was identified as a major cause of
      RPL,Because pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, thromboembolism is the leading cause of
      antepartum and postpartum maternal mortality .The four most common genetic markers for
      thrombophilia are; prothrombin gene mutation(FII, G20210A), methylene tetra hydrofolate
      reductase mutations (MTHFR ,C677T and A1298C), factor V Leiden (FVL, G1691A) , and
      plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) . Prothrombin G20210A refers to a human gene
      mutation that increases the risk of blood clots . Approximately 1 in 50 people in the white
      population in the United States and Europe has prothrombin thrombophilia. Study was conducted
      to evaluate the frequency of PT20210 among healthy Egyptians, (1.06%) had PT20210 G-A
      mutation.The variant causes elevated plasma prothrombin levels (hyperprothrombinemia),
      Prothrombin is the precursor to thrombin, which plays a key role in causing blood to clot
      (blood coagulation).Prothrombin G20210A can thus contribute to a state of hypercoagulability
      . Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the methyl
      cycle, and it is encoded by the Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase gene. It was thought
      that deficient Methylene tetra hydrofolate reductase, by causing elevated homocysteine
      levels, led to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, coronary heart disease, and recurrent
      pregnancy loss . Previous studies suggested that percentage of PT20210 in patients with
      unexplained RPL is ( 10.9%),however searching literatures didn't find any estimation of this
      percentage in Egyptian population.
