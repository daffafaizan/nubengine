    
      This is a prospective study on 30 neonates with moderate to moderately to severe hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) . HIE infants are randomized into two groups: Whole body
      cooling group (N = 15; receive 72 hours of whole body hypothermia) and melatonin/ hypothermia
      group (N = 15; receive hypothermia and 5 daily enteral doses of melatonin 10 mg/kg). Serum
      melatonin, plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD),and serum nitric oxide (NO) are measured at
      enrollment and after 2 weeks for the two HIE groups. The HIE groups underwent
      electroencephalography at enrollment and at 2 to 3 weeks. Brain MRI was performed after 2
      weeks of life. Neurologic evaluations and Denver Developmental Screening Test II assessments
      were performed at 6 months. A group of healthy newborns will be used as a control for
      baseline labs.
