      individuals, sternocleidomastoid (SCM) is rarely recruited during tidal breathing, but
      previous studies have demonstrated SCM activation during loaded inspiratory muscle tests in
      upright sitting position. Whether minimizing SCM activation in supine position would increase
      diaphragm activation during loaded inspiratory muscle tests remains to be determined.
      Therefore, the purpose is to exam diaphragm and SCM activation during loaded inspiratory
      muscle tests in sitting and supine position in healthy adults.
