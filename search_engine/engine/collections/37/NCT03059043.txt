      option for surgical correction of high myopia. Currently, standard method utilizing the
      viscoelastic agent to fill and maintain the anterior chamber during the implantation, this
      requires an additional step to remove the viscoelastic agent at the end of the surgery and
      may cause the intraocular pressure spike in the early post-operative phase due to the
      incomplete removal of the viscoelastics. The new method is viscoelastic-free, which can be
      achieved by using balanced salt solution irrigation during the implantation.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, paired-eye study to compare the safety and efficacy
      of the viscoelastic-free method with the standard method. Subjects enrolled in the study will
      be randomized to receive viscoelastic-free method on one eye and undergo standard method on
      the other one.The clinical outcomes of two groups will be assessed at several follow-ups: 2
      hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively.
