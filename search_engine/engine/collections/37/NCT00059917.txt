        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of polyglutamate camptothecin (CT-2106) in patients
           with advanced malignancies.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive polyglutamate camptothecin (CT-2106) IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      receive 2 additional courses beyond confirmation of complete response.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CT-2106 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
