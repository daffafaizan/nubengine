      to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of PF-04965842 after a single 200 mg oral dose. Subjects will be selected and
      categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their estimated
      glomerular filtration rate. Part 1: A total of approximately16 subjects will be enrolled;
      approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and approximately 8 with normal renal
      function. After statistical evaluation of results from Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted and
      approximately 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment will be enrolled. The total duration
      of participation from the Screening Visit to Day 4 will be a maximum of 31 days and from the
      Screening Visit to Follow-up Contact/Visit will be a maximum of 67 days.
