        1. To assess the diagnostic performance of exercise lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of
           HFpEF.

        2. To identify the value of the B-lines score on exercise maximizing the sensitivity and
           specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

        3. To evaluate the relationship of the delta of B-lines scores between rest and exercise
           with the diagnosis of HFpEF.

        4. To assess the diagnostic performance of the delta of B-lines between rest and exercise
           for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

        5. To identify the score of the delta of B-lines value between rest and exercise maximizing
           sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

        6. To evaluate the relationship between the resting value of the B-lines scores with the
           diagnosis of HFpEF.

        7. To assess the diagnostic performance of the resting lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of
           HFpEF.

        8. To identify the value of the B-lines score at rest maximizing the sensitivity and
           specificity for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

        9. To evaluate the correlation between the B-line score measured at rest and exercise and
           the dyspnoea score measured at rest, during exercise, and during the recovery phase.

       10. To assess the correlation of the delta of B-lines scores between rest and exercise and
           the dyspnoea score measured at rest, during exercise and during the recovery phase.
