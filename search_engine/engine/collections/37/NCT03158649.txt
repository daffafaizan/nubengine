      online-based intervention on indices of prenatal wellbeing. Hypotheses: Specifically, the
      primary hypothesis is that women that would participate to the intervention would report
      higher levels of mental well-being comparing to the ones reported by women assigned to the
      control group (i.e., waiting list, WL). Secondly, it is expected that women that would be
      involve in the positive intervention would report higher levels of positive affect, perceived
      social support, positive future thinking, and self-acceptance, comparing to the ones reported
      by the WL group. Moreover it is expected that participants assigned to the intervention
      condition would report lower levels of negative affect, depression symptoms, pregnancy
      related anxiety and negative future thinking, comparing to the ones reported by the WL group.
