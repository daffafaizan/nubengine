      artery disease in patients with low or intermediate risk. In recent years, cardiac CT is
      being often performed in patients who are at high risk either for coronary artery disease or
      lung cancer. The update edition of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      (NICE) guidelines recommends cardiac CT as the first-line diagnostic tool for patients with
      new-onset chest pain due to suspected coronary artery disease. Also, symptomatic patients
      with known coronary artery disease and previous percutaneous coronary intervention who have
      an unclear stress test but whose presentation suggests a high likelihood of having an
      in-stent restenosis or a 'de novo' stenosis might benefit from cardiac CT. In 2014, the U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force recommended annual lung cancer screening with ultra-low dose
      computed tomography for current and former heavy smokers aged 55 to 80 years. Indeed, lung
      cancer screening in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease undergoing
      cardiac CT may provide the opportunity to implement recommendation for lung cancer screening
      in clinical practice.This pilot randomized study will test the feasibility, safety and
      diagnostic ability of a novel ultra-low-dose CT protocol that allows concomitant coronary
      artery evaluation and lung screening. Current or former heavy smoker subjects with suspected
      or known coronary artery disease will be randomized to undergo CT assessment of either
      thoracic area only or both coronary arteries and thoracic area. Primary end-points will be
      the effective contrast and radiation doses.
