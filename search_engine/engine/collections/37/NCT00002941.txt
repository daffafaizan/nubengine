        -  Estimate the failure-free survival rate in a cohort of relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma and
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients after retrieval therapy which includes peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in patients who achieve a complete remission or
           partial remission.

        -  Estimate the post complete/partial remission failure-free survival rate in these
           patients.

        -  Characterize the time to recovery of normal bone marrow function after transplantation
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 2 courses of reinduction chemotherapy followed by bone marrow
      biopsy and aspirate prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest. If marrow involvement
      is still present at harvest, then 2 additional courses of induction chemotherapy are given.

      The PBSC transplantation preparative regimen should begin within 2 weeks of completing
      reinduction therapy course, consisting of the following:

        -  Carmustine IV over 3 hours on days -8, -7, and -6

        -  Etoposide continuous IV over days -8, -7, and -6

        -  Cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -5, -4, -3, and -2

        -  Mesna as a 15 min infusion before each dose of cyclophosphamide then at 3, 6, 9, and 12
           hours after initiation of each cyclophosphamide dose Methylprednisolone IV is given to
           protect lungs from the toxic effects of carmustine.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued in each subgroup.
