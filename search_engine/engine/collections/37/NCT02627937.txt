      frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.Current diagnostic
      approaches are based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and physical
      examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by
      the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography (PSG). Previous studies have reported
      the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for predicting
      pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results. Despite the
      potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used in clinical
      practice. Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed diagnostic or
      screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for the
      cost-effective care of these patients.
