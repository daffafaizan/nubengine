      patients through treatment advances such as combined chemoradiation therapy or CRT. For all
      these reasons, HNC patients undergoing treatment, frequently require alternate methods of
      nutrition support such as as enteral tube feeding via a gastrostomy tube.Upon gastric tube
      feeding initiation, the registered dietitian (RD) must consider the three different methods:
      bolus (using a syringe), gravity (using gravity feeding bags), and pump (using a tube feeding
      pump).

      Typically, patients are started on bolus (OPTION A), changed to gravity (OPTION B) if bolus
      feeds are not tolerated, and ultimately changed to pump (OPTION C) if gravity feeds are not
      tolerated. The concern is that in this process of starting with OPTION A, and moving to
      OPTION B or further to OPTION C, the patient may experience unintentional weight loss and
      dehydration related to tube feeding intolerance and/or tube feeding inadequacy. Consequently,
      this places the patient at risk of, but not limited to, hospital admission for dehydration
      and/or malnutrition, and treatment interruption. Therefore, exploring the idea of an optimal
      feeding method and starting patients on it from the beginning, may improve patient outcomes
      in terms of nutritional status.
