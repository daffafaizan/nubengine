      ED are at particularly high risk of unintended pregnancy. To date, no intervention has
      successfully increased contraception use among this high risk, hard-to-reach ED population.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a
      user-informed, theory-based, personalized, interactive, pregnancy prevention text messaging
      intervention (Dr. Erica) to determine its feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy.
      The investigators hypothesize that high risk adolescent female ED patients who receive Dr.
      Erica will more often initiate contraceptives than those females who receive standard
      discharge instructions alone.

      At baseline and follow-up assessment at 3 months, participants will provide information
      regarding effective contraception initiation, any contraception at last intercourse, follow
      up with reproductive preventive health services, and contraception self-efficacy.
