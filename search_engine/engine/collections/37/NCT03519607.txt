      recent study (1) documented that both men and women involved in the treatment of infertility
      expressed emotional distress. Research on the female partner of an infertile couple documents
      that psychological interventions, especially those with a cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
      focus, are associated with significant decreases in levels of anxiety and depression (2).
      Subsequent research has also shown that both members of the infertile couple definitively
      underutilize the psychological services offered to them. Thus, new ways to provide
      psychological relief to these individuals is needed. This has lead to the development of a
      new app, FertiStrong. This app is targeted at men- either men with infertility or men whose
      partner has infertility.

      Study Requirements:

        1. Study participants will be asked to complete an on-line questionnaire.

        2. Once completed, the study participant will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
           One group will be provided the mobile app to use for 30 days. The second group will be
           provided the app after 30 days.

        3. After the 30 day period, each group will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire.
           Each questionnaire will take approximately 15-20 minutes to compete.

      Men who are directly seeking care or whose partners is seeking care at any Fertility Center
      of Illinois location are invited to participate.
