      both, for patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma, but have all failed to demonstrate a
      consistent survival benefit. In Eastern countries, Chemotherapy became one of the treatment
      strategies for advanced esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy of systemic
      chemotherapy, the investigators conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of
      Nimotuzumab plus Nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.
