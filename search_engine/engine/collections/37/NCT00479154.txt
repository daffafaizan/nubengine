      To evaluate the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A, (BoNT) for the treatment of primary
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS). We hypothesize that BoNT will be effective at decreasing the
      deep sensory discomfort of RLS.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      This protocol is a proof of principle double-blind randomized placebo-BoNT crossover
      outpatient pilot study of 6 patients diagnosed with moderate to very severe primary RLS.

      DESIGN:

      All subjects will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center by a study investigator to
      determine eligibility for participation in this protocol. We will obtain a complete medical
      history, and perform a neurological examination, along with laboratory screening studies.
      Subjects eligible to participate will receive baseline ratings using the Restless Legs Rating
      Scale (RLS-RS). Subjects will then be randomized to receive electromyography (EMG)-guided
      injections of up to 90 units of BoNT or an equivalent volume of saline in each lower
      extremity, in symptomatic muscles. Subjects will then receive follow up ratings at week 2 and
      4 following each injection. Twelve weeks after receiving the first injection, subjects will
      crossover to receive the alternative compound with similar follow up ratings.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome measure will be mean change from baseline at 4 weeks post-injection on
      the RLS-RS for placebo and BoNT, while the other pre specified outcomes will evaluate patient
      reported Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scores for each group, duration of
      effect, and adverse events. Only descriptive statistics will be performed on this limited
      data sample.
