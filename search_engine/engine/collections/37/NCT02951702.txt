      associated with significant morbidity as well as a risk for mortality. Current practice
      throughout the United States is targeted at infection prevention measures such as hand
      washing and isolation. Despite these measures, incidence of Clostridium difficile infections
      continue to rise as some institutions, including our own. Recently, a study published in
      Clinical Infectious Diseases found oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis to reduce the
      incidence of recurrence. No studies to date have evaluated primary prophylaxis with oral
      vancomycin. This will be a single center, prospective study to evaluate oral vancomycin use
      as primary Clostridium difficile prophylaxis. Patients treated by infectious disease
      physicians will be identified as "high risk" and after pager notification the ID physician
      will have the option to start oral vancomycin 125 mg by mouth daily if they determine it to
      be appropriate. Risk factors include age older than 65 years, taking gastric acid suppression
      medication, and receiving select broad-spectrum antibiotics. Oral vancomycin will be
      continued until de-escalation of antibiotics or hospital discharge and patients will be
      evaluated for Clostridium difficile infection development from the current hospital admission
      up to 4 weeks following antibiotic discontinuation.
