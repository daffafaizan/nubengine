      gastroenterology and is associated with a significant burden on the healthcare system. Proton
      pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of GERD treatment,howerver, some patients have an
      unsatisfactory response to high doses of PPIs, which remains a challenge. The Stretta
      procedure, a radiofrequency (RF) application to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), was
      introduced about 15 years ago as an alternative to chronic medical therapy or surgical
      intervention for GERD.The Stretta procedure appears to result in thickening of the LES,
      decreased transient LES relaxation rate and reduced esophageal acid exposure.The majority
      studies of Stretta were held in USA and Europe, the sduty of Stretta in Asia is rare. The
      investigators propose to perform a prospectively observiton study to evaluate the efficency
      of the Stretta procedure in patients of refractory GERD in China.
