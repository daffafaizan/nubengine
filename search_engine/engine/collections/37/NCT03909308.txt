      sessions: a beach tennis session and a non-exercise control session. The beach tennis session
      started with a standardized 5-minute warm-up consisting of basic techniques, followed by
      three 12-minute beach tennis matches with 2-minute intervals between them. Heart rate and
      rating of perceived exertion were continuously recorded during the beach tennis session, and
      enjoyment was measured after the beach tennis session. The control session was performed in
      seated rest. Both experimental sessions lasted 45 minutes. Ambulatory blood pressure was
      measured continuously for 24-hour after sessions.
