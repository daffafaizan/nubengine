      30,000 will subsequently die of metastatic disease. Although the vast majority of men will be
      diagnosed with clinically localized and potentially curable disease, the selection of one
      local modality over another remains a focus of significant controversy within the
      uro-oncology community. However, patients with higher risk features are most often managed
      with radiotherapeutic approaches to include androgen deprivation therapy.

      Prostate brachytherapy represents the ultimate-three dimensional conformal therapy and
      permits dose escalation far exceeding other modalities. Following permanent prostate
      brachytherapy with or without supplemental external beam radiation therapy, favorable
      long-term biochemical outcomes have been reported for patients with low, intermediate and
      high risk features with a morbidity profile that compares favorably with competing local
      modalities (1,2).

      Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that androgen deprivation therapy in
      conjunction with conventional doses of external beam radiation therapy (65-70 Gy)results in
      improvement in disease-free and overall survival in patients with locally advanced prostate
      cancer (3,4).
