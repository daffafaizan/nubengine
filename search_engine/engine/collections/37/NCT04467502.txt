      imaginal ET integrated with CBT on GD symptom reduction at the end of 12 treatment sessions.

      Secondary objectives:

           during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        3. Show the efficacy of VRET integrated with CBT compared to imaginal ET integrated with
           CBT on gambling behavior, craving, and gambling-related cognitions at the end of
           treatment and during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        4. Show the efficacy of VRET integrated with CBT compared to imaginal ET integrated with
           CBT on the evolution of anxiety and depressive symptoms at the end of treatment and
           during the first 12 months post-treatment.
