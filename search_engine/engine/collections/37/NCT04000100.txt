    
      All patients were assessed with regards to:

      Hemodynamics (heart rate, Bp) and oxygen saturation were recorded preoperatively just before
      the block as a baseline value, immediately after the block 5, 20, 30,40,45 , 60 minutes
      during the operative time and 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours after end of operation.

      Onset time of sensory block, Onset time of motor block, Duration of sensory block, and
      Duration of motor block.

      Pain assessment using a scoring system based on the visual analogue pain scale(VAS) measured
      at the following time intervals 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 post operatively, time to first
      analgesic requirement (in hours) and total analgesic consumption was monitored in the two
      groups for 24 hours in ward.

      The incidence of adverse effects whether related to the drugs used in the technique or
      related to the technique itself were recorded.

      The results of this study found that demographic (age, sex, weight and ASA classification and
      surgical duration were statistically insignificant between the two groups.

      Hemodynamics (HR and Bp) were statistically significant between the groups .They were lower
      in Neostigmine groups.

      As regard onset of sensory and motor block were clinically and significantly earlier in group
      B than group A ( p < 0,05) and the same for duration of sensory and motor block were
      clinically and significantly longer in group B than in group A ( P < 0,05 ). Regarding Visual
      Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), while comparing the two groups, the differences were significant
      at 9 and 12 hours after surgery for the favor of the neostigmine groups . The time to first
      analgesic request was significantly longer in group B than group A.
