    
      The study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and economic burden
      of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established cardiovascular
      disease, chronic kidney disease, or at high cardiovascular risk, including:

        1. estimate the proportion of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with established
           cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk including hypertension and
           hyperlipidaemia;

        2. describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic
           patients with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular
           risk;

        3. investigate the treatment patterns of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;

        4. examine economic burden of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;

        5. explore the trends of clinical characteristics, treatment pattern, economic burden of
           inpatients over time (2008, 2013, and 2018 separately);
