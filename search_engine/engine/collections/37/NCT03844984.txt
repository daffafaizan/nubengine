      Thus, induction of anesthesia in shocked patients might result in deleterious hypotension.
      Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock frequently need surgical interventions. The best
      protocol for induction of anesthesia in septic shock patients is lacking.

      Ketamine is an agent used for induction of anesthesia with known positive cardiovascular
      effects. However, these positive effects were reported in individuals with intact sympathetic
      nervous system. Invitro studies showed that ketamine direct action on the cardiac muscles is
      negative. Thus, it had been recommended that ketamine should be used with caution in
      hemodynamically vulnerable patients till further randomized controlled trials are present.

      Lidocaine is a drug with multiple local and systemic uses. Having local anesthetic
      properties, lidocaine was proposed to have an anesthetic sparing effect. Lidocaine was
      previously reported to enhance the hypnotic effect of thiopentone, propofol, and midazolam
      during induction of anesthesia. Lidocaine showed a sparing effect for volatile as well as
      intravenous requirements for maintenance of anesthesia; thus, we hypothesize that its use as
      an adjuvant during induction of anesthesia in septic shock patient could provide a sparing
      effect for ketamine and minimize its negative circulatory sequelae.
