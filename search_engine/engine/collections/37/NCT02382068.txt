      I. Investigate the potential protective effect of intratympanic dexamethasone administration
      on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized as to which ear receives dexamethasone.

      Patients receive dexamethasone via intratympanic injection in one ear and placebo via
      intratympanic injection in the other ear.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up before each cisplatin treatment
      and then at 1 and 3 months after the last cisplatin treatment.
