      in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Obese children tend to remain obese in
      adulthood predisposing to the huge personal health and economic burden of the
      non-communicable diseases (NCD).

      Several early life factors identified to contribute to development of obesity and adverse
      metabolic profile; pre-pregnancy underweight and overweight, high weight gain in early
      pregnancy in addition to inappropriate infant feeding pattern and rapid weight gain in early
      life have major role.

      The aims of the study are:1) to assess intrauterine and postnatal risk factors for childhood
      obesity in children followed from the second trimester in mother's pregnancy to age 1 year
      and 2) to assess the impact of a nutrition-based educational intervention on infant feeding,
      growth and body composition in the first year of life.

      This study design is a cluster randomized clinical trial with key outputs being : 1) The use
      of deuterium dilution method to provide new data on body composition of mothers from during
      pregnancy and during infancy in addition to obtain accurate measurement of breastmilk intake
      2) new data on the relationship between maternal body composition and/or infant body
      composition and non-communicable disease risk factors; 3) new data on the impact of a
      nutrition-based educational on infant's growth and body composition.
