      and sleeping disturbances than women in the general population, and hormone replacement
      therapy is not considered suitable for breast cancer patients because an increase in
      oestrogen is contraindicated.

      There has been some evidence that acupuncture is suitable treatment for hot flushes and
      therefore we had a small pilotproject where 25 women treated for breast cancer were given a
      course of classical body acupuncture with one 15 min treatment session per week for 5 weeks.
      The effekt was remarkable.

      We want to prove if this effekt is significantly better than shamacupuncture or to no
      treatment at all.

      This is a prospective, randomized and doubbleblinded study:

      35 women get classical body acupuncture once a week 5 times 35 women get shamacupuncture once
      a week 5 times 35 women get no acupuncture. Se-estradiol and se-endorphine will be measure
      before start of the first acupuncture and after the first and fifth acupuncture. The women
      with no treatment will have blodsamples too in the beginning and at the end of the fifth
      week.
