      increased carbohydrate content in the distal and L cell-rich part of the small intestine
      after a meal affects postprandial plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      This will be done by applying an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (to increase the postprandial
      carbohydrate content in the distal small intestine) and the specific GLP-1 receptor
      antagonist exendin(9-39) (to isolate any GLP-1-mediated effects) during meal tests in
      patients with type 2 diabetes.
