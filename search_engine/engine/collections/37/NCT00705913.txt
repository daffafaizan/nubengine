      evidence that in the majority of cases the actual sizer and valve dimensions vary from the
      labeled diameters, which may not be related to any hemodynamically meaningful dimension. The
      disagreement between the true valve dimensions and the labeled valve size may render
      comparisons based on labeled size meaningless
