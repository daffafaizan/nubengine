    
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy of Doxycycline (200mg on D1 to D7) and
      Rivaroxaban (15 mg on D1 to D7) versus combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg on D1 to D7)
      and azithromycin (500 mg on D1 and 250mg on D2 to D5) to treat ambulatory patients with mild
      COVID-19.

      We aim to demonstrate early improvement of a clinical core set of outcomes and prevention of
      clinical worsening, and early negativity of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) among ambulatory patients with mild COVID-19 by treating them with
      Doxycycline and Rivaroxaban compared to patients who receive Hydroxychloroquine and
      Azithromycin as per National standard therapy of COVid-19.

      Ambulatory patients with mild symptoms and with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will receive
      the treatment.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Doxycycline and
      Rivaroxaban versus National standard therapy of mild COVid-19.

      The primary endpoint is failure (i.e severe evolution) measured as PaO2 < 92% within 10 days
      after initiation of treatment.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate

        -  Safety of the different investigational therapies up to D10 days of follow-up per arm,

        -  Hospitalisation due to Covid 19 infection rate per arm,

        -  Time to hospitalisation due to Covid 19 infection,

        -  Cure rate by treatment arm and Death rate,

        -  Worsening as assessed by the need for additional concomitant medication,

        -  Efficacy in sub-groups of patients (with pre-existing conditions/co-morbidities and by
           age group).
