      department, Internal Medicine H (IMH) department or medical intensive care unit (MICU) in
      Rambam-Health Care Campus for moderate to severe Asthma exacerbation. The severity of the
      exacerbation will be based on several acceptable clinical and laboratory criteria, including
      breathless, alertness, pulse rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
      blood (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2), oxygen
      saturation, peak expiratory flow (PEF). Study protocol: The study is a prospective,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Patients will be randomized on
      admission to receive treatment with intra-venous thyroxine (100mcg once on admission and
      additional 100mcg after 12 hours) or placebo. The study treatment will be given only after
      the initial bronchodilator therapy, oxygen and informed consent are given. The primary
      endpoint is the time to return of the PEF rate to normal values or personal base line. PEF
      rates will be examined first after initial bronchodilator therapy and then, every 8 hours.
