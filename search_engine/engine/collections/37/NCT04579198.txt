      and research protocol in preparation for the open trial (Aim 2). To complete this study Aim,
      CAARE will first be refined guided by preliminary work led by the PI with caregivers after
      pediatric traumatic injury (PTI). Then, we will conduct usability testing and refine the
      mHealth components of CAARE with about 10 caregivers in preparation for the open trial (Aim
      2). Finally, we will debug the research protocol via implementation of the full CAARE
      intervention with approximately 5 families prior to conducting the open trial. Aim 2, the
      open trial, is described in more detail in the Arms/Intervention section.

      Aim 3 is to assess CAARE implementation feasibility with families, trauma center leaders, and
      program managers. This will be conducted through qualitative interviews with (1) ~20
      caregivers who participated in the open trial - diverse with respect to race, child age, and
      mental health status - to assess their reactions to CAARE; (2) ~15 pediatric trauma center
      directors and ~15 pediatric trauma program managers to identify perceived barriers and
      facilitators associated with implementing CAARE in pediatric trauma centers.
