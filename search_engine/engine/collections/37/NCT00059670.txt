        1. Determine in a descriptive manner whether patients with residue in the pyriform sinuses
           who aspirate the residue after the swallow respond better, i.e., a higher percentage of
           them can return to 100% oral intake, than patients with residue in the valleculae who
           aspirate after the swallow or patients with residue in both locations who aspirate after
           the swallow and thus to define the spectrum of indications for the proposed exercise
           programs in the two groups of dysphagic patients (stroke and post-chemo radiation
           treatment for head and neck cancer) and whether postures enable each patient type to
           swallow more bolus types without aspiration at pre- and post

        2. Define the pathophysiology underlying the swallow dysfunction and those pathophysiologic
           elements which change as a result of each therapy program including changes in -

             1. anteroposterior and lateral diameter of maximum deglutitive UES opening

             2. maximum deglutitive laryngeal anterior and superior excursions
