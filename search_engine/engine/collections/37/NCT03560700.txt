      infected/colonized people it is evident that new treatment options are needed to reduce the
      number of VRE cases. One such option could be to use probiotics. We hypothesize that
      treatment with a probiotic lactobacillus strain can reduce the number of VRE carriers
      significantly. The aim is to investigate if this strain can eradicate VRE in non-symptomatic
      VRE-carriers measured as the number of subjects without VRE colonization at week 4.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial in
      non-symptomatic VRE-carriers.

      The Trial consists of a 4 weeks intervention period followed by a 20-week follow-up period.

      After patients have been confirmed as carriers of VRE, the subjects are randomized to 4
      weeks' treatment with a lactobacillus probiotic strain (60 billion CFU per day) or to
      placebo. Subjects' VRE carrier-state is assessed at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24, by an in-house PCR
      analysis. Stool samples are collected before intervention (baseline) and at week 4, 8, 16 and
      week 24.
