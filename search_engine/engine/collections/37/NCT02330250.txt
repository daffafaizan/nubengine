      Non-compliance may lead to therapeutic failure, make more difficult and complex the
      management of chronic diseases or cause death. The effectiveness of interventions on
      adherence has an important impact in the health of the population. Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with high proportion of hospital admissions and
      deaths and high cost of treatment. The prevalence of adherence in this group of patients in
      Brazil is very low (31.7%) and the drug treatment is complex. Our aim is to assess the
      effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Care in the adherence of drug treatment by SLE patients
      attended in a Rheumatology outpatient clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

      Randomized clinical trial (pragmatic trial), in which 120 adult patients with confirmed SLE
      diagnosis will be followed for 12 months, and randomized in two groups: the intervention
      group (attended by a pharmacist according to the Dader Method for Pharmaceutical Care), and
      the control group (attended by a non-pharmacist professional with counseling on
      hygiene/nutrition and reduction of risks in lupus therapy). The main outcome will be
      adherence to drug therapy and secondary outcomes the improvement of the medical condition and
      the quality of life of the patients.
