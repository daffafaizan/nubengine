      significantly greater amounts of Tumor necrotic factor-alpha and Interleukin-1 than when
      these cells were incubated with basement membranes from non-diabetic rats.

      These new findings were the first to suggest that inflammatory cytokines may participate in
      the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .Cluster of differentiation 4 cells are believed to
      play central roles in modulating immune responses. Tumor necrotic factor-alpha and
      Interleukin-6, and induce inflammation in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

      T- regulatory cells exert immunosuppressive effects which are important on the maintenance of
      immune homeostasis by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-10 and
      transforming growth factor-b.

      Aim of this work is to the role of T regulatory cells :( Cluster of differentiation 4,
      Cluster of differentiation 25,Cluster of differentiation 127 , forkhead box P3 cells) in the
      different stages of diabetic nephropathy before hemodialysis initiation.
