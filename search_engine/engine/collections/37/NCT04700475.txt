      headings: subjects, equipment, procedures of the study and the statistical procedures.

        1. Subjects:

           Sixty patients who have head and neck cancer (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, or occult
           primary tumor) submitted to conventional 3D radiotherapy, with irradiation fields
           necessarily encompassing all major salivary glands. The total dose ranged from 66 to 70
           Gy, given in fractions of 2 Gy/day selected randomly from Nuclear medicine department,
           Oncology institute, Mansoura University.

           These patients will be divided randomly into two groups of equal number, thirty patients
           for each group.

           Group A: (Laser group) This group of patients composes of thirty patients who will
           receive GaAlAs laser three times a week, on alternate day (48h interval) Laser therapy
           will be initiated before the first radiotherapy session and ended after the last
           session, totaling 21 sessions (Fernanda A. S.G. et al., 2016).

           Group B :( Control group) This group of patients composes of thirty patients will be
           treated with 15mL of a 2% citric acid solution applied as a mouth rinse for 30 sec
           (Bozana Loncar, D.M.D. et al., 2010) .

           The criteria of Patients selection :

        2. Equipment used:

      1-Therapeutic equipment: Laser therapy will be performed with an GaAlAs laser

      2- Evaluation tools:

        -  Unstimulated and stimulated saivery flow rate.

        -  Salivery immunoglobin A (sIgA) concentration in unstimulated saliva

        -  The 11-item modified Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch questionnaire version 22.
