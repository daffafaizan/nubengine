      associated with upper airway obstruction during anesthesia and sedation or immediately after
      anesthesia. Children with OSA (especially those under three years of age, those with severe
      OSA, cerebral palsy or craniofacial anomalies) are at increased risks for post-operative
      complications, and require careful monitoring post-operatively.

      Although the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea is mainly obstruction due to anatomical and
      neuromuscular abnormalities, we believe that a central element may contribute to OSA.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether administration of caffeine to children with OSA,
      scheduled for elective T & A under general anesthesia contributes to a faster recovery, less
      post-operative complications, and a shorter stay in the PACU, DSU and the hospital.
