    
      RAPIDS-GN is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the
      following strategies for patients with confirmed gram-negative bacillus bacteremia (GNB):

        1. Standard culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST); or

        2. Rapid identification and AST using the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, performed on the
           Accelerate Pheno™ System (AXDX)

      Patient specimens with positive blood culture with Gram stain showing GNB identified during
      local laboratory business hours will be enrolled by the Microbiology Laboratory Technologist
      if they do not meet any exclusion criteria. Subject specimens will be randomized 1:1 to
      standard culture and AST or Rapid identification and AST using the FDA approved Accelerate
      Pheno TM System. Both groups will receive standard antimicrobial stewardship (AS). The
      primary service, including the prescribing provider, will be unaware of group assignment at
      the time of randomization, so initial antibiotic choice will not be affected by group
      assignment. Once rapid results become available and/or AS interventions are made, treating
      providers may become aware of group assignment.

      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of rapid bacterial identification and
      phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) on antimicrobial usage and clinical
      outcomes.
