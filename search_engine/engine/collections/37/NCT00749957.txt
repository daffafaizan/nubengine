      into two groups of 6 each. Each participant will receive rAAV2 CB hRPE65 by subretinal
      injection in one eye on a single occasion. Participants in Group 1 will receive 450 µL at a
      dosage level of 4 x 10^11 vg/mL containing a total of 1.8 x 10^11 vg of rAAV2-CB-hRPE65.
      Participants in Group 2 will receive 450 µL at a dosage level of 1.33 x 10^12 vg/mL
      containing a total of 6 x 10^11 vg of rAAV2-CB-hRPE65. A retinal surgeon will administer the
      vector by subretinal injection.

      Enrollment will begin with Group 1 and will proceed to Group 2 after review of safety data by
      a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.

      Safety will be monitored by evaluation of ocular and non ocular adverse events and hematology
      and clinical chemistry parameters. Efficacy will be measured by evaluation of visual fields,
      visual acuity and electroretinography.
