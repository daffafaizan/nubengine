      assignment. Participants will complete outcome assessments upon enrollment (T1) and at 8
      weeks (T2), 20 weeks (T3) and 44 weeks (T4) later. The T2 assessment captures the short-term
      outcomes of the most intensive part of the intervention (i.e., after six weekly sessions).
      The T3 assessment will capture the short-term outcomes at the end of the full intervention.
      The T4 assessment explores the sustained effect of BA/PS (six months after BA/PS ends). The
      study aim is to test whether the BA/PS intervention affects the "slope" of functional
      recovery over time. With the longitudinal data, the investigators will also be able to
      explore the pace of improvement and whether the two groups differ at these clinically
      relevant time points.
