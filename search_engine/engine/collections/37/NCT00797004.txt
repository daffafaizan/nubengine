    
      This is a prospective cohort study. Subjects will be recruited from the group of patients at
      the University of Washington Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Clinic who will undergo
      endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis and other disorders of the nasal cavity and
      sinuses.

      Subjects will sign consent and complete a subjective smell test (UPSIT--University of
      Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test), and the SNOT-20 (Sinonasal Outcome Test-20)

      During their surgery, subjects will have two to four pieces of normally discarded tissue
      preserved for the study. Subjects will also have two to four pieces of healthy tissue removed
      (total size approximately that of a pencil eraser tip)depending on the type of surgery
      involved. The following procedures will be performed on these tissues:

        -  immunocytochemistry utilizing antibodies to AC3 and Golf to determine the patterns and
           levels of expression of these proteins

        -  two odorants, isoamyl acetate and citralva, to elicit odorant-induced activity from the
           human olfactory sensory neurons. The tissue will also be subjected to two putative human
           pheromones: 4,16-androstadiene-3-ol and 1,3,5(10),16-estrateraen-3-ol.

        -  application of six commonly used intranasal agents: 0.9% saline, 1:1000,000 epinephrine,
           0.05% oxymetazoline, 1% lidocaine, Zicam (0.12% zinc gluconate) and Nasocort AQ
           (triamcinolone acetate).
