    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitiglinide in combination with metformin in patients
      with T2DM who are less than adequately controlled on metformin alone. Patients who are
      receiving metformin alone for T2DM will be randomized equally into one of three treatment
      groups.
