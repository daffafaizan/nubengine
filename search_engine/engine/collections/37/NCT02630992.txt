      pathogens in acute otitis media (AOM) with resulting high clinical cure rates at
      end-of-treatment (85%). However, relatively high rates (~25%) of clinically significant
      diarrhea have been reported, the occurrence of which has been directly related to the
      clavulanate potassium component of the drug combination. A reduced concentration of
      clavulanate potassium in the drug formulation would be expected to have an improved safety
      profile regarding the occurrence of diarrhea. This study will examine whether the
      concentration of the clavulanate potassium component of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium
      could be reduced in the treatment of children 6 months through 23 months of age diagnosed
      with AOM using stringent criteria. A total of 75 participants (n=75) with AOM will receive
      amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL; 28:1) administered at 90/3.2
      mg/kg/day (formulation 1) or at 80/2.85 mg/kg/day (formulation 2) in two divided doses for 10
      days.

      The primary outcome measure will be rates of clinically significant diarrhea and diaper
      dermatitis. These rates will be compared with the rate observed in our previous studies of
      AOM in children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/42.9 mg/5 mL; 14:1)
      administered at 90/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days.

      A subset of this group will have pharmacokinetic studies performed. Each participant that
      agrees will have a single blood draw (n=50). Investigators will analyze amoxicillin and
      clavulanate potassium in the blood samples using validated methods.
