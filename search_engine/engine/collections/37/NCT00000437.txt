      either naltrexone (Revia) and nicotine replacement patch or placebos. All individuals will
      receive weekly coping skills and smoking-cessation behavioral therapy. Followup interviews
      will be conducted 3 and 6 months after treatment to determine smoking and drinking status and
      persistence of any dependence symptoms.
