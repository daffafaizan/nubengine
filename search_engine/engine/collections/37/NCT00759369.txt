      individual would need to ingest in order to lower the 24 h mean urine osmolality to a level
      below plasma (~285 mOsm/Kg). This osmolality goal is chosen because the 24h median urine
      osmolality of humans is ordinarily ~753 mOsm/Kg, much greater than 285 mosm/Kg (6, 7). In
      other words, normal humans are usually anti-diuretic during waking hours and while asleep.
      Median 24h urine volume is ~1225 ml (range 1051 - 2270). In temperate climates the insensible
      losses of water in sweat, respiration and stool are nearly balanced by the water ingested in
      solid and semi-solid foods and derived from metabolism. Thus, daily urine volume measured
      upon arising in the morning is a reasonably good indicator of the volume of fluids drunk over
      the preceding 24 h.
