      of diagnosis and relapse. Peripheral blood will be obtained at the time of diagnosis,
      finishing treatment, 3 months after treatment and relapse.

      The investigators will analyze the cell fractions of CD11b+ CX3CR1+ cells and CD3+CX3CR1+
      cells in blood samples by flowcytometry. The investigators will find out the relationship
      between the tested cells and clinical outcome in MM and DLBCL.
