      Patients who are eligible for enrollment will be entered into the study. Patients will
      receive ivosidenib 500 mg by mouth once daily on 28-day cycles until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, physician or subject decision to discontinue, the subject proceeds to
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the subject dies, or until the study closes. Patients who
      achieve complete remission, undergo stem cell transplant, and then relapse can come back onto
      the study after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Enrollment into the study will close
      should ivosidenib be granted marketing authorization. If the study terminates for other
      reasons, access to drug will be assessed based on the rationale for termination.

      Clinical Assessments:

      All patients will have baseline assessments performed to confirm eligibility. Thereafter,
      treatment and assessments will be per routine standard of care at the investigational site
      and documentation will be maintained at the study site in the patient chart. Should study
      drug be discontinued, it is recommended that the patient return at least 28 days after
      receiving the last dose of study drug for a safety evaluation.

      Safety assessments should be performed at intervals per institutional standard of care for
      patients taking ivosidenib. These assessments should include, but are not limited to:
      pregnancy tests, ECG, clinical lab assessments, vital signs and physical exam findings, and
      assessment of adverse events of special interest (AESIs)/serious adverse events (SAEs).
      Toxicity severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.
