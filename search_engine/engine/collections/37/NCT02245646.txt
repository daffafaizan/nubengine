      normally mobile, a conductive hearing loss results. This conductive hearing loss is usually
      compensated with hearing aids or through stapedotomy. During stapedotomy, the diseased stapes
      bone is removed and is replaced with a piston prosthesis that conveys the sound stimulus from
      the incus to the footplate of the removed stapes.

      After surgery subjects sometimes state that the quality of sound is suboptimal, even though
      their hearing ability has improved significantly. Some subjects subjectively hear distorted
      sounds, which often disappear several weeks after surgery.

      This study aims at capturing for the first time at which frequencies and sound intensities
      these distortions are perceived. Additionally, the portion of patients perceiving these sound
      distortions and the length of time over which the distortions occur are assessed.
