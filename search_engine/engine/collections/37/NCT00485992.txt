    
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Children's) is collaborating with Child Health Corporation
      of America (CHCA) in the nationwide effort to reduce catheter related blood stream infections
      (BSIs).

      The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) is participating in this initiative by implementing
      the BSI "Bundles" per the CHCA guidelines. BSI "bundles" are a group of patient care
      practices designed to reduce BSI infection rates with implementation in patient care areas.

      Multiple risk factors are assumed to contribute to the high risk and rate of infection in the
      CICU patient population.

      Many risk factors cannot be controlled, such as patient age, weight, diagnosis, etc. Hence
      the controllable risk factors are the focus for reducing BSI rates, primarily related to the
      care of central lines. This is the main focus of the BSI Bundles which are aimed at reducing
      the risks associated with the utilization of central lines.

      The primary aim is to determine if CHG is effective as an antiseptic wipe for accessing lines
      to draw blood and administer medications. Compare the effectiveness of CHG containing alcohol
      wipes (3.15% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol) to plain alcohol in order to determine best practice
      for the CICU.

      The secondary aim is to reduce BSI rates in the CICU patient population, improving patient
      care outcomes and reducing costs of hospitalization by the resulting reduction and prevention
      of expected BSIs.
