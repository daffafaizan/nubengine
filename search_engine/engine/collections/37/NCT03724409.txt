      (PRRT). In other studies, 90Y-DOTATOC has been administered through a vein (IV) to target
      somatostatin receptor positive tumor tissue. The DOTATOC identifies the tumor through the
      somatostatin receptor and links to it, attaching the radioactive molecule 90Yttrium to the
      malignant cell.

      This study expands the initial work to examine if administering the drug 90Y-DOTATOC directly
      to the liver is safe for patients with neuroendocrine tumors whose disease has spread to
      their tumor. We don't know how of the 90Y-DOTATOC is safe to administer. We want to learn
      what the maximum safe dose is and what the side effects are related to that dose.
