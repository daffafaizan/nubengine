      that characterizes intensive care units (ICU).

      Epidemiological studies have allowed us to improve knowledge and optimize the treatment of
      patients with acute respiratory failure.

      In Latin America the epidemiological data of mechanical ventilation is poor.

      Primary goal of this national, observational, prospective, multicentric epidemiological
      study: to analyze the survival and describe epidemiological features of patients receiving
      mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Units of Argentina.
