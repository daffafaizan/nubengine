    
      This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety, feasibility and response rates of
      concurrent therapy (cisplatin and radiotherapy) after three cycles of an IC regimen based on
      the combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel without 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (thereby avoiding
      infusion pumps and a central venous catheter) in LAHNSCC patients with a high tumor burden.

      The patients were stratified by tumor subsite (oropharynx and hypopharynx/larynx) and by
      tumor resectable status (resectable or irresectable advanced squamous cell).
