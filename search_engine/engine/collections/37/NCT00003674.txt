      therapy versus standard therapy alone on the overall survival rate of patients with advanced
      cancers. II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens and the effect on the quality of
      life of these patients. III. Assess the incidence of symptomatic thrombotic events such as
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), and clotted catheters in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prognostic index
      (good vs bad vs unsure), current therapy (systemic vs radiation vs both vs none), age (50 or
      under vs over 50), disease site (breast vs colon vs small cell lung vs nonsmall cell lung vs
      prostate), history of prior thrombotic event over 1 year ago (yes vs no), and gender.
      Patients are randomized to receive low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) plus standard
      therapy or standard therapy alone.
