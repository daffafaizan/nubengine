      mandibular fracture randomly treated either with non-rigid fixation on both fracture sides or
      a combination of rigid fixation on one side and non-rigid fixation on the other side. This is
      a study where patients will be treated per randomization to one of the two established
      treatments and followed for further clinical examination post-operatively at 6 weeks and 3
      months after the intervention.
