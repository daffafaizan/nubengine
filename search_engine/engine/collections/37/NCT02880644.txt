      a significant slow-down in blood flow, caused by various predisposing factors, results in the
      release of VEGF, leading to the breakdown of the blood-retinal-barrier and finally to macular
      edema. The level of VEGF has been also correlated with neovascularization and vascular
      permeability in patients with ischemic CRVO. Several treatments have been used to treat
      patients with CRVO such as hemodilution, surgery, laser treatment and corticoids injection.
      However anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents administered by
      intravitreal injection, improve both visual and anatomic outcomes in patients with macular
      edema secondary to CRVO. Aflibercept is a fusion protein, use by intravitreal injection. In
      patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO, Aflibercept demonstrated efficacy and safety
      in 2 parallel trials, interventional phase III studies, COPERNICUS study performed in United
      States and GALILEO study performed in Europe and Asia/Pacific. In these studies, anatomic
      outcomes such as ischemic progression and retinal perfusion status were evaluated as
      secondary objectives; the primary objective of these studies was visual outcome.

      With the project of Hermes Study, the first observational study conducted in France in
      patients with CRVO and treated with aflibercept, we would like to evaluate in real life the
      monitoring and the use of Aflibercept. The primary objective of this study will also be based
      on anatomic outcomes. The evolution of retinal ischemia and the degree of non-retinal
      perfusion will be particularly evaluated by using ultra wide field angiography technology.
