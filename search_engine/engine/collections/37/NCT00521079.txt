    
      The Maestro System is a neuromodulation system that consists of implantable and external
      components.

      Implantable components: two leads (one electrode each for the anterior and posterior
      intra-abdominal vagal nerve trunks) that are connected to an implantable neuroregulator.

      External components: one programmable, battery-powered, ambulatory external controller
      connected via a small, flexible cable to a cutaneous transmit coil that is positioned
      externally over the neuroregulator. A clinician programmer that transmits information to the
      controller and uploads data from the controller.

      All non-diabetic subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to therapy ON or therapy OFF
      groups. All type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to
      therapy ON or therapy OFF groups.

      All subjects will receive blinded therapy through the 12-month follow-up visit. All subjects
      will participate in a medical weight management program.
