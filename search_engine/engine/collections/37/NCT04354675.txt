    
      This is a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of pre-test genetic counseling using
      an artificial intelligence program and traditional in-person genetic counseling in women
      newly diagnosed with breast cancer who do not currently meet National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine up-take of testing for those who do not meet NCCN guidelines for genetic
           testing

        2. To assess overall patient satisfaction and comprehension in both groups

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        1. To assess mutation rate in the overall cohort

        2. Identify reasons for not pursuing genetic testing

        3. Identify any specific areas of improvement in satisfaction and comprehension

        4. Assess the impact of genetic testing on Time to Treatment in this cohort

        5. Develop workflow for offering genetic testing, providing pre-test genetic counseling,
           ordering testing, and delivering results
