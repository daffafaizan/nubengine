      written informed consent will be screened to determine eligibility for study entry.
      Participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a double-blind
      manner (participant and investigator) in a 4:1 ratio to aloe vera (study group) or placebo
      (control group), respectively. The dosing regimen will be increased by 3 capsules every month
      for 3 months and then reduced by 2 capsules every week during the fourth month for both
      groups. Participants will remain in the study for sixteen weeks.
