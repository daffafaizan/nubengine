      Patients (CI Algorithm Study) is an acute data collection study using market released
      actigraphy devices (wGT3X-BT) and holter devices (DR 180) to measure study subjects' daily
      activities and surface ECG data simultaneously. The data will be analyzed to develop an
      algorithm to diagnose CI in patients with HF.
