      between the baseline and the post-intervention assessment.

      Secondary outcomes Change in the brain functional network from the baseline to the
      postintervention assessment was also assessed as a secondary outcome ascertained by the
      analysis of resting state fMRI, which has been used to show correlated spontaneous activity
      within cortical and subcortical regions that are functionally related.

      Further secondary outcomes were changes between the baseline and the post-intervention
      assessment on cognitive function measured by validated neuropsychological tests such as SNSB
      and CANTAB on participants' depressive and anxiety symptoms scored by Geriatric Depression
      Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory respectively, on self reported memory problems measured
      by Korean Dementia Screenng Questionnaire, Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire and
      Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, on functions of daily living acitivity
      measured by Bayer ADL, on quality of life measuared by WHOQOL-bref.
