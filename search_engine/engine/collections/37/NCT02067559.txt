    
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study involving patients who are in the ICU, for a
      minimum of 72 hrs with > 24 hrs mechanical ventilation. As is common in ICU research, proxy
      consent will be obtained from family members upon ICU admission. Patients will be randomized
      to 4 different conditions (1) treatment as usual (TAU) (2) ICU diary (3) psychoeducation (4)
      ICU diary + psychoeducation. The ICU diary will be created and maintained by nurses and
      family members for each patient randomized to condition (2) and (4), and will be given to
      patients by a research nurse upon discharge from the ICU. The patients in conditions (3) and
      (4) will receive a psychoeducational brochure detailing general treatment and sedation
      patients receive in the ICU, and the psychological symptoms such as depression and PTSD that
      can occur after a stay in the ICU. This brochure will also be sent to their follow-up
      physician. Patients in all conditions will be assessed at one week post-ICU for recollection
      of delusional memories using ICU Memory Tool (ICUMT), at one- and three-month post-ICU for
      baseline PTSD symptoms using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), a commonly used measure
      of PTSD symptomatology, as well as measures of anxiety/depression, social support, and
      general health. At one and three month follow-up, the investigators will also ask patients if
      they had contact with their health care providers/follow-up physicians, sought mental health
      treatment, their general impressions of the intervention they received (diary,
      psychoeducation, both), and whether/how often they reviewed the document (if in conditions
      2-4). The investigators will ascertain feasibility from the health care provider and family
      perspective by appending a short questionnaire to the diary, to be filled out each time an
      entry is made.
