      causative role in migraine. Nociceptin immunoreactivity and ORL-1 mRNA have been detected in
      human trigeminal ganglia where it was co-localized with CGRP. It may play a role in migraine
      pathogenesis. We are collecting the blood samples of migraineurs for analysis of these
      neuropeptides.
