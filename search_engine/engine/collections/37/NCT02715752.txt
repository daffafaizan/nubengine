      health, 'relieving symptoms', and the interventions that cause such movement, drugs,
      medications, or therapies. The alternative community calls the movement from normal health to
      superior health, 'boosting health' (or boosting the immune system, or improving your sex
      drive, or boosting any another well functioning physiological system), and the interventions
      that cause such movement, natural remedies, dietary supplements, complementary treatments,
      etc. In general, these interventions aim to achieve superior performance of a normal human
      body. Of course, boosting the body's normal performance improves many of its capabilities,
      such as higher resistance to diseases, faster recovery from fatigue, better mental
      concentration, etc. Each movement presents different objectives. Relieving symptoms
      represents the ability of an intervention to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of
      a disease. In contrast, boosting health represents the ability of an intervention to increase
      the frequency, duration, and quality of a person's health. In the current study, the
      investigators would like to measure the changes in health-related complaints by analyzing
      charts of individuals, who are infected with latent virus, and who have used
      Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin.
