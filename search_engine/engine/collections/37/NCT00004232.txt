        -  Determine the toxicity of unmanipulated bone marrow augmented with CD34+ enriched
           peripheral blood stem cells in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing
           allogeneic transplantation.

        -  Evaluate this treatment regimen in terms of kinetics of hematopoietic engraftment,
           infection, severity of graft-vs-host disease, relapse rate, and cost effectiveness in
           this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo allogeneic transplantation comprising unmanipulated bone marrow
      with filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

      Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV over 24 hours
      on day -1 and methylprednisolone IV or oral prednisone daily on days 7-65. Patients also
      receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months and 1 year, and then annually for 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
