      access of EMR is more and more convenient. However, there still have difficulties in
      analyzing all the clinical data directly due to a large number of records using the narrative
      format. In order to perform research smoothly, the process of information extraction is
      required for translating data in clinical text into available format for analysis and
      statistic. In medical research, the problem of missing data occurs frequently. It is
      important to develop the method with better imputation performance in the stability and
      accuracy. The purposes of this project are to provide the data integration and extraction
      methods for handling the structured and unstructured data sources in more efficient ways, to
      provide the validation scheme for facilitating the data reviewing of extracted results
      produced by information extraction modules, to increase the quality of clinical data by
      comparing the data from different data sources and correcting data errors and inconsistent,
      to handle the clinical data with the properties of time series and incompleteness, to
      increase accuracy of data analysis and increase quality of health care by improving the
      completeness and correctness of clinical data, to provide flexibility of methods in the
      platform. In the project, the disease topic is focused on the liver cancer patients' clinical
      data and we hope the methods in the projects can be extended to handle other diseases by
      replacing these knowledge models in the future.
