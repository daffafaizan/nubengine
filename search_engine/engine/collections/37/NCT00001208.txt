      associated with involuntary muscles spasms or movement. The application of botulinum toxin
      therapy to movement disorders requires treatment tailored to the individual patient and
      specific techniques of injection. This protocol 1) allows us to follow the natural history of
      subjects with movement disorders who receive standard botox injections for treatment of
      movement disorders and 2) allows us to provide botulinum toxin injections for patients
      participating in other studies on the physiology of sensorimotor systems and on the
      physiological effects of botulinum toxin.
