      Caribbean, we aimed to determine the frequency of geophagy and the level of knowledge about
      its health effects among healthy adults originating from these countries and attending a
      travel medicine and international vaccination consultation in France.

      A cross-sectional study was performed in the consultation for travel medicine and
      international vaccination in Reims University Hospital, France. All adult travellers who were
      natives of Sub Saharan Africa, South America and the Caribbean or born in France of parents
      from these countries were eligible to complete a confidential questionnaire about geophagy,
      which was defined as eating soil or clay. Descriptive analysis was performed.
