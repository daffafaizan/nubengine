      consisted of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase lasted
      up to 1 week, during which participants were assessed for their eligibility to participate in
      the study. The Randomization Phase consisted of 3 periods: Titration (6 weeks), Maintenance
      (13 weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks; only for those participants not rolling over into the
      Extension Phase). During the Core Study Titration and Maintenance Periods, participants were
      randomized into perampanel (2 to 12 mg per day) or placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio
      within each of the age-matched categories (ie, greater than or equal to 12 to less than 15
      and greater than or equal to 15 to less than 18).

      The extension phase consisted of part A (Conversion Period - 6 weeks and Maintenance period -
      25 weeks) and Part B (Optional Extension Phase -52 weeks). The maximum duration for
      participation in Part B was 52 weeks.
