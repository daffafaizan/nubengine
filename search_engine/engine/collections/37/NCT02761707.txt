      effects on the motor system, afflicts more than six million people worldwide, imposing
      enormous burdens on patients, relatives, caretakers, and society in general. Diagnostic
      errors are common, particularly as symptoms first arise. The most common misdiagnoses are
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), essential tremor, and vascular pseudo-Parkinson's Disease. An
      accurate diagnosis is typically made at a later stage of the disease when marked and
      irreversible damage has occurred within the motor control system of the brain. Sensitive and
      specific biomarkers of the early stages of PD are urgently needed. Identification of such
      markers is critical for the development and assessment of medications and other interventions
      designed to eliminate or reduce the gradual and irreversible decline of neurons involved in
      the disorder. This study seeks to establish the sensitivity and specificity of what appears
      to be a unique brainstem biomarker of PD - an electrically induced trigeminal nerve blink
      reflex response - in differentiation of early stage PD from normal controls and such
      neurodegenerative diseases as early stage AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and
      diffuse Lewy Body disease (DLBD). This study will additionally compare the biomarker to
      olfactory test results.
