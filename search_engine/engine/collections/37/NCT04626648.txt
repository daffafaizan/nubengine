      endpoint was intra-individual change in salivary cortisol between simulations with or without
      a pause including a sugar containing drink. Secondary endpoints were change in heart rate,
      change in self-perceived stress measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and
      experience of the intraoperative pause.
