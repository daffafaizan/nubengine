      will be screened for the presence of severe sepsis. Those who are deemed eligible and provide
      consent will be enrolled. Study patients will receive additional physical therapy according
      to a protocol developed for this study in addition to the usual care recommended by their
      regular treating physician. Additional treatments will be individualized based on enrolled
      patients' baseline physical function and progress and may include standing, stretching,
      transferring, and walking - either with assistance or independently. Treating therapists have
      been trained in the use of the protocol and individualization to maintain the highest
      standard of patient safety. Patients will be contacted 30 days after discharge to answer
      questions about their health and ability to perform routine tasks at home.
