      is based on the replacement of OPV with IPV; however, IPV is not efficient in preventing
      person-to-person poliovirus transmission, particularly in settings of poor hygiene, due to
      limited impact on intestinal mucosal immunity compared to OPV. The addition of an adjuvant,
      in particular one that may direct the response towards mucosal homing may offset that
      deficiency.

      In this study, the safety and tolerability of IPV co-administered with dmLT will be assessed,
      as well as whether co-administration of dmLT with IPV enhances mucosal responses compared to
      those with IPV alone.
