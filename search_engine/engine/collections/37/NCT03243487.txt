      Sleep Center, the deployment of a structured adherence management program and a web-based
      information program designed for participants beginning positive airway pressure therapy
      results in a greater portion of participants meeting CMS adherence requirements (use > 4hrs
      on >=70% of nights) at 90 days.

      Secondary aims:

        1. Results in higher nightly use of therapy (hours per night and % of nights with at least
           4 hours of use) at 90 days

        2. Results in participant satisfaction that is superior to current standard care

        3. Offers operational efficiencies or economic benefits to the health care facility
           (reduced staff time (sleep clinic and physician), equipment consumption, unplanned
           participant contacts or visits, and reduced overtime)

        4. Results in indirect benefits to participants (fewer clinic visits, less travel or
           in-clinic/ office visit waiting time)
