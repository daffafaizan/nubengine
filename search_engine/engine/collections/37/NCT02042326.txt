      the rationale to use it in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations, for which the
      pathophysiology remains poorly understood. The interest of this class of drug is that
      inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) may also block growth and / or angiogenic
      factors (other than VEGF) involved in the development of AVM. More specifically anti-VEGF
      drugs does not have that potential.
