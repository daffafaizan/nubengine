      vision loss, resulting in reduced visual acuity and reduced sensitivity to contrast. Our
      previous findings (see CITATIONS) show that the adult amblyopic brain is still plastic and
      malleable, suggesting that active approach is potential useful in treating amblyopia. The
      goal of this project is to assess the limits and mechanisms of neural plasticity in both
      normal and amblyopic spatial vision. This study uses psychophysical measures to study neural
      plasticity in both adults and children with amblyopia. Research participants will be asked to
      practice a visual discrimination task (perceptual learning) or to play video games with the
      amblyopic eye for a period of time. A range of visual functions will be monitored during the
      course of treatment.
