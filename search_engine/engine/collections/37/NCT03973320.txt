      worse outcomes in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty. The plan to analyze the outcomes is listed
      below:

      Primary outcomes:

      Multiple logistic regression will be used to compute the adjusted odds ratios of any
      postoperative complications (MI, CVA, death) , adjusting for covariates including duration of
      intraoperative mean arterial pressure of less than pre-defined threshold, such as 55, or 60
      mmHg mean blood pressure.

      Sensitivity analyses will also consider the effects of intra-operative hypotension (IOH)
      defined as mean blood pressure of less than 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mm Hg.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Multiple logistic regression will be to compute the adjusted odds ratios of individual
      postoperative complications, (such as MI, CVA, stroke) , adjusting for covariates including
      duration of intraoperative mean blood pressure of less than pre-defined threshold, such as
      55, or 60 mmHg mean blood pressure. Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to test the
      effects of extend of IOH on complications.
