      than ameliorating deficits in contrast to standard psychotherapy.

      A lack of positive emotions, engagement and felt meaning are typically viewed as consequences
      or mere correlates of depression, while the PPT suggests that these may be causal for
      depression. Therefore building positive emotion, engagement and meaning will alleviate
      depression.

      Thus PPT may offer a new way to treat and prevent depression.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of the Positive Psychotherapy on depressive
      symptoms, life satisfaction and happiness in comparison to standard cognitive behavior
      psychotherapy (regular cognitive behavioral therapy).

      60 mildly to moderately depressed patients are randomly assigned to the Positive
      Psychotherapy group or the regular cognitive behavioral therapy group.

      Both treatments (primary intervention group and control group) are conducted in an outpatient
      group therapy setting with 14 sessions and a duration of 2-hours-per-week in small groups of
      6 or 7 patients.
