      delayed stent strut re-endothelialization. Thus it seems conceivable that a longer duration
      of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) after DES implantation is needed.
      However, no studies have been done to investigate which is the optimal antiplatelet therapy
      duration after DES implantation. Therefore, the objective of the randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled ISAR-SAFE study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 6 month versus
      a 12 month duration of clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation.

      Patients on clopidogrel therapy at least 6 months after DES implantation, who do not require
      a reintervention will be randomized to an additional 6 month period of clopidogrel or
      placebo. The patients will be followed-up for 9 months after randomization.
