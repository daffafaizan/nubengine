      the placebo (n = 25) or coenzyme Q10 groups (n = 25). The intervention will administer for 12
      weeks. The concentrations of coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress marker (malondialdehyde),
      antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase),
      inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and biochemical
      parameters (fasting glucose, A1C, insulin, C-peptide, and lipid profiles), and blood pressure
      will measure. Hopefully, the results of this study could provide the information of
      water-soluble ubiquinol supplement for clinical doctors and dietitians recommend that
      diabetes patients deserve to know whether the use of coenzyme Q10 supplement.
