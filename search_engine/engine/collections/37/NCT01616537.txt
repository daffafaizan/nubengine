      dimensions: pain during placement or use (Q1, Q2), contribution to the comfort of the
      treatment (Q3, Q4, Q7, Q10, Q12), esthetics and privacy (Q5, Q6, Q8, Q11, Q17, Q19), the
      impact on professional activities, social and sports (Q9, Q13, Q14, Q18, Q20), the impact on
      daily activities (Q15, Q16, Q21, Q22 ), local discomfort (Q23, Q24, Q25, Q26) and overall
      satisfaction (Q27). The device-related answers were of two types: Likert or visual analogue
      scale. Four types of Likert response were available: "no", "low," "moderate,"
      "significant,"/"never," "sometimes," "often," "always "/" very easy "," easy "," difficult
      "," very difficult "/" not at all "," somewhat "," a lot "," extremely ". These questions are
      scored 0, 33, 67, 100, respectively, when the scores are correlated with symptoms, or 100,
      67, 33, 0 when the scores are inversely correlated with symptoms. Visual analog scales (VAS)
      have a length of 100 mm. The score represents the number of mm measured on the scale. A mean
      score of acceptance and satisfaction can be calculated on a scale of 0 to 100 for all seven
      dimensions using the following formula: {(100-score DO) + CO + score (score ES-100) + (100-PR
      score) + (100-ES score) + (score 100-IN) + SA score} / 7. The higher the overall score, the
      greater the acceptance and satisfaction

      The questionnaire is administered to the patient 30 days (+/-7 days) after CVC implantation.
