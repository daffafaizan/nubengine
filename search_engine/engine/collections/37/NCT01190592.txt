    
      We will recruit 150 healthy, adolescent middle school boys and girls (grades 7 through 9),
      BMI > 50th percentile < 98th percentile, who will participate in 6 months of supervised
      resistance training (3 days/wk) and will be randomized to one of 3 groups: RT + milk, RT +
      isocaloric carbohydrate, RT only (control). Both physical activity and diet outside the study
      protocol will be carefully monitored. Measurements will be completed at baseline 3 months and
      upon completion of the training protocol at 6 months.
