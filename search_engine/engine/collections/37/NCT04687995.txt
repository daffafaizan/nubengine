      a more direct and wider surgical viewing angle, largely reduces the necessity for a traumatic
      postauricular incision. Some otolgists have adopted this technique using the nearby tragal
      perichondrium/cartilage graft. The tragus has a pivotal function in reconstruction in ear
      surgery. The superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) was first introduced by Mits and
      Peyroniein1976. It is located in the mid-face overlying the parotid gland and mimic muscles,
      It connects the dermis and the muscles, acting as a unique motor unit to produce facial
      expressions. The SMAS graft has great potential because it is accessible from the least
      invasive transcanal route of tympanoplasty, and is located away from the vital structures.
