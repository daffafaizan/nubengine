      the study. In eligible a number of studies will be conducted:

        -  detailed clinical examination

        -  routine laboratory tests

        -  lung ultrasound

        -  muscle strength with a dynamometer

        -  ultrasound assessment of upper limb vessels with assessment of fistula function (in the
           case of active fistula) and for the possibility of future vascular access

        -  blood collection and protection (10-15 ml) for biomarkers

        -  survey EQ-5D-5L and LVD-36

        -  functional strength test.

      The obtained clinical data and test results will be subject to statistical analysis after
      anonymization. The impact of individual parameters on long-term prognosis will be assessed.
