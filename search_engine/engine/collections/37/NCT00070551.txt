      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of GTI-2040 and
      high-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the therapeutic response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (under age
      60 vs age 60 and over). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 strata.

      Stratum I (under age 60): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-6 and high-dose
      cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 2, 4, and 6.

      Stratum II (age 60 and over): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-6 and
      high-dose cytarabine IV over 4 hours once daily on days 2-6.

      In both strata, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and high-dose
      cytarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-51patients will be accrued for this study within 2-16 months.
