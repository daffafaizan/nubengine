      given involvement of the major drainage pathway of both superficial femoral and deep femoral
      veins. This would not only affect the primary venous drainage, but would also compromise the
      ability to develop efficient collateral pathways. This creates higher chances of developing
      post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The proposed trial would utilize Angiojet thrombectomy
      followed by catheter directed thrombolysis and Anticoagulation compared to Anticoagulation
      alone. To assess whether Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) therapy
      utilizing AngioJet and tPA for the treatment of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis can safely
      and effectively reduce post thrombotic syndrome after 24 months.
