    
      This study is a pilot test of an intervention to engage residents and their family and the
      healthcare team in a collaborative approach to decisions about care planning in long-term
      care. The intervention includes leadership coaching with the management team, an educational
      bundle that includes a one-day education session for staff and managers on communication
      strategies and ways to engage family and residents in care planning and follow-up visits, and
      a series of resident and family led huddles (brief, 15 minute meetings) to discuss something
      important with staff to foster proactive communication and information sharing.

      The study aims are to describe the feasibility and acceptability of the resident and family
      engagement intervention, and to evaluate the following outcomes: resident quality of life,
      resident and family satisfaction with care, and staff quality of work life. The investigators
      aim to recruit 20 staff, the leadership team, and 12 resident-family dyads from four
      long-term care facilities who will receive the intervention and complete the survey measures.
      The expected outcome from this study is an increased understanding of how to engage residents
      and family in care decisions impacting quality of life.
