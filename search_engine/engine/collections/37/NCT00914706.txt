      specified clinical measurements each with regular repeats at different specified time
      intervals or on specified conditions. It is virtually impossible for health care providers to
      adhere consistently to guidelines and to do so sustainability as well as equitably for "most
      if not all" of their patients with diabetes. Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee
      (OHTAC) has requested the following study. Aggregate monthly primary care practice level data
      will form the basis of the analysis. Primary care practitioners in Ontario will be enrolled.
      Differences in 1-year outcome measures within will be performed. Baseline, 2 month, 6 month
      and 12 month site team member surveys will be completed. Using patient level data from each
      site, a cost-utility analysis will be conducted. Six aspects related to the use of the CDMS
      will be examined.

        1. Change in proportion of the patients in whom monitoring frequency is up to date for A1C,
           blood pressure and cholesterol.

        2. Change in proportion of patients who are well controlled with A1C < 0.07, blood pressure
           < 130/80 and LDL-cholesterol < 2.0.

        3. Change from baseline across sites in the percentage of patients with an up-to-date foot
           exam, retinopathy screening, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or
           angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and documentation of self-management goals.

        4. Site questionnaires.

        5. Changes in physician MOHLTC diabetes incentive billings.

        6. Long-term cost-utility of the use of the CDMS.
