      determine if they are eligible for clinical trials of investigational products conducted by
      the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH at the NIH Clinical Center. Educational
      materials on the investigational products and protocols will be reviewed with and provided to
      subjects during participation in the screening protocol. Approximately 3,000 adults 18 years
      of age or older will be enrolled; however, the age ranges may be more restrictive for some
      clinical trials. Recruitment efforts at any given time will focus on the age ranges specified
      for the VRC studies that are in development or open to accrual.
