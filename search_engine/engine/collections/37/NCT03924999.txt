      abnormal increase of subcutaneous adipose tissue, especially in the lower extremities. It is
      often seen in female sex. The main determinants of lipedema are bilateral symmetric swelling
      of the hypodermis of the legs which are painful with palpation or spontaneous and easy
      ecchymosis and hematoma with minor trauma.

      Lipedema usually begins in the period of hormonal change in adolescence or after a few years
      and can progress in women during hormone changes such as pregnancy, gynecologic surgery or
      menopause.

      Lipedema is a different diagnosis from obesity, but it can be misdiagnosed as primary obesity
      due to clinical overlap. In contrast to obesity, lipoedema may not improve with weight loss
      and does not include the risk of metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, hypertension and
      dyslipidemia. However, if not treated for lipedema, medical complications such as
      hypermobility, joint problems, walking difficulties, and psychological complications such as
      anxiety and depression may develop.

      Treatment for lipedema includes conservative and surgical options. In conservative treatment
      to control edema, combined decongestive treatment which consists of manual lymphatic drainage
      and compression bandaging, intermittent pneumatic compression and exercise options are
      included.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of combined decongestive treatment and
      intermittent pneumatic compression treatment combined with aerobic exercise on pain, quality
      of life and fatigue in patients with lipedema.
