      graft (SCTG) plus coronally advanced flap (CAF) which is defined as the golden standard for
      the treatment of gingival recessions and Xenogenic collagen matrix (XCM) plus coronally
      advanced flap (CAF) to treat class I Miller gingival recession. CAF elevation will be done as
      it described by (De Sanctis & Zucchelli 2007) with modifications in the the control group.The
      flap will be partially elevated in the (SCTG+CAF) group while it will be a split-full-split
      thickness flap in the (XCM+CAF) group, and finally the flap will stabilized coronally.
      Fifteen patients who have bilateral buccal Miller Class I gingival recession defects will be
      enrolled in this study. These defects will be distributed randomly into two groups: the test
      group (XCM+CAF) and control group (SCTG+CAF). Clinical parameters will be evaluated:
      Recession depth (REC), change in visible plaque index, recession width (RW), width of
      keratinized tissue (KT), thickness of gingival tissue (GT), probing depth (PD), clinical
      attachment level (CAL), healing index (HI), questionnaires will be given to evaluate each of
      patient perceptions, pain index (PI), and changes in root sensitivity by using visual analog
      scale (VAS).
