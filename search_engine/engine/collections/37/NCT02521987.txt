      allow abdominal access and abdominal insufflation through "ports". The increase in operative
      times is mostly due to the need to pass suture, needles, cameras and instruments through the
      abdominal ports. While, it is intuitive that smaller abdominal ports will result in less pain
      at the incision site, the port size is also limited by instrument size and the size of the
      needle. When ports are smaller, it can take a little more time for a needle or instrument to
      be passed into the port.

      There is a paucity of research comparing different port sizes as they relate to participate
      pain and operative time especially in a randomized controlled trial setting. The
      investigators goal would be to determine if there is a difference in pain perception by
      patients when the assistant port size varies by 50% (8 mm to 12 mm).
