      nebulized salbutamol in all hospitalized children (1 month to 24 months) in treatment of
      bronchiolitis. A randomized clinical trial which recruits children admitted to the pediatrics
      department with diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Children aged 1 month to 2 years will be included
      in the study.

      Children who meet the inclusion criteria will be alternately distributed in two groups:

      Group 1:

      Will receive salbutamol (2 units/kg) with 3 ml normal saline by nebulizer.

      Group 2:

      Will receive epinephrine (0.5 mg/dose) with 3 ml normal saline by nebulizer. All admitted
      patients will receive aerosol every 20 minutes three times and after, depending on the
      clinical status of the patients, they will be given oxygen therapy at 1.5 liters / minute at
      the admission if oxygen saturation is below 94% till the normalization of the oxygen
      saturation.

      Clinical parameters such as clinical score, oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, heart
      rate, and temperature will be measured at admission, at hour 1 to hour 12 and then every 24
      hours until they are discharged.
