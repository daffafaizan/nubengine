      mucositis associated with targeted supradose cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy (RADPLAT
      protocol) in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II.
      Determine the efficacy of amifostine in alleviating other treatment related morbidities
      associated with this protocol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study of amifostine. Patients receive external
      beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6.5-7.5 weeks. Concurrent with
      radiotherapy, patients receive amifostine IV over 10 minutes, 30 minutes prior to cisplatin,
      then cisplatin intra-arterially over 3-5 minutes. Chemotherapy and amifostine course is
      repeated every week for 4 weeks. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued into this study over 12-18
      months.
