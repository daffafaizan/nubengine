    
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the correlation between simultaneous
      concentrations of propofol in plasma and expiratory air in children during general
      anesthesia.

      Key secondary objectives include correlating plasma and exhaled measurements of propofol with
      electroencephalogram (BIS) values and computer estimated propofol concentrations in plasma
      and brain (TCI: target control infusion) Primary endpoint: Exhaled air and plasma
      concentration ratios of propofol during general anesthesia in children.
