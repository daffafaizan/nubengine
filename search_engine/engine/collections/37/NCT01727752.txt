      intervention with Coflex速 is equivalent to surgical decompression after 12 months in people
      with intermittent claudication. The main advantage of coflex速 might be a faster recovery
      after surgery, but after long term follow-up it is unknown if this treatment effect remains.
      Therefore in addition, it will be investigated whether surgical intervention with coflex速 is
      more effective than surgical decompression on short-term follow-up (8 weeks to 6 months) and
      whether surgical intervention with coflex速 is more cost-effective after 12 months than
      surgical decompression.
