      fogging, larviciding) has failed to contain dengue epidemics and to prevent the global range
      expansion of Aedes-borne diseases (ABDs: dengue, chikungunya, zika). Part of the challenge in
      sustaining effective ABD control emerges from the remarkable paucity of evidence about the
      epidemiological impact of any vector control method. Furthermore, the classic deployment of
      interventions in response to clinical cases fails to account for the important contribution
      of out-of-home human mobility and asymptomatic infections.

      The trial will be conducted in the city of Merida extending ongoing longitudinal cohort to
      follow a population of 4,600 children 2-15 years old randomly allocated to receive either
      TIRS treatment or not. If efficacious, TIRS will drive a paradigm shift in Aedes control by:
      considering Ae. aegypti behavior to rationally guide insecticide applications; the change to
      preventive control (pre- ABD transmission season rather than in response to symptomatic
      cases); the use of third generation insecticides to which Ae. Aegypti is susceptible.
