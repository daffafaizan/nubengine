      tubal ostia, allowing also the visualization of vaginal walls and the cervical canal.
      Compared to the other available diagnostic techniques, hysteroscopy has the advantage of
      directly visualization the anatomical area to be investigated and allows to perform biopsy.
      The possibility of hysteroscopy-guided biopsy sampling is particularly important in order to
      get histological diagnosis. As recently suggested, the hysteroscopic biopsy of the
      endometrium has diagnostic accuracy of 90% for post-menopausal endometrial cancer.

      Currently, most diagnostic hysteroscopies are performed in outpatient setting, without
      anesthesia, using modern hysteroscopes with a 1.67 mm working channel. In particular,
      endometrial biopsy is usually performed through the classic spoon grasper or alligator
      grasper. Recently, a new hysteroscopic grasper with knurled terminal end and cutting jaws was
      designed, in order to improve feasibility of the procedure, reduce its duration and the
      discomfort for the patients.

      This study aims to compare the outcomes of the three hysteroscopic graspers for endometrial
      biopsy in post-menopausal patients.
