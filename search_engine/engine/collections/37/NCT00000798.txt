      characteristics of an effective HIV vaccine, such as induction of mucosal immunity,
      production of cytotoxic T cells, and ease of administration. An oral microparticulate vaccine
      containing a prototype synthetic peptide has been developed. The microparticles can be
      degraded over time, inducing both secretory and systemic immune responses.

      Twelve volunteers per dose regimen will receive oral microparticulate multivalent HIV-1
      peptide vaccine at months 0, 1, and 6, either daily as a low dose for 3 days or a single
      higher dose. Additionally, four volunteers per regimen will receive placebo. Volunteers are
      followed for 1 year. They will be contacted once or twice yearly for 5 years to check on
      health status.
