      mg/1800 mg per day WS® 1442 is determined by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital
      signs as well as by a treadmill test at the beginning and the end of the study. Endothelial
      function measured before and after two different training modalities is compared to that
      measured before and after intake of two different doses of WS® 1442.
