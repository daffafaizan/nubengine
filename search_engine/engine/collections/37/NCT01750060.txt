    
      "The Study System is a single-use system that consists of two parts: a Drug Unit containing
      10.8 mg fentanyl hydrochloride, and a Controller that supplies the dosing current. The two
      parts are packaged separately and assembled immediately prior to use. The Study System will
      be applied to the upper, outer arm of each subject. Fentanyl will be delivered from the Study
      System via transdermal iontophoresis using a current of 170 mcAmp (Treatment B), 140 mcAmp
      (Treatment C), 200 mcAmp (Treatment D), or 230 mcAmp (Treatment E). Each subject will be
      randomly assigned to a treatment sequence consisting of Treatment A (IV fentanyl citrate),
      Study System Treatment B (170 mcAmp), and one of three additional Study System treatments
      consisting of Treatment C (140 mcAmp), Treatment D (200 mcAmp), or Treatment E (230 mcAmp).
      Each subject will therefore receive a total of three treatments (A and B and either C, D, or
      E).

      The specific treatments are outlined in detail below:

        -  Treatment A: Fentanyl citrate (equivalent to 80 mcg fentanyl) administered over 20
           minutes by IV infusion every hour through 23.33 hours.

        -  Treatment B: Two consecutive 40 mcg fentanyl doses each delivered over 10 minutes by the
           Study System (170 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.

        -  Treatment C: Two consecutive 35 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by
           the Study System (140 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.

        -  Treatment D: Two consecutive 50 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by
           the Study System (200 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.

        -  Treatment E: Two consecutive 54 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by
           the Study System (230 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours.

      Naltrexone (50 mg) will be administered orally (PO) every 12 hours, beginning 14 hours before
      the start of each fentanyl treatment and ending approximately 11 hours after completion of
      each treatment "
