      of early EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN). "Early" refers to the fact that, in
      contrast to previous CPN trials, we targeted patients with inoperable, painful pancreatic
      cancer in whom pain was mild and who were taking little or no narcotics. Our a priori
      hypotheses were that, compared to conventional management with narcotics alone, early
      neurolysis: 1) will better control pain related to inoperable pancreatic cancer, 2) will
      prevent the escalating use of narcotics associated with disease progression, 3) will improve
      quality of life, and 4) will improve survival. The aim our study is to test these 4
      hypotheses.
