      transplantation (HSCT). Gut is the most vulnerable target organ of acute GVHD. Patients who
      develope the acute gut GVHD and do not respond to the first line therapy with steroids have a
      high mortality. The investigation of safe and effective second line therapy for these
      patients are in need. The study evaluates safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of streoid resistant GVHD of the gut. Stool for FMT
      will be prepared from the healthy donor.This strategy might offer a safe and effective
      therapeutic approach for these acute steroid resistant gut GVHD patients.
