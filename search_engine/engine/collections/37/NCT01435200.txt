      include oral iron supplementation and blood transfusion. However, oral iron has
      gastrointestinal side effects, which affects patient compliance, and only a small amount of
      oral iron can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Intravenous iron may overcome a
      block of iron absorption and iron recycling induced by hepcidin. Therefore, it may increase
      hemoglobin level and reduced blood transfusion in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
