      Primary:

      â€¢ To evaluate diagnostic yield

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate rate of pneumothorax.

        -  To evaluate rate of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement.

        -  To evaluate clinically significant bleeding (defined by bleeding requiring
           intervention).

        -  To evaluate need for hospitalization after procedure.

        -  To evaluate duration of the procedure.

        -  To evaluate procedural factors associated with improved yield (type of biopsy, number of
           biopsies, use of radial ultrasound, presence of a bronchus sign, biopsy site).

        -  To evaluate need for additional nodule biopsy.

        -  To evaluate need for additional procedure for staging.

        -  To evaluate radiation exposure from fluoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy and CT for CT-guided
           biopsy.

        -  To evaluate need for F-Nav during navigation bronchoscopy.

        -  To evaluate bronchoscopy yield defined as the combination of the primary endpoint
           (navigation diagnostic yield) and yield from endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal
           and/or hilar lymph node biopsies.
