    
      Extra corporeal circulation and aortic clamp induce ischemia-reperfusion damages.

      Vascular damages are represented by first glycocalyx, a layer of endovascular vessel
      proteoglycans, responsible for fluid permeability and secondly by nitro oxygen liberation
      responsible for vascular tonus.

      The investigators suppose that both functions are impaired after cardiac surgery.
