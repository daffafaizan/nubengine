    
      This is a multicenter study that will compare ipragliflozin/metformin with
      glimepiride/metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with albuminuria.

      The study will include screening and 24-week treatment period. Subjects entering the study
      have been on a stable dose of at least 1000 mg/day metformin monotherapy for at least 8 weeks
      (56 days) prior to Visit 1. For randomization, subject will be stratified by the site and the
      administration of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin receptor blockers and/or
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors) at Visit 2. Subjects will be centrally randomized
      to either ipragliflozin/metformin group or glimepiride/metformin group and receive 24-week
      treatment by each group
