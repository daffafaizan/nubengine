        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan hydrochloride combined with
           high-dose cyclophosphamide and carboplatin in the setting of autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation for relapsed, recurrent, or persistent ovarian epithelial or
           primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan.

        -  Autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection: Patients receive filgrastim
           subcutaneously (SC) daily for 5 days. Patients undergo leukapheresis per standard
           practice until a minimum of 2 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected and cryopreserved.

        -  High-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide
           IV, and carboplatin IV over 8 hours on days -6 to -3.

        -  Autologous peripheral stem cell reinfusion: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive sargramostim SC daily
           beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months
      for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 5 years.
