      immunotherapy after SBRT will be superior to treatment with immunotherapy alone and that
      SBRT, given to a single metastatic site of the tumor, will augment the immune response to the
      tumor. Objectives: Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients having a
      complete response, partial response or stable disease at 12 weeks, PFS, defined as time from
      randomization to disease progression or death, OS, defined as time from randomization to
      death (of any cause). Toxicity.
