      interrupts multiple biological processes which lead to organ injury following onset of
      sepsis. Data presented below suggests that ascorbic acid potently attenuates lung injury
      produced by septic insults. Sepsis and septic shock secondary to bacterial and fungal blood
      stream infections are a leading cause of death in critically ill patients. At present, 28 day
      mortality in septic patients averages 40% in the best of ICUs. In sepsis, disseminated
      intravascular coagulation produces widespread systemic microvascular thrombosis that leads to
      multiple organ injury (i.e., lung, liver, kidney, intestinal, cardiovascular). Despite
      aggressive intravascular volume resuscitation and vasopressor support, appropriate antibiotic
      administration, and expert critical care management, mortality remains high. Only a single
      agent has been approved to disrupt progressive sepsis-associated microvascular thrombosis
      (activated protein C, [Drodrecogin Alpha, brand name: Xigris, Lilly]). No other
      non-antibiotic pharmaceutical agent is currently approved for use in sepsis. Activated
      protein C (APC) continuous infusion protocol spans a 96 hour period. APC infusion produces
      significant anticoagulation, and therefore the major risk from its use is hemorrhage. Thus,
      recent surgery, especially neurosurgical procedures, is a major contraindication to APC use.
      Finally, cost stands as an important issue for APC use. A 96 hour APC infusion in a 70 kg
      patient at VCUHS costs the patient over $33,000 (source VCUHS Pharmacy Services). Use of APC
      in sepsis remains controversial and has failed to achieve widespread acceptance. The goal of
      the current study is to determine the safety of ascorbic acid infusion in septic humans.
