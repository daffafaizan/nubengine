        1. Screening period: All volunteers are required to sign a written informed consent form
           for the study; after the signing of informed consent form, the demographic data and
           medical history of the volunteers will be collected, and physical examinations and local
           laboratory tests will be performed to assess the eligibility of the volunteers.
           Volunteers who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria
           (except for the basic biological indicators of UCAR-T product preparation) will receive
           peripheral venous whole blood sampling, and the volunteers receiving apheresis based on
           the assessment results will be enrolled.

        2. Apheresis period: 5 volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo collection
           of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by means of apheresis.
