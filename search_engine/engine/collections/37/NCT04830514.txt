      protein sources. Investigators will observe the effects of recommended and common protein
      intakes on the maintenance of whole-body protein balance and potential for muscle protein
      anabolism.

      3 groups of 10 older subjects will be studied during daily protein intakes. Study duration
      per subject will be about 2 weeks.
