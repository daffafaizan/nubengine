      management with this group of patients their acute 24 hour evoked pain is less than
      anticipated; and the incidence of persistent pain and depression when contacted 2 months
      after delivery is decreased. This study is designed to see if these additional interventions
      would prove effective for patients at risk of having high pain level after cesarean surgery.
