      and MS in breast cancer surgery. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness
      of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      Prior research has shown that intraoperative MRI and MS are two types of tests that are
      feasible to use during cancer surgery and may be able to guide therapy. In this study, we are
      evaluating the accuracy of intra-operative MRI and MS in determining whether or not all
      cancer tissue was removed during breast surgery.
