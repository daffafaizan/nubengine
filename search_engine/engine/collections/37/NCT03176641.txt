      healing at the avascular zone. Additionally, the accelerated degeneration of articular
      cartilage and increased rate of knee osteoarthritis that can occur following a meniscal
      injury. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma that contains platelets and
      multiple growth factors concentrated at high level. Because activated platelets have the
      potential to release growth factors, PRP has been clinically used to accelerate wound healing
      and tissue regeneration in orthopedic and oral surgery. Several in vivo and in vitro studies
      have reported favorable outcomes of PRP on meniscal repair; however, the clinical results
      varied between studies.This clinical trial will investigate the effect of PRP on on meniscus
      injury. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive PRP with meniscus repair
      surgery or to receive meniscus repair surgery only. The postoperative imaging and clinical
      outcomes will be compared and analyzed.
