      cross-linking improves outcomes in microbial keratitis. Patients presenting to the Aravind
      Eye Hospitals in Madurai, India for treatment of microbial keratitis will be recruited for
      the proposed study. Approximately 266 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects
      presenting with bacterial keratitis will be randomized to receive medical therapy plus
      corneal collagen cross-linking at presentation or to receive medical therapy alone. All
      subjects with bacterial ulcers will receive standard topical antibiotic medications as
      required after the procedure.

      Subjects with fungal keratitis will be randomized into one of four groups:

        1. collagen cross-linking + amphotericin;

        2. collagen cross-linking + natamycin;

        3. amphotericin alone;

        4. natamycin alone.

      All study subjects will be followed for 12 months to evaluate response to treatment.

      Investigators from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will assist Aravind Eye
      Hospital with the study design, implementation, and analysis of the research, and will help
      fund the study. The investigators plan to visit Aravind to help with the study
      implementation. UCSF will play an important role in this study by assisting with the study
      design, implementation, analysis, and funding.
