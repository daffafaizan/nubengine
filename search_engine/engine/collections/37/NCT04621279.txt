      the effectiveness of TH versus normothermia for mild HIE on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2
      years of age.After standardizing all aspects of clinical care for mild HIE (except for TH vs.
      normothermia)we will enroll 460 infants with mild HIE into the longitudinal, observational
      comparative effectiveness study.The central aim of the comparative longitudinal cohort of
      mild HIE is (1) to compare the effectiveness of hypothermia to normothermia on
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years, (2) determine the adverse effects of TH on the infant
      and his/her family; and (3) determine the heterogeneity of treatment effects (moderating
      effect) across mild HIE subgroups as determined by physiological biomarkers obtained during
      the 6 hours window to initiate hypothermia. The decision to apply TH or normothermia will be
      entirely determined by practice parameters at each site.
