      I. To evaluate the utility of early (i.e. during treatment) digital (d)PET as a diagnostic
      tool to predict local control 6 months after definitive chemoradiation for patients with
      locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during treatment) and complete response (CR) on PET after definitive chemoradiation.

      II. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during) treatment and 2 year LC after definitive chemoradiation.

      III. To assess the ability of dynamic dPET compared to conventional PET or
      conventional-equivalent dPET reconstruction to identify tumor volumes with greater
      sensitivity at the time of before (dPET1), during (dPET2, dPET3) and after (dPET4, dPET5)
      chemoradiation.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive radiotracer injection and undergo dPET/CT over 20-75 minutes at
      baseline, during the 2nd and 4th week of radiotherapy, and 3 months after the completion of
      chemoradiation therapy.
