      Demographic data and risk factors responsible for PONV, including the history of PONV and
      motion sickness, were collected preoperatively by interviewing participants the day before
      anesthesia.

      All study subjects received a standardized anesthesia regimen. General anesthesia was induced
      by midazolam 0.04 mg/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and cisatracurium 0.2
      mg/kg (to facilitate tracheal intubation) given intravenously.Participants' lungs were
      ventilated with 50% oxygen in air.

      During general anesthesia, concentration of sevoflurane maintained 1.0% to 3.0% at the
      discretion of anesthetist who was not involved in the study. General anesthesia also uses
      propofol 1 mg kg-1 h-1 and sufentanil 0.1 μg kg-1 h-1 by continuous intravenous infusion. An
      Entropy index monitor was used to maintain the appropriate anesthesia depth by 40-60.
      Participants received a repeated bolus of sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg or cisatracurium intravenously
      on demand.

      After surgery the investigators recorded the data such as Anesthesia duration, doses of
      sufentanil and propofol and so on.

      At the end of surgery and after returning to the ward, flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg injection
      i.v. was administered as an analgesic therapy, respectively. Cholinesterase inhibitor-based
      neuromuscular reversal drugs and vitamine B6 were not administered after surgery. Bucinnazine
      hydrochloride 100 mg intramuscular injection (i.m.) as a rescue medication was administered
      to any participant whose visual analogue scale/score (VAS) was > 3.

      Ondansetron was given intravenously to the participants if necessary or requested . Unaware
      of the genotypes of the subjects, the investigators collected the participants' data
      including nausea, vomiting and pain.
