      Pre-procedural cardiac MRI will be performed with late-gadolinium enhancement to visualize
      the individual amount and distribution of fibrosis in the right and left atrium.
      CARTOFINDER-guided mapping will be performed during the ablation procedure followed by AF
      ablation. The individual relationship between atrial fibrosis and potential ablation targets
      will be accessed.
