      care (ANC) in primary care settings of India and Nepal. Currently, the usual pathways for
      obtaining ANC in India and Nepal start with Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and
      Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) respectively. These workers mobilize pregnant
      women in the community to attend ANC services with Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes (ANMs), who
      provide routine ANC, and refer women to physicians (MBBS doctors) at PHCs, or higher levels
      of care, as required. However, health programme managers and providers in both India and
      Nepal are cognizant of concerns over current ANC practice, and wish to enhance ANC in a
      number of ways. First, they recognize the changing disease burden and rising importance of
      PIH and GDM, and seek to increase access to specialized care when needed.

      The investigators propose using an EDSS intervention to enhance ANC. EDSS can allow FHWs to
      incorporate screening, detection and referral of high-risk pregnancies for appropriate
      clinical management into routine ANC services to improve glucose and blood pressure control
      and health outcomes for both mothers and babies. EDSS should also improve adherence to
      National ANC guidelines and provide an integrated continuum of maternal care services across
      several levels of care.
