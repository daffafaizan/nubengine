      allocated into two groups. The control group (n=15) was treated with scaling and root planing
      (SRP)+placebo whereas the test group (n=15) was treated with SRP and dietary supplementation
      of low-dose omega-3 PUFAs (6.25 mg EPA and 19.19 mg DHA). Clinical parameters were taken at
      baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months following therapy. Saliva samples were obtained at the same time
      intervals and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
