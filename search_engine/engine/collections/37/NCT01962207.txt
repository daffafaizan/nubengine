    
      The study aims to evaluate the antibody persistence post primary vaccination with active
      control, safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose uncontrolled post primary vaccination
      during different phases:

      Persistence phase: Long-term persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after primary vaccination
      with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY, in study MenACWY-TT-027.

      Booster phase: One month post booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT vaccine ten years after
      primary vaccination.

      The subjects in this study will be allocated to the same groups as in the vaccination study
      MenACWY-TT-027 (NCT00427908).
