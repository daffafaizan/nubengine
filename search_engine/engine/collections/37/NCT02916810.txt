      sensory areas and language-related areas are related to psychosis symptoms including auditory
      and visual hallucination, delusion, and thought disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS has
      been approved by FDA for treatment of depression. Other applications have not been approved
      but it has been used in a wide range of clinical research especially in neurology and
      psychiatry. Among psychotic symptoms, there are preliminary significant improvement in
      treatments of auditory hallucination using TMS with small samples, but those treatments are
      not robust in larger samples. The high inter-subject variability limits the efficacy of TMS
      treatment in schizophrenia patients. The investigators aim to develop a TMS treatment method
      with a fMRI-defined treatment target area, where the TMS target is individually identified to
      maximize the TMS effects. The identification method uses both the anatomical character and
      its functional relationship with auditory hallucination and other psychosis symptoms. If the
      current target-identification successfully identified effective TMS target individually, the
      treatment efficacy will be significant improved and more patients will benefit from TMS
      treatment.
