        -  Primary Specific Aims

             1. To conduct a cluster randomized trial to examine the reach, effectiveness,
                adoption, implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM) of Connection to Health (CTH) for
                patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care practice settings. Primary
                effectiveness outcomes will include hemoglobin A1c, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood
                pressure and Low Desity Lipprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

             2. To determine the incremental benefit, using the RE-AIM framework, of brief targeted
                practice coaching on the implementation of CTH in diverse primary care practices.

        -  Secondary Specific Aims

             1. To identify key practice characteristics (e.g., practice size, organization,
                setting, and level of experience with practice redesign efforts) that impact CTH
                RE-AIM. These results will inform dissemination of the CTH intervention.

             2. To determine the relative costs associated with implementing CTH and practice
                coaching to further inform dissemination efforts.
