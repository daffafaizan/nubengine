      be possible to improve significantly post-radiation xerostomia and quality of life if
      radiation techniques can be devised that would spare the salivary glands while adequately
      treating the targets. A new treatment modality (computer-optimized IMRT) facilitates
      increased sparing of noninvolved tissue, specifically the sparing of both parotid glands, and
      more conformal high-dose delivery to the bilateral neck targets in patients with head and
      neck cancer. This study will evaluate the benefits regarding xerostomia-specific and general
      QOL in patients receiving head and neck RT using this modality. Assessment of swallowing
      dysfunction and aspiration will be made using videofluoroscopy. In addition, this study will
      evaluate the pattern of local/regional tumor recurrence, to assess whether sparing both
      parotid glands may cause tumor recurrence in spared neck areas.
