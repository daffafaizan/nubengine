      region. For each subject enrolled we will also enroll a healthy control subject(matched by
      age , race and gender). Both the cases and control will undergo the same interview and have
      blood drawn for genetic analysis. The cases will have a chart abstraction done on their event
      medical record and be contacted for 3 and 6 month follow up(short interview). The genetic
      sample will be genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 gene chip looking for SNPs of interest and
      to identify genetic variants associated with ICH. The most promising SNPs identified through
      this process will be replicated in the external cohort from Massachusetts General Hospital.
