      protocol. You will provide and smoke your preferred brand cigarettes for an initial 5-day
      baseline period, then receive your own brand free-of-charge for an additional 5-day period,
      and then will receive free, investigational low nicotine cigarettes for the remaining study
      duration (i.e., 30 days total). Low nicotine cigarettes will be provided in three varieties;
      each variety will be used for a 10-day period, in counterbalanced order. Primary outcomes
      will include smoking behaviors (daily cigarette consumption and total puff volume), harm
      perceptions (i.e., beliefs about product safety), and tobacco exposure (i.e., carbon monoxide
      [CO]). You will complete in-person visits at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on
      Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) every 5 days, for a total of nine in-person visits.
