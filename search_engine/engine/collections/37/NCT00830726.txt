      salt-channels (Aquaporin-2 and Epithelial Sodium Channels) in the urine accurately reflects
      the handling of water and salt in the distal tubules af the kidneys, and whether
      quantification of these channels in the urine is useful to monitor and/or predict the effects
      of pharmacologic or surgical treatment of Heart Failure and heart failure-related diseases
      (Aortic stenosis, acute and chronic ischemic heart disease or pulmonary hypertension)
