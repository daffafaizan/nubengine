      matrix vaginal ring, containing 25 mg of dapivirine, to deliver investigational product for
      28 continuous days. The specific objectives were to:

        1. Assess the safety and tolerability of the vaginal ring containing dapivirine, when used
           continuously for 28 days, compared to a placebo ring

        2. Assess dapivirine concentrations in plasma before, during and after 28 days' use of a
           silicone elastomer matrix vaginal ring containing dapivirine

        3. Assess dapivirine concentrations in vaginal fluids before, during and after 28 days' use
           of a silicone elastomer matrix vaginal ring containing dapivirine. Safety was evaluated
           from clinical evaluations, clinical laboratory test results and adverse events (AEs).
           The pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was made based on systemic absorption from plasma
           concentrations and local disposition from vaginal fluid concentrations.
