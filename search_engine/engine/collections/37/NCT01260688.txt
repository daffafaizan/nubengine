      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with docetaxel-resistant and
      castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cediranib maleate with versus without
      dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the safety and tolerability of cediranib maleate with versus without dasatinib
      in these patients.

      II. To calculate objective response rates of cediranib maleate with versus without dasatinib,
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, in patients with
      measurable disease at baseline.

      III. To perform symptom assessment using the FACT-P questionnaire and the Present Pain
      Intensity (PPI) scale from the McGill-Melzack questionnaire.

      IV. To explore bone resorption markers (e.g., c-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase),
      and to correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the presence of
      soft tissue (visceral or nodal) vs bone-only disease. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral cediranib maleate once daily and oral dasatinib once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cediranib maleate as in arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
