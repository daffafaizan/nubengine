      simultaneous use of eyes and hands. Eye-hand coordination supports our daily activities,
      interactions with objects and people, and is critical to understanding how the brain creates
      internal models of the space and generates movement within it (2). The eye-hand coordination
      represents the integration of visual information, perceptual stimuli and motor decisions in
      order to perform a specific task. Along with the development of technology, opportunities for
      stimulation of eye-hand coordination with the use of technical novelties have appeared.
      Virtual reality (VR) is a three-dimensional image, which is created by means of computer
      programs. It has become one of the technologies that offer many possibilities of application
      and use of its various aspects that can bring great benefits in the real world. In most
      educational communities VR has been used as an opportunity to support many students. VR
      allows the user to observe the world generated for their own needs as the real world and
      experience impressions that are not available in real life. It can be assumed that VR can
      help trainers or teachers, especially music teachers, by interacting through movement,
      realization and graphic images, to develop and shape skills such as eye to hand coordination.
      The use of virtual reality gives a wide range of possibilities for training, so it was
      decided to examine how it will affect the coordination of the eye-hand response in music
      school students.

      The aim of the research was to evaluate the eye-hand coordination of music school students
      undergoing training sessions in the musical game "Beat Saber" conducted in immersive virtual
      reality.
