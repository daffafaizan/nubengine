      All paranasal sinuses need ventilation to prevent infection and inflammation. Sinus
      ventilation occurs through the ostia into the nose. When rhinosinusitis occurs, the mucous
      membranes of the sinuses become swollen, resulting in ostia closure. Functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that opens the sinus ostia.

      The most common unwanted side effect of the FESS procedure is the formation of adhesions
      (fibrous bands) in the area of surgery. These bands (adhesions) can prevent proper
      ventilation and drainage from the paranasal sinuses.

      Various hyaluronan based biomaterials are now available and in common use to provide a
      post-surgical nasal dressing which is absorbable, can prevent adhesion formation, and
      eliminate the pain and tissue abrasion caused by removal of non-absorbable nasal packing.

      AdvaCoat is a bioresorbable hyaluronan gel that conforms to mucosal surfaces and provides a
      post-surgical nasal dressing to prevent adhesion formation as tissues heal.
