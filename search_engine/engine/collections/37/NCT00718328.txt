      mortality rate of 35% to 52% with only 20% expected to be functionally independent at 6
      months. No medical or surgical interventions have been found to alter the natural evolution
      of this disease. The high risk for mortality and poor outcomes seems to occur despite
      relatively small hematoma volumes and small amounts of neuronal tissue at risk for injury.
      The reasons for this observation remain unknown; however perihematomal edema formation and
      inflammation that follows ICH seems to play an important role.

      The Simvastatin for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Study is a prospective double blinded placebo
      controlled randomized (1:1) clinical trial that compares outcomes in patients receiving
      generic simvastatin 80 mg for 14 days or until death or discharge with patients in the
      placebo group.

      The hypothesis for our study is that statins ameliorate perihematomal edema evolution thereby
      reducing mortality and improving functional outcomes following Intracerebral Hemorrhage
      (ICH). This hypothesis in turn is based on animal data showing suppression of inflammatory
      reaction and improved neurological outcomes following administration of statins to rodents
      with experimental ICH, and on a retrospective review of patients admitted to The Johns
      Hopkins Hospital over the last 7 years with spontaneous ICH which showed significantly better
      outcomes (decreased 30 day mortality secondary to decreased perihematomal edema) in patients
      on statins at the time of admission.
