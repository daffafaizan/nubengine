      diagnosis of delayed puberty. Study participation involves 2 outpatient visits and two
      hospital admissions (one 11-hour, overnight admission and one 6-hour day admission) when
      subjects will receive two investigational drugs, the naturally occurring hormones kisspeptin
      and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Subjects will then be followed every 6 months
      until they reach 18 years of age to determine if their pubertal delay was self-resolved or
      permanent. Individuals interested in learning more may call 617-726-8484.
