      initiating cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on whole blood viscoelastic profile after CPB has not
      been well established.

      Method: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery employing moderate hypothermic CPB (n=40) are
      randomly allocated into one of two groups: in Group-ANH(n=20), ANH is applied by using a
      balanced hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.6); and in Group-C ANH is not applied.

      Intergroup differences of INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM profiles are analyzed. after
      anesthesia induction (control) and after weaning form CPB and protamine neutralization
      (after-CPB) in both groups. In Group-ANH, those are determined after ANH (after-ANH).

      As a primary outcome, inter-group difference between maxiaml clot firmness of EXTEM is
      determined at 10 min after ANH in Group-ANH and that at control.

      As secondary outcomes, intergroup differences of Hematocrit (Hct), Na+, K+, HCO3-, Ca2+,
      osmolarity, s-Cr are determined Intergroup difference of data at T2 are performed.
