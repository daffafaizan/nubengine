    
      This is a prospective, multi-center study with a maximum duration of 24 months or longer
      depending on refinements, to assess the safety and efficacy of 3M Clear Aligners, with the
      use of attachments to correct teeth malocclusions.

      The subject population for this study will be male and female subjects â‰¥ 14 years of age.
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the
      study. Up to a total of 180 subjects may be enrolled at up to 12 different clinical research
      sites, (up to 15 subjects per site).

      The subjects will undergo a target of up to 24 months (or longer depending on refinements) of
      treatment to align the teeth to the planned target. Subjects will wear the Clear Aligners for
      at least 22 hours per day, with the exception of consumption of meals and beverages, with the
      exception of water, which can be consumed while wearing the aligners. During each 6-week
      period between follow up visits, subjects will wear each set of Clear Aligners for 2 weeks,
      in the order indicated per the Orthodontists treatment plan.
