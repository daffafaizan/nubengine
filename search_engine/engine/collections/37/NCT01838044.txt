    
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant use of pregabalin and
      celecoxib compared with celecoxib monotherapy for the symptomatic relief of pain in patients
      with chronic low back pain with a probable neuropathic component.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Demonstrate the additional benefit of adding pregabalin to celecoxib monotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the concomitant use of pregabalin and celecoxib compared to celecoxib
           monotherapy in a set of patient reported measures (sleep, depression, anxiety, impact of
           pain in daily functions, patient's global impression of change and patient's perception
           of the treatment).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of celecoxib and of the concomitant
           administration of pregabalin and celecoxib.
