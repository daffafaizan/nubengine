      strength, work and fatigue of the thigh muscles after ACL surgery. The reference is the
      preoperative assessment (V1), the variation is measured on V2 (measurements at 3 months) and
      V3 (measures at 9 months). Each patient is his own control. In addition, a control group of
      healthy subjects is used to determine level of significance of each parameter.
