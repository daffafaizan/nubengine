      The study aims to measure the quality of life (QoL) and the emotional-affective sphere of
      patients, currently hospitalized in residential structures, and their family members.

      The study data will allow identifying (a) whether the social distancing between family
      members/caregivers and patients undergoing rehabilitation for orthopedic or neurological
      disabilities affects the quality of life and the emotional-affective sphere and (b) if these
      conditions change over time. The data obtained will, therefore, allow identifying those
      subjects who present a particular fragility of the emotional-affective sphere and who
      therefore need attention and possibly psychological support that will be prescribed.

      Procedures:

      Demographic (for patients and caregivers) and anamnestic (only for patients) data will be
      collected; moreover, disability will be assessed in patients using the modified Barthel
      index.

      Three questionnaires will be administered to patients and caregivers:

        -  The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36), to evaluate the QoL;

        -  The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), to evaluate the emotional state;

        -  The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), to evaluate mood.

      These questionnaires will be administered after one month of hospitalization (T0), and after
      one (T1) and two (T2) months after T0. Finally, at time T1 and T2 it will be registered if
      the patient is still hospitalized or discharged (and in the latter case the days between the
      discharge and the compilation of the questionnaire will be recorded). Since the three
      selected questionnaires provide for self-administration, to simplify the collection of data
      relating to caregivers, the implementation and use of an online questionnaire will be
      assessed. This questionnaire will also provide for the collection of consent to the use of
      data by the subject and will guarantee their privacy.
