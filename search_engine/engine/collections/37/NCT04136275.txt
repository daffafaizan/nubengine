    
      This is a two-part, non randomized, open label, single site Phase 1 study. Participants who
      fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial Chimeric Antigen Receptor
      (CAR)-37 T Cells (CAR-37 T Cells).

      This study consists of 2 parts:

        -  Part A (Dose Escalation): The investigators are looking the highest dose of the study
           intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects
           in participants that have relapsed or refractory CD37+ hematologic malignancies, not
           everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study
           intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been
           enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated

        -  Part B (Expansion Cohort): Part B: Expansion Cohort: Participants will be treated at the
           respective dose (at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose), as determined during Part A
           (Dose Escalation).

        -  A total of 18 participants will be enrolled to this trial

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies.

      Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) has not approved CAR-37 T Cells as a treatment for any disease.

      This is the first time that CAR-37 T Cells will be given to humans
