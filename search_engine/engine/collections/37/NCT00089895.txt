      (experiencing chest pain at rest with episodes lasting at least 10 minutes) and who are
      planned to undergo invasive surgical procedures after being given study drug for 12 to 96
      hours. There are two different treatment groups in this study; approximately half of the
      patients will go to each group and the likelihood of receiving study drug vs. placebo is
      50/50 (like tossing a coin). Medications that are standard of care will be provided to the
      patients (all patients will be given aspirin and standard hospital doses of one of two other
      blood thinning drugs - unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin). Which
      one patients receive is at the discretion of the Investigator.
