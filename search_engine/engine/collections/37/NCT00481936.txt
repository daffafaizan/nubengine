      (MTD) of VB6-845 and evaluate the safety and tolerability of VB6-845 when administered as a
      monotherapy intravenous (IV) infusion (over 3 hours), once weekly in 4-week cycles, to
      subjects with EpCAM positive advanced solid tumours of epithelial origin.

      Secondary objectives included evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile and immunogenicity of
      VB6-845 and assessing exploratory efficacy of VB6-845.

      Dose cohorts of 3-6 subjects with EpCAM positive advanced solid tumours of epithelial origin
      are to be entered into the study. The starting dose is defined as 1.00 mg/kg, which is 1/10
      of the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) reached in preclinical studies. Doses are to
      be escalated according to the modified Fibonacci design until 2 out of 3 or 2 out of 6
      subjects experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). The MTD is to be reached when <2 out of
      6 subjects experienced a DLT. An additional 12 subjects are to be enrolled at the MTD for
      further characterization of VB6-845 at that level.

      Regardless of dose cohort, subjects are to continue to receive treatment until an
      unacceptable toxicity occurred, all lesions completely disappeared or disease progression is
      determined.
