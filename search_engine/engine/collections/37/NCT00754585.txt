      proportion of their work day. An average of 30% of Ontario WSIB lost time claims since 1996
      involve low back injury. The return to work objective for twenty percent of these patients
      requires prolonged sitting in their work stations. While a number of these studies have
      claimed a relationship between sitting and LBP, the relationship is complex. Back pain and
      chair use are the second most important health factors for the aging workforce. The odds
      ratio for LBP is estimated for seated tasks at 1.9721. Prolonged and monotonous, low-level
      mechanical loads associated with a seated posture are thought to provoke pain.

      Besides personal suffering, postural discomfort in the workplace reduces performance and
      productivity, both of which can be improved by raising comfort levels. According to Corlett
      (2006), other lumbar supports do not exert enough pressure on the spine to actually change
      its configuration. However, the patient often alters their posture when such a device is in
      place as they arch their back to conform to it. The Logic Back support offers a simple means
      to alter posture and reduce associated strain on the lower back during seated tasks by
      promoting the neutral standing lordotic posture. Clinically, it has been shown to support the
      ENP or the natural standing lordotic posture. Although its clinical applicability has been
      accepted by many practitioners, its effectiveness in improving seated comfort and functional
      task performance has yet to be quantified in LBP patients who perform seated tasks. This
      study will help to understand why the Logic Back or ENP must be considered when planning
      return-to-work goals and methods to reduce first-time injury incidence in the workplace.
