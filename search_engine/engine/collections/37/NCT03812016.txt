      light-emitting diode and one photodiode sensor, a permanent electromagnetic actuator, an iron
      sheet (for affixing to the paralytic upper eyelid), and a biosignal acquisition module along
      with a power supply unit providing a wired connection with optical sensors and a permanent
      electromagnetic actuator. Before the study, the differences between the affected and
      unaffected palpebral fissure heights were directly measured using a ruler. During the test
      after the wearing of the prototype, the distance of the paralytic eyelid lift was documented
      and the corrected distance (gain) of the paralytic upper eyelid was calculated. The efficacy
      and safety of the device prototype were assessed. The efficacy was evaluated according to the
      synchronous blinks and gain of paralytic eyelid lifts. Subjective sensation and complications
      were assessed by visual axis obstruction, blurred vision, foreign body sensation over the
      cornea, burning or hot sensation over facial skin, and erythema or pruritus over the eyelid.
      After the completion of the study procedure, the eyelid skin integrity, subjective sensation
      and discomfort were examined.
