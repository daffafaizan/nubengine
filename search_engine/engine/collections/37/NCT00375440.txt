      reduction of blood loss without concurrently increasing the risk of thromboembolic
      complications. Several studies have shown that tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and blood
      transfusions in primary total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, there have not been any
      studies that evaluate its efficacy in revision total hip arthroplasty. The significance of
      this study is that the need for blood transfusions and their complications may be minimized
      in revision hip arthroplasty if tranexamic acid is found to significantly decrease the amount
      of blood transfusions.

      After the patient has been consented, he or she will be randomized into one of two groups
      (tranexamic acid and placebo) by the School of Pharmacy. The placebo will be crystalloid
      fluid of equal volume as tranexamic acid. The patient will then undergo revision total hip
      arthroplasty by Dr. Rosenstein and be administered tranexamic acid or placebo. Blood loss
      will be recorded intraoperatively and postoperatively through drains. Criteria for blood
      transfusion include hemoglobin less than 10g/dl or hematocrit less than 30%. Once the
      operation ends, the drug or placebo will be discontinued and the postoperative care is
      unchanged from current standards/protocols. Intraoperative blood loss, total blood loss, and
      number of blood transfusions will be recorded and analyzed. Length of acute hospital stay
      will also be recorded. A cost analysis will be performed comparing tranexamic acid to blood
      transfusions.
