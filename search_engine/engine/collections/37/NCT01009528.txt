      feedback system has been developed. The system will be evaluated both quantitative and
      qualitative.

      Method: The general practitioners (GP´s) of the Region of Southern Denmark have been
      randomised to either admission or no admission to the electronic feedback system. The system
      was launched 1/3-2007 and ran for one year prior to evaluation.

      Quantitative evaluation by assessment of the following end-points: Patients Hba1c-level,
      number of patients who have had their hba1c-level measured within the last year,
      cholesterol-level and number of patients who have had an eye examination within the last
      year.

      Qualitative evaluation by interviewing GP´s who have had admission to the system.

      Qualitative data have been collected through interviews with intervention GPs, designed to
      uncover motivational factors as well as barriers concerning the use of feedback on chronic
      care in general practice. Data are being analyzed.

      Quantitative data are being gathered. Perspective: This project will shed light on the value
      of electronic feedback systems within chronic care in general practice.

      Based on this project it will be possible to set up a system for automatic electronic
      monitoring and feedback of the quality of care in general practice, taking motivational
      factors of the GP s into account during implementation.
