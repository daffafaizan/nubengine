      case-fatality ratio of human rabies is 100%,the disease is preventable by the modern
      cell-culture vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin.Post-exposure rabies vaccination with the
      modified Thai Red Cross intradermal(modified TRC-ID)regimen has been approved by WHO and
      proven to be immunogenic and effective. It represents a significant saving in vaccine cost
      and is now established in several developing countries. SPEEDA,chromatography purified vero
      cell derived rabies vaccine,approved by Thai FDA on 8 April 2009 and drug registration code
      of SPEEDA is 1C 90022/51. This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity and safety of
      SPEEDA and TRCS-SPEEDA (SPEEDA which is filled by Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute)vs.
      reference vaccine (purified vero cell vaccine; VERORAB)when using with post-exposure rabies
      intradermal vaccination with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin.
