    
      The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) is a multicenter, prospective, observational study for
      participants treated with Firazyr (icatibant) and/or Cinryze (C1 inhibitor [human]) in
      countries where it is currently approved. The entry of participants in the Icatibant Outcome
      Survey (IOS) is at the discretion of the physician and the participant and is not a
      pre-requisite for prescribing Firazyr (icatibant) or Cinryze (C1 inhibitor [human]).
