      endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This can be accomplished through exercise or with a
      device known as Exer-Rest® which applies Whole Body Periodic Acceleration (WBPA) that is also
      called pGz. WBPA produces systemic vasodilation, by exerting shear stress on the vascular
      endothelium, activating endothelial NOS and releasing NO in animal models and human subjects.
      Cigarette smoking is associated with attenuated vascular relaxation responses in the systemic
      circulation. Patients with asthma also exhibit endothelial dysfunction in the airway. In this
      study the investigators wish to assess the effect of a single pGz session on baseline Qaw and
      delta Qaw in current smokers, glucocorticoid-naïve asthmatics, and age-matched healthy
      never-smokers to test if this treatment will increase the vascular relaxation responses.
