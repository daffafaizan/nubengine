      volunteers. It will be conducted at a single center and will enroll approximately 104
      participants. The study will have 2 parts:

        -  In Part A, participants will receive a single dose of study drug or placebo. Multiple
           dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.

        -  In Part B, participants will receive 4 doses of ALPN-101 or placebo--1 dose each week
           for 4 weeks. Multiple dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.

      In each Part, safety assessments will be performed throughout the dosing and follow-up
      periods, and multiple PK and PD samples will be collected.
