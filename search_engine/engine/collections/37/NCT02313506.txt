      physically active improves pain, mobility and quality of life for people living with knee OA;
      however, less than half of patients are active. Combining the best evidence in OA care and
      digital technology, the investigators propose a new model of care for improving physical
      activity in patients with OA.

      The investigators primary objective is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy
      of a multi-component model of care involving 1) a group education and structured goal-setting
      session, 2) the use of Fitbit Flex (a commercially available physical activity tracker) and
      3) weekly telephone activity counselling by a physiotherapist for improving physical activity
      and reducing sedentary time in patients with knee OA.

      In this pilot randomized controlled trial the investigators hypothesize that compared to a
      control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention group), participants in the Immediate
      Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 2) reduce
      sedentary time, 3) improve OA disease status, and 4) improve abilities to self-manage their
      condition.
