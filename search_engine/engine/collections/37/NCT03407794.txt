      explained in detail. Once the consent form is signed participants will schedule a visit to
      provide blood, urine and stool samples at the beginning of the intervention at which point
      they will be randomized into one of three groups: a fermented vegetable group (1/2 cup per
      day for 6 weeks), a non-fermented vegetable group (1/2 cup per day for 6 weeks) and a control
      group (usual diet). Both vegetable groups will receive weekly deliveries of the vegetables to
      be consumed. Following 6 weeks, participants will provide blood, urine and stool samples one
      more time. Participants will also fill out questionnaires related to dietary intake,
      demographics, physical activity, prescription medication use and gastrointestinal function.
      Compliance will be monitored weekly via a gastrointestinal function log where participants
      will be asked to enter whether they consumed or not the vegetable provided each day, as well
      as any side effects of consumption.
