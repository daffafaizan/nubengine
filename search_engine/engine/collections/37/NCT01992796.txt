      responses in arteries. In addition to direct effects on vascular tone, ANG II affects
      multiple aspects of microvascular function through promotion of leukostasis, induction of
      capillary permeability and depletion of glutathione. Binding of ANG II to its receptors (in
      particular AT1) mediates intracellular free radical generation that contributes to tissue
      damage by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interrupt renin-angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity by
      blocking a specific receptor that mediates the pathogenic activity of angiotensin II.
      Objectives: The clinical question objective of this study is if the antiinflammatory effect
      of ARBs is relevant in sepsis management and in particular if ARBs are able to improve
      survival and reduce the incidence of Multi Organ Failure in septic patients.

      Methods:

      STUDY DESIGN: Experimental; prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.

      STUDY POPULATION: Three hundred adults within 12 hrs of recognition of severe sepsis, with
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II-predicted risk of mortality
      between 20% and 80% are eligible.

      Settings: 5 Italian Intensive Care Units. Oral irbesartan (total dose of 75 mg) or placebo
      administered every 24 hrs for 15 days. Analysis of data performed by a blind operator.
      Expected results: about 25% reduction in 28-day mortality rate and incidence of multi organ
      failure in the study population.
