      Omalizumab and those who will not respond. Nowadays, the monitoring of therapeutic response
      to Omalizumab is based on clinical and spirometric data.

      On the other hand, when a medication is administered, it has its main expected effect, but
      also acts on other targets with various direct and indirect effects. We do not know all the
      genes that are switched on and those that are switched off by the use of Omalizumab. For
      example, anti-IgE has been developed to block serum total IgE and thereby improve control of
      allergic asthma. However, the studies noted that Omalizumab also reduces the receptors
      FcepsilonRI, which may have implications for the treatment of autoimmune urticaria.
