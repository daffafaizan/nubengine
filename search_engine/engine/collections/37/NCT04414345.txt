    
      The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a perpetual multi-center, multi-regimen clinical trial
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational products for the treatment of ALS. This
      trial is designed as a perpetual platform trial. This means that there is a single Master
      Protocol dictating the conduct of the trial. The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Master Protocol is
      registered as NCT04297683.

      Once a participant enrolls into the Master Protocol and meets all eligibility criteria, the
      participant will be eligible to be randomized into any currently enrolling regimen. All
      participants will have an equal chance of being randomized to any currently enrolling
      regimen.

      If a participant is randomized to Regimen C - CNM-Au8, the participant will complete a
      screening visit to assess additional Regimen C eligibility criteria. Once Regimen C
      eligibility criteria are confirmed, participants will complete a baseline assessment and be
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either active CNM-Au8 or matching placebo.

      Regimen C will enroll by invitation, as participants may not choose to enroll in Regimen C.
      Participants must first enroll into the Master Protocol and be eligible to participate in the
      Master Protocol before being able to be randomly assigned to Regimen C.

      For a list of enrolling sites, please see the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Master Protocol under
      NCT04297683.
