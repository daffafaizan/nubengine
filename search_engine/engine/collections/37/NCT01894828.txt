      of cancer patients. This may cause numerous problems including anorexia, which together with
      biological disturbances can initiate cancer related catabolism even when it can not yet be
      seen. In this study we want to answer the question if oral nutritional supplementation can
      help the patient overcome the catabolism in its initial phase and improve nutritional status,
      which would result in reduced number of postoperational complications
