    
      The study duration per patient will be 80 weeks. A screening period (from 4 to 16 weeks) will
      precede a 52-week double-blind treatment period and a 3 months follow-up period.

      The study will be conducted in 270 patients (90 patients in the placebo arm, 90 patients in
      the GFT505 80mg arm, and 90 patients in the GFT505 120mg arm).

      Enrollment will be performed in two phases: during the first phase, the patients will receive
      either GFT505 at a dose of 80 mg either the placebo. An independent expert committee will
      review the safety data when 45 patients receiving the dose at 80 mg will have been treated
      for 6 months. The committee approval will be necessary to start the second phase, while the
      patients will receive either GFT505 at a dose of 80 mg, or GFT505 at a dose of 120 mg or the
      placebo.
