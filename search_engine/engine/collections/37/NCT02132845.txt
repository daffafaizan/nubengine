      I. Overall (composite) response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 4-month progression free survival (PFS). II. Mutation rate. III. Adverse event
      rate/severity. IV. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Targeted agent rate. II. Available protocol rate. III. Protocol enrollment rate. IV.
      Disease site influence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for analysis via next
      generation sequencing. Patients receive standard of care therapy based on the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      ARM B: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for analysis via next
      generation sequencing. Based on the results of the next generation sequencing, patients
      receive target-directed therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
