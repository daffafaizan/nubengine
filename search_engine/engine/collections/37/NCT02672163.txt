      During coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery part of the right atrial appendage can be
      excised upon insertion of the right atrial cannula of the heart-lung machine. This study aims
      to address the surgical feasibility and patient safety of epicardially delivered atrial
      appendage micrografts during CABG surgery.

      Autologous cardiac cells are harvested from right atrial appendage during CABG of six
      patients. Micrografts consisting atrial appendage-derived cells (AADCs) and their
      extracellular matrix (ECM) of the atrial appendage are mechanically processed. The cells are
      placed on a tissue-engineered sheet with fibrin gel and tissue clue and further delivered
      epicardially on top of a infarction scar. Parameters including echocardiography reflecting
      cardiac insufficiency are studied pre- and post-operatively as well as at three and six
      months of the follow-up. Cardiac functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed
      preoperatively and at six-months follow-up. 20 patients will be recruited to serve as a
      control group. They are scheduled for elective CABG and are treated according to the normal
      hospital protocol, without the ECM sheet.
