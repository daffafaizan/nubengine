      laryngeal mask. The efficacy of ventilation during tracheostomy may be affected by length of
      previous endotracheal intubation.

      This is an observational and monocentric study aimed to evaluate the impact of length of
      endotracheal intubation on efficacy of lung ventilation with a laryngeal mask. Two groups of
      patients who have to undergo elective percutaneous tracheostomy after either a short or long
      endotracheal intubation will be enrolled.

      Data on the correlational effects of the endotracheal tube on the integrity of laryngeal
      structures and on ventilation will be collected.

      Statistical analyses will use standard tests to compare the two groups of patients.
