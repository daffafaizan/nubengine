      regression rate and prolonging survival in patients with breast or endometrial carcinoma or
      mesothelioma. II. Evaluate the immune, endocrine, and clinical effects of this regimen, with
      particular attention to effects on cachexia.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by performance status, dominant
      site of disease, and prior treatment with megestrol. Breast cancer patients are randomized to
      one of 3 doses of oral megestrol (800, 1,280, or 1,600 mg/day, divided qid). Female patients
      with other tumor types are nonrandomly assigned to receive oral megestrol at 1,600 mg/day.
      Male patients are nonrandomly assigned to a dose-finding study of megestrol. The first
      patient cohort receives megestrol at 480 mg/day in 3 divided doses, with further escalation
      for subsequent cohorts as tolerated. All patients continue therapy for at least 8 weeks, with
      treatment discontinued upon progression. Measurable lesions are evaluated every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 9 evaluable breast cancer patients at each dose level will be entered; 14
      patients will be required for each of the other disease categories. (As of 11/92, the study
      is temporarily closed to patients with prostate cancer.)
