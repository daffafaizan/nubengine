      sockets augmented with porcine derived bone and 20 consecutive patients with implants placed
      in native bone were reviewed. For each implant, the radio- graphs from the surgical
      appointment were compared to those from the last follow-up visit and evaluated regarding
      changes of marginal bone level over time.
