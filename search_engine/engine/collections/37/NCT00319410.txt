      with the traditional diagnostic hysteroscopy after intracervical injection of Mepivacaine
      Hydrochloride 3%.

      METHODS: A total of 130 women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy were included in the study
      and were randomized, using a computer-generated randomization list, into two groups with a
      ratio of 2:1. Eighty three women underwent vaginoscopy without speculum, tenaculum or
      anesthesia. Forty seven women received intracervical anesthesia with 10 ml of 3% mepivacaine
      hydrochloride solution injected at two sites (3:00 and 9:00 positions) and underwent
      traditional hysteroscopy using a speculum and tenaculum. Hysteroscopy was performed using a
      rigid 3.7 mm hysteroscope in a medium of 0.9% saline, and the image was transmitted to a
      screen visible to the patient. A Visual Scale Analogue (VAS) consisting of a 10 cm line was
      used to assess the intensity of pain experienced during and after the procedure. Overall
      patient satisfaction was assessed during, immediately after, 15 minutes later, and three days
      post hysteroscopy.

      RESULTS: The mean pain score was significantly lower in the vaginoscopy group (3.8±2.7 vs
      5.34±3.23, p=0.01). Patient satisfaction rate was similar in both groups.

      CONCLUSION: Patients reported significantly less pain with the vaginoscopic approach to
      diagnostic hysteroscopy even without anesthesia compared to patients undergoing the
      traditional procedure with anesthesia. This new approach should therefore be considered as a
      replacement for the traditional hysteroscopic technique.
