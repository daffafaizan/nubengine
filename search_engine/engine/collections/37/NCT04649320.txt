    
      In December 2019, the novel human pathogenic virus "SARS-CoV2" from the coronavirus family
      was identified, causing a respiratory disease known as "COVID19" (coronavirus disease 2019).
      COVID19 manifests itself primarily with influenza-like symptoms, but in special cases it can
      lead to severe conditions such as ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Compared to
      other pulmotropic viruses such as the influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a higher
      contagiousness and mortality.

      Haematological and oncological patients are particularly vulnerable due to their advanced
      age, immunological restrictions in the context of the underlying disease and the treatment
      modalities (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, ...).

      To evaluate the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on the perception of patients with malignant
      diseases, we aim to record so-called "patient-reported outcomes" (PROs) from patients at the
      University Hospital of Innsbruck at the Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and
      Oncology) and at the Department for Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology. We use the validated
      EORT QLQ-C30 and a specially developed questionnaire for COVID19.
