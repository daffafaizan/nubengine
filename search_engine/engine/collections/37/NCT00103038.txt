      I. Investigate the utility of ferumoxytol and gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) for
      improved imaging biomarkers of malignant brain tumors in a single imaging session by
      comparing dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) determined relative cerebral blood volume
      (rCBV) and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) determined vascular permeability (derived
      transfer coefficient [Ktrans]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare and evaluate magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with ferumoxytol between
      different time points.

      II. Assess number and size of tumors imaged. III. Assess tumor vascularity. IV. Assess
      histology and electron microscopy (EM) on tissue samples. V. Assess differences in subjects
      with prior therapy versus (vs.) no prior therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy).

      VI. Assess the long term imaging characteristics of different tumors using DSC and DCE.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite intravenously (IV) beginning
      approximately 15 seconds after start of 3T DSC-MRI and GBCA IV approximately 1 minute and 50
      seconds after start of 3T DCE-MRI on day 1. Patients also undergo MRI without contrast at
      baseline and on day 2. Imaging with ferumoxytol, GBCA, and without contrast repeats every 3
      weeks for a total of 6 more imaging sessions over up to 5 years.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.
