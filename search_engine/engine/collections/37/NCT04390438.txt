      patellar tendon pain pressure thresholds and subjective anterior knee pain perception after
      application of two percutaneous electrolysis methods using a same charge (high intensity and
      low intensity) compared to a dry needling group in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome
      (PFPS)

      Fifteen patients diagnosed with unilateral PFPS were divided in two experimental groups (high
      intensity percutaneous electrolysis and low intensity percutaneous electrolysis) and one
      active control group (dry needling. The duration of the study was 7 days with only one
      intervention. Pain pressure thresholds were assessed using an algometer before the
      intervention, immediately after the intervention and after 7 days and a Visual Analogue Scale
      was used before the treatment and after 7 days to rate the subjective anterior knee pain
      perception. Also a VAS was used to rate the pain perception during the intervention
