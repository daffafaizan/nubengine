      mucus at various times of the menstrual cycle in fertile and sub-fertile women. The
      investigators would aim to also investigate the interaction of cervical mucus with sperm and
      capacitation and to investigate the impact cervical surgery and differing diagnoses of
      sub-fertility have on cervical mucus.

      Study aims:

        1. To determine the functional, biochemical and molecular properties of cervical mucus
           through out the menstrual cycle in fertile women.

        2. To determine if there is a difference in these properties of cervical mucus in fertile
           and sub-fertile women.

        3. To determine whether these properties are influenced by the sub-fertility diagnostic
           group eg unexplained, endometriosis, tubal factor, sperm factor.

        4. To examine the interaction between cervical mucus and sperm in women with normal
           fertility and sub-fertility.

        5. To examine the impact of cervical surgery on cervical mucus functional, biochemical and
           molecular properties and sperm interaction.
