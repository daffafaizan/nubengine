      the response rates are only 10-20% using non-cross-resistant chemotherapeutic agents.

      New biologic agents in combination with chemotherapy or other treatment modalities may result
      in improvement in survival.

      Recent results in colorectal cancer have clearly indicated that KRAS mutant tumors do not
      respond to treatment with EGFR inhibitors.

      Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) is the first fully human monoclonal antibody specific to the EGF
      receptor. To date, panitumumab has been evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in
      patients with CRC, NSCLC, and SCCHN.

      No previous studies have evaluated the effect of panitumumab in epithelial ovarian cancer
      based on KRAS mutation status.
