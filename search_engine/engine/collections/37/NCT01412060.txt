      first 6 weeks, participants received 3, 6, or 9 mg cariprazine orally once a day; the dose
      could be modified during this time. The cariprazine dose was fixed at 3, 6, or 9 mg for the
      last 14 weeks of this Open-label Phase. At the end of Week 8, participants had to meet the
      following criteria to continue in the study.

        -  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score ≤ 60 at the end of Week 8

        -  At least 20% decrease in PANSS total score from baseline to the end of Week 8

        -  Clinical Global Impressions - Severity (CGI-S) score ≤ 4 at the end of Week 8

        -  Score of ≤ 4 on each of the following 7 PANSS items: P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, and G14 at
           the end of Week 8

        -  Stable dose during the previous 2 weeks

        -  No significant tolerability issues as judged by the Investigator at the end of Week 8

      At the end of the Open-label Phase, participants were randomized into 2 treatment groups,
      cariprazine or placebo, if they met the following criteria:

        -  PANSS total score ≤ 60 at the end of Week 20

        -  At least 20% decrease in PANSS total score from baseline to the end of Week 20

        -  CGI-S score ≤ 4 at the end of Week 20

        -  Score of ≤ 4 on each of the following 7 PANSS items: P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, and G14 at
           the end of Week 20

        -  No significant tolerability issues as judged by the Investigator During this
           Double-blind Treatment Phase, participants received either placebo or cariprazine at the
           same dosage (3, 6, or 9 mg) that they received during the last 14 weeks of the
           Open-label Phase.

      All participants entered the 4 week Safety Follow-up Phase. They received a treatment other
      than the investigational product at the discretion of the Investigator.
