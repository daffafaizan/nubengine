      Eligible patients will first have received standard 50.4 Gy chemoradiation. Patients entering
      the study will have the opportunity to receive SBRT as a noninvasive option as compared to
      surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, SBRT after 50.4 Gy
      chemoradiation represents a technique of radiation consolidation that may be more effective
      and less toxic than standard conventional fractionated radiation
