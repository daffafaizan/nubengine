      patients with hemiplegia after stroke. Ambulation training, therefore, is an important part
      of physical therapy intervention for these patients. Conventional neurologic physical therapy
      for ambulation training, based sorely on neurophysiology, prohibits early ambulation
      experience after stroke in attempt to avoid the development of abnormal gait patterns. Such
      an approach has been shown to be limited in helping these patients regain independent
      ambulatory ability.
