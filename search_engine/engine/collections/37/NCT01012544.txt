      The first objective of the MAPCAT-study is to investigate whether plasma pharmacokinetics
      (Cmax, Tmax and AUC) of an additional 600 mg loading dose are impaired in patients with a
      history of stent thrombosis.

      The second objective of the MAPCAT study is to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in
      receptors, enzymes and ligands involved in the process of thrombosis and haemostasis as well
      in the conversion-process of clopidogrel into its metabolites do have influence on both the
      absolute magnitude of platelet inhibition and Cmax, Tmax and AUC.
