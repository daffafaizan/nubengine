      hand function. Good fracture stability to allow early mobilization of joints and thus early
      return of function. The objective of this report is to introduce a novel external-fixation
      technique using the combination of K-wires and cement. For comparison, we also included
      another group of patients who were treated using a mini plate and screw system. A total of
      104 patients (131 fingers) were randomly allocated into group A (56 patients) and B (51
      patients). Patients in group A were treated with cemented K-wire fixation; and patients in
      group B were treated with conventional mini-plate. Bone healing, range of motion of the
      fingers, costs of treatments, and patient satisfaction were assessed.
