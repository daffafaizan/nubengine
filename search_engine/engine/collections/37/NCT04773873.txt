      the Geneva Hospital Ethic Committee's approval is required. Patients in need for replacement
      of single unit posterior teeth will be recruited at the Dental School as well as in the 5
      private practices based on specific selection criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      a restorative group using a computer-generated random number table for allocation.

      The CAD-CAM blocs containing a screw channel for implant-retained chairside-made single-unit
      hybrid-abutment crowns are 1) Lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (e.max CAD) (G1) and 2)
      feldspath-ceramic infiltrated by polymer (Enamic) (G2). The CAD-CAM crowns are adhesively
      cemented to titanium base abutments (Ti-base) and screw-retained to Titanium implants
      (Straumann Standard Plus) in the premolar (RN) and molar region (WN). Controls are
      screw-retained PFM crowns (G3). The number of crowns in each group is N=30 (15 molars and 15
      premolars) which gives a total of 90 crowns for this study.

      Participants are recalled after 1 week-10 days after crown insertion (baseline, T0) and then
      yearly during 5 years (T1-T5). Digital X-Rays are taken at T0, T1, T3 and T5 with
      repositionable individual resin bite registrations.
