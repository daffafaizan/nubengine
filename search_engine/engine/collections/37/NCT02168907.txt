      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613, when used in combination with
      bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) and rituximab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), who have or have not received hematopoietic
      cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR), derived from the modified
      International Work Group (IWG) criteria.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free-survival (PFS), and possible
      correlation between RR and DCR derived from the modified IWG criteria vs. OS and PFS.

      III. To evaluate assessment of bone marrow biopsy, and possible correlation between complete
      response (CR) vs. bone marrow biopsy assessment (e.g., clear of infiltration of leukemic
      cells accordingly to morphology, and/or negative on leukemic cells according to
      immunohistochemistry).

      IV. To evaluate safety of the CPI-613 + bendamustine + rituximab combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid.

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-4
      (week 1) and days 1 and 4 (weeks 2 and 3). Patients also receive bendamustine hydrochloride
      IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 5 and rituximab on day 5 of week 1. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
