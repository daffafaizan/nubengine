      of Lusedra for routine use in preoperative regional blocks that avoids deeper levels of
      sedation and increased risk of nerve damage in an over-sedated individual. The shorter
      half-life of Lusedra should also demonstrate a superior recovery profile compared to
      midazolam when used as a rescue comparator. While this study will only enroll patients
      undergoing regional blocks prior to orthopedic surgery, the clinical utility and value of the
      larger initial intravenous dosing for Lusedra may be evident for many different monitored
      anesthesia care anesthetic management situations requiring rapid and effective onset of
      effects.
