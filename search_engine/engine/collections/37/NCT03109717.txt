      participate in the study they will have to stop any antidepressants that they are taking to
      prepare for the use of MAOIs. After a two week washout period, subjects will have an fMRI and
      will be started on a MAOI. They will then be followed up for 8 weeks, which is routine and
      considered standard care.
