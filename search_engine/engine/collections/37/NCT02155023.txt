    
      The subjects (Type 1 diabetes) will stay at the Clinical Research Centre for the whole period
      of the investigation (12 hours).

      Continuous blood glucose monitoring will be performed using the IR-Glucose Reader system
      and/or the IR-CGM system based on microdialysis. In parallel blood glucose measurements will
      be performed every 15 min as reference. The measurements of the sensors will be calibrated
      with different schemes and the difference between the calibrated glucose readings and the
      reference blood glucose values will be determined.
