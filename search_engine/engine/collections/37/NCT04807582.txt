    
      24 evaluable patients with radiological evidence of cerebral metastases on MRI will be
      enrolled into the study (12 who are treatment na√Øve + 12 who have completed Stereotactic
      Radiosurgery (SRS)+/- combination therapy). The patients invited to participate in the study
      will provide written informed consent. [18F]FPIA PET/MRI imaging will only be performed once
      patients have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once these have been satisfied,
      eligible patients will proceed to [18F]FPIA PET/MRI.

      On the day of imaging the patients will undergo a blood test to measure plasma concentrations
      of carnitine (approximately 6mls). During the scan, a single dose of [18F]FPIA (maximum, 370
      MBq) IV will be administered to the participant followed by a whole brain dynamic PET/MRI
      scan over 66 minutes. During the MRI sequences, the patient will receive a 2 stage IV bolus
      of Gadolinium contrast medium administered through a peripheral venous cannula.
