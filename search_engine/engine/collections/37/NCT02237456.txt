      treatment with implantation of stents (Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI )). To
      evaluate disease in coronary arteries prior to, and during PCI , X-ray fluoroscopy with
      contrast is used. X-ray fluoroscopy produces little information of any disease changes in the
      vessel wall and implanted stents and especially polylactid acid (PLA) type bioresorbable
      scaffolds are visualized poorly .

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a light-based, high resolution, imaging modality for
      intra coronary assessment of tissue and implants. Currently two CE-marked OCT systems are
      used in clinical practice in (Illumien OPTIS, St. Jude Medical , Minnesota, USA and Lunawave,
      Terumo , Tokyo, Japan). It is a common assumption that the scanning images for the two
      systems are similar and are interpreted the same way.

      The aim of the study is to assess if tissue, stents and PLA type scaffolds are presented with
      same characteristics by the two systems.

      Same segment scans by the two systems will be systematically compared and reported.

      Differences in scans by the two systems may have implications for the interpretation and thus
      may affect clinical decisions.
