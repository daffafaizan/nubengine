    
      Following a planned interim analysis in the POC component on 21 August 2008 by the internal
      DMC (Data Monitoring Committee) of study A4001056, the trial was discontinued due to lack of
      efficacy. All participating investigators/country offices and monitors were notified on 22
      August 2008 to cease patient enrollment. The DMC indicated that maraviroc was well tolerated
      in the Rheumatoid Arthritis patients and there were no safety concerns in the study. The
      termination date of this trial was 07 October 2008 when the last patient last visit occurred.
