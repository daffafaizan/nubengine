    
      This is a Phase I/II study to determine:

        -  the safety, tolerability and to identify the MTD and DLT of Plitidepsin in combination
           with a fixed dose of Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia and to
           determine the response rate of the combination of Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in
           patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD.

        -  the pharmacokinetic parameters of Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine.

        -  whether Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine exerts antiangiogenic effects as
           measured by reduction in microvessel density and VEGFR-1 expression in bone marrow
           biopsies of patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia.

        -  whether measurement of free serum VEGF levels, soluble circulating VEGF Receptor and
           Peripheral Progenitor Endothelial cells provide an early marker of response to
           Plitidepsin.

        -  the effects of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine on cytidine deaminase activity and correlate
           results with Cytarabine drug resistance.

        -  changes in leukemic gene expression as a result of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine
           administration.

        -  tumor response duration.

        -  progression free survival and overall survival.
