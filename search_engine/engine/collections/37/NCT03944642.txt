      exclusive breastfeeding is not as expected. The evidence of effectiveness of interventions
      designed to support breastfeeding is not conclusive. Breastfeeding is a complex experience,
      influenced by numerous factors, as self-efficacy, that require interdisciplinary
      approaches.The aim of the study is to design and pilot the effect of a complex intervention
      to support mothers' breastfeeding self-efficacy and professional self-efficacy to support
      breastfeeding families, considering breastfeeding as a health promoting behavior. The project
      will be done in two stages a) design of the intervention and b) experimental pilot trial with
      control and intervention groups, for evaluation of feasibility, acceptability of the
      intervention and preliminary estimate of its effect on maternal and professional
      self-efficacy. The project will be carry out in two public outpatient clinics (Centro de
      Salud Familiar Alberto Hurtado y Centro de Salud Familiar Juan Pablo II) in Santiago, Chile.
      Participants will be breastfeeding women and their partner/family member; and health
      professionals who provide care to mother and child. Intervention group will receive a
      breastfeeding workshop during the third trimester of pregnancy and on-line breastfeeding
      support during the first 6 months postpartum. Health professionals will be train to deliver
      the intervention.Control group will receive the standard care as provided in the outpatient
      clinic.
