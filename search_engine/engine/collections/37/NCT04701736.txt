    
      Primary Objective: In order to evaluate the impact of such an approach on adherence, a
      prospective, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT) was carried out to determine
      if a picture-based medication calendar would improve patient adherence to antiemetic
      medication regimens for adult patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for solid organ tumor
      origins.

      The secondary objectives were: 1) to assess medication use and self-efficacy parameters, 2)
      to determine patient comfort with antiemetic regimen prescribed along with chemotherapy and
      3) to determine patient satisfaction with the calendar study tool.
