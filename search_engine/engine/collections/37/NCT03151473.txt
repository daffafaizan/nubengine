      cells. It is associated with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
      Some people with NAFLD only have excess fat in the liver. However, other people may develop a
      worse form of NAFLD with liver injury and scarring. This form, called non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH), can lead to liver failure, liver cancer, and death. Not much is known
      about why some people develop NASH and others do not.

      This study aims to determine and elucidate, through the cooperative effort of a
      multidisciplinary and multicenter group of collaborators, the etiology, natural history,
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of NAFLD, and in particular its more severe form of NASH
      and its complications in Chinese subjects.
