      (Temporary Abdominal Closure) methods. The two TAC methods being compared are the Barker's
      vacuum packing technique or BVPT and the Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System
      (ABThera) developed by the sponsor of this research (KCI, San Antonio, TX). The BVPT is made
      up of supplies that are stocked in most surgery rooms. The ABThera dressing is available
      commercially. Neither method will be supplied to the doctor (Principal Investigator), so that
      in no way would the subject's standard of care be different from what they would get if the
      study was not being done.

      This study is observational and only collects data about how the subject progresses after
      surgery TAC is used. When a study is observational it means that the subject's standard
      medical care will not be altered in any way, simply watched. The doctor will not change
      treatment of your open abdomen.
