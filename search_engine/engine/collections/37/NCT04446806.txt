    
      Adults ages 18-75 with primary acute promyelocytic leukemia.

      Design:

      The induction therapy with ATRA 25mg/m2/d and ATO 10mg/kg/d should be started as soon as the
      diagnosis of APL confirmed.

      Intravenous dexamethasone at a dose of 5-20 mg daily must be started if the WBC count greater
      than 5e+9/L (before or during the treatment with ATRA) as prevention or preemptive therapy of
      DS.

      Idarubicin (4-10 mg/m2 /d*3d) and hydroxyurea（1.0-3.0g/d）can be given as leukocyte lowering
      therapy which may lessen the risk of DS.

      When the progression of clinical symptoms of DS with no response to dexamethasone,ATRA must
      be stopped and ruxolitinib (5-20mg /d) should be administrated to reduce the production of
      cytokines.

      Participants should stay in the hospital during the treatment for about 4 weeks.

      The changes of spectrum of cytokines are monitored to discover the potential relationship
      between the cytokines and the severity of DS.

      Participants will visit every 1 months after CR for 3 years.
