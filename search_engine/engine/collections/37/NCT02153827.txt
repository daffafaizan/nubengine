      provocation model for exercise progression. This method of progressing resistance training
      load and volume assumes that pain must be increased during the exercise movement for clinical
      benefit to occur. When the individual reports a reduction in pain, load is increased so that
      the provoking pain level returns. The contrast to this approach would be a performance based
      progression as utilized in the Blume et al study for shoulder eccentric training. This method
      progresses a patient based on ability to perform a higher number of repetitions at a given
      load without increasing symptoms which could be favorable in many clinical settings.

      Further investigation on the role of eccentric training, specifically to the shoulder
      external rotators, in patients with SAPS is warranted. Thus, the aim of this investigation
      was to compare outcomes, for individuals diagnosed with SAPS, performing a six week protocol
      of eccentric training to the shoulder external rotators compared to a general exercise
      protocol.
