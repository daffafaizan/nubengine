      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer, who
      survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have
      objective tumor response (complete or partial), treated with brivanib (brivanib alaninate).

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of brivanib in this cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      persistent or recurrent cervical cancer treated with brivanib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain the serum expression levels of surrogate markers of brivanib effects including
      angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and basic fibroblast growth
      factor [bFGF]) and markers of endothelial damage (E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule
      1 [VCAM-1], and (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]). (exploratory) II. To determine
      whether these marker expression levels alone or in combination are associated with response,
      PFS, or overall survival. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brivanib alaninate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
