    
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre phase I-II study of CHR-2797 administered
      orally once a day. The study involves two distinct phases:

      Phase I: an open-label, dose-escalating phase of the study to explore the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHR-2797. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each will be
      treated with escalating, once daily, oral doses of CHR-2797 for 84 days (12 weeks), of which
      the first 28 days constitute the dose finding/ DLT phase. The starting dose will be 60 mg
      once daily. Doses will be increased in a stepwise fashion by around 40 percent per step until
      the MTD is reached. The proportion of patients with Multiple Myeloma will be limited to one
      third: one per cohort of 3 or 2 per cohort of 6. It is anticipated that 24-30 patients will
      be enrolled in the phase I portion of the trial. A decision will be made with regard to the
      disease indication to be tested in phase II (either AML/MDS or MM or both), after completion
      of phase I, or following definition of MTD.

      Phase II: the recommended dose as determined in phase I, will be administered for 84 days to
      a maximum of 40 patients. The primary objective is to determine whether CHR-2797 has
      sufficient biological activity against the disease(s) under study. A multinomial stopping
      rule has been included in the design that incorporates objective responses and early
      progression into a decision to stop or continue this phase I/II trial. An interim assessment
      will be performed after 15 patients have received the maximum acceptable dose (MAD) dose of
      CHR-2797 with clearly defined early stopping rules.

      There will be a clinical conference at the end of every cohort in the phase I portion of the
      study, between phase I and II and after the first 15 patients have completed therapy in phase
      II.
