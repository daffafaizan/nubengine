      dream-enacting behaviors such as punching, kicking, singing, screaming, or somnambulism.
      These can interfere in sleep quality and increase the risk of falling down from the bed and
      physical injuries of both the patient and sleep partner. Therefore, qualities of life of the
      patient and sleep partner are negatively influenced by presence of RBD.

      Clonazepam has been used for treatment of choice of RBD. However, the efficacy of clonazepam
      is not proven in the clinical trial. Clonazepam has several side effects that could be
      problematic in PD patients such as increasing fall-down risk, daytime somnolence, and
      cognitive decline. Melatonin is a second-line treatment option for RBD, but there has been
      only one randomized crossover trial that evaluated the efficacy of melatonin on RBD. Finally,
      there has been no study that evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of melatonin and
      clonazepam for treatment of RBD.
