      two grafting materials used in lateral window sinus augmentation procedure (anorganic bovine
      bone xenograft alone compared to a mixture of allograft and anorganic bovine bone xenograft).
      Participants will have the same surgical treatment of the lateral window sinus augmentation
      procedure. Participants will have a simultaneous implant placement at the time of sinus
      augmentation procedure or a delayed implant placement based on the stability of the implant
      evaluation.

      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be used to evaluate the volumetric changes between
      two groups of graft material in sinus augmentation procedure at three time points:
      pre-operatively, two weeks post-operation and six months post-operation. Biopsies will be
      harvested after six months for histological and histomorphometric analysis.
