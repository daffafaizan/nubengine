      Primary

        -  Identify genetic markers of paclitaxel chemosensitivity and/or chemoresistance, using
           gene expression arrays, in patients with newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian
           epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer treated with single-agent weekly
           paclitaxel followed by paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin.

        -  Correlate RNA expression levels with clinical response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Compare transcriptional profiles of primary tumors vs tissue obtained at second-look
           surgery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify differential expression between pre- and post-treatment tissue in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Pre- and post-chemotherapy tumor samples undergo transcriptional profiling using cDNA
      microarrays to identify gene overexpression. The gene expression profiles of
      paclitaxel-sensitive tumors are compared with those that are paclitaxel resistant to identify
      gene markers that are associated with response to paclitaxel.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
