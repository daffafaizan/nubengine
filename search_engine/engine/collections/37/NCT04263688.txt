    
      Method of Research:

        1. ⅢB-Ⅳ NSCLC patients, tumor mutation burden (TMB) was tested by the 448 gene panel with
           pleural effusion and tissue sample, to observed mutation characteristics;Tissue and
           pleural effusion cell precipitation:TMB (Next generation sequencing, 448 gene
           panel;Average sequencing depth: above 5000×)

        2. The date of blood routine examination(neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR)) and
           serological tumor maker of NSCLC were collected before treatment;the The results of
           Programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression level were collected also;

        3. Collected Imaging(CT)and pathological data before treatment;

        4. Immunotherapy was applied for 8 weeks to evaluate the efficacy;

        5. The tumor mutation burden of pleural effusion was tested again for the patients of
           hyper-progression after immunotherapy, the mutation characteristics and changes were
           observed, the molecular mutation change before and after treatment were evaluated, and
           the correlation with immunotherapy was analyzed.Hyper-progression (HPD) were defined as
           tumor growth rate excess of 50% compared to baseline CT scans prior to treatment
           initiation.The patient underwent imaging examination (chest CT or pet-ct) at 2 months (8
           weeks) after 3 full doses of immunotherapy drugs.

        6. The date of blood routine examination(neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR)) and
           serological tumor maker of NSCLC were collected after treatment;

        7. Imaging, CT and pathological data of patients after treatment were collected
