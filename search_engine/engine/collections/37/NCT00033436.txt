        -  Compare the 6-month cystoscopic response in patients with locally advanced transitional
           cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with radical radiotherapy with or without
           radiosensitization with carbogen and niacinamide.

        -  Compare the local failure-free and overall disease-specific survival of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the treatment-related morbidity, in particular acute and chronic bowel and
           bladder symptoms, in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radical radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 4-6.4 weeks.
           Patients also receive oral niacinamide once daily 1.5-2 hours before initiation of each
           radiotherapy dose and carbogen through a closed breathing system (face mask with a tight
           air seal or a mouthpiece with nasal clip) once daily beginning 5 minutes before
           initiation and continuing until completion of each radiotherapy dose.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed at
           baseline; at 4 weeks; at 3, 6, and 12 months; and then annually for 4 years.

      Patients are followed at 8 and 12 weeks; at 6, 9, and 12 months; and then every 6 months for
      4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 patients (165 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
