    
      Background:

        -  LGL leukemia is a low grade non-Hodgkins Lymphoma characterized by tissue invasion of
           the marrow, spleen and liver

        -  Recurrent infections due to chronic neutropenia and transfusion-dependent anemia are the
           principal causes for initiation of therapy

        -  Approximately 50% of patients treated with cyclosporine (CSA) respond to treatment. CSA
           appears to correct the associated cytopenia without decreasing LGL numbers, suggesting
           it may inhibit LGL secretion of yet unidentified mediators of neutropenia and anemia.

        -  Analysis of differential gene expression profiles in patients with LGL leukemia treated
           with cyclosporine has the potential to detect as yet unidentified, therapeutic targets
           and possibly provide predictors of CSA responsiveness.

      Objective:

        -  Identify changes in gene expression patterns induced by cyclosporine therapy in patients
           with LGL leukemia

        -  Identify differences between responding and non-responding patients

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with Large Granular Lymphocyte leukemia

      Design:

        -  Patients will be treated with cyclosporine at a dose of 5-10mg/kg/day in divided doses,
           with doses adjusted to maintain a therapeutic serum level between 200-400ng/ml. These
           therapeutic levels shall be maintained for 3 months.

        -  Tumor response will be evaluated after 3 months therapy, the dose of CsA may then be
           tapered to that required to sustain a response or discontinued if no evidence of
           response, or after relapse.

        -  Blood sampling or Lymphapheresis for collection of circulating malignant cells will be
           performed at a number of different time points. Gene expression profiling will be
           carried out on Affymetrix microarrays to compare pretreatment and post-treatment
           samples.
