      patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomies. Although many patients are being discharged
      home the same day of surgery, majority of patients complain of immediate postoperative pain
      after a laparoscopic hysterectomy. Since postoperative pain is usually transient and improves
      over a short period of time, infiltration of local anesthetic to trocar insertion sites might
      alleviate the patient's discomfort during the recovery period. Immediate post-operative pain
      relief further facilitates early discharge and faster patient recovery.

      Published data regarding the effects of preemptive port site local anesthesia in gynecologic
      operative laparoscopy have been limited and controversial. Visceral pain control through
      afferent nerve block could minimize pain perception especially during the first postoperative
      hours. This study aims to assess the influence of infiltration of local anesthetic to trocar
      insertion sites after laparoscopic hysterectomy on postoperative pain.
