      that serves as a permanent scaffold. However, it is hypothesized that the stent is no longer
      needed once the artery has healed. This study will evaluate the safety of a bioresorbable
      (non-permanent) stent for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The stent is designed to
      restore blood flow to the artery which allows the artery to remodel (heal), and then resorb
      from the body. The stent supports the vessel during the critical 90-day healing process, and
      then gradually resorbs and is cleared from the body.
