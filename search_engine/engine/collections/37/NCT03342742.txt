      continued growth of numerous fluid-filled renal cysts that ultimately result in renal
      failure. Similar to the general population, the prevalence of overweight and obesity have
      been rising in ADPKD patients, effecting about two-thirds of individuals. Surprisingly, the
      role of obesity in ADPKD progression is currently unknown. The investigators have novel
      preliminary data that overweight and obesity are independently associated with substantially
      faster kidney growth in ADPKD patients. Furthermore, in rodent models of ADPKD,
      mild-to-moderate food restriction profoundly slows cyst growth and maintains renal function
      via mechanisms including AMPK-activated kinase pathway activation and suppression of
      mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase signaling and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels.
      Collectively, these data suggest that dietary restriction regimens may slow ADPKD
      progression. Accordingly, the primary aim is to determine the feasibility of delivering a 1
      year behavioral weight loss intervention program in 30 overweight/obese adults with ADPKD,
      based on either daily caloric restriction (DCR) or intermittent fasting (IMF), with a similar
      (~34%) targeted weekly energy deficit. A key secondary goal is to evaluate safety,
      acceptability, and tolerability of IMF in ADPKD versus DCR. Last, the third exploratory aim
      is to a) obtain mechanistic insight into biological pathways that may be altered and b)
      provide initial insight into any changes in total kidney volume by magnetic resonance imaging
      with IMF and/or DCR.
