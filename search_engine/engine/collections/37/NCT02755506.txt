      ultrasonic technique,and presents a promising application prospect in differentiated
      diagnosis of benign and malignant disease.The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of
      endobronchial ultrasound elastography in the diagnosis of thoracic lesions.

      Conventional ultrasound and ultrasound elastography are respectively used to examine thoracic
      lesions before aspiration,then the images are saved as video clips. Features of conventional
      ultrasound and parameters of ultrasound elastography are analysed and recorded by skilled
      worker. The investigators define the pathological results of EBUS-TBNA combined with results
      of six months follow-up as the "Gold Standard". The receiver operator characteristic curves
      are drawn to obtain area under the Curve (AUC) and the best diagnostic threshold values of
      each parameters. According to the best cutoff values, the investigators respectively
      calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, odds product of each parameters, and then
      compare them with each other to evaluate the value of ultrasound elastography
