      kidneys based on whole-body gamma camera image data for comparison with that obtained using
      mathematical models based on whole body counting from a small gamma detection device called a
      thyroid probe; to obtain pharmacokinetic data following administration of 166Ho-DOTMP; and to
      evaluate safety and efficacy in patients who receive 25 Gy targeted therapy of 166Ho-DOTMP
      and 200 mg/m2 melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).
