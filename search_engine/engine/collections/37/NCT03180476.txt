      been given, patients still locally recurrence and distant metastasis. There is no standard
      treatment recommendation for metastatic NPC who failed to chemoradiotherapy therapy. Apatinib
      has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III
      studies of liver cancer, non small cell lung cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has
      less toxicities and better tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this trial is designed
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib as maintenance therapy after
      chemoradiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma with metastasis.
