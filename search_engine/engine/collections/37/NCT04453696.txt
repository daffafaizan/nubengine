      via social media on dental anxiety, and second, to evaluate the appropriate timing of such
      communications.

      Instagram's quick replies system was used to answer patients' questions to alleviate dental
      anxiety for patients undergoing impacted mandibular third-molar extraction under local
      anesthesia. Patients were assigned randomly into four groups according to timing of such
      communications: Communication before operation (n=36), Communication after operation (n=35),
      Communication before and after operation (n=36), and a control group who received no
      communication on social media (n=36). Dental anxiety was evaluated one week before and after
      the surgical operation using recognized assessment scales-the Spielberger's State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory, Modified Dental Anxiety Scale and a visual analog scale.
