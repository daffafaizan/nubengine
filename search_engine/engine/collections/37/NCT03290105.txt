    
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent life-threatening nosocomial
      infection in the ICU. Oropharyngeal colonization with bacterial pathogens is the first step
      toward lung infection. Oral hygiene with Chlorhexidine mouth wash (CMW) is among the most
      widespread preventive measure to prevent VAP. Although many guidelines and expert opinions
      recommend oral hygiene with chlorhexidine, optimal conditions of CMW use remain unknown. In
      addition, precise microbial documentation of CMW efficacy on oropharyngeal colonization is
      lacking. Investigators wish to determine CMW antimicrobial efficacy in ICU ventilated
      patients and to measure chlorhexidine residual concentration in the saliva at the same
      time-points after CMW.

      In the participanting unit, CMW is performed every 6 hours with a 0.12% chlorhexidine
      solution.

      Hence, microbial oropharyngeal sampling will be performed 6h after the last CMW (and just
      before the next one), to assess oropharyngeal colonization and then 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2
      hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours after a new CMW to assess CMW efficacy in terms of bacterial
      growth.

      In a subset of patients, 0.5 mL of saliva will be collected with a syringe at the same time
      points, with an additional T30 time (at 30 minutes) to measure chlorhexidine concentration.
