      an estimated period of 18 months for the enrolment and max 18 months of follow-up. All
      consecutive patients affected by NSCLC and referred for immunotherapy with the anti-PD-1
      agent nivolumab, or other checkpoint inhibitors that may become available in the future, will
      be prospectively enrolled. The study cohort will consist of 40 patients.

      All patients will undergo the following steps: 1) selection based on eligibility criteria and
      informed consent; 2) baseline examinations (ceCT and 18F-FDG PET/CT); 3) tumor biopsy and
      blood sampling; 4) Immunotherapy with check-point inhibitors; 5) response evaluation after 8
      weeks of treatment (ceCT and 18F-FDG PET/CT) and second blood sampling; 6) follow up.
