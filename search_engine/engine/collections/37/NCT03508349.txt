      where routine antenatal care does not include malaria chemoprohylaxis and whether this
      intervention is protective against malaria during pregnancy. The secondary objective is to
      determine whether this intervention results in an improvement in other key maternal and
      newborn health outcomes including maternal anemia, low birth weight and prematurity. The
      third objective is to determine the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of ISTp
      among women who receive ISTp and among health workers who deliver this intervention.

      This study will establish if testing and treating pregnant women is effective, feasible and
      whether it adds an additional burden to the work already being undertaken by facility-based
      health workers who provide antenatal care services. It is expected that the study will result
      in information to develop appropriate approaches that can be implemented in Rwanda in the
      prevention of malaria in pregnancy in addition to the use of preventive measures such as
      insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and case management. This information may
      potentially also be used by other countries with similar patterns of malaria transmission.
