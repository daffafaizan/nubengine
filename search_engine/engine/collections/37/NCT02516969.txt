    
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the 1-year local control in patients with
      operable, recurrent previously-irradiated squamous cell head-and-neck cancers with or without
      adjuvant SBRT. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the locoregional
      progression-free survival (PFS) distant PFS, overall PFS (local + regional + distant), and
      overall survival (OS), to evaluate the acute and late toxicities of adjuvant SBRT in the
      re-irradiation setting following salvage surgery, to determine prognostic factors that may
      predict the likelihood of local failure, regional failure, or OS in this cohort to guide
      future management, to compare the impact of adjuvant SBRT versus a wait-and-see approach on
      patient reported quality of life (PR-QoL), and to compare surgical versus SBRT-induced
      immunological serum markers in relation to local control.
