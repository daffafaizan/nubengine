    
      The investigators aim to A) compare atrial cardiomyopathy findings from the tissue samples to
      clinical phenotype and adverse events B) study the association of genetic defects
      predisposing to atrial fibrillation with atrial cardiomyopathy findings in the tissue samples
      C) assess the role of inflammation in atrial fibrillation by comparing circulating cytokine
      profiles, purinergic signaling and atrial cardiomyopathy findings in tissue samples.
