      diacerein 1% ointment and vehicle ointment applied under fully occlusive patch conditions on
      the infrascapular region of each subject's back to induce a photoallergic skin reaction
      following Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This was repeated twice each week during the 3-week
      Induction Phase, once during rest week 4 as applicable and once at Challenge Phase.
