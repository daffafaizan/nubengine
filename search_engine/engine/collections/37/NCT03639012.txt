      the day of surgery and then randomised to 1 of 2 groups who will either receive the
      intervention or current standard care. Patients will be recruited from the ENT outpatient
      clinics in conjunction with the ENT surgeons.

      Data collection will be undertaken with the aid of experience research assistants.
