      immunogenicity of demi-doses of two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines being authorized in the European
      Union since December 2020: mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX and Vaccine BNT162b2
      (ComirnatyÂ®; Pfizer-BioNTech) in healthy adults up to age 55 year. Immunogenicity will be
      measured 28 days after first and second dose, and day 180 and day 365 after first vaccination
      of 50 or 100 mcg mRNA-1273 and 20 mcg of BNT162b2. The primary outcome is the level of
      binding antibodies for RBD 28 days after the second dose. This study will be performed in
      healthy employees at three sites of Mensura EDPB in Belgium.
