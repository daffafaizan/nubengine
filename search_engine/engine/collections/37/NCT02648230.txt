      has become the invasive gold standard for determining the physiologic extent of cardiac
      ischemia, and which has been validated in several clinical outcomes studies as a way of
      optimizing case selection for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). More recently a
      microcatheter (MC)-based sensor measurement of fractional flow reserve has been introduced.
      Small scale in-vivo comparisons have been performed suggesting the utility of this approach
      to measure FFR,but these data are limited and have not been independently validated. This
      non-randomized, prospective study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of MC-based FFR
      measurement to the PW standard in lesions subjected to FFR assessment in routine clinical
      practice.
