      resulting in a distinct phenotype, most probably related to many specific causes. Individuals
      with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early
      childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive
      and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades
      (Wiznitzer, 2005).

      The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but
      current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.

      Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed
      to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive
      behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of
      autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for
      an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).

      Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism.
      Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam
      et al, 2006). A recent investigation of the cholinergic system in autism, detailed below, has
      provided promising findings. Our study aims to assess the clinical outcomes associated with
      cholinergic manipulations using pharmacological agents and nutritional supplements. The study
      approved by the Helsinki committee for clinical research.
