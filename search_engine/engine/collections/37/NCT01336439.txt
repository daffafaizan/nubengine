      grinding of teeth and is a very common condition in the general population. Various treatment
      modalities such as occlusal splints, pharmacologic agent and cognitive-behavioral therapy
      have been investigated for the management of bruxism, but none is reported to be fully
      effective. Recently locally injected botulinum toxin has been used in various movement
      disorders, but its usefulness and objective effects on nocturnal bruxism have not been
      evaluated using objective measures such as polysomnography. Moreover, there is no systematic
      study about which site is most appropriate for injection to obtain maximal effects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin type A into masseter
      muscle or both masseter muscle and temporal muscle on nocturnal bruxism using polysomnography
      and the changes in the bruxism events on polysomnography.
