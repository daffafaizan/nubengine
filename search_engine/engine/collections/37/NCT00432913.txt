      polyps. More than 90% of new large bowel cancers arise sporadically. The molecular events
      leading to the development of colorectal cancer from polyps are characterised by an imbalance
      in cell proliferation (formation of new cells) and apoptosis (natural cell death) from
      changes in the genes involved in normal colon cells.

      Recent work at St George's Hospital Medical School, London, has shown significant beneficial
      effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis rates in the lining of the colon in subjects with
      a history of colonic adenomas using a highly purified, free-fatty acid form of
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

      Comparator(s): 2g EPA per day for 6 months and 1g EPA per day for 6 months will be compared
      against placebo for 6 months.
