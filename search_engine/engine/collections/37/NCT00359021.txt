    
      This is a Phase III open-label, roll-over trial to evaluate the long term tolerability,
      safety, antiviral and immunological effect of TMC125 as part of an individually optimized
      antiretroviral therapy including TMC114/rtv in HIV-1 infected patients who participated in
      one of the DUET (TMC125-C206 or TMC125-C216) trials. Also the change in HIV-1 resistance over
      time will be evaluated. This trial offers patients meeting the definition of virologic
      failure at Week 24 or beyond the option to roll-over to an open-label trial where they will
      receive TMC125 and TMC114/rtv. Three hundred patients are estimated to enroll into this
      trial. The withdrawal visit of the DUET trial will be the first visit of this trial. From
      this visit onward, all patients will receive 200 mg twice daily TMC125 and 600/100 mg twice
      daily TMC114/rtv until both TMC114 and TMC125 are commercially available or the therapy is no
      longer of clinical benefit to the patient. Patients will receive an antiretroviral therapy
      consisting of TMC125 as the only non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI),
      TMC114/rtv as the only protease inhibitor (PI) and an optimized background, which will be
      selected by the investigator according to the local standard of care, the patient's
      experience with previous therapies and most recent resistance testing. The most recent HIV-1
      genotype-analysis system report results from the DUET trial will be made available. TMC125
      will be dosed at 200 mg twice daily, administered orally as 2 tablets twice daily with
      food.TMC114/rtv will be dosed at 600/100 mg twice daily, administered orally as 2 tablets
      TMC114 and 1 capsule ritonavir twice daily with food.The optimized background will comprise
      of at least 1 approved ARV drug: 1 or more NRTI(s), with or without ENF. Administration will
      continue until both TMC114 and TMC125 are commercially available or therapy is no longer of
      clinical benefit to the patient.
