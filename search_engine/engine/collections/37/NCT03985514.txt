      unselected populations indicate that approximately 70-80 % of patients respond to
      antibiotics, while the remaining 20-25% need an operation. Antibiotic treatment was
      associated with significantly fewer severe and non-severe complications compared to surgery.
      Therefore, antibiotic treatment can be regarded as safe and effective initial treatment of
      acute appendicitis based on evidence.

      However, it remains to be evaluated to what extent antibiotic treatment is more effective
      compared to the most conservative application of procedures in the care of patients with
      acute appendicitis. A well- recognized approach in Sweden is watchful waiting at in-hospital
      conditions. A certain number of patients with suspected uncomplicated appendicitis will
      likely recover without any active treatment, but controlled evidence are lacking to what
      extent such recoveries may occur in the short- and long-term perspective.

      The hypothesis is that antibiotic treatment is superior to active observation with regard to
      symptom relief at suspected acute appendicitis in selected patient groups.
