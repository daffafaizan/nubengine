      - ropivacaine is injected near the spine before surgery. Midazolam and fentanyl are
      administered intravenously for sedation. Group 2 - Lidocaine/Ketamine - General anesthesia
      with lidocaine and ketamine administered intravenously throughout your surgery and for 60
      minutes after surgery. Group 3 - General Anesthesia Alone. General anesthesia with placebo
      administered intravenously throughout surgery and for 60 minutes after surgery. All
      participants will rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10 after surgery and on days 1 and 2
      after surgery. Participants are called 3 and 6 months after surgery for pain and quality of
      life assessments
