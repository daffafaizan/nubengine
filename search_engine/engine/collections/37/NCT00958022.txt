        -  LBH589 will be given in oral formulation starting at a dose of 10 mg (Dose Level 1)
           three times per week (doses will be given at least 2 days apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday,
           Friday), 2 out of 3 weeks dosing schedule.

        -  After establishing the MTD of LBH589 at a 2 out 3 weeks dosing schedule, a 3 out of 3
           weeks dosing schedule will be tested at that dose, and this schedule will be adopted in
           the absence of limiting toxicities.

        -  Carboplatin will be given on day 1, every 21 days, and etoposide on days 1,2,3 every 21
           days for up to 6 cycles. LBH589 will be continued weekly, three times-a-week, without
           interruption after completion of 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy until progression,
           or intolerable toxicities.

      In the phase I part and for cycle 1 only, for the purpose of the PK studies LBH589 will start
      the week prior to the first carboplatin/etoposide cycle and PD studies will be performed
      (week -1).

      Study design and sample size:

      This is a phase I/II study. Phase I: 15-24 patients (estimated; Three to six patients will be
      enrolled at each dose level); Phase II: 39 patients.
