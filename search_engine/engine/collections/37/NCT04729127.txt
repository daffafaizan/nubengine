      with ASD. The investigators will enroll 3 clinicians per agency (18 total) and 3 families per
      clinician (54 total). Agencies will be randomized to the 3 arms. The investigators will
      measure clinician fidelity and parent fidelity through direct observation and selfreport. The
      investigators will measure child and parent outcomes at baseline and 6 months using measures
      common to similar trials. Resource use for the economic evaluation will occur quarterly and
      will take a societal approach. The investigators will partner with a community advisory board
      to apply the findings from this pilot trial to the development of a larger, system-wide
      subsequent trial that is feasible and ecologically valid for Philadelphias EI system. The
      results will provide rigorous information about whether evidence-based autism interventions
      for young children can be implemented successfully with the resources available in cities
      like Philadelphia, the role of hours of treatment in improving child outcomes, and the
      cost-benefit implications for families and community agencies. This project has the potential
      to dramatically improve the services families of young children with ASD in Philadelphia
      receive, and significantly improve their long-term outcomes. This preliminary trial would
      provide the EI system with the information needed to bring this type of intervention to scale
      across the entire system. It also would serve as the foundation for an application for
      federal funds to conduct a system-wide study of Project ImPACT as implemented in all
      Philadelphia agencies serving children with ASD.
