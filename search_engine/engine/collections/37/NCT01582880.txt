      degradation by the body's own enzymes. The use of highly-resistant donor corneas is meant to
      eliminate the serious post-operative complication of corneal melting (keratolysis) that
      repeatedly occurs in Boston KPro patients with severe ocular burns, autoimmune and
      cicatrizing diseases.
