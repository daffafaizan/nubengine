      and cytarabine in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia. II.
      Evaluate the safety and tolerance of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the time
      to progression, disease free survival, and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive idarubicin IV over 1 hour
      on days 1-3. Fludarabine IV is administered over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Cytarabine IV is
      administered over 4 hours on days 1-5. If partial response is obtained, patients receive a
      second course of treatment. Patients receive a consolidation course in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable toxicity. Idarubicin IV is administered over 1 hour on days 1
      and 2. Fludarabine IV is administered over 30 minutes, followed by cytarabine IV over 4 hours
      on days 1-5. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 27 months.
