    
      Patients scheduled to undergo sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse at the University of
      Oklahoma Health Sciences Center will be recruited for this study. Written informed consent
      will be obtained from all participants prior to the scheduled surgery and before the
      randomization process. This study will contain two arms, each with two groups. The first arm
      will have participants receiving sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse; the second arm
      will consist of participants receiving sacrocolpopexy plus a concomitant procedure for stress
      urinary incontinence. Each participant will be assigned to the arm that matches their
      scheduled procedure; they will then be randomized into one of the two study groups within
      that arm. Randomization will be performed by placing note cards in sealed envelopes with
      "Group A" or "Group B" listed on the card. One envelope will be placed with each
      participant's preoperative packet and opened on the day of surgery after the operation is
      complete.On the date of the procedure, a urinalysis will be performed prior to the routine
      administration of prophylactic antibiotics. At the beginning of the procedure, a
      transurethral catheter will be placed as is routine for this procedure. At the conclusion of
      the procedure, the sealed envelope containing the participant's group designation will be
      opened and she will be assigned to one of two groups. Group A participants will have their
      catheter removed on postoperative day 1 and Group B will have their catheter removed on
      postoperative day 2.
