      Our hypotheses are that levels of HbA1c and hsCRP will:

        1. decrease after extraction of all teeth

        2. not increase after placement of dental implants

        3. not increase after prosthetic restoration with full dentures anchored on the dental
           implants.

      Part II:

      Our hypothesis is that:

      a) the implants will be retained over the long term

      Only one arm was included due to ethical reasons: Once potential participants would be
      diagnosed with terminal periodontal (gum) disease, they would need full-mouth extraction and
      prosthetic rehabilitation. It would be unethical to withhold or delay treatment that is known
      to work, especially because such severe gum infection can have very serious consequences.
      Therefore, no control group was included in study.

      Few studies have determined what happens to sugar control and inflammatory markers in people
      with diabetes if teeth with severe gum disease are removed and replaced with implants and
      dentures. Neither has any study followed for a total of 11 years after implant placement such
      subjects that initially had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes as well as recent severe periodontal
      infection, and several of whom smoke cigarettes.

      Therefore, the results of this study could add new understanding about diabetes and dental
      health. The results of this study could influence dental care guidelines for treating people
      with uncontrolled or poorly type 2 diabetes and severe gum disease. The option of implant
      supported dentures could potentially be added to the treatment choices for such patients.
