      January-April 2020, was carried out. The evaluation of the staff's absence included all
      workers employed under an employment contract: 713 workers in 2019 and 747 workers in 2020.
      The variable number of employees was a result of the employment dynamics in the subsequent 2
      years, due to variable quantity of healthcare services that were contracted with the national
      payer and changes in the form of employment of some hospital workers.Three types of analyses
      were carried out: global analysis, analysis taking into account division into specific
      professions and the analysis of absence in different hospital organizational units/areas. The
      absences due to medical reasons, holidays or childcare were analyzed together. The analysis
      of performing the contracted tasks was shown in relative values ( %). The analysis included
      the structure of contracted services dividing them into: Orthopedics (alloplasty and others),
      rehabilitation (person-day), rheumatology (drug trials and others). Considering the
      rehabilitation unit, it was subdivided into inpatient and outpatient wards due to temporary
      closure of the outpatient ward.
