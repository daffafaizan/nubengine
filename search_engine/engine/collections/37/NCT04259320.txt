      34-96%. Nipple cracks generally occur in the first week after the birth and may continue in
      the following periods of breastfeeding. Nipple crack is the second most common reason to stop
      breastfeeding early, after perceived insufficient milk release. Nipple crack pain in studies
      has been expressed as extremely painful and terrible. It is known that breast milk, olive
      oil, quince seed jelly, mint juice, lanolin, jujube fruit lotion, guaiazulen pomade, aloe
      vera gel, menthol essence, vitamin A-E, curcumin extract, hydrogel dressings are recommended
      to mothers to prevent nipple cracks during breastfeeding. The prevention of nipple cracks,
      will successfully allow to continue breastfeeding. In this way, breastfeeding will not be
      interrupted and the rate of breastfeeding-only feeding will increase in the first 6 months.
      Using non-pharmacological, effective and therapeutic methods will also have a positive effect
      to increase the rate of breastfeeding.

      Studies in the literature cover the evaluation of the effectiveness of beeswax or
      beeswax-containing mixtures on wound, burn and crack healing. Due to its natural composition
      with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiulcerative properties, beeswax is thought to be an
      effective and sufficient material in preventing and healing nipple cracks.

      In this study, it is planned to include 90 lactating women (30 women in each group) to meet
      the parametric test assumptions in the experimental and control groups (beeswax-containing
      barrier, breast milk, and no treatment-control). Breastfeeding mothers to be included in the
      experimental and control groups will be randomized.
