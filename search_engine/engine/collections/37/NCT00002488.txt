      patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed primary
      combination chemotherapy but still respond to conventional-dose DHAP
      (dexamethasone/cytarabine/cisplatin) and are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation.
      II. Determine the toxicity of the intensification chemotherapy regimen in this group of
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. CVP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX,
      NSC-26271; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 CR is seen in the first 6 patients, an estimated maximum of
      20 patients will be enrolled. If 3 or more of the first 10 patients (or 25% of the study
      population thereafter) die within the first 35 days of treatment from causes unrelated to
      tumor progression, the study will be terminated.
