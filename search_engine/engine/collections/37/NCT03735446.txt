      drug or combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the
      drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved prexasertib as a treatment
      for any disease. Prexasertib is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being
      developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by
      preventing cancer cells from being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of
      a cell) which then leads to cell death.

      The drugs mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) have all been approved by the FDA.
      MEC is a standard chemotherapy treatment option, commonly used for AML that has not responded
      to other standard treatment or returned following standard treatment.

      In this research study, the investigators are combining prexasertib with MEC therapy to test
      if it is a safe treatment for AML or MDS that has returned or not responded to standard
      treatment.
