      hydrochloride can increase intestinal calcium absorption in contrast to lanthanum carbonate.
      It is unknown whether such the difference may have an effect on bone metabolism and/or modify
      the development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of
      the study was to compare the effect of a single dose of 1000 mg of lanthanum carbonate with
      2,4 mg of sevelamer hydrochloride on serum and urine calcium following an oral load of 5 g of
      calcium carbonate given with a meal with standardized phosphate content.
