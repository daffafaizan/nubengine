    
      This is a multi-center, observational study to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of
      the AMPLATZERâ„¢ PIVSD Occluder for use in transcatheter closure of muscular ventricular septal
      defects following a myocardial infarction in the post approval setting.

      The study has five endpoints (safety: acute and chronic survival; effectiveness: technical
      success, acute and chronic closure).Two cohorts will be utilized to obtain study endpoint
      data. The first cohort will be comprised of all available Emergency and Compassionate PIVSD
      Occluder subject data from 2011 until the end of 2016 and these data will be used to
      determine technical success and acute survival. The second cohort of thirty subjects will be
      comprised of patients who are successfully implanted with a PIVSD Occluder from 2011 onward
      at activated study centers. The index procedure must have occurred >6 months prior to
      enrollment. Subject identification will occur until data on a minimum of 30 subjects with
      PIVSD Occluders for post myocardial infarct VSD and post-procedure echocardiogram available
      for evaluation of residual shunt by the echocardiography core laboratory have been enrolled.
      The thirty subject cohort data will be used to determine acute closure, chronic closure, and
      chronic survival endpoints.

      The study will be conducted at up to 50 centers in the U.S. The expected duration of
      enrollment is approximately 4 years. The total duration of the clinical study is expected to
      be 4.5 years.
