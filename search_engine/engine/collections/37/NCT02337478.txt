      I. To determine the feasibility of administering vincristine sulfate liposome injection
      (VSLI) to relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients having failed, refused
      or not a candidate for at least one chemotherapy salvage regimen.

      II. To observe the hematologic improvement-rate of VSLI in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with VSLI. II. To observe the response
      rate (complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi],
      partial response [PR], and morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]) of VSLI in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vincristine sulfate liposome via injection on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.
