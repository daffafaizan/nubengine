    
      Pain perception is affected by physiological, psychological, existential and demographic
      factors.

      In the present study psychophysiological, psychological, genetic and demographic components
      in pain perception are evaluated in healthy volunteers (n = 100).

      Psychophysical assessments following induction of a first degree burn injury (47.0 C, 420 s,
      12.5 sq.cm, lower leg) include:

        -  pain during induction of burn injury

        -  thermal thresholds

        -  tactile thresholds

        -  electrical thresholds

        -  areas of secondary hyperalgesia

        -  pressure algometric assessments

        -  assessment of Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) efficiency

        -  assessment of (DNIC) using cold pressor test

      Psychological assessments include:

        -  HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale)

        -  PCS (Pain Catastrophizing Scale)

        -  vulnerability score

      Genetics include:

      - A118G SNP

      Demographics include:

        -  gender

        -  height

        -  weight
