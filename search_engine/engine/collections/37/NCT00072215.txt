      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of men with progressive or recurrent metastatic germ cell
           tumors treated with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin vs vinblastine, ifosfamide,
           and cisplatin as second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      complete response or partial response with negative markers for at least 6 months (yes vs no)
      and relapse at least 2 years after completing first-line chemotherapy for germ cell tumors
      (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 20-30
           minutes and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 2-5. Patients also receive filgrastim
           (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 7-18 OR pegfilgrastim SC once within 24-72 hours
           after completion of chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vinblastine IV on days 1 and 2 and cisplatin IV over 20-30
           minutes and ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients also receive G-CSF SC on
           days 7-18 OR pegfilgrastim as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
