      I. To evaluate the efficacy of levocarnitine in combination with vitamin B complex in
      treating PEG-asparaginase (PEG) or inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) induced hyperbilirubinemia
      (total bilirubin [Tbili] > 3 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients (pts) with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate chemotherapy dose intensity in patients treated with PEG-asparaginase or
      inotuzumab ozogamicin.

      II. To characterize the safety, tolerability, and adverse event profile of levocarnitine and
      vitamin B for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      Patients receive levocarnitine intravenously (IV) over 2-3 minutes every 6 hours up to 4
      times a day (inpatient) or orally (PO) three times a day (TID) (outpatient). Patients also
      receive vitamin B complex PO twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for up to 30 days after
      the last dose of either PEG-asparaginase or inotuzumab, or until Tbili of â‰¤ 1.5 x ULN or at
      least a 50% reduction in peak Tbili is achieved.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
