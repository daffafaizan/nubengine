      assess the effectiveness and safety of JointRep®, a second-generation chitosan-based hydrogel
      for cartilage repair. A total of 185 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either Microfracture
      plus JointRep® or Microfracture alone. The follow up will be at 24 months, with a planned
      interim analysis at 12 months. The primary endpoint is an objectively measured structural one
      (quantity of new cartilaginous tissue, assessing the percentage of fill) and it will be
      blindly assessed using a sophisticated quantitative MRI at 12 and 24 months. Two of the
      secondary endpoints are also structurally based and blindly measured: quality of the new
      tissue, quantifying the T2 (which measures the Collagen 2 content and orientation as well as
      degree of hydration); the upper and lower half of the new tissue T2 measurement will depict
      the degree of stratification of the new cartilaginous tissue. A semiquantitative MOCART-2
      blinded analysis will also be carried out. The clinical outcomes will be measured using KOOS
      and Tegner, as well as a VAS and an EQ-5 questionnaire. All the secondary endpoints will be
      analyzed at the same 12 and 24 months timepoints. In addition, subject safety will be
      assessed through a record of adverse events.
