      Tumors originating from the neuroendocrine system, although relatively rare, may be life
      threatening. In cases where the disease has metastasized, the 5 year survival is very poor.
      131I meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)and 90Y DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-Octreotide (DOTATOC) are two
      radiopharmaceuticals that have shown promise as therapeutic agents in patients with
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor
      to obtain objective anti-tumor responses or cure with these radiopharmaceuticals is
      challenging because of the allowable dose limits imposed by radiation damage to normal
      tissues. Organ biodistribution and kinetics of 90Y DOTATOC and 131I MIBG are substantially
      different, which leads to different critical organs for these agents, the kidney for Y90Y
      DOTATOC and the red marrow for 131I MIBG. We propose to investigate a mechanism to increase
      the radiation dose delivered to tumors without exceeding "critical" radiation dose to normal
      organs by combining 90Y DOTATOC and 131I MIBG.

      AIMS / OBJECTIVES:

      The primary aim of this project is to determine, what fraction of individuals with
      neuroendocrine tumors would show substantially improved tumor dosimetry with combined agent
      therapy compared to "best" single agent therapy and determine the magnitude of the potential
      tumor radiation dose increase.

      METHODS:

      To achieve this, we plan to perform serial scintigraphic imaging procedures to measure
      patient specific bone marrow, kidney, and tumor biodistribution and kinetics for 111In
      Pentetreotide and 131I-MIBG in adults and children with neuroendocrine tumors. Then, using
      the program we have already developed, we will input the individual dosimetry measures for
      bone marrow, kidney and tumor to determine the optimal amounts of administered radioactivity
      for the combination of 131I MIBG plus 90Y DOTATOC or 131I MIBG alone.
