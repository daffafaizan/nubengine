      parenteral nutrition for intestinal failure, participants will be enrolled from the pediatric
      intestinal rehabilitation clinic, and data collection will be obtained from the electronic
      medical record. Participant will receive daily sodium citrate 4% catheter locking solution
      for CLABSI prophylaxis, instead of heparin locks. Participants will be monitored for 12
      months for adverse events, including CLABSI. Participants will have the same routine
      laboratory schedule and monthly outpatient follow up. After 12 months, participants will be
      given the option to continue to use sodium citrate 4% locks after the initial study period if
      no serious adverse events have occurred. The investigators anticipate enrolling 10-15
      participants per year and anticipate enrollment to continue for 3-5 years.

      Sodium citrate locks: 3 ml vials of locking solution will be prepared by the infusion
      pharmacy using commercially available 4% sodium citrate IV fluid (available in 500 ml bags).
      The sodium citrate locks will be instilled into the central catheter daily during the period
      that parenteral nutrition is not infusing, and will be withdrawn and disposed of prior to
      resuming infusion of parenteral nutrition. If subjects are hospitalized, sodium citrate locks
      will be temporarily held during the duration of the inpatient stay, and will be resumed once
      the participant is discharged home.
