      radiation therapy for approximately four months. Subjects who remain eligible will then be
      randomized to receive either intra-arterial chemotherapy with gemcitabine; or to continue
      gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Subjects will receive the randomized treatments for up to 16
      weeks or until progression. Both groups will receive either IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      or oral capecitabine following the 16 week treatment course until disease progression at the
      discretion of the Investigator.
