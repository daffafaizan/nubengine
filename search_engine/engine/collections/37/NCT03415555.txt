      participate in the study. Each patient will be anesthetized generally. The same drugs will be
      used in each stage of anesthesia. The induction: etomidate, remifentanil, rocuronium, scolina
      as required. The maintenance: sevoflurane, remifentanil, rocuronium. The emergence: oxygen,
      sugammadex or neostigmine a required.

      Patients will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: PCA or ESP. Among the patients
      from ESP group will have ESP blockade before the induction of general anesthesia. ESP
      blockade will be performed under ultrasound control. A single-shot technique will be used
      with 0.375 % solution of ropivacaine: 0.2 mL per patients' KG. The maximum dose is 40 mL.

      Each patient, before the end of surgery, will be administered i.v. 0.1 mg of oxycodone. PCA
      with oxycodone (1mg/mL) will be utilized during the postoperative period: 5-minute interval.
      This is standard protocol in our department.

      Only patients who are successfully awakened after the procedure may participate in the study.

      The pain intensity will be assessed with visual-analogue scale (VAS) at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24
      hour after the end of anesthesia.

      The total consumption of oxycodone will be also monitored.
