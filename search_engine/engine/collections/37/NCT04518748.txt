      delivered to a tumor. In SIRT, small radioactive beads are deposited in the liver through a
      large blood vessel (hepatic artery). SIRT that uses the radioactive material Yttrium-90 is
      called Y-90 SIRT.

      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a technique where radiation is externally
      delivered to a tumor. In SBRT, a machine produces a beam of radiation that targets the tumor
      from outside the body.

      After receiving Y-90 SIRT, participants will be evaluated to estimate how much radiation was
      absorbed by their tumors during Y-90 SIRT. Y-90 PET-CT imaging will be used to help plan
      SBRT, which will target areas of tumors that did not receive as much radiation as expected
      during Y-90 SIRT.
