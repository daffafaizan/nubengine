      endometrial (EC) and certain types of ovarian cancer (OC). Lynch Syndrome is caused by
      inherited changes in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In this study we will establish the
      proportion of EC and OC patients with Lynch Syndrome. We will screen all EC and OC patients
      by performing MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) on their surgical specimen. These data will then
      be used along with family history data to determine which women are at high risk of Lynch
      Syndrome. We will facilitate the referral of all women at risk for Lynch Syndrome to genetic
      counselling on behalf of their treating physician. First degree relatives of those patients
      found to have Lynch Syndrome who consent to participate in the study will also be referred to
      genetics by the study PI. We will encourage all participants found to have Lynch Syndrome to
      attend regular colonoscopy screening to prevent colorectal cancer, and (for females with
      Lynch Syndrome) consideration of gynecologic risk reducing surgery to prevent endometrial and
      ovarian cancers. We will assess adherence to Lynch Syndrome screening guidelines in this
      population and will determine if our universal screening strategy is feasible and
      cost-effective for widespread implementation across Canada in an effort to prevent Lynch
      Syndrome associated cancers in women and their families. In addition to this, consenting
      patients may provide blood and tumour tissue samples for sequencing studies which will
      investigate the genetic basis for Lynch Syndrome and shed light on cases of MMR loss in the
      absence of germline mutation.
