    
      The trial is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with two
      phases: phase I to 48 weeks and phase II to 96 weeks with the primary analysis at 48 weeks.
      HIV-infected individuals who are taking their first standard cART regimen for at least four
      years with complete viral suppression. Upon enrollment, he/she will be randomized to one of
      two arms: the MK-0518 arm or the control arm. As each participant reaches week 48, he/she
      will be unblinded and those in the MK-0518 arm will continue taking MK-0518. Based on the
      results of an interim analysis, the control arm will be rolled over to receive MK-0518 for 48
      weeks. After the screening, baseline visits and week 4 safety visit, follow-up visits will
      occur every 8 weeks for both arms.
