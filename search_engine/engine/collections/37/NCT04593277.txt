    
      OUTLINE: Patients who have one or more elevated distress or low cardiometabolic or cancer
      health care adherence are randomized to Arm I or II. Patients who do not have elevated
      distress or low cardiometabolic or cancer health care adherence are assigned to Group 0.

      ARM I (INTERVENTION): Patients receive a personalized smart cell phone (SCP) and use the
      Interactive Survivorship Program to Improve Healthcare Resources (INSPIRE) mobile
      application. Patients may receive telehealth stepped care after 1 month.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Patients receive access to a study-specific control website that has
      annotated links to existing resources for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors. After
      12 months, patients receive a personalized SCP and have access to the digital INSPIRE
      intervention program without telehealth calls.

      GROUP 0: Patients have access to the digital INSPIRE program and receive printed SCP
      materials without telehealth.
