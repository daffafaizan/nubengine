      Eligible subjects will receive a single dose of investigational medicinal product or placebo
      on Day 1 and will be followed for safety, PK, and PD for 72 hours post dose. Follow-up visits
      on Day 4 and Day 7 for the end-of-study safety. Participation of an individual subject may
      last up to 36 days from the time of screening until the end-of-study follow-up visit. Each
      cohort will enroll a sentinel pair (1:1 randomized to active: placebo). These subjects will
      be followed for 48 hours postdose and safety data reviewed before the remaining subjects in
      the cohort receive IMP. A Safety Monitoring Committee will review the seven-day safety data
      in each cohort before proceeding to the next ascending dose cohort, according to the stopping
      rules outlined in the protocol.
