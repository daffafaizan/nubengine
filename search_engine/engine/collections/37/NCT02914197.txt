    
      1:1 double-blinded randomized controlled trial of patients to receive the intervention or
      standard information (control) at the study start in an information package. The intervention
      includes a decision aid (previously developed by Hersch et al. 2015, with minor modifications
      to reflect the Canadian context), a YouTube video link and an invitation to attend a group
      information session. The intervention or standard information, depending on participants
      assigned study group, will be mailed or emailed to participants. The information packages
      will also include questionnaires to collect data on outcome measures. There will be two study
      waves to account for women's eligibility at different time points (i.e. when approaching a
      mammogram due date). The first wave of participants will receive their information package at
      the study start and the second wave of participants will be sent their information packages 6
      months after the study start. Each wave of participants will be followed for one year. Data
      collection will include quantitative measures of factors relevant to the decision-making
      process. Screening participant rates will be measured for each wave of participants, 6 months
      and 12 months after their respective enrollment date. Qualitative methods will be used to
      obtain an understanding of clinician's perception of decision aids in a primary care setting.
      Outcome measures and analyses will be blinded.
