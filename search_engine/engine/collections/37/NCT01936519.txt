      with the nephrotoxic effect of calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppression associated with
      its long term negative survival impact, this study proposes to examine the renal sparing
      impact of conversion to everolimus from a calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppressive
      protocol at 3 months post liver transplant. The 3 month time point was chosen to allow for
      the switch to everolimus to occur at a period of stable post transplant liver function when
      both technical and rejection risks are lower. The 3 month cut off was also chosen because of
      data indicating that worsening renal function at 4 weeks, 3 months and 1 year post transplant
      is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic renal failure and end stage
      renal disease after orthotopic liver transplantation. 24 patients will be randomized into 2
      arms:

      Arm A: Conversion to Everolimus immunosuppression combined with mycophenolic acid (Myfortic:
      MPA), and complete discontinuation of Calcineurin inhibitor at 3 months post transplant.

      Arm B: Continuation with standard immunosuppressive therapy consisting of Calcineurin
      inhibitor associated with mycophenolic acid (Myfortic: MPA).

      Follow up: 2 years.
