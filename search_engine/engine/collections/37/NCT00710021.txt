    
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production
      of autoantibodies with subsequent immune complex deposition and tissue inflammation. The role
      of interferon (IFN) alpha in the development of SLE has been repeatedly documented. Vitamin D
      deficiency is common among lupus patients. Vitamin D is recognized as a regulator of immune
      response. This study will explore the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on IFN alpha
      expression in SLE patients.

      The study will last approximately 12 weeks and consist of three treatment groups: 1.)
      Participants will receive vitamin D3 2000 IU daily 2.) Participants will receive vitamin D3
      4000 IU daily 3.) Participants will receive a vitamin D3 placebo daily. There will be four
      study visits for each participant. Visits will occur at screening, study entry, and Weeks 6
      and 12. Physical examination, vital signs, and blood and urine tests will occur at all
      visits. For females of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed at
      screening and Week 6.
