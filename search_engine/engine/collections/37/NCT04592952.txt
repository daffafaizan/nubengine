      episodic or chronic migraine will receive intravenous infusion with calcitonin gene-related
      peptide and subsequently be treated with erenumab. The study will consist of the following
      elements:

        -  Provocation Phase (1 experimental day with intravenous infusion of calcitonin
           gene-related peptide)

        -  Screening/Baseline Phase (4 weeks)

        -  Open-Label Treatment Phase (24 weeks)
