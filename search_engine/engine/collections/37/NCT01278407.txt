      Confirmatory Phase) and 36-week open-label extension phases. Of 142 DLB patients enrolled in
      the RCT phase (three arms: placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg), 110 entered the extension phase. The
      placebo group of the RCT phase initiated active treatment at week 16, and the active groups
      maintained allocated treatment and dosages until week 24. After week 24, all patients
      received 10 mg. Dose reduction to 5 mg for safety concerns was allowed.
