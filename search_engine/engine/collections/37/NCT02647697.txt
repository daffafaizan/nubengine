    
      UP0027 is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      and PK profile of radiprodil in healthy adult male and female subjects after a single fasting
      oral dose of radiprodil 30 mg suspension formulation. A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled
      in the study.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the PK profile of oral radiprodil in
      suspension form in healthy adult subjects.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral
      radiprodil in suspension form in healthy adult subjects.

      The exploratory objectives of the study are to evaluate the comparative PK profile of
      radiprodil from samples collected using 2 alternative microsampling techniques (MITRAâ„¢ and
      Drummond capillary tubes) with that of conventional venous blood samples, and to test the
      perception of the taste and texture of the oral radiprodil suspension.
