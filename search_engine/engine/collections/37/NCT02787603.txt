      not blind. DAHF diagnosis will consider symptoms, physical examination, x ray and other image
      methods and BNP ou NTproBNP levels. Pulmonary infection diagnosis will "Infectious Disease

      with Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Multivariative analysis related to diagnosis, mortality and
      morbidity will be performed by Cox regression model. Sensibility and specificity will be
      calculated by ROC curve. Statistical significancy will be considered when p<0.05.
