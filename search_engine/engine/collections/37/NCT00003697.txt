      with solid tumors. II. Establish a maximum tolerated dose for this drug in these patients.
      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of DMXAA in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of
      this regimen on coagulation parameters, TNF and other cytokine production, nitric oxide, and
      serotonin production in these patients. V. Assess the efficacy of this drug in this patient
      population. VI. Determine the effect of this drug on tumor vasculature by evaluating any
      changes apparent on MRI scans in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive dimethylxanthenone
      acetic acid (DMXAA) IV over 20 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest.
      An additional course of therapy may be administered in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalated doses of DMXAA until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued to each dose level used to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose.
