        1. To assess the relative efficacy of the two procedures in inpatient treatment for PTSD

        2. To assess whether the predominant emotions in the traumatic memories moderate the
           outcome of the different procedures

        3. To assess whether theory-derived constructs mediate outcome and whether the mediating
           relationships are different in the two treatments

        4. To provide a theoretical account of the two models

        5. To psychometrically evaluate 3 new measures
