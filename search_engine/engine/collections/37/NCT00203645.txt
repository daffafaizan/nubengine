      the rise. The costs of problem gambling are enormous.There are social and economic costs, the
      gambler can sometimes lose a significant relationship, job, or commit an illegal activity.
      Pathological gamblers are also at risk for developing a general medical condition related to
      stress. There is a high risk of suicide and problem gamblers also have increased rates of
      mental health disorders. Relatively few people choose to attend formal treatment programs so
      it's important to provide a range of options to make treatment more accessible. The present
      study examines the effectiveness of minimal and brief interventions delivered by the
      telephone.

      Comparison(s): The "Workbook Only Control" condition involves receiving the self-help booklet
      through the mail after a brief telephone assessment. The "Minimal Treatment" condition
      involves receiving the same workbook but also having a motivational enhancement intervention
      by telephone. The "Brief Treatment" condition provides the workbook, motivational
      enhancement, and follow-up support on six occasions spread over 36 weeks. The "Wait List
      Control" condition involves participants being assigned to a six week waiting list.
      Participants are assessed and after a six week waiting period they will have a reassessment
      at which time they will be sent the gambling self-help workbook.
