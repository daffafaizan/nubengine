      in combination with physical rehabilitation.

      The primary outcome data collected will be used to characterize and compare spinal
      sensorimotor activity in muscles below the level of injury during TESS and EES-enabled motor
      tasks in persons with chronic motor complete paralysis of the lower extremities due to
      traumatic SCI. Furthermore, data collected will be used as a proof of concept that TESS can
      be used to determine recovery of function during EES-enabled motor tasks. Following exposure
      to each stimulation intervention, data collection will include changes to spasticity, body
      composition, metabolic variables, and spinal imaging to assess the effect of either TESS or
      EES stimulation.
