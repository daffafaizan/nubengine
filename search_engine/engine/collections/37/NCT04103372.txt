      of early rectal cancer (ERC). This is treated effectively with radical surgery, offering
      excellent oncological outcome, but has a major impact on patient quality of life. The
      diagnosis of early stage rectal cancer, allows an opportunity for effective oncological
      treatment, with preservation of the rectum avoiding the deleterious effects of unselective
      use of radical surgery and unselected use of radiotherapy. Our previous work has led to
      High-Spatial-Resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the established modality for
      providing reliable information about extramural disease prior to radical surgery.

      This trial will use a new MRI staging protocol to identify more patients with early rectal
      cancer to enable accurate mapping for more precise patient selection for local excision.
      Improved success with local excision will result in greater rates of organ preservation.
