    
      To study binding of foliglurax to mGlu4 receptors in human brain, up to 9 healthy subjects
      (Part A) and up to 8 patients with Parkinson's disease (Part B) will be injected with a
      liquid dose of a radiolabelled tracer that allows measurement of foliglurax binding in the
      brain to determine to which degree foliglurax binds to regions of the brain.
