      published. The only phase III study, our VITdAL-ICU study recruited from 2010 to 2012 and
      (n=475) did not find a difference in the primary endpoint "length of hospital stay" between
      placebo and high-dose vitamin D3. However, there was a non-significant absolute risk
      reduction in all-cause hospital mortality in the total population. The difference was larger
      (17.5%) and significant in the predefined subgroup of patients with severe vitamin D
      deficiency at baseline, see Kaplan Meier curve below (n=200, 28.6 vs 46.1%, p=0.01, 0.56
      (0.35-0.90) ), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 6. (51) As this was only a
      secondary endpoint in the predefined subgroup with severe vitamin D deficiency, this finding
      is hypothesis generating and requires further study, leading to this application.

      In our study, we were unable to identify a mechanism by which this benefit was achieved.
      Interestingly, looking at the causes of death, the vitamin D group seemed to benefit in every
      category.

      The VITDALIZE study is a pragmatic, multicenter, placebo-controlled double-blind randomized
      controlled phase III trial in adult critically ill patients which will be conducted in
      academic and non-academic centers. The sponsor is the Medical University of Graz, Austria.

      Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either of the two treatments:

      Vitamin D: oral/enteral pharmacological dose of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)

        -  total dose 900,000

        -  loading dose of 540,0000 (dissolved in 37.5 ml of medium chain triglycerides - MCT)
           followed by 4000 IU daily (10 drops) for the entire active study period (90 days)

      Placebo: identical regime - loading dose of 37.5 ml MCT followed by 10 drops daily

      This study uses a group sequential design, with one interim analysis when 50% of the planned
      enrolled patients in each arm (N=600 per arm) have completed their day 28 assessment by the
      independent data safety monitoring board. The enrollment of patients will continue while the
      interim analyses is performed.
