    
      -  In this randomised, clinical trial with cross-over design, 52 patients with Diabetes
           type 1 and 2 using a 8 or 12 mm needle, are randomised into two groups.

        -  Group I starts using 5 mm needles for insulin administration, after 13 weeks group I
           returns to their previously used 8 or 12 mm needle

        -  Group II continues using their own 8 or 12 mm needle, after 13 weeks group II starts
           using 5 mm needles for insulin administration.

        -  During each visit the HbA1c level is measured and a copy is made of the logbook of the
           patient with the blood glucose measurements.

        -  Insulin doses and number of experienced hypoglycaemic events are registered at each
           visit.

        -  The opinion and experiences of the patients regarding the different needles are obtained
           by using a questionnaire.

        -  Within-group analyses are computed, using the Wilcoxon signed Ranks Test. Between-group
           analyses are computed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
