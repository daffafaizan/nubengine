      perimenopausal middle age women. Neuroendocrine function will be measured by broad assessment
      of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. We will also assess metabolic profiles and
      behavioral and emotional function. We plan to determine correlations between these measures
      and nutritional state. Other measures may include insulin, glucose, leptin, IGF-1,
      triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ghrelin and eating attitudes and physical reactivity.
