      measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC) and standard lung diffusing capacity for carbon
      monoxide (DLCO). However, FVC measurement does not provide an accurate estimate of lung
      restriction and DLCO does not allow separate the alveolar membrane (DMCO) from erythrocyte
      (DeCO) diffusive conductance for CO. Previous studies have shown that DMCO and DeCO may
      change irrespective of overt intersitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH). These changes may be consistent with a limitation of alveolar-capillary
      erythrocyte recruitment which impairs DM.This study was designed to test the hypothesis that,
      irrespective of the degree of ILD and/or PAH, combined DLNO-DLCO measurement might be useful
      to provide a mechanistic interpretation of DM and De changes in SSc.
