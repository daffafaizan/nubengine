      groups: early EPO group (rhEPO from the first week for 9 weeks , n= 74), late rhEPO group
      (rhWEPO from the fourth week for 6 weeks, n=74), or control group (no rhEPO, n= 71). All
      infants received enteral iron (3-9 mg/kg/day) from the first week. The rhEPO ÃŸ dose was 750
      IU/kg/week. Success was defined as no transfusion and hematocrit levels never below 30%.

      The concentrations of trace elements and of antioxidant enzymes were investigated in all
      patients, too. Clinical and nutritional data were recorded prospectively.
