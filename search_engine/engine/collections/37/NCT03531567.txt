      (ADLs) when they enter the chronic phase at 6-months post stroke, and over half have
      hemiparesis that impacts upper extremity motor function. Exercise and activity in the chronic
      phase of stroke are essential in reducing disability, improving balance, increasing mobility,
      and improving overall quality of life. Without regular activity and exercise in the chronic
      phase, survivors are at risk for a developing comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes) and
      experiencing a recurrent stroke. Unfortunately, people with stroke report many barriers to
      exercise, such as fatigue or pain, and lack of motivation and engagement. A promising
      solution may lie in interactive video games and virtual reality (VR), which have been used as
      intervention tools to potentially increase patient engagement and adherence, over the past 15
      years. The investigators have developed an interactive, customized VR system called Mystic
      Isle that has shown to be feasible for general home-based rehabilitation. Mystic Isle
      utilizes portable, low-cost technology (the Microsoft KinectÂ® sensor, Microsoft) and can
      provide a customized program with remote monitoring by an occupational therapist (OT). This
      study will explore the preliminary effect of the game-based home program on adherence to a
      home program in comparison to a control. It will also explore the barriers and facilitators
      to home use of a virtual reality-based intervention.
