    
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of orally administered CB-5339 in
      participants with R/R AML or participants with R/R intermediate- to high-risk MDS. The study
      will include two parts:1) a Dose Escalation phase in participants with R/R AML, or R/R
      intermediate- to high-risk MDS and 2) a Dose Expansion phase in participants with R/R AML for
      whom there is no standard of care therapy available that is likely to lead to disease
      remission. Additional cohorts for participants with R/R intermediate- to high-risk MDS
      following hypomethylating agents or other AML cohorts may be added at a later time.
