      has been amended to include a new "agar-overlay" serum bactericidal assay using human serum
      complement (hSBA). Additional changes include validation of the MenB manual to measure
      immunogenicity of the meningococcal group B vaccine, a modification in the definition of
      4-fold increase in post-vaccination hSBA titer definition when the pre-vaccination titer is
      below the limit of detection, and a modification in the population set to be used for safety
      analysis wherein the exposed set is to be used for all safety analyses.
