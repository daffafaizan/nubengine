      buprenorphine. While effective pain relief can be achieved, women maintained on buprenorphine
      during pregnancy have been shown to require up to 50% more opioids after CD compared to women
      with opioid use disorder not on a maintenance regimen. The perioperative use of gabapentin
      has been shown to reduce pain scores and opioid consumption following a variety of surgeries,
      ranging from cardiac bypass to total abdominal hysterectomy. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether a perioperative course of gabapentin in parturients on buprenorphine
      maintenance would improve analgesia after elective CD.
