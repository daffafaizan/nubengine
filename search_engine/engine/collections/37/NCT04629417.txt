      patients' exercises during their supervised physiotherapy sessions each week using the SPARS
      smart watch. Each patient will wear smart watch on their affected arm only when performing
      prescribed exercises, and the watch will start recording inertial sensor data once the
      patient puts the watch on. The injured worker population will be recruited from referrals
      made to the Sunnybrook Working Condition Program (WCP) at the Holland Centre for a
      work-related shoulder injury. The patient population that is being funded by OHIP, will be
      recruited from referrals Sunnybrook Shoulder and Upper Extremity Program. Data collection
      will be collected at baseline (at time of informed consent), and at each supervised
      physiotherapy session during the course of a patient's treatment. A research assistant will
      be required to attend a minimum of one supervised physiotherapy session for each patient
      every two weeks, and record exercise type and technique, alongside the inertial data
      collection, based on feedback from the treating physiotherapist. Follow-up outcomes such as
      surveys and shoulder testing will be done at 6 weeks, monthly at a maximum of 3 months
      (OHIP-patients) and 5 months (WSIB) patients, final treatment session (if different than
      maximum amount), and 1 year after.
