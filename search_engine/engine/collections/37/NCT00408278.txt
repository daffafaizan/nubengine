    
      Treatment of induction with the simultaneous administration of ATRA (45 mg/m2 day until the
      RC) and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 days 2, 4, 6 and 8), 3 monthly cycles of consolidation with
      ATRA (45 mg/m2 days 1-15) and idarubicine (5 mg/m2 days 1-4) in the cycle #1, mitoxantrone
      (10 mg/m2 days 1-3) in the cycle #2 and idarubicine (12 mg/m2 day 1) in the cycle #3. The
      consolidation was reinforced for the group of patients with intermediate risk by means of an
      increase of the idarubicine to 7 mg in the cycle #1 and to 2 days in the cycle #3. In the
      patients of high risk, the consolidation was reinforced with the addition of altar-c in the
      cycles #1 and #3. For the maintenance treatment, one will administer to intermittent ATRA (15
      days every 3 months) and chemotherapy low doses with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurina during
      two years
