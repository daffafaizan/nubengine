      (prophylactic). Preventive medication is usually given daily for months or years; however,
      treatment may also be given in an intermittent regimen. Most migraine prophylactic
      medications were designed to treat other disorders, and they can be divided into three
      groups:

        1. Serotonergic or monoaminergic agents such as methysergide, which have demonstrated high
           degrees of effectiveness;

        2. Non-serotonergic drugs such as beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, valproate; and

        3. Drugs with lesser demonstrated effectiveness, such as selective serotonin reuptake
           inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      The choice of treatment must be individualized, and is influenced by contraindications,
      potential side effects, the need to treat associated symptoms like tension-type headache and
      insomnia, and drug cost.

      Anticonvulsants, such as valproate, have shown significant degrees of efficacy in migraine
      prophylaxis when used in low doses. Considering the differences in proposed mechanisms of
      action of these agents, it is likely that a novel anticonvulsant such as zonisamide may also
      be an effective prophylactic treatment for migraine.
