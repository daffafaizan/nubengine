      the reduction of symptoms of osteoarthritis. Of the 30 patients participating in this study,
      a blood sample will be taken at the beginning of the study, and then after three months of
      taking the crucumin. To evaluate the response to treatment, after each person sampling, we
      will analyze cell count for Th-1, Th-17, TReg and Ly.B by flowcytomtry method. Also we will
      measure cytokines level of IL-17, CXCL8, CX3CL1 and April by ELISA method. Finally we
      evaluate the gene expression of MicroRNA-720, MicroRNA-155, MicroRNA-146a and MicroRNA-16 by
      Real Time PCR technique.
