      immunocompromised hosts patients. Recent evidence has identified others populations at risk
      for IPA, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and advanced
      cirrhosis patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Moreover, Recently influenza has been
      identified as a new independent risk factor for IPA and IPA was described as an early
      complication of influenza. IPA groups different clinical presentations: the classical
      angio-invasive, the broncho-invasive form and the invasive tracheobronchitis aspergillosis
      form (ITBA).

      ITBA is an infrequent clinical form of IPA with often a fatal outcome, in which Aspergillus
      infection involves entirely or predominantly the tracheobronchial tree. Early diagnosis of
      ITBA is based on bronchoscopy examination. Severe influenza is a life-threatening condition
      where IPA has been repeatedly reported. Little is known on severe influenza infection
      complicated with IPA and still less with ITBA. Current data on ITBA in critically ill
      patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection has only been described in single case
      reports. Because ITBA has been associated with a poorer prognostic than other forms of IPA,
      this retrospective study aimed to analyze diagnostic and prognostic differences between ITBA
      and IPA without tracheobronchial lesions, in critically ill patients with influenza infection
      hospitalized in ICU.
