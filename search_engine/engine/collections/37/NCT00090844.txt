      Primary

        -  Determine the protective effect of chemical ovarian suppression using triptorelin on the
           preservation of ovarian function in premenopausal women with early-stage operable breast
           cancer undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the value of inhibin A and B as alternative markers of premature ovarian
           failure in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (<
      35 years vs 35 to 39 years vs > 39 years); concurrent neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic
      chemotherapy (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [6 courses] OR fluorouracil,
      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [6 courses] vs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC] [4
      courses] vs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC] [4 courses] followed by a taxane [4
      courses]); and hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- AND progesterone receptor
      [PR]-negative vs ER- OR PR-positive).

        -  Arm I: Beginning within 1-4 weeks before the start of chemotherapy, patients receive
           triptorelin intramuscularly once monthly for 4-6 months during neoadjuvant or adjuvant
           systemic chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy only. Quality of
           life is assessed at baseline, monthly during treatment, every 6 months for 2 years, and
           then annually for 3 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 138 patients (69 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 35 months.
