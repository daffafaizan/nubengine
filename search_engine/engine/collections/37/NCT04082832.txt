    
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to CuATSM or placebo for 6 x 28-day cycles (24 weeks) of
      treatment. Study drug is administered orally, once a day in fasted state (before breakfast).
      Assessments for safety (physical examination, vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry
      adverse events) will be conducted at baseline and following each cycle of treatment.
      Assessments for efficacy (Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale [ASLFRS-R] score, and Edinburgh
      Cognitive and Behavioral Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Screen [ECAS] score, and seated slow
      vital capacity [SVC]) will be conducted at baseline and following 2, 4 and 6 cycles of
      treatment. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare efficacy endpoints between
      CuATSM and placebo groups.
