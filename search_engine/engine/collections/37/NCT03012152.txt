      breast unit at Ain Shams University hospitals with breast cancer amid the period from
      September 2012 to May 2013 .

      Every one of them signed an informed consent to partake in this study that was approved in a
      meeting held by the ethical committee on august 2012 at Ain Shams University. All patients
      sharing in the study received closed envelope before surgery in a randomized way in which the
      surgical technique is written either standard conservative surgery or oncoplastic
      surgery(Double Blind).

      Our patients were partitioned into 2 equal groups: group A (35patients) who underwent
      standard conservative surgery, group B (35patients) who underwent oncoplastic surgery.
