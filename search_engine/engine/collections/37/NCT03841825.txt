    
      Orthodontic treatment (i.e. braces) makes it hard to keep good oral hygiene. The purpose of
      this research study is to compare the use of text message reminders versus multiple in-person
      sessions of oral hygiene instructions and motivation on improving oral hygiene measurements.
      Participation in this study will last up to 6 months and will consist of 4 study visits to
      the VCU Orthodontic clinic which are also regular visits for treatment. Measurements to
      assess participant's oral health will be taken during these visits. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups which may include receiving different types of text
      messages, repeated in-person oral hygiene instructions, or both, or neither.
