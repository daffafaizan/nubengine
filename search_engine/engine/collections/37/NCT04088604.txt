      will be administered as monotherapy in participants with solid tumors. The starting dose was
      30 mg/m2 and the subsequent dose was increased according to the protocol of 60 mg/m2, 90
      mg/m2, 120 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, 180mg/m2. Each subject received only one dose of the drug, and
      the next dose group study could only be performed if the previous dose group was completed 21
      days of observation after the first dose and safe tolerance was confirmed. According to the
      subjects' tolerance, appropriate doses will be selected and the safety, PK characteristics
      and initial efficacy of LY01610 were further evaluated in additional 6 - 8 patients. The
      interval between the first dose and the second dose was 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks.Another
      8 subjects were enrolled and given CAMPTOÂ® (180 mg/m2) once every 2 weeks to perform the
      pharmacokinetic profiles.

      The second stage is a dose escalation study of LY01610 combined with 5-Fu. Based on the
      results of the first stage, three doses of low, medium and high doses were selected in
      combination with a fixed dose of 5-Fu to determine the DLT and MTD. Similarly, according to
      the subjects' tolerance, appropriate dose will be selected and the safety, PK characteristics
      and initial efficacy of LY01610 combined with a fixed dose of 5-Fu were further evaluated in
      6 - 8 patients. The drug was administered every 2 weeks.
