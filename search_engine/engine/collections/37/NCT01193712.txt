      defibrillators (ICD) has proven to be a valuable therapy in selected patients with systolic
      heart failure, ameliorating both morbidity and mortality. However, with current selection
      criteria and implant technique, about 20 to 30 % of patients remain non-responders.
      Non-responders might be due to failing selection criteria or methodology in casu
      echocardiography. However, an important number of non-responders may result of sub-optimal
      positioning of the left ventricular lead, remote from the site of delayed activation.
      Endocardial left ventricular stimulation may ameliorate the shortcomings of epicardial
      stimulation. The advantage of an endocardial approach is the absence of phrenic nerve
      stimulation which regularly complicates epicardial pacing, a more predictable pacing
      threshold and much less restriction to position the lead in the area of interest. Transseptal
      left ventricular endocardial pacing has already been used in patients in whom standard
      epicardial pacing was not applicable.
