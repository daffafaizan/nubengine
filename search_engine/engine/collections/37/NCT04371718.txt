      with SOC.This is a new Phase 2 study to find an optimal dose for relevant phase 3 study in
      newly diagnostic AIH patients. All patients will receive prednisolone and AZA as standard of
      care (SOC) during the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive 5 mg JKB-122, 15 mg
      JKB-122, 35 mg JKB-122 or placebo in 1:1:1:1 ratio, adjunct to SOC. This protocol with the
      primary endpoint being biochemical remission and evaluation of 3 different treatment doses.
      The histology will be explored as secondary to test long term benefit and to show similar
      trend with the biomarkers.
