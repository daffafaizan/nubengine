      sedation with benzodiazepine and narcotics.

      There will be two groups both of exposed to music and placebo (headphones without music). The
      study will be simple blind.

      Sedation scale will be followed regularly. Vitals signs and adjustment of sedation will be
      recorded by the nurse on the ward. Blood test will be taken before and after placement of
      headphones in the morning. We will measure IL-6, cortisol, copeptin, prolactin, CRP.

      We will analyse the total reduction dose of sedation and analgesia on a daily basis. We will
      consider a fall of 20% of medication to be significative.
