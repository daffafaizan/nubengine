      NF-PNEN was observed. Various study indicates the safety of a conservative management for
      this lesion and the The European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) proposed a "wait and
      see" approach for small NF-PNEN.

      Indications for surgery include the presence of a localized NF-PNEN in the absence of distant
      metastases as curative resection of these tumors is associated with favourable prognosis
      especially for low grade.

      In the last decade a dramatic increase in diagnosis of small, incidentally discovered,
      NF-PNEN was observed.Moreover, other investigators observed a clear relationship between the
      tumor diameter and low risk of malignancy and systemic progression.

      In particular, a tumor size â‰¤ 2 cm seems to be associated with a negligible risk of disease
      recurrence and with a very low incidence of aggressive features such as lymph node
      involvement.On this basis, the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) proposed a "wait
      and see" approach for small NF-PNEN when incidentally discovered. Since then, various series
      evaluated the safety of a conservative management for small, sporadic, incidentally
      diagnosed, NF-PNEN.

      After a median follow-up of 28-45 months, all the studies confirmed that an intensive
      surveillance for incidental and small NF-PNEN is safe in selected cases.

      Nevertheless, available data are based only on retrospective series with a significant
      heterogeneity of inclusion criteria and different tumor diameter cut-off and the appropriate
      management of this entities (surveillance versus surgery) is still a matter of debate.
