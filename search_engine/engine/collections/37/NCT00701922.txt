      institutional review board of Hannover medical school.

      LTx recipients are screened for CARV infections during the cold season (end October until end
      April) in a single-centre outpatient clinic. Symptoms of upper (URTI) and lower respiratory
      tract infections (URTI) are recorded by questionnaires and findings.

      Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (NOS) were performed to detect RV-antigens by
      immunofluorescence testing (IFT) of respiratory-syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus,
      parainfluenza (PIV), influenza and cultures for CARV are performed. BAL was performed when
      clinically indicated and processed by IFT. Multiplex-PCR to detect 14 CARV are processed in
      symptomatic patients.

      In addition blood samples are monitored at each contact to investigate an association of
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) with the
      development of BOS and to identify risk factors for virus detection in blood.
