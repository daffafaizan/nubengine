      with chronic use in a combination therapeutic used widely for a different disease in Europe
      and Canada. The doses to be studied are human equivalent doses of doses that are active in
      nonhuman primates in inducing high level fetal globin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA),
      protein, and proportions of red blood cells expressing fetal globin protein (F-cells).
      Additive effects are observed with hydroxyurea in sickle cell patients' cells in vitro.

      The study will first evaluate the study therapeutic in male and female patients who are 18
      years and older. After a screening period to obtain baseline medical and laboratory data, the
      study drug will be taken by mouth once per day, every other day. The first dose will be taken
      in a clinical unit, and thereafter will be taken at home for 12 weeks. Laboratory tests,
      physical exams, and tolerability will be assessed 6 times over 4 months, including for one
      month after completion of dosing.

      The cohorts will be enrolled sequentially. Each new cohort will begin after the prior lower
      dose cohort has received 2 weeks of treatment without serious adverse events related to the
      study drug. The dose that increases fetal globin assays to the highest degree will be
      evaluated in a larger group of subjects.Other regimens or test doses may be added as needed
      to identify an active dose and regimen. The study drug is expected to be safe when added to
      most other medications used to treat thalassemia.
