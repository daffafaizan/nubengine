        1. In patients on mechanical ventilation for a non-infectious cause of respiratory failure,
           the tracheal bacterial load should be absent or below the cut-off values defined for
           infection, that is to say tracheal colonization.

        2. In patients without the diagnosis of Ventilator-Adquired Pneumonia (VAP) and not taking
           antibiotics till the weaning process, tracheal bacterial load should remain below the
           predefined cut-off values and the biomarkers (PCT and CRP) should be surrogate markers
           of this clinical course.

        3. In patients developing VAP, an increase in tracheal bacterial load should precede
           diagnosis with an associated rise in the biomarkers levels (PCT and CRP). Finally, after
           institution of antibiotic therapy, adequate therapy should be associated with a decrease
           tracheal bacterial load as well as of the biomarkers (PCT and CRP).

        4. In patients admitted with clinical suspicion of pneumonia, either community-acquired
           (CAP) or hospital-acquired (HAP), with microbiological documentation, after institution
           of antibiotic therapy, adequate therapy should be associated with a decrease tracheal
           bacterial load as well as the biomarkers (PCT and CRP).

        5. In patients admitted with clinical suspicion of a non-pulmonary infection (e.g.
           peritonitis and urosepsis) and on mechanical ventilation for an expected length longer
           than 3 days, either community or hospital-acquired, preferentially with microbiological
           documentation, after institution of antibiotic therapy, adequate therapy should be
           associated with a decrease of biomarkers (PCT and CRP).
