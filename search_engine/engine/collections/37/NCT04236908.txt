      years or older with complaints of acute lower back pain (four weeks or less in duration).
      Subjects will be randomized into one of four study groups receiving either 1) NSAIDs only
      (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed) or 2) acupuncture to include use of GV 26
      with manual tonification (twisting or rotating the needle) plus NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg by
      mouth twice a day as needed) or 3) Battlefield Acupuncture in both ears (which includes the
      points cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega-2, point zero and shen men) plus NSAIDs (naproxen
      500mg by mouth twice a day as needed) or 4) GV26 with manual tonification + Battlefield
      Acupuncture in both ears (which includes the points cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega-2, point
      zero and shen men) plus NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg by mouth twice a day as needed). We seek to
      determine if acupuncture is superior to conservative management alone in treating acute low
      back pain (4 weeks or less in duration).
