      peptide receptor agonists on insulin secretory capacity, will be determined in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.

      Included patients will be randomized to either 12 weeks of endurance exercise training 3
      times a week or therapeutical treatment with semaglutide for 3 months followed by 12 weeks of
      endurance exercise training 3 times a week. Insulin secretory capacity will be determined by
      hyperglycemic clamp method before and after.
