      of ADF is assessed when administered simultaneously with the patient's reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (RTI) regimen. The second phase begins on Day 7 when nelfinavir is added to the
      therapy regimen for an additional 15 weeks. ADF pharmacokinetics are measured on Days 1, 2,
      and 7 (on a subset of 18 patients); peak and trough samples are collected on Day 28.
