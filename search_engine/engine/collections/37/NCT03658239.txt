      pressure (IOP) levels is investigated using a theoretical biomechanical cornea model found
      changes in both conventional refractive error (sphere and cylinder) and irregular astigmatism
      i.e. higher order aberrations (e.g. spherical aberration, trefoil and quadrafoil). This is
      due to the mechanical characteristics of the cornea determined largely by interaction between
      collagen fibrils organization and extrafibrillar matrix material properties. Corneal geometry
      and the material properties are the two main factors that contribute to the changes in
      corneal aberrations with IOP elevation. These aberration changes due to the variation of IOP
      and the material properties of the cornea can be measured routinely with corneal topography
      systems (UR) and Brillouin ocular scanner (MGH), respectively and can guide the investigators
      to study their impact on optical and biomechanical behaviors of the cornea.
