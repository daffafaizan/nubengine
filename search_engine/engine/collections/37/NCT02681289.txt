      compare the effects of an early goal-directed neuromotor physiotherapy (GDNT) application
      between preterm and term at-risk infants. Eighteen at-risk infants between the ages of 0 and
      12 months were assigned to the preterm and term groups according to their gestational and
      corrected age. Each group received GDNT for 45 min, three days per week for 12 weeks. The
      effectiveness of the therapy was measured using Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS),
      Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), and Goal Attainment Scale (GAS).
