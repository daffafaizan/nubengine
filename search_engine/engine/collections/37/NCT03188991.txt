    
      In this open-label, dose rising trial, subjects with mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms
      will receive intracystic NanoPac® via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle injection
      (EUS-FNI).

      In the dose escalation phase, subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac® at
      6, 10, and 15 mg/mL at volumes sufficient to fill the cyst, at least equal to the amount of
      cyst fluid aspirated. Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled
      sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. Following Data Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) review of the cohort data, the next cohort may begin enrolling, an additional three at
      the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does not provide adequate safety and
      tolerability the study may be halted. The dose determined to be the most suitable for further
      evaluation, defined as the highest dose with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile
      (as determined by the DSMB), will be the dose used in the second phase of the study which
      will enroll 9 additional subjects. Subjects enrolled in the second phase of the study will
      also receive a second injection of NanoPac at the same dose 12 weeks after the first NanoPac
      injection..

      Plasma samples will be taken on the day(s) of NanoPac® injection at 1 and 2 hours after
      injection, as well as at each of the subsequent study visits, to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of intracystic NanoPac®.

      Subjects will be followed for 6 months after the first NanoPac® injection for safety,
      tolerability and cyst response to therapy (as shown by imaging). Cyst fluid will also be
      extracted and analyzed for cyst fluid markers.
