    
      In the preoperative period, the following clinical tests will be performed before the patient
      arrives in the operating room and when the patient arrives, the measurements will be made by
      ultrasonography.

        1. Mallampati classification

        2. Determination of mouth opening (interinsizer distance)

        3. Thyromental distance

        4. Sternomental distance

      Preoperative evaluation of the patients and clinical results of the airway tests (mentioned
      above) will be recorded. The cervical soft tissue thickness will be measured and recorded at
      3 levels (thyrohyoid membrane, vocal cord, hyoid bone) with the help of ultrasonography
      (mentioned above). In addition, since all patients will be under general anesthesia,
      laryngoscopic images (laryngoscopic evaluation according to Cormack Lehane classification)
      routinely recorded on the anesthesia follow-up sheet will be recorded.
