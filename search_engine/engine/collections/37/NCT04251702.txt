      transformed to calculated the power density spectrum median frequency have been found
      separately to be associated with labor dystocia and cesarean birth. Both are hypothesized to
      reflect that uterine fatigue plays a role in the pathophysiology of labor dystocia for some
      women.

      This study aims to characterize the relationship between the two measures to better
      understand the role of uterine fatigue in labor dystocia and triangulate biomarkers of
      fatigue that may lead to a better understanding of labor dystocia phenotypes.

      In addition to the primary measures, comparison measures will be collected. For AFL
      comparison, venous whole blood lactate and capillary lactate will be collected and measured
      using both a point-of-care lactate meter (Stat Strip Lactate Meter, Nova Biomedical) and a
      table-top blood gas analyzer (Nova Prime). For EMG comparison, routine contraction monitoring
      data will be collected and compared to the EMG signal. Three visual analog scales on women's
      experiences of fatigue, anxiety, and pain will also be administered.

      Additional data will be collected from the medical record to perform exploratory and
      hypothesis generating analysis.
