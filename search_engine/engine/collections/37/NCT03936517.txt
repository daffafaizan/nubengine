      (AI), who are unable to produce the natural stress hormone, cortisol. The objectives of
      steroid replacement therapy are to replace the body's physiological requirements for cortisol
      without over-replacement and consequent Cushing's syndrome. Equally, under-replacement
      presents the risk of patients experiencing potentially fatal Addisonian crises.

      Appropriately replacing a patient's steroid requirement is a significant challenge.
      Hydrocortisone (HC) is used in the majority of patients with AI in the UK. However, HC has a
      short duration of action, necessitating dosing 3 times a day. Low-dose prednisolone (PR) is
      an alternative to HC which needs only once-daily. There have been no studies directly
      comparing low-dose PR to HC treatment.

      This is a two-arm, two-period, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study comparing the low
      dose PR and standard regimens of HC in the treatment of AI.
