    
      A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial will be undertaken to test the acute effects of
      supplementation of 200 mg, 400 mg gd-TRF vs. placebo. There are 3 occasions for subjects to
      attend during postprandial period and these occasions will be separated by at least one week.
      On the day preceding the postprandial high fat meal challenge, subjects will be asked to
      avoid food high in fat, alcohol, caffeine and taking part in any strenuous exercise. Subjects
      will be provided with a standardised low fat meal (containing < 10 g fat) on the day
      preceding the postprandial study days to consume as their evening meal. They will be asked to
      fast overnight and instructed to avoid eating or drinking anything, except water, after 10
      pm. Fasting blood samples will be collected on the next day and subjects will then consume
      the test meal, containing 50 g test fat supplemented with gd-TRF. Further venous blood
      samples will be collected at regular intervals for up to 6 hours postprandially.
