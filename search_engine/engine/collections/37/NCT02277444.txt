      multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to determine the pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves
      the blood and tissues over time), efficacy (effectiveness) and safety of intravenous
      golimumab in participants with pJIA despite current treatment with methotrexate (MTX). The
      study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (6 weeks); an Open-label Treatment Phase
      (consists of golimumab and MTX treatment for 52 weeks, wherein after Week 28, MTX dose change
      is allowed); Long-term Extension Phase (after Week 52 through Week 252) and Extended
      Treatment Period (after week 252). The maximal study duration for a participant will not
      exceed 832 weeks. All the eligible participants will be administered golimumab IV infusion
      and commercial MTX. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics of
      study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
