    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose of SCH727965 administered as a 4-hour infusion
      every other week in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. (Phase I) II. To determine the
      1-year overall survival of patients with malignant melanoma treated with SCH727965 at the
      dose and schedule derived in the phase 1 part of the study. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile and toxicities of SCH727965 administered as a 4-hour
      infusion every other week.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of SCH727965 administered as a 4-hour infusion every
      other week.

      III. To determine the proportion of patients with malignant melanoma who are alive without
      progression of disease 6 months after beginning treatment with SCH727965 at the dose and
      schedule derived in the phase 1 part of the study.

      IV. To determine the objective response rate to SCH727965 of patients with malignant melanoma
      enrolled to part 2 of the study.

      V. To document cdk2, combined cdk2/1 and cdk9 inhibition in surrogate tissues and tumor.

      VI. To correlate the degree of change of pharmacodynamic parameters in post-treatment
      compared to pre-treatment samples with clinical outcome.

      VII. To correlate the degree of change of parameters defining cdk2, cdk2/1 and cdk9
      inhibition with pharmacokinetic parameters.

      VIII. To correlate pre-treatment cdk2 levels with the degree of change of parameters
      measuring cdk2 inhibition.

      IX. To correlate pre-treatment cdk2 levels with clinical outcome. X. To correlate tumor p53
      status with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive dinaciclib IV over 4 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.
