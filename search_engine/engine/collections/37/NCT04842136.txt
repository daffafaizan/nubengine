      January and December 2020.

      The case-control study included patients diagnosed with myofascial TMD by dental
      practitioners at regional hospitals referred for physiotherapy. Total of 200 myofascial TMD
      patients, comprising 91 identified as SB and 109 as non-SB were included in the study.

      The Jaw Function Limitations Scale (JFLS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) scales
      and indexes were used for both groups.

      The effect of Sleep Bruxism (SB) on jaw function, neck problems, sleep quality, fatigue, and
      tension headache were evaluated.

      The interactions of these factors and the importance of taking SB into consideration when
      evaluating and treating patients with TMD were examined.
