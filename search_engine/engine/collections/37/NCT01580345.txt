      women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400 mg/d
      algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible participants
      would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline measures would be
      taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. This study would assess the
      effect of maternal DHA supplementation on:

        1. New born anthropometry (birth weight, length and head circumference)

        2. New born APGAR score
