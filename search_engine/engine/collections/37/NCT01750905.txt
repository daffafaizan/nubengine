    
      This study is a double blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial of the safety and neurohumoral
      activity of CD-NP, in the treatment of heart failure with LVAD support. Subjects more than 3
      months after LVAD implantation will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments lists
      and interested qualified subjects will be either confronted at a visit or sent a letter in
      the mail to be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been
      obtained, baseline values will be established at day 1 and subjects will be given
      subcutaneous injection of placebo or CD-NP and stay overnight on two different visits in the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Participant's will receive both placebo and the CD-NP during
      the study, one per visit. A final follow-up visit for clinical assessment will be conducted
      over the phone at the end of the study.

      Potential subjects who present to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota for follow up clinical
      visit after LVAD implantation will be identified by the study coordinator. A $300
      remuneration per subject will be involved to compensate for the inconvenience to the subject.
      A $500 reimbursement of gas mileage will be provided for those who travel.
