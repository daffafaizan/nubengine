      strongest predictor of a chief reason for hospital readmission with fatigue, are the primary
      reasons for modification in function leading to decreased physical activity (PA). Dyspnea and
      fatigue lead to activity avoidance, subsequent muscle de-conditioning, and further increases
      of dyspnea at even lower levels of activity. Depression, because of its moderate relationship
      both with perceived functional status and dyspnea, can further diminish PA and increase
      disability in activities of daily living (ADLs). Strategies to minimize or mitigate dyspnea
      and to boost motivation are imperative for improving adherence to PA, and, in turn, improving
      fatigue, muscle weakness, PA itself, functional status, disability, and depression in HF
      patients. Thus, diaphragmatic breathing retraining (DBR) or deep breathing with a slow
      breathing pattern, a focus on decreasing dyspnea, and mediated by Self-efficacy for DBR and
      informal caregiver support during the DBR provide an innovative approach to positively impact
      the spiraling effects of HF. The purpose of this pilot/feasibility study is to evaluate a
      diaphragmatic breathing retraining (DBR) intervention that incorporates informal caregiver
      coaching to improve the primary outcomes of dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle weakness, and the
      secondary outcomes of PA, functional status, depression, disability, and depression.
