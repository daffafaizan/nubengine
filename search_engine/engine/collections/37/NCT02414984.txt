      research study), non-interventional, prospective cohort study that will enroll participants
      with RA in Colombia, for whom the treating physician has decided to treat with golimumab
      prior to enrolment. All participants will be observed for adherence to golimumab treatment
      for 24 months from study start (Week 0), and recommended follow up assessments will be every
      3 months. Any changes including addition of new medications or dose modifications of existing
      medications will be entirely according to the treating physician's judgment. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
