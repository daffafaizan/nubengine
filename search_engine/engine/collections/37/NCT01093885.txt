    
      This is an open label, single center study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      ambrisentan and antifibrotic agent combination in systemic sclerosis. Up to twenty patients
      will be recruited within the next year who have early diffuse systemic sclerosis and are
      presently receiving treatment with any of the following antifibrotic agents - cellcept,
      colchicine, azathioprine, D-penicillamine, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. Ambrisentan will
      be added to the present agent and then followed for 12 months.

      Patients, male or female, > 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of systemic sclerosis
      fulfilling the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (formerly the American
      Rheumatism Association) classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (24), and diffuse
      cutaneous involvement based on the criteria of LeRoy et al

      A thorough baseline evaluation will determine the extent and severity of systemic sclerosis
      in the individual patients using laboratory studies and the clinical evaluation. Monthly
      follow-ups will capture any safety issues related to the combination therapy based again on
      laboratory studies and clinical evaluation. At the six month and twelve month follow-up a
      thorough evaluation will again be undertaken to evaluate the extent and severity of the
      disorder. Event driven follow-ups will also take place to record and establish any safety
      issues that may arise. Clinical end-points will be the focus of this study.

      Dosing of ambrisentan will begin at 5mg daily for the first month. Half the patients will
      remain at 5mg daily, while the remaining patients will be increased to a maintenance dose of
      10mg daily on the fourth week. Subjects will continue their present dose and schedule of
      disease modifying/antifibrotic medication for the duration of the study.
