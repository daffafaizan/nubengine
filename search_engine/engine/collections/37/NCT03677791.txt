    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual 360째 counselling
      environment in the anxiety and adherence to treatment of the patients coming to CCTA
      (coronary computed tomography angiography).

      The virtual, 360째 environment 'Virtual 360째-tour in coronary computed tomography' uses 360째-
      technology based on spherical panorama images and resembles the spaces of the hospital
      according to the patient's pathway in CT-examination and provides information to the patient
      at various stages of the pathway. Patients who have referred first time to the coronary
      computed tomography can access the virtual CT examination environment via link before
      entering the hospital. Using the environment requires a network connection and is possible
      with a computer, tablet or phone. The environment has digital counselling materials in text,
      image, animation and video formats in three different virtual spaces/views, the environment
      and examination are presented via pathway of example 59-year female patient with arterial
      hypertension and exercise related chest pain (angina pectoris).
