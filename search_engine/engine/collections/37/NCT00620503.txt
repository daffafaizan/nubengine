    
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, outpatient, unblinded, single-dose,
      three-way crossover study of the safety and PK properties of Proellex® in women ages 18 - 34
      years. Twelve female subjects will each receive a single dose of Proellex®: 25 mg (fed state,
      formulation A), 25 mg (fed state, formulation B), and 25 mg (fasting state, formulation B);
      successive dosing will be separated by at least one week intervals from the previous dosing.
      Blood will be collected prior to taking the dose, and following the dose for 24 hours
      post-dose. Subjects will be discharged from the study after the last blood sample is obtained
      after the third dose of Proellex®. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
