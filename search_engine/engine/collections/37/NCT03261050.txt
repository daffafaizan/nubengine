      rarely receive evidence-based treatments because they are very intensive and costly, few
      clinicians deliver them, and they differ for the various EDs. These factors have hindered
      broad implementation of evidence-based treatments, implying that a brief frontline outpatient
      treatment for a range of EDs that could be easily, cheaply, and widely implemented would
      address a major public health problem. There is also limited experimental evidence regarding
      factors that maintain EDs and mechanisms of action for ED treatments. The investigators
      propose to conduct a project that translates basic persuasion research into clinical
      hypotheses and a novel treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that EDs are maintained by (1) excessive valuation of the thin
      beauty ideal, which prompts caloric restriction and other unhealthy weight control behaviors
      (vomiting, laxative use, excessive exercise) that increase binge eating risk, and (2)
      excessive valuation of high-calorie foods, which maintains binge eating. The investigators
      propose to evaluate a treatment that addresses these hypothesized maintenance processes. Two
      pilot trials evaluated a novel 8-session group dissonance-based treatment (Counter
      Attitudinal Therapy; CAT) wherein women with any ED appropriate for outpatient care completed
      activities in which they collectively discuss costs of pursuing the thin ideal and the ED
      behaviors in which they personally engage (unhealthy weight control behaviors and binge
      eating), which putatively creates dissonance about engaging in those particular behaviors
      that reduce valuation of the thin ideal and high-calorie binge foods.

      During the COVID-19 shelter-at-home orders taking place at both research sites, the
      investigators will not measure in-person only outcomes including fMRI, ECG, computerized
      implicit associated tests, and height and weight measurements for all participants that have
      assessments during this order. The investigators will continue to conduct treatment groups
      that will be administered on a virtual platform.
