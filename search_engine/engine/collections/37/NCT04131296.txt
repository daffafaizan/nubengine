      year both in Europe and in the US. Despite the use of neuraminidase inhibitors, its treatment
      is mostly based on symptomatic care. As lung microbiota is correlated with lung inflammation
      in numerous chronic respiratory diseases, we hypothesize that lung microbiota would be
      correlated with influenza outcomes. In a pilot study, we found that lung bacteriobiota but
      not mycobiota is associated with influenza ICU mortality. We therefore aim to confirm this
      correlation between lung bacteriobiota and influenza mortality.
