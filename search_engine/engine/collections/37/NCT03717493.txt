      development and maintenance of binge eating disorder (BED). Thus, we aim to clarify whether
      BED symptoms can be reduced with the help of a training of general affect regulation skills.
      For this purpose, we randomly allocated N = 99 individuals meeting criteria for BED either to
      an affect regulation training (ART) or to a wait list control condition (WLC). Primary
      outcome is the reduction of binges during the treatment-vs.-waiting period as assessed with
      the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview. Secondary outcomes include BED symptom
      severity at follow-up and change in emotion regulation skills. To clarify whether potential
      differences between groups regarding change in binge eating result from a greater increase of
      affect regulation skills in ART, we will test whether potential group differences regarding
      binges will be mediated by differences between groups regarding change in affect regulation
      skills.

      Change of randomization procedure: Over the course of the study, serious difficulties
      occurred with regard to recruiting participants as quickly as necessary to avoid drop-outs
      due to participants' unwillingness to wait until eight individuals were recruited for
      randomization. To solve the problem, we switched from the original block randomization to a
      procedure in which the next patient eligible for the study was allocated to the treatment
      condition until the minimum group size of four was reached.
