      40 Gy/15 fractions, 2.67 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly. The primary endpoint is late
      radiation morbidity; secondly, we want to investigate the frequency of local recurrences, and
      try to establish a genetic risk profile for development of late radiation morbidity.

      The hypothesis is that women operated with breast conserving strategy for early breast cancer
      can be offered moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy without developing more late
      radiation morbidity compared to standard fractionated radiotherapy.
