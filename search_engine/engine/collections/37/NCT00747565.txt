      DIOL-104-TCNS. The study protocols were almost identical with the exception that no control
      subjects were enrolled in the expansion study; only additional multifocal subjects. All
      eligibility criteria and testing conducted in the expansion study was the same as that in the
      original study. The hypotheses were that best corrected distance visual acuity of the ZM900
      lens would meet or exceed the FDA grid values, complication and adverse event rates of the
      ZM900 would be similar to the FDA grid rates for posterior chamber IOLs, and near visual
      acuity of the ZM900 lens would be improved compared to that of the monofocal control lens.
