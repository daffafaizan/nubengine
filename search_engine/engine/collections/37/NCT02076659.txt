      with standard-dose of MTX in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and to determine the
      recommended dose of F8IL10 when combined with MTX.

      As soon as the MTD/RD is determined, an additional 12 patients will be randomized (6+6)
      between F8IL10 (RD) and placebo to further investigate the safety and pharmacacodynamics
      profile of the study treatment.

      Methotrexate (MTX) will be administered as concomitant medication in the dose escalation as
      well as in the randomized part of the study.
