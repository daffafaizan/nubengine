    
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      anti-tumor effect of NT-I7 (rhIL-7-hyFc) in combination with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A,
      anti-PD-L1) in patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 naïve or relapsed/refractory high-risk skin
      cancers including cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC), Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) and
      melanoma.

      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, including the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), of NT-I7 in combination with
      atezolizumab.

      There are two phases to this study:

        -  Phase 1b, a NT-I7 dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD or RP2D

        -  Phase 2a, a non-randomized parallel dose expansion phase to confirm the MTD or RP2D in
           both arms.

      Arm I: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (checkpoint inhibitors, CPI) naïve patients with cSCC and MCC

      Arm II: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 relapsed/refractory patients with cSCC, MCC and melanoma

      Number of Patients A total of up to 84 patients will be enrolled; Up to 24 patients will be
      enrolled in the Phase 1b (up to 6 patients per dose level, using 3 + 3 design), and 60
      patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2a (24 patients in Arm I, i.e., 12 patients for each
      indication, and 36 in Arm II, i.e., 12 patients for each indication).
