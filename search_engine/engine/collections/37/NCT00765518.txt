      with 550,000 new diagnoses made each year. Heart failure is the leading cause of
      hospitalization in persons over 65 years of age with cost exceeding $29 billion annually.
      Prognosis is very poor once a patient has been hospitalized with heart failure. The mortality
      risk after heart failure hospitalization is 11.3% at 30 days, 33.1% at 1 year and well over
      50% within 5 years (Hunt SA; et al., 2005). These numbers emphasize the need to develop and
      implement more effective treatments to manage heart failure.

      This study is targeting a subset of heart failure patient population, namely those diagnosed
      with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines dilated
      cardiomyopathy as a cardiac condition wherein a ventricular chamber exhibits increased
      diastolic and systolic volume and a low (<40%) ejection fraction. DCM is reported to affect
      108,000 to 150,000 patients in the U.S.

      This study is a prospective, stratified, randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center
      study to assess the safety profile and efficacy of CRCs in treating patients with DCM. It
      will enroll a total of 40 patients at 5 sites in the U.S.
