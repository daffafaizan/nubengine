    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the mutation rates of HRAS and PIK3CA in patients with head and neck
           squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who were treated with cisplatin/placebo and
           cisplatin/cetuximab on protocol ECOG-E5397.

        -  To determine the association between HRAS or PIK3CA mutation status and clinical
           benefits (i.e., response, progression-free survival, and overall survival) in patients
           treated with cisplatin/cetuximab compared with those receiving cisplatin/placebo on
           protocol ECOG-E5397.

      OUTLINE: DNA is isolated from one unstained slide per patient. The mutations in HRAS and
      PIK3CA are determined using BEAMING technology.
