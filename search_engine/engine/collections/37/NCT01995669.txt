      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide plus obinutuzumab in
      relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety of lenalidomide
      in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma.
      (Phase II) III. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination in patients
      with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate, time to progression (TTP), and progression free
      survival in patients with indolent lymphoma following treatment with obinutuzumab +
      lenalidomide.

      II. To evaluate changes in immune effector cells and the tumor microenvironment following
      treatment with obinutuzumab + lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-22 and obinutuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 4-5 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of each
      subsequent cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not experiencing progression and who
      in the opinion of treating physician are deriving benefit from combination treatment may
      continue lenalidomide for an additional 6 cycles (up to cycle 12) and obinutuzumab on day 1
      every 2 months for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.
