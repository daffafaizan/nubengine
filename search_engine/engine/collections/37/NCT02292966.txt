      metabolite concentrations in the frontal white matter and the basal ganglia in people with
      chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, through a comparison of baseline and post-treatment
      parameters.

      This is an open label single arm multi-centre study. All participants will each receive
      daclatasvir (30mg), asunaprevir (200mg) and beclabuvir (75mg) in a fixed-dose combination
      oral tablet for twice daily administration with food.

      Duration of treatment will be 12 weeks for all subjects followed by 24 weeks of observational
      follow-up.
