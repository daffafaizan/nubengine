      75.1%. The source of neck pain is often considered - although there is no strong evidence -
      the cervical intervertebral disc. Radiological imaging methods are used for the detection of
      degeneration of the discs and the end plaque changes in the vertebral body corresponding to
      this degeneration.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gives information about the structure of
      intervertebral disc, width of spinal canal and tissues outside the canal. However, there is
      no standardization in the identification and evaluation of radiological images, and
      interobserver variability is high. Studies have been initiated on automated systems that
      analyze MRI images to increase the accuracy and consistency of reporting procedures.
      Examining MRI images with deep learning can lead to the production of systems that help
      clinical decision making and also allows the evaluation of large data in a short time.
