      placebo-controlled trials with 393 participants proved corticosteroid injection to be
      effective in symptom relief. However, all injections were palpation-guided. Therefore, the
      exact injection site was uncertain. Although three studies comparing palpation and ultrasound
      (US) guided CTS injection showed US superiority, the optimal injection site for the injectate
      delivery remains unclear. Some authors believe in thinning of the flexor tenosynovium as the
      mechanism of the median nerve decompression, and therefore recommend injection between the
      tendons, away from the nerve. Other authors stress the importance of hydrodissection and
      direct contact of the injectate with the nerve and suggest injection targeting the median
      nerve. According to our best knowledge, no study comparing different injection sites for a
      corticosteroid delivery in CTS has been published in English written literature. The
      objective of this study was to determine the optimal target site for the corticosteroid
      delivery in CTS injection.
