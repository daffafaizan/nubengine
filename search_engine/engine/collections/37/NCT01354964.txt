      of developing Type 2 Diabetes. The investigators will administer vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
      to non-diabetic, insulin resistant subjects with vitamin D deficiency (total vitamin D levels
      <20 ng/ml) to increase the level of vitamin D3. The investigators will study the effects of
      increased Vitamin D on insulin action, adipose tissue inflammation, and on certain cells and
      processes in fat tissue.

      Investigators will study participants with a procedure called a "pancreatic clamp" study.
      During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas
      that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter,
      and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar
      levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in the body and are related to
      glucose metabolism. Adipose tissue inflammation will be measured using the following
      inflammatory markers: IL-6, PAI-1, TNF-alpha, and iNOS.
