      at the moment to place the epidural: epidural or combined spinal epidural (CSE). CSE has been
      shown to work faster and provide better pain relief than epidural alone. The investigators
      aim to show that CSE also requires less medication over the course of labour as this may mean
      it has fewer side effects. The amount of medication needed during labour between the two
      different techniques given in a standardized way will be compared.
