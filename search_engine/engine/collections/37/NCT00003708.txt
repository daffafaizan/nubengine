      toxicity of temozolomide in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Characterize the
      single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of temozolomide following oral administration in
      these patients. III. Determine antitumor activity of temozolomide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of temozolomide. The
      maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during courses 1 or 2, with at least 2 patients
      experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
