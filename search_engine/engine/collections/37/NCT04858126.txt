    
      This Study will compare the accuracy of the ECOM Plus Endotracheal Cardiac Output Monitor
      (ECOM) without the use of the arterial pressure waveform from the arterial line to 1) the
      current clinical standard of cardiac output measured by intermittent room temperature bolus
      thermodilution using a PAC, 2) the current ECOM System with the use of the arterial blood
      pressure waveform from a radial arterial line and 3) the Flo-TracÂ® System (Edwards
      LifeSciences).
