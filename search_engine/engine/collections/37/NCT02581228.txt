    
      The aim of this project is to develop a technology application (termed ML-PrediCare), which
      is meant to be a predictive stand-alone software device, to support clinicians'
      decision-making, by predicting the individual patient's response to immunotherapy treatments,
      e.g., in terms of time-to-progression (TTP).

      In Stage I of the study, data will be collected for establishing a training set and assess
      the predictive potential of the modelling technology for the response of melanoma patients to
      immunotherapy. In Stage II of the study, data will be collected in order to establish a
      validation set and test the predictive power of the modelling technology in an independent
      set of patients diagnosed with melanoma.
