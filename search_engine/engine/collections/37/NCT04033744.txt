    
      Eighteen young patients with bilateral impacted mandibular third molars will be selected. All
      36 cases of impactions will be selected for a split mouth study and randomly treated by using
      2 different therapeutic approaches, thereby yielding 2 different study groups, each of which
      is composed of 18 cases: in one side the post-extraction socket is left healing
      spontaneously, on the other side the socket is filled with PRF.

      CAL at the distal surface of the lower second molar is chosen as primary outcome.

      Criteria will be the presence of a pocket distal to the mandibular second molar with a
      probing depth >7 mm and a probing clinical attachment level >6mm.

      This study was designed as a single-blind research since subjects will be unaware of their
      treatment allocation. A software will be used to produce a random sequence of 18 integer
      numbers without duplicates generated from atmospheric noise and concealed in closed envelopes
      by one of the investigators. At the time of the patient's first surgery, the envelope will be
      opened and patient allocated either to group 1 (PRF on the right side, spontaneous healing on
      the left side), for allocation numbers 1-9, or group 2 (spontaneous healing on the right
      side, PRF on the left side), for allocation numbers 10-18.

      One clinician, not involved in patient treatment and not aware of what therapeutic approach
      used for the different sites of treatment, will perform all clinical measurements (PD, CAL,
      gingival recession, plaque index and gingival bleeding index) before and after 12 and 18
      weeks of surgery.

      Clinical and radiographical measurements will be recorded at 12 and 18 weeks after the
      surgery. The Student t test will be used to compare the differences between the 2 groups.
