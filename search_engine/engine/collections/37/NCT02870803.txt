      Clinic and Ocular Oftalmologia clinics and will be aware of all stages of the research,
      formalizing the approval of their participation by informed consent term. The tests will be
      performed after pupillary dilation with 2 eye drops of tropicamide 1% (Mydriacyl, Alcon
      Laboratories), in Cirrus 5000 HD-OCT devices (Carl Zeiss Meditec - Dublin USA). Image
      acquisition protocols Optic Disc Cube 200x200 and 512x128 Macular Cube will be used, with
      analysis by RNFL protocols and NGO Analysis Report and Macular Cube Analysis Report,
      respectively. Subjective analysis of the examinations will be performed by the three authors
      of this project independently and then compared between them.
