      Spectrometry (AMS, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) in plasma and urine collected over
      48 hours following oral doses of 25, 50, 100 or 250 ng (2.7-27 nCi). Metabolite profiles and
      kinetics of elimination over this dose range are predicted to be consistent with a BaP
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed by Pacific Northwest National
      Laboratory (PNNL). A non-smoker, not exposed occupationally, receives 270-700 ng of BaP
      daily; about 95% dietary. The WHO has set an estimated safe daily lifetime (70 year/70 Kg
      individual, cancer endpoint) exposure to BaP of 42-350 ng. This protocol represents de
      minimus risk.
