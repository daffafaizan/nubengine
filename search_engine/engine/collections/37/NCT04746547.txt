    
      This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised, prospective study evaluating the
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of twice-daily dose DTG administered during concurrent RIF
      treatment and assessing safety and tolerance in HIV-TB co-infected children weighing 20 to 35
      kg.

      DTG will be administered as a twice-daily dose 50mg tablet formulation both before starting
      and after completion of the standard six-month RIF-based anti-TB treatment. The NRTI
      background and anti-TB drugs will be prescribed following the national weight band dosing
      guidelines.

      Those initially diagnosed with TB are likely to be sicker, and the recommendation is to start
      anti-TB treatment first and follow with ART two weeks later.
