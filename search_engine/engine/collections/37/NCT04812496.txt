    
      All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 30, 2020 at the "Hospital
      Nacional Carlos Alberto Seguín Escobedo (CASE)-EsSalud" (Arequipa, Peru) with a PCR-confirmed
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 will be included.

      The primary outcomes to be compared will be mortality, the need for admission to the
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and / or Mechanical Ventilation, and LOS (length of stay) in both
      groups.

      Furthermore, demographic factors, risk factors, vital / respiratory functions, and laboratory
      results of both groups will be compared. The tests closest to the time of admission to the
      hospital will be taken into consideration.

      Statistical Analysis: quantitative variables will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation,
      qualitative variables will be expressed as percentages (%). In the univariate analysis, the
      Student's t test will be used for the means and the chi2 test for nominal or ordinal
      variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be evaluated 30 days after admission to the
      hospital to assess mortality. The multivariate analysis of the variables that result
      significant in the univariate analysis will be carried out by the Cox regression model in the
      evaluation of mortality; the multivariate linear regression model for the evaluation of the
      stay and the "log rank" model for the evaluation of admission to the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) or the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). In addition, models will be developed to
      estimate the effects of TDF treatment by regression adjustment for the primary outcomes of
      this observational study: hospital stay, need for ICU (intensive care unit) and / or MV
      (mechanical ventilation) and mortality. The Stata® software version 14 will be used and p
      <o.o5 will be considered significant.
