    
      Fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic widespread pain condition with an unknown pathogenesis and no
      known cure, affects 2 to 4 million persons in the adult US population. One of the most common
      conditions seen in rheumatology clinics world wide, including the US, Mexico, and Spain, FM
      is accompanied by various co-occurring symptoms such as fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness
      and depression. While studies of fibromyalgia in Hispanics have been reported in Spain,
      Brazil and Argentina, very few such studies have been reported in the United States. This gap
      exists despite data indicating that there are a reported 16 million Hispanics with rheumatic
      diseases in the US and that Hispanics (self-identified) form the fastest growing minority
      group in this country.
