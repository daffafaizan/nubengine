      etiology. Actually, that evaluation is based on histologic score of Banff FI/AT (0 to III).
      It is obtained thanks to punction-biopsy, which is invasive and can lead complications. This
      exam is systematic on M3 of the transplantation.

      Tissue's fibrosis is a proliferation of extracellular matrix, leading to an increase of
      fibrosed tissue rigidity.

      Elastography is an ultrasound technique allowing evaluation of tissues' rigidity.

      The purpose is the validation of elastograhpy, innovative and non -invasive technique, and
      more specifically Shear Wave Elastography (SWE). For this, strain ratio (SR) could improve
      intra-operator variability and estimate fibrosis' degree of kidney's graft.
