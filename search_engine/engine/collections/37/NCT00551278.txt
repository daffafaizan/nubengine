      positive predictive value of the GeneSearchâ„¢ BLN Assay in patient samples by comparing its
      performance to that of the current methods -- permanent section Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
      staining with IHC. Additional marker testing using probes associated with nodal metastases
      may be used in the assay performance calculations. The observed performance measures will be
      compared to those obtained in the larger U.S. registration trial to show that there are no
      differences in the assay's performance.
