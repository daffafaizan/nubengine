    
      A prospective multi-center study to establish the clinical utility of the measurement of
      monocyte volume width distribution, a cell population parameter of the CBC-Differential, on
      the Beckman Coulter Unicel DxH analyzers. The study will validate the cut-off for the early
      detection of sepsis in an adult emergency room population where the standard of care included
      a CBC with Differential and will evaluate the diagnostic performance of the parameter.
