        -  Determine the antitumor effects of erlotinib and docetaxel, in terms of objective
           response, stabilization of disease, and progression-free survival, in patients with
           stage IV or recurrent breast cancer.

        -  Determine time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare time to tumor progression in patients who achieve disease stabilization or
           response after treatment with this regimen and continue to receive erlotinib versus
           patients who do not receive additional erlotinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 3 weeks and oral erlotinib
      once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving maximal tumor
      response or stabilization of disease after 6 courses may continue to receive erlotinib alone
      until disease progression.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months.
