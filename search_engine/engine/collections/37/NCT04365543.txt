      auditory triggers. Negative affective states, including significant distress and avoidance
      are characteristic of misophonia. These negative emotional responses to trigger sounds, which
      result in behavioral problems and impairment, may be the primary targets for effective
      psychosocial intervention for misophonia. Transdiagnostic treatment approaches address
      clinically-significant distress through the use of evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral
      techniques (e.g., mindful awareness, problem-solving, and opposite action strategies) that
      allow for flexible and personalized treatment of core dysfunctions that cut across emotional
      disorders and lead to on-going impairment. This type of evidence-based, transdiagnostic
      approach includes skills applicable for problems observed frequently in misophonia including
      adaptability, problem solving, emotional (arousal) dysregulation and poor distress tolerance.
      The hypothesized mechanism of change of these core-dysfunction focused treatments is
      increased tolerance of distress in response to strong or intense emotion states. A secondary
      target is the reduction of maladaptive emotional behaviors (e.g., avoidance, aggression,
      escape) that may reinforce distress over time. To that end, this proposal aims to evaluate
      the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic
      Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) for youth with
      misophonia. We will compare UP-C/A in a 2:1 ratio against a comparison condition (PRT:
      psychoeducation plus relaxation training), a behavioral approach that represents usual
      treatment in the community and has been utilized in clinical trials (35% response rate).
