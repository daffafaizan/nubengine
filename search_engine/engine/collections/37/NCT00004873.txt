        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TCF)
           versus docetaxel and cisplatin (TC) versus epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (ECF)
           in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.

        -  Compare the time to treatment failure, time to progression, and survival in this patient
           population treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life during the treatment period and after failure in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, performance status (0 vs 1), and liver involvement (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of three treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV bolus and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 plus
           fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day
           1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel and cisplatin as in arm II and fluorouracil as in
           arm I.

      Treatment regimen is repeated every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before randomization; at day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6; and one
      month after treatment failure.

      Patients with complete response or partial response are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 111 patients will be accrued for this study.
