      and the cardioselective β-blocker metoprolol succinate on aortic blood pressure and left
      ventricular wall thickness. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study in 80 hypertensive
      patients. Patients received either nebivolol 5 mg or metoprolol succinate 50-100 mg daily for
      one year. Their heart rate, central and brachial blood pressure, mean arterial pressure,
      augmentation index, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and left ventricular wall thickness
      were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.
