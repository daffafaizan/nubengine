      symptoms, such as constipation. OMM has been shown to improve constipation symptoms in
      non-diseased subjects and cerebral palsy subjects. Constipation will be measured before,
      during, and after treatment by a constipation scoring system (Cleveland Criteria) to measure
      the severity of constipation and by the Bristol Stool Scale to measure colonic transit time.
      The study subjects' assessment of their constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) and quality of life
      (PAC-QOL) will also be measured throughout the study.

      Studies have also shown that there is a difference in the gut and oral bacterial flora of
      constipated versus healthy adults, so subjects will be given the option to provide weekly
      stool samples for analysis to track bacterial colonies and to observe for any flora changes
      over the study period. This will provide data to determine if bacterial colonies in stool are
      altered by OMM.

      The study will require ten weekly on-site visits over the course of eleven weeks. For the
      first half of the study, surveys and optional stool tests will be performed without OMM
      treatment for four weeks to obtain baseline data. For the second half of the study, all
      subjects will receive OMM for four weeks along with surveys and optional stool microbial
      tests to obtain the experimental data.
