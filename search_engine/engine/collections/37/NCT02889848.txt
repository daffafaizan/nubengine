      number of diseases for which there is an accumulation of collagen.

      It is possible that lysis of collagen may reduce the collagen content of fibroids thus
      decreasing the size of fibroids, and possibly reducing the stiffness of fibroids. This may
      result in reducing the symptoms of pain and bleeding associated with fibroids.

      In this study three subjects will be injected with saline only followed immediately by
      hysterectomy in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method.

      Twelve subjects will receive a single injection of study drug as follows: three subjects will
      receive a set dose of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 24-96 hours
      later (Group 1) to evaluate safety of the injection of study drug. Nine subjects will then
      receive increasing doses of collagenase enzyme followed by hysterectomy or myomectomy 60-90
      days later (Group 2).
