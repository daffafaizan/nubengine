      glycaemia. Insufficient metabolic control (HbA1c > 8 %) leads to micro and macro- vascular
      complications. Especially in adolescence a lack of compliance leads to deteriorated metabolic
      control. Motivational factors play a pivotal role in this age-group, however they have
      neither been studied so far nor considered in interventions with diabetes patients.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate in a multi-centred randomized controlled
      trial the effectiveness of diabetes management training with the method of Motivational
      Interviewing with elements of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and E-mail support.

      Sixty adolescents within the age group of 13-20 years and HbA1c levels > 8 % will - after a
      refresher course in diabetes education - be involved to 2-weekly individual interventions
      sessions including motivational interviewing and CBT-modules with a psychologist and weekly
      e-mail support for a period of six month in order to improve HbA1c levels, self- efficacy in
      diabetes management and general quality of life.

      As control group sixty adolescents within the age group of 13-20 years and HbA1c levels > 8
      will - after a refresher course in diabetes education - get treatment as usual, including
      routine medical support visits, unspecific psychological consultations and unspecific e-mail
      support to match with the intervention group for time bonus.

      We assess motivational changes and effects on metabolic control (HbA1c) and define the
      predictors of positive effects on glycaemic control.
