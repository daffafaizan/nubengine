      for clinical effectiveness of vancomycin. However, the 2009 consensus guideline for
      vancomycin therapeutic monitoring continued to recommend trough serum concentration
      monitoring in the clinical setting. In 2011, Patel et al showed that highly difference
      between AUC(72-96h) and Cmin(96h). Different dosing and creatinine clearance may reach the
      same trough drug level with different AUC. The investigators wonder whether trough drug level
      can serve as a substitute marker for AUC and as a parameter for vancomycin therapeutic
      monitoring.

      In this study, the investigators will calculate AUC/MIC of vancomycin with published formula,
      analyze its correlation with patient's clinical outcome and compare that with trough drug
      level.
