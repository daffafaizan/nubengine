      mortality rate. Professional organizations provide conflicting recommendations regarding
      prostate cancer testing but generally agree that men learn about the risks and benefits of
      testing and share in decisions about testing based on their personal preferences. This study
      was designed to assess the effects of a decision support intervention on men's knowledge
      about prostate cancer testing, participation in medical decisions about testing, decision
      conflict related to testing, and the congruence between prostate cancer testing intentions
      and behaviors. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomized into
      one of two conditions: (a) tailored telephone education about prostate cancer testing
      (intervention group) or (b) tailored telephone education about national guidelines for fruit
      and vegetable consumption (attention control group).
