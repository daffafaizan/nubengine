      common fungus called Aspergillus. In patients with CF, aspergillus is not known to cause
      direct damage to the lungs, but some patients respond with an allergic reaction that causes
      them to wheeze, cough, or have difficulty breathing. This allergic reaction is called ABPA.
      Current treatment for ABPA includes high dose steroids and an "anti-fungal" medicine.
      Treatment with steroids may be problematic for some people due to its side effects on blood
      sugar levels and the bones. Steroids are medications that decrease inflammation, including
      prednisone, medrol, dexamethasone and others.

      Ongoing research at UPMC on the study "Mechanisms of Immune Tolerance in ABPA" has studied
      people with CF and ABPA versus those patients with CF that just grow A. fumigatus (Af) in the
      sputum, but do not have ABPA. You may have participated in this study. This study has shown
      that people with CF with the fungus, Af, in their sputum but who do not have ABPA have more
      of a certain type of cell in their blood that helps the body to regulate or suppress allergic
      reactions than those people with CF and ABPA.

      Recent studies have demonstrated that Vitamin D is a critical factor in the development of
      these cells that suppress allergic reactions. People with CF, due to their pancreatic
      insufficiency that causes them to have difficulty absorbing fat, also have lower levels of
      the fat soluble vitamins which include vitamin D. In the study done at UPMC, "Mechanisms of
      Immune Tolerance in ABPA", people with CF and ABPA had significantly lower vitamin D levels
      than people with CF who did not have ABPA.
