      functions in adults and adolescents with ASD in comparison with age- and gender-matched
      healthy young adults. The study involves 1 screening visit of approximately 2 hours and 1
      study day of 5 hours

      The objective is to explore changes in amino acids (e.g. TRP pathway) in ASD and evaluate the
      function of TRP in neuropsychological functions by using the technique of stable isotope and
      our newly developed 'single pulse method' with multiple amino acid and keto-acid isotopes.

      The aim of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism by which the metabolism of
      amino acids such as TRP are involved in mood and cognitive functions in ADS.
