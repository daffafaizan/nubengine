      onset of progressive proximal muscle weakness, elevated serum muscle enzymes and endomysial
      inflammation. They comprise 3 clinically distinct subsets: polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis
      (DM) and Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). Because immune-mediated mechanisms are primarily
      responsible for the clinical manifestations of these conditions, the treatment of choice is
      with corticosteroids or immunotherapy drugs. Although most of the patients initially respond
      to these drugs, a number of them become resistant or develop unacceptable side effects that
      necessitate their discontinuation. The need for a more effective and safe immunotherapy in
      patients with PM, DM or IBM prompted the present study using high dose intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg is an immunomodulating agent which has been shown to be effective
      and safe in the treatment of a number of patients with immune-related neuromuscular diseases.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 30 patients, who will
      receive IVIg or placebo for 3 months and then will cross-over to the alternate therapy for
      another period of 3 monthly infusions. The monthly dose of IVIg is 2 GM/Kg divided into two
      daily doses. The drug will be considered effective if patients experience an increase of more
      than 15% in their baseline muscle strength. Muscle strength will be assessed with a series of
      objective dynamometric measurements performed before and at the end of each monthly infusion.
