      efficacy and safety of retigabine dosed at 1200 mg/day, in three equally divided doses,
      compared with placebo in patients with epilepsy who are receiving up to three established
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The primary objective is to demonstrate a superior change in
      total partial seizure frequency for four weeks from baseline to the double-blind period. The
      proportion of responders (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in total partial seizure
      frequency for four weeks from baseline to the double-blind period) will also be evaluated.
