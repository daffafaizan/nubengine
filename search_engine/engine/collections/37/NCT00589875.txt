      AdV-tk into remaining tumor or tumor bed after resection. Pathologic confirmation of
      malignant glioma must be made prior to AdV-tk injection; if this was not possible, the
      injection was not performed and the subject was no longer eligible for the study. The oral
      prodrug, valacyclovir, started 1-3 days after AdV-tk injection and continued for 14 days.
      Standard radiotherapy began on average 7 days after AdV-tk injection for the up-front course.
      Patients received temozolomide as per standard of care after completion of prodrug.
