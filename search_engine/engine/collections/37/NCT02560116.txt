      morbidity and mortality.

      Echocardiography, due to its widespread use, versatility, portability, noninvasive nature,
      and safety, is routinely used as the primary method for diagnosis and evaluation of these
      patients. However, in this very cohort, its accuracy is frequently compromised by poor
      acoustic windows. The use of echocardiographic contrast (EC) in such patients may increase
      diagnostic accuracy, eliminate the need for performing more invasive, time-consuming, and
      expensive tests, and eliminate potential diagnostic and management errors.

      Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure (PASP) is routinely measured noninvasively with
      transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by obtaining the tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV)
      with continuous wave spectral Doppler and applying the modified Bernoulli equation.

      The investigators aim to use the FDA approved perflutren-based EC agent Optison to augment
      inadequate TR CW spectral Doppler envelopes and determine if the TRV and PASP measurements
      obtained with the use of Optison correlate better with the invasive measurements obtained
      simultaneously during right heart catheterization as opposed to those measurements obtained
      without the use of EC.
