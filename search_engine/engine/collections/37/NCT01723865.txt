    
      Aim of the study The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of a dedicated
      remote monitoring system (RPM) in the management of patients with heart failure and implanted
      with ICDs and CRT-D.

      The clinical benefit will be assessed by:

        -  Increased cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization).

        -  Events arrhythmia: atrial fibrillation, sustained and nonsustained ventricular
           tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

        -  Autonomic profile, echocardiographic parameters, 6-minute walk test, quality of life
           questionnaire.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to estimate the incidence (and its accuracy) of the
      first event of unplanned hospitalizations for cardiac reasons or death from cardiovascular
      causes in the group monitored using RPM (with or without external sensors) and in the group
      management via conventional follow-up (Usual Care).
