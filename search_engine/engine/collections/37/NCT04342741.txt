      cervical ripening and patients' satisfaction. Sixty low-risk women were randomized to
      outpatient and inpatient management of intracervical Foley catheter digital insertion. The
      outpatient group was provided with verbal and written 24-hours contact information and
      instructions. Both groups were reassessed the next morning unless labor had begun or the
      catheter had dropped off.
