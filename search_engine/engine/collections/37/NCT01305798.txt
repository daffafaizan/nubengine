      e-mail and a health service provider website. Much as is the case in the current system, the
      control group will be informed via e-mail of the window of dates during which they can take
      part in the on-site screening and given instructions for scheduling an appointment. The first
      treatment group, the active choice and default option arm, will be informed via e-mail of a
      preselected time and date for their screening, which we will have generated randomly. This
      group will be asked to accept the default time, schedule a different time, defer the
      scheduling decision, or decline to receive a screening by clicking the appropriate option in
      the email. The second treatment group, the active choice only arm, will be given the same
      information as the control group, but they will also be asked to make an appointment
      immediately, defer the scheduling decision, or decline to receive a screening. The two
      treatment groups will also receive email reminders one week before their appointment and
      again one day before their appointment.
