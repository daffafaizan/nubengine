      admitted to Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål (OUH-Ullevål). Patients admitted to the
      emergency department and managed by the medical rapid response team or the sepsis rapid
      response team are considered eligible for inclusion. Informed consent will be collected at
      the emergency department if possible, or within few days, by a clinical investigator or a
      study nurse. The investigators aim to include 300 - 400 patients treated by the Sepsis Rapid
      Response Team or Medical Emergency team for possible sepsis. Patients classified to have had
      other conditions than sepsis in the post hoc assessment will be used as controls. The
      inclusion period will be 12 months.
