      that has the potential to eliminate the complications associated with other restrictive
      procedures (i.e., gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy) by creating a restriction without the
      use of an implant and without performing gastric resection. LGP is notably similar to a
      sleeve gastrectomy in that it generates a gastric tube by means of eliminating the greater
      curvature but does so without gastric resection.
