      inductions, unplanned surgeries such as urgent/emergent cesarean delivery or operating room
      management of postpartum hemorrhage, and opioid abuse/addiction are risk factors for
      developing postpartum depression (PPD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after
      delivery. This study will, through questionnaires, interviews, and examination of the medical
      record, seek to identify whether and how strongly such correlations exist during the first
      year postpartum in patients who have no preexisting history of these conditions.
