      and postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease (CD) and to evaluate the disease course.

      In our clinical treatments, the investigators found that perioperative CDAI and nutrition
      treatment may have same impact on postoperative recurrence and complication in Crohn's
      disease. The investigators design this study to test it.

      The study prepare to collect the clinical data of patients who need bowel resection for CD to
      analyzed. The investigators divide those patients into two groups (N,I group). They accept
      intestinal nutrition with the respective aim that get the inflammatory index (erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Crohns Disease Activity Index (CDAI))
      norm or nutritional index norm before they accept surgery. Postoperative recurrence and
      complications in patients will be recorded and compared.
