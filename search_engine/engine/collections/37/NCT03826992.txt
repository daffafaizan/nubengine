    
      This is a single-institution Phase I pilot study designed to test the safety and tolerability
      of combining venetoclax with Vyxeos (CPX-351, cytarabine and daunorubicin liposome) for the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory acute leukemia in young patients. Subjects will receive a
      single course of study therapy consisting of daily, oral venetoclax at an assigned dose level
      with a 3-day ramp-up to target dose and Vyxeos administered intravenously at the established
      dose on Days 1, 3, and 5. In addition to safety and tolerability, the overall response rate
      to these therapies will be estimated. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will also be conducted to
      define the drug clearance of venetoclax in this combination.
