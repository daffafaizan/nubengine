      Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with recurrent or resistant high-risk
      neuroblastoma treated with fenretinide.

      Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. Determine the proportion of
      patients with disease detected only by bone marrow immunocytology, who clear all evidence of
      disease during treatment with this drug.

      Determine minimal residual disease response by marrow and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) I
      123 scan in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to presence of measurable disease on CT scan/MRI
      (yes vs no). A third stratum of patients with tumor cells in bone marrow by immunocytology
      only is enrolled but is not evaluated for response.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide 3 times daily (or 2 times daily if over 18 years of age) on
      days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 30 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in stratum III who fail to achieve a complete
      response after 8 courses of therapy are removed from study.

      Patients are followed monthly until blood counts and visual acuity are stable or normalized
      and then every 6 months for 2 years and annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (25 each for strata I and II, 20 for stratum III)
      will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
