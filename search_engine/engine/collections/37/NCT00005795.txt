      response, relapse free survival, and overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or untreated older patients or those with secondary AML when
      treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Evaluate the toxicities of this agent in this patient
      population. III. Measure degree of apoptosis induced and/or differentiation in pretreatment
      and posttreatment AML cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for up to 60 days, or
      until bone marrow blasts are less than 5%, followed by 4-6 weeks of rest. After the first
      course, additional courses of arsenic trioxide last 25 days. Treatment continues for a
      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      with a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional 25 day course after achieving CR. Patients
      are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months,
      and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
