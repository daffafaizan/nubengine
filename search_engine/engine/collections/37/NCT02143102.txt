      suitably acquired and analyzed with the vascuCAP™ analysis software, can provide a
      sufficiently accurate profile of plaque characteristics to provide an objective basis for
      patient management. Study subjects include patients undergoing endarterectomies to mitigate
      their clinical risk or symptoms for conditions including stroke, claudication, and critical
      limb ischemia. The endarterectomy specimens removed at surgery will allow a direct comparison
      between the MRI information obtained prior to the surgery and the histopathological analyses
      of the arterial specimens. The vascuCAP™ measurements of structural and functional features
      of the arterial wall will be performed in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Measured
      results will be compared in a blinded fashion with histology to assess performance of plaque
      profiling and build a pilot prediction model for risk scoring.
