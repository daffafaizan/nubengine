      diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure by oscillometric technique. Several studies have
      confirmed the accuracy and precision of the oscillometric technique in ambulatory patients at
      both the level of the brachial and radial arteries. Multiple clinical research studies have
      demonstrated that when blood pressures (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures)
      determined by non-invasive blood pressure monitors (NIBP) from various manufacturers are
      compared to direct invasive arterial pressure monitors, the two values are on average within
      5 mm Hg of each other. There is limited data in critically ill patients. To date, there are
      no studies evaluating the accuracy or precision of these devices in intensive care patients
      for alternative sites (calf, thigh). In addition, there are no large clinical studies
      evaluating oscillometric NIBP monitoring in a complex medical intensive care population with
      varying hemodynamics. The goal of this study is to validate the oscillometric technique in
      measurement of blood pressure in the calf and thigh regions when compared to a gold standard.
      We may also be able to evaluate more specifically which situations for our patient population
      the blood pressure will be accurately portrayed as compared with the arterial pressure
      tracing. It has possible clinical value in either validating non-invasive blood pressure
      monitoring and eliminating/decreasing the need for invasive arterial blood pressure
      monitoring. Our hypothesis is that NIBP in the medical intensive care patients is highly
      variable and not a reliable means of arterial blood pressure monitoring.
