      pressure. Importantly, increased arterial pulsatile load predicts left ventricular
      hypertrophy, and thus presents a potential mechanism through which high dietary sodium
      augments cardiovascular disease risk.

      While high sodium diets impair vascular function via an increase in oxidative stress, how
      high sodium influences central pulsatile hemodynamics is not known. This project aims to a)
      determine how impaired vascular function affects pulsatile hemodynamics and thus influences
      the work of the heart during periods of high sodium consumption and b) examine whether
      regular aerobic exercise and/or fitness protects against the deleterious effects of excess
      sodium.
