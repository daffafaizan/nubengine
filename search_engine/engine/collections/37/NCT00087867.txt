      relapsed, refractory patients with multiple myeloma (MM), based on response rates. Patients
      took SCIO-469 two capsules (60 mg) by mouth three times a day with water, preferably with a
      meal, for 72 days except on Days 1 and 30 of monotherapy and Days 1 and 11 of combination
      therapy. On these days, the second dose of SCIO-469 was administered after collection of the
      12-hour PK sample, and the third dose was not administered.
