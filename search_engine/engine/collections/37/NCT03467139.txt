      problems. Breathing exercises also began to take place among the applications towards pain.
      Abdominal respiration is considered the easiest method to reveal relaxation response. Slow
      breathing increases parasympathetic activity in the body and reduces sympathetic activity.
      This is the first and fundamental step of real healing. The reduction of pro-inflammatory
      markers with respiratory exercises suggests that respiratory exercises are effective in
      inflammation.

      On study group; Hotpack was applied for 15 minutes and TENS was applied for 15 minutes and
      ultrasonics for 5 minutes. Then, scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were
      applied in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation) to increase
      joint range of motion by physiotherapist. Then abdominal respiratory exercise training was
      given 3 times a week as 30 sets of 3 times a week and patients were treated for 8 weeks.

      For the control group; Hotpack was applied for 15 min and TENS was applied for 15 min and
      ultrasonics for 5 min. Then scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were
      applied for 8 weeks in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation)
      to increase joint range of motion by physiotherapist.
