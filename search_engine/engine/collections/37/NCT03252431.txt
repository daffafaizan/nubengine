      400 female subjects (approximately 200 per arm) with Stage I - III invasive breast cancer who
      are to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant myelotoxic TC chemotherapy treatment (docetaxel +
      cyclophosphamide, 75 and 600 mg/m2, respectively). Subjects in this study will be those who
      are scheduled to undergo at least four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy treatment. Subjects may
      be scheduled for more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy; however, study participation will be
      limited to a subject's first 4 cycles.

      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of F-627 given as a
      single fixed dose (20 mg) pre-filled syringe as compared to Neulasta® standard dosing (6 mg)
      in the first chemotherapy cycle. The primary endpoint will be the duration of grade 4
      (severe) neutropenia - the number of days in which the patient has had an absolute neutrophil
      count (ANC <0.5 x 10^9/L) observed in chemotherapy cycle 1.

      Approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy completion in each cycle (Day 2 of the cycle),
      subjects will receive one of the following treatments:

      Arm 1: F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre-filled syringe, administered on Day 2 of each of 4
      chemotherapy cycles.

      Arm 2: 6 mg fixed dose Neulasta®, administered on Day 2 of each of 4 chemotherapy cycles
      Randomization will occur in an equal ratio (1:1) using a central randomization system (IWRS)
      on Day 1 of the study, the day of chemotherapy administration for the first chemotherapy
      cycle.

      This study is open-label, however, study drug injections are to be administered separately by
      qualified study personnel to allow study investigators to remain blinded and perform study
      assessments without knowledge of treatment assignment.
