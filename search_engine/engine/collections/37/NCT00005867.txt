        -  Compare the overall survival, failure free survival, disease specific survival, relapse
           free survival, and response rate in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
           treated with mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine, bleomycin, and
           prednisolone (PMitCEBO) versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
           prednisolone (CHOP).

        -  Compare the early and late toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and etoposide IV on day 1
           and vincristine and bleomycin IV on day 8. Treatment continues every 14 days for a
           maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients also receive oral prednisolone daily on courses 1 and 2 and every other day
           beginning on course 3 and continuing until the end of treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day
           1 and oral prednisolone on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of
           8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, then every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 310 patients (155 per arm) will be accrued for this study over
      5 years.
