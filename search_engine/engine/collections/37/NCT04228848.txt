      population: non symptomatic subjects, without major injury in their history. Injured
      population: ACL injured subjects, 9-12 month after beginning of treatment/surgery.

      Stages of study:

      stage 1- The investigators will create a new high-quality literature-based assessment test
      for the triple hop test (NTHT). The test will have 10 sections, its score ranges from 0 to 14
      points and a high score means poor performance.

      Stage 2- Performing reliability tests between and within the testers for NTHT. The tests will
      be done with the help of video photography of NTHT.

      Stage 3- Performing NTHT and THT tests on healthy adult and adolescent subjects and on ACL
      adult and adolescent subjects, assessing the NTHT by watching video performance.
