      under the lesion creates a "safety" cushion and protects from damage to the gastrointestinal
      tract wall. Various solutions are currently used, but some of them are easy to inject but
      quickly dissipate (normal saline),other solutions are more longer lasting (hydroxypropyl
      methylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, etc) but are very difficult to inject and can be expensive
      and not always available. The investigators decided to use blood drawn from the patient for
      injection under the lesion. The investigators performed previously animal experiments which
      demonstrated that blood is easy to inject and creates a protective cushion which lasts longer
      than other fluids which are currently used for protective cushion creation. Blood can also
      have local hemostatic action preventing from bleeding during polypectomy.
