      correlates with neurocognitive impairment. To show this we will measure regional cortical
      perfusion and regional brain and WM lesion volumes in 26 predefined brain regions using a
      template developed for Alzheimer's disease. Regional perfusion will be correlated with
      neurocognitive tests validated for MS use. Patients will be divided into impaired and non
      impaired and perfusion compared controlling for known confounding factors. If confirmed
      cortical perfusion may be utilized as a surrogate marker of cognitive outcome in therapeutic
      studies.
