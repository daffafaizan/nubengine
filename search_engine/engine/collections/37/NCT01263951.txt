        1. Find out if sorafenib and everolimus prevent the growth of tumors that have grown when
           treated with sorafenib alone

        2. Find out how long one might benefit from treatment with sorafenib and everolimus

        3. Find out what side effects this drug may cause

        4. Measure the amount of sorafenib and everolimus in the blood and see if "markers" can be
           found to help understand who might benefit from sorafenib and everolimus.
