      achieve the target treatment parameter in all patients, and lack of direct parameters for
      monitoring treatment efficacy or even intensity. Patients with low activity of thiopurine
      methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of 6MP, have lower levels of
      liver toxic metabolites (MeMPs), higher levels of the major active metabolites (TGNs), and
      reduced relapse rates. Most patients (90%) have high TPMT activity. Nearly all patients with
      high TPMT activity and high MeMP levels experience elevated liver enzymes. Increasing the 6MP
      dose in patients with high TPMT activity, to intensify therapy, will mainly lead to further
      increase in the MeMP level. A novel approach compensating the adverse thiopurine metabolism
      of the majority of patients is warranted.
