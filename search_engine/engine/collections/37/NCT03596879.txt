    
      The purpose of this study is to 1) explore the relationship between prenatal insomnia,
      ruminative thinking and the severity of PPD symptoms. and 2) determine the effectiveness of
      Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (dCBTI) in reducing the risk for postpartum depression
      in pregnant mothers entering into their third trimester. dCBTI is an online form of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that is used with people who experience trouble sleeping at night
      (insomniacs). As pregnant women are especially vulnerable to sleep problems during this
      period, this study will help us determine whether dCBTI is helpful in improving sleep and
      reducing the risk for PPD in this population.

      Pregnant women entering their third trimester will be recruited from the Henry Ford Health
      System through the HFHS Electronic Medical Record (EPIC). They will receive an email from
      study personnel describing the study, and encouraged to schedule a phone call to discuss
      study details. Participants will then complete a consent and an online screening survey. Upon
      meeting inclusion criteria, participants will complete weekly surveys and randomized into one
      of 2 active online insomnia treatment conditions. Each treatment involves 6 weekly "sessions"
      which each take up to 20 minutes to complete.

      Subjects will complete weekly online surveys beginning at week 30 of pregnancy, and
      continuing through 6 weeks after giving birth.
