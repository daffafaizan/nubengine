      and the latter's advantages lie in its slighter toxic-and-side effect and favorable security.
      When heated to 37℃, the 20 ℃ contrast agents would be diluted to 50% consistency, then a
      shorter time period of its intravascular and other intracavitary stay would add to less cell
      damage. And the applications of heated non-ionic contrast agents could be found in computed
      tomography angiography(CTA), hysterosalpingography (HSG) and cystourethrography, and
      consequently the patients with the intervention of heated non-ionic contrast agents felt more
      comfortable and fewer adverse reactions could be observed. Nevertheless, heated contrast
      agent was rarely reported to act in ERCP. It's theoretically possible that its heat-reduced
      lower mucosity could help the contrast agent itself to drainage, so that the incidence of
      cholangeitis could be under control.
