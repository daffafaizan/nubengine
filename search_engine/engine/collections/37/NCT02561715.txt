      self-awareness and the impact they are likely to have on patient reported quality of life
      (QoL) outcome measures for a chronic condition.

      This will be an observational study, a case series of approx. 10 to 20 patients. These
      patients will be recruited over a 6 month period from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital,
      Birmingham and will be informed of the study during their routine pre-surgical visit.

      Patients will be eligible if they are about to undergo DBS at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. If
      the participant has a carer, who is also willing to participate, they may also join the
      study. Patients will be excluded if they are unable to complete questionnaires in English.

      Once recruited and following consent, a patient will complete a brief battery of
      questionnaires both self-reported and clinician rated prior to surgery and at their 6 month
      post op visit.
