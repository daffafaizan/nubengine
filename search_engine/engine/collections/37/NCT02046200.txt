      development of effective treatments for AUDs represents an important public health objective.
      Repositioning, i.e. using existing approved drugs for other indications, represents a fast
      and economically feasible approach for drug development. Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA-approved
      antiparasitic medication that can significantly reduce alcohol intake in mice, suggesting
      that it may be useful in the treatment of AUDs in humans. The goal of this project is to
      provide key clinical evidence that IVM can be repositioned as a novel therapeutic agent to
      treat AUDs. We will enroll 10 alcohol dependent individuals in a placebo-controlled
      randomized pilot safety trial of IVM (30 mg orally once) over a 2-day (1-night) inpatient
      stay at the UCLA CTRC and employ a well-characterized battery of behavioral paradigms (i.e.,
      alcohol administration and cue exposure). The goals of the study are to test: (a) the safety
      of combining IVM, at a dose currently shown to be safe in humans (30 mg), with moderate doses
      of alcohol (0.08 g/dl); and (b) whether IVM reduces the reinforcing effects of alcohol during
      alcohol administration and whether it reduces alcohol craving during cue exposure, as
      compared to placebo.
