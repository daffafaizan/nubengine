      control arm of CF regimen, DCF showed higher efficacy in terms of response rate, time to
      progression and overall survival. But the regimen had increased grade 3-4 neutropenia (82% vs
      57%) and febrile neutropenia infection (29% vs 12%). We began to study on weekly DCF in the
      patients with advanced gastric cancer to evaluate the efficacy no less than that of 3-week'
      regimen.
