      improve outcomes of surgical treatment. New analgetic medications and combinations of these
      are sought for optimal analgesia with lowest possible incidence of side effects. One of the
      method of multimodal analgesia is a combination of opioids and adjuvant agents, such as
      ketamine. To our knowledge, the role of ketamine in the treatment of postoperative pain after
      bariatric surgeries is poorly researched. The investigators hypothesize that ketamine, acting
      through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) and opioid receptors, provides favourable
      conditions for adequate post-operative pain management.
