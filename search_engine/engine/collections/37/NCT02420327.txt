      different attention tasks. Over four test session, participants will then perform these tasks
      after receiving (1) a placebo patch and a placebo capsule, (2) a nicotine patch (7 mg/24 hrs)
      and a placebo capsule, (3) a placebo patch and a galantamine capsule, and (4) a nicotine
      patch and a galantamine capsule. The four test session are performed on separate days and
      take approximately 7 hours each. During the first 5 hours, the participant may read or watch
      TV while nicotine and/or galantamine are being absorbed. During the last two hours, the
      participant will perform the attention tasks on a computer. The investigators hypothesize
      that performance-enhancing effects of nicotine, which were documented in previous research,
      will be larger in the presence than in the absence of galantamine. This proof-of-concept
      would have implications for the development of drugs for the treatment of conditions such as
      Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia.
