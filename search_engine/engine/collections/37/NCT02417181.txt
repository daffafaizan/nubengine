      (GPs) during out-of-hours care is high and there are concerns about maintaining the quality
      of care. Since 80% of the complaints shown in out-of-hours care are low complex and not
      urgent, not all patients necessarily have to be seen by a physician. Shifting care from GPs
      to physician assistants (PAs) is considered to be a possible method to reduce workload while
      maintaining high quality and safety of care.

      Previous research, on PAs in primary care during office hours, has shown PAs were found to be
      acceptable, effective and efficient in complementing the work of GPs.

      We hypothesize that in a team of PAs and GPs working out-of-hours primary care, the PAs will
      deliver care to less urgent and complex complaints, deliver quality of care comparable to GPs
      and their implementation will lead to a reduction in cost of healthcare.

      We compare care provided by a team of PAs and GPs with a team of only GPs. Within the team of
      PAs and GPs we make a comparison between the two healthcare professionals.
