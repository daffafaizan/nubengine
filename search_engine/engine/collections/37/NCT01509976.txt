      Objectives:

        1. Assess diversity and quantities of microbial flora in gut, skin, mouth before, during,
           and after TC use

        2. Assess whether TC use correlates with microbial resistance

        3. If any, assess time to change in alterations in microbial flora

      Study design:

      Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study of 20 subjects

      Here, we propose a pilot study in which we will compare the microbial flora of subjects who
      use triclosan-containing personal hygiene products and those who use triclosan-free products.
      We will randomize half the cohort to triclosan-containing personal hygiene products including
      toothpaste, liquid hand soap, bar soap, and dish soap for half of the cohort for a 5-month
      period of time. The participants and investigators will be blinded as to whether they are
      using triclosan-containing products or triclosan-free products by blinding the packaging.
      After about 5 months, the participants will cross-over to the other arm.

      During a lead-in period of about 2 weeks, we will collect urine samples for a baseline
      triclosan level and body weight. We will also collect Leptin, Resistin, Grehlin, IL 10, IL17,
      PAI-1 Plasminogen activator inhibitor -1, TNFa, IFN-g, Insulin, IGF, Glucagon, CRP, TSH, Free
      T4T3, Estradiol, Testosterone free, Testosterone total, Adiponectin, IL6, Visfatin, H.
      pylori, ESR. Blood, urine, and body weight will be collected at three points in the study:
      prior to first phase, in between phases, and after completion of second phase.

      We will collect stool, skin, tooth, and saliva samples multiple times throughout the study
      and submit for pyrosequencing.
