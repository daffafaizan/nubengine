      better than the previous time domain Stratus OCT, its diagnostic power for glaucoma detection
      and judgement of disease progression should be directly compared with Stratus OCT. In the
      present study, we will review the data of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness
      measurement using the Cirrus HD OCT and Stratus OCT. Their discriminating ability for
      diagnosis of glaucoma and judgement of disease progression will be compared using the ROC
      curves and Cohen's kappa.
