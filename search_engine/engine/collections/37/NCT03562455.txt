      who desire to be power wheelchair users and thus allow them to benefit from living a more
      active life. A virtual reality training program could significantly impact the lives of
      people with disabilities by improving function, reducing abandonment of power wheelchairs,
      and reducing morbidity and mortality and associated costs occurring from power wheelchair
      accidents. This new virtual reality training program will reflect improvements in
      accessibility, customization, simulator sickness, ease of use, and will have report
      generating capabilities as compared to previous virtual reality training platforms. The
      investigators expect that virtual reality training will be a superior alternative to standard
      in-person wheelchair training.
