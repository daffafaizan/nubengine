      Diabetes Mellitus by reducing hepatic glucose output. This study will investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics when single doses of GSK1362885 are
      administered to healthy volunteers. A glucagon challenge test will be used to stimulate
      hepatic glucose output in order to evaluate liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibition by
      GSK1362885.
