      recognized as safe and effective method of increasing muscle strength, physical fitness,
      muscle mass, and overall cardiovascular health. The magnitude of the RT effects is associated
      with the structure of the training program. Understanding these aspects may provide guidance
      for the RT prescription while reducing potential risk of cardiovascular events associated
      with the recovery period after exercise. The objective of the study is to compare the acute
      responses of the Autonomic Nervous System post RT performed with different intensities
      (endurance and strength) in different body segments (UL and LL). Our hypothesis is that
      different intensities and body segments influence the acute responses of the ANS in the post
      RT recovery period.
