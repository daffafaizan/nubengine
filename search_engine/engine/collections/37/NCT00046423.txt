      for three weeks followed by a week of rest. The treatment course will repeat every 28 days.
      No pretreatment will normally be considered necessary. Patients will have white blood cell
      and platelet counts monitored as will indications of performance (Karnofsky Performance
      Status), and will be asked to describe adverse events, if present. Patients will be treated
      for a minimum of two cycles to be evaluable for the study, and may continue in the study for
      four cycles within the study, if tumor response and safety parameters warrant continuing.
      Patients may continue on study medication beyond this at the investigator's discretion.
