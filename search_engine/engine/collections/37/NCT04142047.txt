      experience more fatigue and difficulty exercising than older people without HIV. This is
      important because fatigue and problems exercising are predictors of disability and
      hospitalization in older individuals. We will use non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the leg muscle to measure muscle metabolites and fat content,
      as well as blood samples measures levels of inflammation.
