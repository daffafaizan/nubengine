      epithelium off (CXL epi off) versus trans-epithelial (CXL epi on) cross linking in patient
      with progressive keratoconus.

      Forty eyes from 32 patients with progressive keratoconus were prospectively enrolled from
      June 2014 to June 2015 in this non-blinded, randomized comparative study. Twenty eyes were
      treated by CXL epi off and 20 by CLX epi on, randomly assigned and followed for 2 years. All
      patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic testing that included uncorrected and best
      corrected visual acuity, central and peripheral corneal thickness, corneal astigmatism,
      simulated maximum, minimum, and average keratometry, corneal confocal microscopy, Schirmer I
      and break-up time (BUT) tests, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index. Intra-and postoperative
      complications were recorded. The solution used for CXL epi off comprised riboflavin 0.1% and
      dextran 20.0% (Ricrolin), whereas the solution for CXL epi on (Ricrolin, TE) comprised
      riboflavin 0.1%, dextran 15.0%, trometamol (Tris), and ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid.
      Ultraviolet-A treatment was performed with UV-X System at 3 mW/cm2.
