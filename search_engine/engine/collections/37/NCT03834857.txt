      safety of the StentrodeTM device in participants with loss of motor function due to paralysis
      from spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, stroke, muscular dystrophy or loss of limbs.

      Research has shown that in individuals with neurological conditions, brain signals can be
      recorded using electrical sensors implanted on to the brain. These signals could be used by
      the individuals to control assistive technology (e.g. spelling devices) that help with daily
      life, just by thinking. However, implanting these electrical sensors often requires open
      brain surgery.

      A new medical device and surgical technique has been developed, which allows implantation of
      the electrical sensors without open brain surgery. The device, called Stentrode™, is a small
      metallic mesh tube (stent), with electrode contacts (small metal disks) within the stent
      structure. It can be placed inside a blood vessel of the brain located in the motor cortex.
      This does not involve open brain surgery.

      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety of the Stentrode™ device in humans.
      This is an experimental device. This research will be the first of its kind to be performed
      in humans and may help find safer, more effective ways to introduce/implant electrical
      sensors in patients. This could foster the development of user friendly biotechnology for
      patients with neurological conditions.
