        -  to evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR), as defined as complete
           disappearance of invasive tumor in breast and axillary nodes.

        -  to estimate the percentage of clinical objective responses (cOR) (complete plus partial)
           in the breast, as assessed by ultrasonography (US)

        -  to estimate the percentage of breast conservative surgery

        -  to evaluate the safety profile

        -  To perform correlative biomarker analyses
