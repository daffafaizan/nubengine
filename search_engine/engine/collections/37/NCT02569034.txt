    
      Twenty young adults (aged 18-38) and 20 older adults (aged 60-80) will perform the EEfRT
      while fMRI data are acquired. To quantify brain activity associated with reward "wanting,"
      the fMRI activation will be measured while participants view information about reward
      probability and choose to perform the easy or hard task, with greater reward associated with
      the hard task. The investigators will measure activation during presentation of reward
      magnitude to capture brain activity associated with reward "liking." Participants will also
      complete a brief cognitive battery and anhedonia questionnaires.
