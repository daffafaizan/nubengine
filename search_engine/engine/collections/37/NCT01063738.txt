    
      Critically ill patients aged 45 years and over will be recruited during recovery after
      intensive care. Using a randomised controlled, blind at follow-up design the study will
      examine whether the combination of an amino acid supplement and an enhanced physiotherapy
      programme improve the rehabilitation of muscle following intensive care better than a
      self-guided rehabilitation programme alone or with either an amino acid supplement or the
      enhanced physiotherapy programme. The Primary efficacy outcome will be the improvement in six
      minute walking test measured at 3 months post intensive care discharge. Secondary efficacy
      parameters will be insulin resistance, health related quality of life and muscle mass using
      DEXA scanning at 3 months and 1 year post intensive care discharge.
