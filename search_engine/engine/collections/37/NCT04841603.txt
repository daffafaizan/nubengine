      they receive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, existing interventions have been further reduced.
      Mood and anxiety symptoms are common for all inpatients across diagnostic categories. Studies
      have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be effective for treating these
      symptoms among inpatients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Mindshift
      CBT app (an app based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy) is an acceptable,
      feasible, and useable intervention for inpatients.

      The Mindshift CBT app is a tool designed and maintained by Anxiety Canada. It includes tools
      for daily mood check-ins, healthy thinking, calming intense emotions, and taking actions to
      change behaviours associated with anxiety and low mood. It also includes information about
      the common types of anxiety.

      The proposed trial includes 12 patients per arm. All participants in control and intervention
      groups will have access to assigned tablet devices throughout the study period, though only
      those in the intervention group will have the MindShift CBT app on their device. All
      participants will undergo assessments at baseline and at the end of the intervention period
      (1 week).
