      surgery under routine anesthesia, a cohort of ongoing patients received topical proparacaine
      immediately post op, or none. Co-variables were intraoperative opioid and OCR, patient age,
      type of surgery. Several post-operative recovery outcome variables were prospectively
      monitored.
