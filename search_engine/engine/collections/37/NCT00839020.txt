      requirements for achieving good long-term results in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A
      minimally invasive approach might compromise the accuracy due to lacking intraoperative
      oversight. The purpose of this study is to compare a minimally invasive TKA approach that was
      performed under control of a navigation system with a standard navigated approach, with
      respect to patient pain and range of motion.

      All patients receive a Columbus knee prosthesis and in both groups an OrthoPilot navigation
      system is used to control the alignment. Pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
      and concomitant pain medication intake are documented daily during the first 20 days after
      operation. As long as the patient is hospitalized the Range of Motion will also be documented
      daily. Knee society score, oxford score, as well as the WOMAC score are monitored pre- and
      postoperatively.
