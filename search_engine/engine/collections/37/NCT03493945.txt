    
      Background:

        -  PD-1/PD-L1 signaling appears to be a major inhibitor of activated T cell anti-tumor
           immune responses. The rapid, deep and durable responses seen in various malignancies
           with PD-1/PD-L1 targeted agents demonstrate that blockade of this axis is key to
           facilitating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

        -  Prostate cancer is poorly recognized by T cells. Lack of an immune response is one
           explanation for the lower response rates (<15%) observed with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies
           for prostate cancer.

        -  Increasing response rates will likely require therapeutic nullification of multiple
           immune deficits by combining immunotherapies that generate tumor-specific T cells
           (vaccine), dampen the inhibitory milieu of the TME, and enhance T and NK cell activity
           within the TME.

        -  A quick efficacy seeking trial, utilizing sequential arms offers a means to identify
           signals of activity for combinations of immunotherapy, added sequentially, in castration
           resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

        -  BN-Brachyury is a novel recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to
           induce an enhanced immune response against brachyury, which is overexpressed in many
           solid tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma. BN-Brachyury collectively refers
           to the priming doses (MVA-BN-Brachyury) and the boost doses (FPV-Brachyury) of the
           vaccine platform.

        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1
           (PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-
           beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap. M7824 can also mediate antibody-dependent
           cellular cytotoxicity in vitro.

        -  ALT-803 is an IL-15/IL-15R alpha superagonist complex that can enhance NK cell mediated
           ADCC and T-cell cytotoxicity.

        -  Synergistic anti-tumor effects have been observed in vitro when combining M7824 and
           ALT-803, and in vivo when combining these agents with tumor vaccine in animal models.

        -  IDO1 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and can contribute to immune escape by tumor
           cells. INCB024360 (Epacadostat) is an IDO1 inhibitor under investigation in combination
           with different immunotherapies in treatment of various malignancies.

        -  In treating of CRPC, we hypothesize that these agents and their effects will be
           complementary. Tumor-specific T cells generated by vaccine may become more functional in
           a TME following treatment with M7824 and Epacadostat. ALT-803 can further enhance the
           activity of antigen-specific T cells as well as NK cells.

      Objective:

      -To determine if there is clinical benefit to any of a set of 3 possible treatments for
      patients with CRPC:

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + ALT-803

        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + ALT-803 + Epacadostat

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults with histologically proven CRPC, or metastatic solid tumor of any type for which
           there is no standard treatment or standard treatment has failed.

        -  Adequate organ function as defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.

        -  Patients with acquired immune defects, active systemic autoimmune disease, history of
           organ transplant, history of chronic infections, or history of active inflammatory bowel
           disease are excluded.

      Design:

      Open label Phase I/II trial with following randomization during the expansion.

      Phase I: Cohort 1, Arm 1.1

      - Up to 18 patients with any solid tumor will be enrolled in dose escalation Cohort 1 for
      treatment in Arm 1.1 (flat dose of M7824 + different dose levels of ALT-803).

      Phase IIA: expansion with sequential enrollment into Cohort 2A, Arms 2.1A, 2.2BA. and 2.3 AC

        -  Concurrently with the enrollment to Arm 1.1, 13 patients with CRPC will start enrollment
           in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.1A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury).

        -  When safe dosing of ALT-803 is identified during Phase I, 13 patients have enrolled in
           arm 2.1A and the first 6 patients, treated in Arm 2.1A, have met safety requirements, 13
           patients with CRPC will start enrollment in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.2A (M7824 +
           BN-Brachyury + ALT-803).

        -  When 13 patients have enrolled in Arm 2.2A and the first 6 patients, treated in Arm
           2.2A,have met safety requirements, 13 patients with CRPC will start enrollment in Cohort
           2A for treatment in Arm 2.3A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury + ALT-803 + Epacadostat).

      Phase IIB: expansion with randomized enrollment into Cohorts 2D and 2R, Arms 2.1B, 2.2B. and
      2.3B

        -  Each Arm in Cohorts 2D and 2R: 2.1B, 2.2B and 2.3B will be open for additional
           enrollment (25 evaluable patients total) when the initial 13 patients have accrued,
           safety requirements are meet and a positive signal (defined as Objective Response by
           RECIST 1.1 or sustained PSA decrease >= 30% sustained for > 21 days) in >= 2 patients is
           shown.

        -  If only one arm is open for additional enrollment, patients will be directly assigned to
           this arm. If 2 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will be randomized
           between these 2 open arms. If 3 arms are open for additional enrollment, patients will
           be randomized among these 3 open arms.

      If there are >= 6 of 25 patients with a positive signal of activity in any expansion arm,
      that arm will be considered of interest for future studies.
