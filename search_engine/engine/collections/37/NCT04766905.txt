      dissection takes place slightly over the acromial edge proximally and over the origin of the
      acromial deltoid part (the middle part of deltoid origin) distally.

      After clearly revealing the region of the medial deltoid origin on the acromion, the
      acromionic deltoid origin is skinned only; of the edge of the acromion, and that maybe
      accrued by electric knife pen or periosteal elevator, without exposure the clavicular deltoid
      origin in the front and the deltoid origin on the spine of scapula in the back, the origin of
      the acromial deltoid is distanced laterally and distally, where the lateral edge, the lower
      surface of the acromion, under acromial bursa and the rotator cuff are exposed clearly.

      Throw this approach can be made acromioplasty and rotator cuff tears repair especially upper
      part of rotator cuff tear very easily.

      For wound closure the acromionic deltoid origin is reattached to the acromial edge by long
      period synthetic absorbable sutures as PDS and PDO, or non absorbable sutures as Polyester
      suture, under skin and skin sutures are made.
