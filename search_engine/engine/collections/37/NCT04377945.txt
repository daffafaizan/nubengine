      Subjects with a diagnosis of PD and moderate to severe dyskinesias in PD will complete a
      Screening Visit to assess eligibility to participate in the study. Subjects will continue
      with their usual levodopa treatment regimen for the duration of study participation.

      The screening assessment period will be from 1 week to 6 weeks duration. For both Part 1 and
      Part 2, subjects deemed eligible at the end of the Screening Visit will be randomly assigned
      in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the treatments, as per the double-blind study design.
