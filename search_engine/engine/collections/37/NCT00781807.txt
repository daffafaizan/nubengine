      management, home-based ergometer training program, psychosocial support and neurocognitive
      screening. The nutrition management and physical reconditioning program will be supplemented
      by psychosocial support targeting the risk of increased stress, anxiety, and depression
      level. Moreover, standardized neurocognitive screening procedures will be administered to
      detect neurocognitive dysfunction (except stroke) and will be assessed for their potential to
      predict limitations in QoL. Adverse events like re-hospitalizations, thromboembolic and
      bleeding events will be monitored and assessed for their potential to negatively impact QoL.
