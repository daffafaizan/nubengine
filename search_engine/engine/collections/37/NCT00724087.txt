    
      Study participants will complete two 16-day inpatient stays in the sleep laboratory of the
      University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center that will be scheduled at least 4 weeks apart.
      Bedtime duration will be set at 5.5 hours per night during one of these stays and at 8.5
      hours per night during the other. No daytime naps will be allowed. Study participants will be
      served regular daily meals including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a bedtime snack. On
      weekdays all participants will engage in simulated "office work" in the sleep laboratory.
      During the rest of the time participants will maintain their usual indoor and outdoor
      activities as much as possible within the limits of the University of Chicago campus. At the
      beginning of each inpatient stay, study participants will drink a glass of water containing
      harmless non-radioactive dense forms of oxygen and hydrogen, small amounts of which are found
      in natural water. Several urine samples will be collected before and after the participants
      drink the water and again 14 days later in order to measure the amount of energy that was
      used by them during this time. At the end of each stay participants will also undergo
      measurements of their body composition (lean tissue, bone and fat) and their metabolic rate
      at rest and after a standard meal, and will complete tests to determine how much insulin does
      their body produce in response to an intravenous glucose infusion and how effective is the
      action of the sugar-processing hormone, insulin, in their body when it is infused
      intravenously together with glucose over a period of several hours.
