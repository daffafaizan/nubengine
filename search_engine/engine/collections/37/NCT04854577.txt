    
      Patients, aged 18 years or older, scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
      with a complete midline sternotomy as surgical approach will be recruited for this study.

      Patients planned for this particular surgical procedure will be recruited and allocated to
      one of 2 groups:

        1. "Intervention" group: Opioid-free anesthetic regimen with a pre-incisional
           pecto-intercostal fascial plane block (PIFB);

        2. "Control" group: traditional opiate-based anesthetic regimen in which the dosage of the
           opioids is at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.

      Based on our power analysis, each group will consist of 64 patients.
