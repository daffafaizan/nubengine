      each chart, the subject name, date of birth,and social security number will be recorded along
      with the state of residence and year of surgery. This information will be transferred to a CD
      that is encrypted and password protected. The CD will be sent via FedEx overnight to the
      Center for Disease Control(CDC), National Death Registry. The CDC will use the information on
      the CD to extract death outcomes for each subject's information provided. Once all
      information is complete, the CDC will transfer on to a CD that is encrypted and password
      protected and return to our office via FexEx overnight. The information on the CD will then
      be used to determine what the long term death rates were for subjects here at SUNY Upstate
      Medical University and stored in an anonymous database. Once the information is verified as
      accurate, the CD will be destroyed and no identifying information will be kept. The CDC will
      also destroy the information after 60 days, with no links to the identifying information.
