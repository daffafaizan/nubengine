      now widely practiced throughout the world. The theory is based on Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM), which sees meridians of life force (chi) running through the body, and aims
      to optimize health through manipulating the body into maximal alignment.

      We are proposing a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy
      of acupressure as adjuvant therapy added to antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia.

      The goals of this study are twofold:

        1. To assess through the highest standards of empirical research whether acupressure can
           benefit patients with schizophrenia.

        2. To furnish data relevant to the possible physiological mechanisms by which acupressure
           may produce a therapeutic effect.
