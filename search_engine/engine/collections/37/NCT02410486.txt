    
      Neonatal pathogens other than group B Streptococcus (GBS) and resistant to beta-lactam
      antibiotics have emerged as the most common etiologic agents of EOS and EOM among preterm and
      term neonates and result in high mortality rates, potentially offsetting the decreased burden
      of early-onset GBS disease prevented by maternal intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

      Primary Outcomes of this study:

        1. To determine current hospital-based rates of early-onset neonatal infection (total,
           GA-specific and BW-specific, and pathogen-specific) in term and preterm infants in the
           era of maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent vertical transmission of
           group B streptococcal disease. Early-onset infection comprises EOS and/or EOM and is
           defined as isolation of a pathogen from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained
           within 72 hours of birth and provision of appropriate antibiotic treatment for 5 or more
           days (or <5 days if death occurs while receiving antibiotic therapy).

        2. To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of organisms associated with EOS
           and EOM

      The case control aspect of this study will address 2 major conundrums regarding EOS: Can we
      identify risk factors for early-onset Gram-negative infections that might lead to
      intervention strategies to reduce risk and can we identify infants born to mothers with
      clinical chorioamnionitis who are at highest risk for early-onset sepsis and thus warrant
      antibiotic treatment soon after birth?
