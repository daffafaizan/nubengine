      Anzhen Hospital were enrolled, and all the eligible participants were randomized to either
      remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) group or control group. Those randomized to RIPC group
      had a pneumatic medical tourniquet cuff (width , 5 cm ; length , 40 cm) placed around their
      upper arm at < 2 hours before the PCI procedure. The pneumatic medical cuff was inflated to a
      pressure of 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes , followed by 5 minutes of deflation to allow
      reperfusion. This procedure was repeated for 3 times. Control participants did not experience
      this procedure of transient upper-limb ischemia.
