           morning dim light in consolidating nighttime sleep as assessed by actigraphy.

        2. Predictors of response: We expect the primary predictor of treatment response will be
           initial MMSE score. Secondary predictors include baseline sleep/wake and circadian
           parameters and age.

        3. Effectiveness: Bright light treatment will be more effective than dim light in improving
           quality of life.

        4. An understanding of some of the genetic markers of memory and/or sleep problems.
