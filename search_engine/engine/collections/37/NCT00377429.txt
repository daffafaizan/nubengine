    
      A multi-center, phase II study of catumaxomab in ovarian cancer patients who experience a
      complete response to chemotherapy. Each eligible patient will receive four ascending doses of
      catumaxomab, administered intraperitoneally via an indwelling catheter or port. Catumaxomab
      will be administered as a 3-hour constant rate infusion with a dosing interval of 3-4 days.
      Each patient will participate in this study for up to 4 months (includes the baseline
      screening period, 11 to 21 days treatment period, and up to 90 days/3 months follow-up), with
      post-study follow-up every 3 months for 2 years.

      Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)
      on tumor cells and CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies
      represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the
      capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs]
      and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data,
      trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells, which can trigger a
      complex anti-tumor immune response.
