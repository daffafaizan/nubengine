      with established stability at 6 months after implantation of the device. If inclusion
      criteria are met, patients will be transitioned to a single anti-thrombotic therapy with
      Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) or equivalent antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with
      warfarin will be withdrawn. ASA will be administered in a minimum dose of 100 mg per day with
      dosage adjustments based on VerifyNow testing up to a maximum of 200 mg daily. The primary
      endpoints will be analyzed at 90 and 180 days after initiation of the single antiplatelet
      therapy.
