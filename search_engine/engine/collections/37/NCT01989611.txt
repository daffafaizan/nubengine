      the informed consent and confirmation of eligibility within 45 days after the screening
      visit.

      Once included, participants will be examined in a follow-up visit performed four weeks later
      and evaluated for evidence of seroconversion to HIV, medication compliance and clinical
      toxicity. The second follow-up visit will occur at 12th week and every 12 weeks successively
      (quarterly). Quarterly visits include HIV testing, serum creatinine and counseling on
      medication compliance and risk reduction.

      The study has a total of 6 visits. In all visits will be assessed the risks, HIV testing will
      be performed, monitoring of renal function and dispensing of the drug Truvada [emtricitabine
      1 tablet (FTC) / tenofovir (TDF) (200/300 mg) once a day orally for 12 months].

      Participants who have completed 12 months of follow-up or prematurely discontinue a PrEP will
      be encouraged to return for a follow-up visit after discontinuation of medication for
      monitoring of the status and evaluation of HIV as the resolution of side effects.
