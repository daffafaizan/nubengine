      arteries and veins, connecting as a fistula without intervening normal capillary bed. The
      treatment strategy including surgical removal, endovascular embolism and stereotaxic
      radiosurgery and comprehensive treatment. China is a united multi-ethnic nation of 56 ethnic
      groups, and has the largest population in the world. We have most extensive and valuable
      clinical resources of intracranial arteriovenous malformation in the world. But we know
      little about the current treatment situation of the disease in China.
