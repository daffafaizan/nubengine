    
      [Phase Ib]

      After preoperative CRT, to sequentially administer nivolumab in combination for patients with
      locally advanced resectable rectal cancer. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab in sequential
      combination therapy, the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the safety of subsequent
      surgical therapy, and to decide on a recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part.

      [Phase II]

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety when nivolumab is sequentially administered in
      combination at the RD determined in the phase Ib part, following preoperative CRT in patients
      with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer and to identify biomarkers related to the
      therapeutic response. To also evaluate the safety of surgical therapy.
