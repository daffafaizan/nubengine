      with atorvastatin (Lipitor) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Patients with MS are thought to have an immune response that attacks certain proteins in the
      brain, including myelin basic protein. (Myelin basic protein is a protein that makes up part
      of the outside layer of nerve cells.) BHT-3009 is an investigational immunotherapy product
      that is designed to alter the immune response to myelin basic protein and make the response
      less harmful. BHT-3009 contains the DNA (gene) for myelin basic protein.

      Three different doses of BHT-3009 will be tested to determine if there are any differences in
      safety or effects on immunity. This is the first clinical research study of BHT-3009.
      Laboratory studies have shown that BHT-3009 and atorvastatin given together alters the immune
      response to myelin basic protein and makes the response less harmful.
