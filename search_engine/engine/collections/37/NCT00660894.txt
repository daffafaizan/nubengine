        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with stage III colon cancer treated with
           S-1 or tegafur-uracil and leucovorin after curative surgery .

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil and oral leucovorin 3 times daily on days
           1-21. The treatment repeats 5 times every 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-28. The treatment repeats 4
           times every 6 weeks.

      Biological samples are collected for gene expression analysis for identification of
      predictive markers.
