      such as lesion severity, tissue characterization, vessel sizing, and stent optimization.
      Current evidences suggest potential advantage of intracoronary imaging guidance in reducing
      the risk of major adverse cardiac events after stent implantation over conventional PCI under
      angiographic guidance alone. IVUS has been clinically used in two decades and it is known as
      one of the most dominant intracoronary imaging technique. OFDI is a new light-based
      intracoronary imaging technology which provides higher image resolution and higher-speed
      pullback compared to those of IVUS. Given the different properties between ultrasound-based
      IVUS and light-based OFDI, treatment and clinical impact of these two imaging techniques
      would be different.
