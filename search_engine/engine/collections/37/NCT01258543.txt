      diagnosis in the initial patient assessment is essential to choosing a specific treatment
      plan for that patient, regardless of the type of therapy the patient chooses to pursue.
      Evidence based medicine is the current gold standard for most manual-therapy professions, and
      there has been a great deal of research performed in an attempt to give credibility to the
      one tool that all manual therapy professions share in common: palpation. Few studies have
      been able to demonstrate an acceptable rate of inter-examiner reliability for palpation. This
      study will combine a global testing regime, consensus training for evaluators, and access to
      history of injury with symptomatic subjects to verify the inter-examiner reliability of an
      osteopathic evaluation on patients with chronic, non-specific low back pain.
