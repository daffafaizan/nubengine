    
      Purpose; The aim of this study is to adapt the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      Index (WOOS) specific to shoulder osteoarthritis, to Turkish and evaluate its validity and
      reliability.

      Methods; WOOS index was translated and culturally adapted to Turkish, systematically. It was
      applied to 68 patients with osteoarthritis of the shoulder treated conservatively. The
      reliability of the scale was checked through internal consistency and test-retest methods.
      Internal consistency was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha value. Test-retest reliability was
      assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient with 25 patients. The Western Ontario
      Rotator Cuff (WORC), The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and The Society of
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment (ASES) score were used
      to conduct concurrent validity.
