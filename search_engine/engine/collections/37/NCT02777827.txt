    
      This is a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, six-way
      William's design, crossover study to assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and
      safety of abediterol single dose, given by dry powder inhaler or pressurised metered-dose
      inhaler, in patients with asthma, on inhaled corticosteroids. During the screening period,
      all patients will take their own baseline inhaled corticosteroid for 2 weeks. Patients on
      long-acting Î²2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids will be switched over to the respective
      inhaled corticosteroid monocomponent. Patients will be provided salbutamol as rescue
      medication for use throughout the study. Abediterol is an investigational product in early
      stages of clinical development, therefore individual participants in the clinical studies may
      not have a clinical benefit, especially in view of alternative therapies (bronchodilators)
      being available for the treatment of asthma and COPD.
