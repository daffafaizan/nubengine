      progression. We aim to characterize both functionally and morphologically initial DR stages
      and to identify patients at risk of progression to centre involving macular oedema (CME)
      and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). We want to identify imaging patterns and
      characteristics that might be used as prognostic biomarkers for DR progression.

      For this, ischemia and blood-retinal barrier alteration will be assessed using non-invasive
      retinal imaging methodologies. SD-OCT with layer-by-layer segmentation will be performed.
      Furthermore, a state-of-the-art methodology with OCT-Angiography will be used for
      identification of areas of capillary drop-out and leakage areas will be identified on SD-OCT
      without the need of a dye injection. In a subgroup of patients we will study
      neurodegeneration patterns using multifocal ERG examination.
