      illness at various time points in the course of treatment of AIS. Three independent sets of
      questionnaires will be administered during a single scheduled clinical visit. There will be
      no clinical visits for the exclusive purpose of completing questionnaires. The first
      questionnaire will be the SRS outcome instrument. The second questionnaire will be the
      Achenbach YSR, completed by the adolescents, and the parents will be asked to complete the
      CBCL. Finally, a generic outcome measure specific to children and adolescents, the Pediatric
      Outcome Data Collection Instrument, will be administered. The time requirement to complete
      these questionnaires is anticipated to be approximately 45 minutes. The Achenbach
      questionnaires will be scored promptly after each is completed using the provided scoring
      templates. This data will be used to identify those at risk and make appropriate resources
      available. This would provide appropriate care for adolescents at high risk of mental health
      disorder by identifying those at risk via a non-invasive screening tool.
