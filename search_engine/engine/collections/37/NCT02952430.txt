      Collaborative(NWRC), consisting of surgical trainees with a successful record of publishing
      credible research and establishing clinical trials.

      Following ethical approval, data will be collected from NHS Trusts throughout the UK. Trained
      leads will facilitate data collection adhering to a study protocol and local clinical
      governance.

      Patients over 65 undergoing emergency laparotomy will be identified prospectively over 3
      months. Demographics, time to surgical intervention, length of stay(LOS), pre- and
      post-admission independence, intermediate care stay, Clavien-Dindo post-operative
      complications, 30-day mortality and 30-day re-admission data will be collected on a secure
      database. Pre-operative frailty will be assessed using the Rockwood Frailty Scale.

      500 patients are required for a statistically significant difference in primary outcome (30
      day mortality). Secondary outcome measures are complications, change in independence status
      and LOS. Outcomes will be analysed to compare the impact of frailty.
