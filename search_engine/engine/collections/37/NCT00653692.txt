      abstinence syndrome in multiply drug-dependent women. Previous research by this group of
      investigators has found that the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in methadone
      exposed infants is related to maternal vagal tone changes in response to methadone during
      pregnancy. While previous research has focused on drug abstinent, methadone maintained women,
      most drug dependent pregnant women are poly-substance abusers who also use prescription
      psychiatric medications, alcohol and nicotine. This protocol seeks to further our
      understanding of the effects of multiple drugs on the fetus, including the co-variate effects
      of maternal psychological status. Infant neurobehavior and vagal tone will also be evaluated.
      This research will extend our knowledge of fetal neurobehavioral development and neonatal
      abstinence syndrome in a realistic population of poly-drug dependent women, potentially
      altering the way in which these women are evaluated and their infants monitored and treated
      for neonatal abstinence syndrome.
