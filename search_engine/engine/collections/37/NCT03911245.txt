        -  Describe the prognostic factors of osteosarcoma in patients aged 40 years or older,
           treated at the Hospital de la Santa Creu and Sant Pau in Barcelona during the years
           1986-2016, as well as overall survival and disease-free survival.

        -  Quantify the frequency of limb salvage surgery and amputation, determining the influence
           of the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the definitive therapeutic management.

        -  Compare the results obtained with a group formed patients with a range of less than 40
           years, diagnosed and treated with osteosarcoma at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant
           Pau in Barcelona during the same period of years.

      The secondary objectives of this study are the following:

        -  Analyze the frequency of occurrence of local recurrence.

        -  Determine postoperative complications.

        -  Evaluate the frequency of distant spread of the disease.

        -  Describe the characteristics of the group of patients in the study.

        -  Demonstrate that the incidence of osteosarcoma in adulthood is increasing over the
           years.

        -  Determine predisposing factors or lesions to the appearance of osteosarcoma not
           described in the literature.
