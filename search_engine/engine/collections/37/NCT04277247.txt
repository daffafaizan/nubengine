      pain in Parkinson's disease (PD). Involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive
      movements or abnormal postures are common. The movements may be painful and present in
      different ways, from just foot inversion or hallux extension to complex forms. They may
      affect the quality of life of patients in different ways during both ON and OFF periods.
      Cures for foot dystonia symptoms in PD are not yet available. Yet, improving pain symptoms
      can improve patients' quality of life. BTXA has been proposed as a safe and useful option for
      the treatment of PD patients affected by foot dystonia as it could improve symptoms locally
      without modifying any antiparkinsonian medications. Injected into muscles, BTXA could reduce
      rigidity, stiffness and improve abnormal postures that may cause foot pain. Recognizing
      different uses of BTXA will help to understand the symptomatic treatment for each patient in
      any stage of the disease. The results will help doctors to use new tools to treat
      foot-dystonia pain in patients with PD.
