    
      This is a single-center, two-arms, parallel randomized controlled trial with concealed
      allocation, blinded measurers, with 12 weeks of follow-up analyzed using an
      intention-to-treat approach.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to the beach tennis training intervention (BTT) or to
      the control group (Con), which will not be submitted to intervention and will be instructed
      not to engage in any kind of structured physical exercise training and to keep the life
      activities identified at baseline. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)
      will be applied before and after the intervention in order to assess the level of physical
      activity.

      In BTT, supervised beach tennis sessions will be performed two times per week. Each session
      will be composed of an initial period of 10 min of warm up and technical exercises (i.e.,
      serve, volley, forehand and backhand). After that, 3 games of 10-15 min each (weeks 1-4: 3 ×
      10 min; weeks 5-8: 3 × 12 min; and weeks 9-12: 3 × 15 min) with an interval of 2 min between
      each game will be played in pairs (i.e., 2 versus 2). In case of less than 4 participants are
      able to play at the same time, the games can also be played individually (i.e., 1 versus1).
      In Con, participants will be advised to not change their daily usual activities and to not
      participate in any structured physical exercise program during this period.
