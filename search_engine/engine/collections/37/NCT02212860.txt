      patients with low-risk carcinoma of the breast. For the selected subset of patients with
      low-risk disease, it appears that intra-operative radiotherapy with a single fraction leads
      to acceptable clinical outcomes in terms of local control, overall survival and toxicity.
      There have also been a few Phase I dose escalation trials demonstrating safety with single
      fraction breast radiation.

      In this study, we propose the delivery of radiotherapy using only a single fraction, 21 Gy,
      but using stereotactic body radiation therapy. Radiation will be delivered using
      Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), planned on coregistered PET/MRI and CT imaging, and
      delivered prone. Our approach will potentially have numerous benefits, including
      significantly shortened treatment time, convenience and potentially reduced health care
      costs. It would significantly improve the quality of life of many patients.

      This study will also provide a unique opportunity for pathologic assessment of the impact of
      radiation at a microscopic level and on tumour markers without the confounding impact of
      systemic treatments, comparing pre- to post-radiation biopsy specimens for imaging and
      histologic predictors of radiation sensitivity.
