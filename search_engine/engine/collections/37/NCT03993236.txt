    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety on the target LDL-C goal
      achievement between rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg (rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg)
      once daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily in patients with recent ischemic stroke.

      The target LDL-C goal achievement rate in patients with recent ischemic stroke has not been
      well studied. In particular, no clinical studies have been conducted comparing the efficacy
      and safety of low-dose rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe with high-dose rosuvastatin single agent
      for achieving target LDL-C levels.

      In this trial, the investigators aim to compare the efficacy of the target LDL-C achievement
      between rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg (rosuvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg) and
      rosuvastatin 20 mg in patients with recent ischemic stroke.

      For this trial, more than 292 patients (584 total) per group will be enrolled.

      Subjects who were satisfied with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this trial and who
      agreed to participate in the clinical trial in writing were randomly assigned to a 1:1 ratio
      in the experimental group (the low-dose combination of rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe) and
      comparator group (high-dose rosuvastatin).

      The duration of administration of the drug for clinical trials is 90 days (Â±14 days), and the
      efficacy and safety evaluation parameters are compared with baseline.
