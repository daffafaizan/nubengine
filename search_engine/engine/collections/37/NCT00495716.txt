      orally twice daily (standard dose) versus episodic acyclovir for treatment of genital herpes
      recurrences. We will enroll 500 HSV-2 seropositive single persons (250 per arm), stratified
      by gender and history of symptomatic genital herpes, and prospectively follow them for 1 year
      to assess sexual behavior, adherence to therapy, and herpes-related quality of life. These
      outcomes will be measured by self-report in a confidential, computer-based assessment. We
      plan to use data from this trial to model the effect that increasing the proportion of
      sexually-active HSV-2 infected persons taking suppressive therapy will have on
      population-level incidence and prevalence of HSV-2.
