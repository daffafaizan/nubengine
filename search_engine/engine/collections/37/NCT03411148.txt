      analysis and balance testing, as well as a series of validated self-reported outcome scales
      addressing balance confidence, quality of life, and community integration. Participants are
      then provided a step activity monitor (SAM) and a global position sensing (GPS) tracker to be
      worn for one week, the data from which is linked and used to objectively quantify baseline
      community participation. At the conclusion of the one week, participants are randomized to
      one of two groups, each of which will last for 8 weeks. At the conclusion of the eight weeks,
      participants repeat baseline assessments and are again provided a SAM and GPS tracker to wear
      for one week. Baseline measures and activity monitoring occur again 8 and 16 weeks
      thereafter.
