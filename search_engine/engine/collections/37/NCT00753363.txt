      loss (WL) in older individuals on:

        1. adipokine secretion and expression (tumor necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin);

        2. adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inflammatory proximal receptor expression
           (adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression) and signaling pathways; and

        3. whether the changes in signal transduction are associated with changes in peripheral
           whole body insulin sensitivity by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

      The prevention and treatment of insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and their CVD
      complications through exercise and weight loss could improve Veterans' health and reduce
      health care costs. Knowledge of their effectiveness has important implications for the
      cardiovascular health of Veterans given the widespread adverse health effects of chronic
      inflammation on vascular biology, skeletal muscle function and insulin action.
