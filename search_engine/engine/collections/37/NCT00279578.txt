      severe haemophilia A after they receive recombinat factor VIII and after addition of
      tranexamic acid. Our hypothesis is that addition of tranexamic increases the clot stability.
      The perpective of the study is to document whether it is relevant to use traneksamic acid in
      surgery in patients with severe haemophilia A.
