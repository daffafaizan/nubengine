      facilitate life-saving surgery and other essential surgical or medical procedures. In the
      past two decades, mounting evidence from animal and clinical studies have raised concerns
      that general anesthetics may produce harmful effects in the developing brain and lead to
      adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Factors that may influence the degree of injury include
      age at the time of drug exposure/surgery and cumulative anesthetic dose.

      The Intelligence Quotients of pediatric patients with intracranial tumors are lower when
      compared with healthy children of same age. The investigators suppose that these patients are
      more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of general anesthetics. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha
      2-adrenoceptor agonist that provides sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia, and has been shown
      to be safe to the brain in animal studies. In clinical studies, the use of dexmedetomidine
      decreases the consumption of anesthetics and opioids during general anesthesia and suppresses
      stress response induced by surgery. The investigators hypothesize that dexmedetomidine, when
      used as an adjuvant to general anesthesia, can reduce the neurotoxic effects of general
      anesthetics by decreasing anesthetic consumption and inhibiting stress response.

      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled pilot study is to
      investigate whether dexmedetomidine, when used as an adjuvant to general anesthesia, can
      decrease the harmful effects of anesthesia and surgery on intelligence development of
      pediatric patients undergoing craniotomy.
