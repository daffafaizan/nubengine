      incident cardiovascular events. Diabetes affects arterial vasodilation by reducing the
      bioavailability of NO and more in general affecting the balance between the atheroprotective
      and atherothrombotic properties of the endothelium. A consistent number of studies has so far
      documented that Mediterranean-style diet associates with reduced risk of cardiovascular
      diseases and diabetes. Intake of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), that is a common but not
      necessary ingredient of the Mediterranean diet, seems to further enhance the beneficial
      cardiovascular effect and reduce the incidence of diabetes. We have designed the present
      study to test whether EVOO supplementation acutely influences endothelial function in T1DM.
      EVOO supplementation wil be compared to butter supplementation in the context of a high
      glycemic index (GI) meal that is known to increase PP glycemic burden.
