      Patients referred for MRI for possible prostate cancer will be invited to take part in the
      study. Following consent, participants will have an additional MRI sequence performed during
      their routine MRI called Double Inversion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DIR-MRI). Participants
      scan images and prostate biopsy histology report (if applicable) will be reviewed by the
      research team. The research team will look at the variability of LNR score amongst the two
      scan typed and the DCE-MRI and DIR-MRI images will be correlated with biopsy results to give
      an indication of the accuracy.
