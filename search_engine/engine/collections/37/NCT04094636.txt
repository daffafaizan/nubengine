      increased focus on mobilization, hospitalization is associated with bed rest. Bed rest with
      low levels of physical activity leads to functional deline as well as increased risk of
      complications.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial, which investigates the effect of standard usual
      care combined with daily supervised physical training in patients hospitalized with CAP
      compared to standard usual care alone.
