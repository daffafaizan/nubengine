      accepted therapeutic strategies include bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and
      immunosuppression, both offering cure or amelioration in the majority of patients. Although
      BMT is successful using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling bone marrow, the 25%
      probability of finding an HLA identical sibling within a family renders this approach
      available to only a minority of patients. BMT utilizing HLA-matched, unrelated donors carries
      a high risk of treatment failure along with considerable toxicity. While combined
      immunosuppression with both antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA) produces
      hematologic improvement in most patients, relapse is common, occurring in about a third of
      responders. Late evolution of aplastic anemia to other serious hematologic disorders is a
      significant problem following successful treatment with ATG/CSA with paroxysmal nocturnal
      hemoglobinuria (PNH) occurs in approximately 13%, myelodysplasia in about 10%, and acute
      leukemia in about 7%. Recently, results of immunosuppression in SAA with another potent
      immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide, were reported in 10 patients. In this small group,
      the overall response rate was similar to that seen with ATG/CSA, but relapse and late clonal
      disease were not seen during a median follow-up of greater than 10 years. In the larger
      randomized trial proposed here, we will compare sustained hematologic response rates to
      either conventional immunosuppression with ATG/CSA or high dose cyclophosphamide and CSA.
      Secondary endpoints include response duration, event free survival, and overall survival.
