      bone marrow failure syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, metabolic disorders and primary immune
      deficiencies. While survival of these patients is typically better than survival of patients
      with malignancies, toxicities of conditioning regimens and failure of engraftment remain
      challenges. Most children with non-malignant disorders present with normocellular or even
      hypercellular bone marrow, posing a barrier to engraftment and requiring intensive
      conditioning. Commonly used backbone of busulfan and fludarabine, although well tolerated,
      results in variable engraftment, in particular with mismatched unrelated donors and cord
      blood recipients. In this study, the investigators test 2 dose levels of thiotepa (5 mg/kg
      and 10 mg/kg) added to the backbone of targeted reduced dose IV busulfan, fludarabine and
      rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) in order to determine the minimum effective dose
      required for reliable engraftment. Subjects are stratified in groups A and B based the risk
      of graft failure.
