    
      In this 4-week observational study conducted between May 2010 and May 2011 at 2 US academic
      clinical study sites, 12 adults with bipolar disorder and 16 adults with schizophrenia (all
      diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria) utilized a digital health feedback system (DHFS). All
      subjects were on a stable regimen of oral medication. The DHFS utilized a digital tablet,
      consisting of an ingestion sensor that was embedded in a tablet containing nonpharmacologic
      excipients, which subjects coingested with their regularly prescribed medication.

      The primary study objective was to compare the accuracy of DHFS in confirming digital tablet
      ingestion versus a method of directly observed ingestion; secondary aims included
      characterization of adherence and physiologic measures longitudinally in these cohorts.
