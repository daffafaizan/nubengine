      Research Center (ARC), Fairview University-Riverside Campus. In addition to the interview
      assessment, we will ask you to complete a set of questionnaires about your behavior and mood.
      This first visit will last approximately 2.5-3 hours. Following the interview assessment, if
      you are eligible for the MRI study we will contact you to schedule an MRI scan on a separate
      visit. This visit will last approximately 2 hours. At this visit you will have an MRI scan of
      your brain. Prior to the MRI scan, you will have a practice session in an MRI simulator.
