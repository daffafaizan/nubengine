    
      Eligible participants in this study are randomized to receive either artesunate or placebo
      vaginal inserts for the treatment of CIN2/3. Both groups receive three 5-day cycles of the
      respective drug, at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Dosing visits can be done as telehealth visits
      (medication is mailed to the patient's home). Participants are followed closely with
      colposcopies at weeks 6, 15, and 28. After the week 15 colposcopy visit the investigator is
      unblinded. Participants in the placebo group who still have CIN2/3 have the option to start
      treatment with artesunate within 4 weeks. Participants in the artesunate treatment who still
      have CIN2/3 at the week 15 visit, will undergo standard of care surgical treatment (LEEP or
      cold knife conization) within 6 weeks.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the histopathologic regression after three 5-day cycles of
      artesunate vaginal inserts in adult females with biopsy-proven HPV-associated CIN 2/3.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of artesunate vaginal inserts for the treatment of CIN2/3

        -  To evaluate the viral clearance after three 5-day cycles of artesunate vaginal inserts
           in adult females with biopsy-proven HPV-associated CIN 2/3.

        -  To evaluate histopathologic regression after the week 15 time point
