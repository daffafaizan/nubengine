      Incontinence (UI) because of their anatomical characteristics. Their participation in the
      sports field has been more active recently. There are studies that correlate the race with
      presenting weakness of the SP muscles and Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), so the race is
      considers as a risk factor for these affectations. However, there are few studies of
      real-time measurements during running. Some runners may even present SUI during daily
      activities (ADL). The UI is not only a physical problem but also affects the social,
      emotional, psychological, sexual and professional level and may even lower their self-esteem
      or renounce the physical activity.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to perform measurements of different variables in
      real time while running and in their ADL. The main objective is to analyze the relationship
      between the PF muscles and the other variables along the different tasks of daily life and
      during the race. The secondary objectives are to differentiate these neuromuscular,
      physiological and biomechanical responses of PF and abdominal girdle (AG) according to the
      type of stroke, duration, intensity and distance. And compare results between both group
      (interventional group and no interventional group).

      Material and method: Randomized clinical trial will be performed with 59 female runners aged
      25-44 years. The sample will be divided into two groups randomly. The study will be carried
      out health center called "Tiro de Pichón" in Málaga.
