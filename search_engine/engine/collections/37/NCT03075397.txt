        -  our expertise of HIV in semen and male genital tract and our experience in organotypic
           cultures;

        -  a network of infectious diseases and reproductive biology clinicians to collect, analyze
           and process seminal cells and seminal plasma from HIV+ donors;

        -  the expertise in confocal microscopy and ex vivo colo-rectal model. State of the art
           culture of colo-rectal tissues, primary cell culture and infection, confocal microscopy,
           flow cytometry, Polymerase Chain Reaction and Luminex assays for cytokine measurements
           will be the methodologies primarily used in this project.
