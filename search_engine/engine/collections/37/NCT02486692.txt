      disorder (PTSD) related to their military experience. Treatment is widely available to
      Veterans with PTSD, and national dissemination initiatives have increased Veterans' access to
      best practice interventions. However, treatment seeking remains strikingly low among Veterans
      with PTSD. In fact, most Veterans with PTSD do not seek mental health services due to
      perceived stigma and other associated barriers. The National Center for PTSD recently
      developed and launched AboutFace, a peer education resource for Veterans. The investigators
      of this study believe that AboutFace has tremendous potential to reduce stigma and improve
      attitudes toward seeking mental health services among Veterans. However, it has not yet been
      evaluated. Investigators have partnered with the National Center for PTSD to launch this
      mixed methods pilot evaluation of AboutFace. There will be two phases to this study. During
      Phase I- Usability, 20 Veterans will be recruited to participate in individual interviews
      during which they will be asked to describe the ease of use of the AboutFace website for the
      researchers. During Phase II- Feasibility, 60 Veterans will be randomized to one of two
      conditions- About Face or Usual Care. All participants will complete several brief
      assessments measuring PTSD symptoms and attitudes toward seeking mental health services.
      Participants will then be randomized to either receive a link to the About Face website or to
      receive a link to a general online brochure about PTSD. After two weeks, participants will
      complete the assessment measures once again to determine any changes in attitudes toward
      seeking mental health services and potential changes in PTSD symptoms.
