    
      Primary goals The primary trial goal is to assess the etiologic mechanisms of myocardial
      damage in patients with MINOCA as well as to evaluate a variety of therapeutic strategies for
      these patients.

      Secondary goals

        1. To assess functional and morphological myocardial changes in patients with MINOCA;

        2. To assess the true prevalence and prognostic relevance of MINOCA (all-cause mortality
           and MACE);

        3. To test the effect of conventional acute MI therapies (BB, ACEI, ARB, CCB, statins,
           anti-platelet agents) on MACE (death and myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality
           in patients with MINOCA;

        4. To test the diagnostic and prognostic role of several biomarkers (sST2, BNP, cTnI, CRP,
           copeptin, procalcitonin, MR-proADM, galectin-3) in patients with MINOCA;

        5. To assess the impact of MINOCA with respect to chronic health status, such as persistent
           angina symptoms, impairment in quality of life, and depression;

        6. To evaluate systemic microcirculation status and assess its effect on long term
           outcomes.

        7. To evaluate hospital mortality and all-cause death within 6 and 12 months follow-up;

        8. To determine recurrent hospitalizations within 30-days, 6 and 12 months follow-up;

        9. To assess peak creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB and troponin levels during hospital
           stay;

       10. To determine quality of life at 6 and 12 months assessed using the Euroqol 5D (EQ-5D)
           questionnaire (www.euroqol.org).
