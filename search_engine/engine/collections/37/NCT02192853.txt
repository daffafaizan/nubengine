      insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are secreted from the intestinal L- and K- cells,
      respectively in response to ingestion of nutrients. The two hormones are able to lower blood
      glucose levels during high glucose levels - by the so called incretin effect. GIP and GLP-1
      are both rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). The remaining
      metabolites are without insulinotropic effects. The effect of DPP-4 inhibitors used in
      treatment of type 2 diabetes relies on their impact on DPP-4 activity.

      DPP-4 exists in a soluble form in plasma ad as a membrane-bound form in blood vessels and
      other tissues. The impact of DPP-4 inhibitors on DPP-4 activity has only been evaluated in
      plasma. We aim to investigate plasma and endothelial DPP-4 activity (i.e. whole-body DPP-4
      activity) in patients with type 2 diabetes during different doses of the DPP-4 inhibitor
      sitagliptin.

      Both healthy control subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes are subjected to 4
      experimental days (in a randomized order) with continuous infusion of GLP-1 and pre-treatment
      with 25 mg sitagliptin, 100 mg sitagliptin, 200 mg sitagliptin and placebo, respectively.
      Afterwards, we are going to measure the whole-body DPP-4 activity by comparing plasma levels
      of active (intact) GLP-1 and total GLP-1, and relate to plasma DPP-4 activity.
