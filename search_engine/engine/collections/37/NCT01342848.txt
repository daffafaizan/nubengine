      Several trials have documented a reduction in the occurrence of periprocedural MI through
      various pharmacological strategies, with enhanced inhibition of platelet aggregation or high
      dose statins. However, real-world registries still document an incidence of periprocedural MI
      in 30-40% of patients. Currently available intravascular imaging techniques, Intravascular
      Ultrasound (IVUS) and more recently available Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allow a
      precise evaluation of the coronary plaque and can be extremely useful for monitoring plaque
      modifications obtained with thrombus aspiration (TA). Plaque burden will be assessed as
      plaque + media (P+M), commonly measured with IVUS by subtracting lumen (L) to external
      elastic membrane (EEM) cross sectional area (P+M= EEM-L).

      Expecting a mean plaque volume of 160Â±50 mm3 in a population of patients with ACS undergoing
      PCI, a sample size of at least 45 patients (52 lesions) with a recent (<15 days, but after 24
      hours) STEMI or a non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS within 72 hours of symptoms would provide a 90%
      power to detect a 20% reduction in the plaque volume after TA with an alpha (probability
      value) of 0.05.
