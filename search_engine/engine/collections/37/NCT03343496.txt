      intubation. However, several problems of AFOI are existing including long operation time,
      patients' strong discomfort, coughing and resistance. And, to investigators' knowledge, there
      was a lack of a fixed procedure for the implementation of AFOI. Investigators conducted the
      research and aimed to study the simplification and feasibility of a new AFOI method based on
      years of clinical theory, practice and experience.
