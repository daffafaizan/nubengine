    
      In this trial we are comparing two types of urostomy bags - the SenSura 1-piece and
      Hollisters Moderma Flex.

      Both products are CE-marked, meaning that they are safe and approved in use for people with
      an urostomy.

      Population 30 urostomy operated people from UK will participate in the trial. Only
      participants who normally use a flat 1-piece urostomy bag can participate. It is very
      important that the participants keep their normal use- and change pattern. Furthermore they
      need to be over 18 years old, have had the urostomy for more than 3 months, the size of the
      urostomy shall be between 15-55 mm, otherwise the bag will not fit them and then they should
      be able to handle the bags themselves and be willing to use the two products tested in the
      trial.
