      MK-3577 25 mg twice daily (BID), metformin 1000 mg BID, and placebo to MK-3577/placebo to
      metformin. Participants were to be randomized to one of 14 treatment sequence arms. A subset
      of participants in each group was to domicile (stay overnight) at selected clinical sites at
      Baseline, Week 4 (end of Period 1), and Week 8 (end of Period 2) to undergo 24-hr blood
