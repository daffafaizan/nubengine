      Herb-partition moxibustion (Treatment Group) and b) Sham herb-partition moxibustion (Control
      Group). All patients in the trial will be treated with moxibustion 3 times a week, once a day
      for 30 minutes, for a total of 12 weeks. After treating the treatment had ended and the 52nd
      week of follow-up to observe the clinical therapy effect of Moxibustion in UC patients.
      Tissue morphology and molecular biology tests will be conducted to observe the regulation in
      the intestinal mucosa of UC patients. All these steps will be done in order to provide
      clinical usage for the effects of herb-partition moxibustion in the treatment of UC.
