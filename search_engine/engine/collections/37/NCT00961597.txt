      with success rates that vary from 57% to 100%. Meniscus repairs that fail in this region
      usually require subsequent removal, which essentially results in loss of the majority of
      meniscal function and risk of future disabling osteoarthritis. This study will determine if
      the addition of platelet rich plasma increases the success rate of complex meniscus repairs
      of longitudinal, horizontal, or radial tears in the red-white region. The investigators have
      over two decades of experience with clinical studies of meniscus repairs in patients whose
      age ranged from 9 to 58 years. Those investigations revealed an average success rate in terms
      of retention of meniscus tissue of 80%. However, meniscus tears classified as horizontal,
      radial, double longitudinal, and complex multiplanar had success rates of 71-73% which
      prompted the need for an adjunct therapeutic measure, such as platelet rich plasma, to
      increase the healing potential in these cases.
