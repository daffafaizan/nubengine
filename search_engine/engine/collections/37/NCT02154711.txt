      The first visit is a "screening" visit to ensure eligibility. This includes fasting blood
      tests. The second visit is an MRI scanning session. This also takes around 2 - 3 hours, with
      no more than 1.5 hours spent in the actual MRI machine. It may be possible to complete these
      two visits on the same day. Otherwise, the MRI session should occur within 3 months of the
      screening visit. In addition, an optional physical capacity visit will occur on the same day
      as the MRI session.
