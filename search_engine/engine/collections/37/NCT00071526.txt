      concentrations than non-diabetic subjects. Although urinary vitamin C loss in diabetic
      subjects was reported to be increased in two studies, these are difficult to interpret due to
      lack of controlled vitamin C intake, inadequate sampling, lack of control subjects, or
      methodology uncertainties in vitamin C assay and sample processing. Consequently, it is
      unclear whether diabetic subjects truly have both low plasma and high urine vitamin C
      concentrations. We propose that low plasma vitamin C concentrations in diabetic subjects are
      due in part to inappropriate renal loss of vitamin C in these subjects but not in healthy
      controls. We will study vitamin C concentrations in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
      and in matched healthy research subjects. Vitamin C concentrations in plasma, neutrophils (as
      a proxy for tissue concentrations) and in urine will be measured in outpatients. In those
      willing to be admitted to the Clinical Center, we will measure 24-hour urinary excretion of
      vitamin C while on a vitamin C free diet, and creatinine clearance, a measure of glomerular
      filtration rate. On day 2 of the inpatient study, subjects will receive a single 200mg dose
      of oral vitamin C and we will measure vitamin C concentrations in frequent blood and urine
      samples to determine the renal threshold and relative bioavailability for vitamin C. Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be determined in genomic DNA responsible for the two
      proteins mediating sodium-dependent vitamin C transport, SVCT1 and SVCT2. If low plasma and
      high urine vitamin C concentrations are found in diabetic subjects, further studies will be
      needed to explore mechanisms and to determine recommended dietary allowances for this patient
      population.
