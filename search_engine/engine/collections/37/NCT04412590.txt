      focus on the entire family, recognize the central role of emotional and behavioral health in
      relation to all health, use evidence-based health promotion in addition to evidence based
      treatment of existing problems, and intervene early in children's life.

      The VFBA is a public health framework for evidence-based health promotion, prevention, and
      treatment that is delivered from the family perspective and emphasizes emotional and
      behavioral health.

      The study was a pilot RCT of the VFBA in a primary care pediatrics clinic. The goals of the
      study were to test whether the VFBA would (1) be feasible in primary care pediatrics and (2)
      would lead to improved emotional and behavioral health and health-related quality of life or
      children and parents. Families were recruited at the pediatric clinic and randomized to the
      VFBA or Control conditions.

      The VFBA group received family-based assessment of emotional and behavioral health and family
      functioning, family wellness coaching, and a menu of cost-free wellness activities, such as
      parent and child violin instruction, yoga and mindfulness training, and nutrition counseling.
      Where indicated by results of family-based assessment, families in the VFBA group also
      received family-based, evidence-based psychotherapy and psychiatric care. Families in the
      Control group received pediatric primary care, as usual.
