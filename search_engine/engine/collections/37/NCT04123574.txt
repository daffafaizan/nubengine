      before and after drug exposure, will permit the evaluation of target modulation and
      assessment of immune effector cell infiltration into the tumor and the generation of relevant
      immune cytokines.

      In this study, BXCL701 will be administered at a dose of 0.3 mg, twice daily for a total
      daily dose of 0.6mg (the previously defined maximum tolerated dose [MTD] of the drug), to all
      patients for a short period of 14 days. This study is designed to assess the biochemical and
      immunomodulatory effects of BXCL701 in pancreatic cancer.
