      Catholic University of Korea. Patients with diabetes mellitus who received insulin are
      retrospectively enrolled. Among those, only patients who underwent coronary CT scan for more
      than two times will be included. Included patients will be classified into DPP4-inhibitor
      group and no DPP4-inhibitor group according to the prescribed medication. Mean change in
