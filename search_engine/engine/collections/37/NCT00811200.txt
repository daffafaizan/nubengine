    
      Approximately 30-40% of patients develop a deterioration of visual acuity within 5 years
      after treatment of uveal melanoma using radiation therapy and TTT due to radiation
      retinopathy (Shields 2002, Bartlema 2003). By administration of either Lucentis® or
      Triamcinolone® we hope to treat complications of radiation therapy, by demonstrating a
      statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and a reduced amount of macular edema
      and vascular leakage. Additionally, we hope to obtain a better understanding of the
      pathophysiologic processes involved, by demonstrating a possible relation between high levels
      of angiogenic factors (VEGF) in the anterior chamber fluid, and radiation retinopathy. In
      conclusion, we hope to provide evidence for a new therapy in patients with retinopathy, due
      to radiation in uveal melanoma. There is no scientifically proven treatment available at this
      time.
