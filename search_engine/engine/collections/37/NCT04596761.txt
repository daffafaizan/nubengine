    
      This is a parallel group, single-blind, randomized, and controlled prospective study aimed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ToothWave in calculus reduction and prevention of
      calculus accumulation.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a dental prophylaxis, and will enter a two-month run-in phase.
      A Volpe-Manhold Index (V-MI) calculus examination will be per-formed at the end of the run-in
      phase. A minimum of 90 qualified subjects (completers) who will form at least 9 mm of
      calculus on the lingual surface of the mandibular anterior teeth and will qualify to continue
      participation ac-cording to the eligibility criteria and will be randomly assigned to either
      the ToothWave or the control brush (ADA-accepted powered TB) group. Subjects will be
      stratified according to calculus levels (which indicates the calculus growth rate).
      Stratification will also be conducted according to age, gender, and ethnic group. Subjects
      will brush twice daily, unsupervised, during a three-month test period, returning at Weeks 3,
      6 and 12 for safety and V-MI examinations. An additional visit will be conducted at week 9,
      during which a supervised brushing will be conducted.

      The study test phase will include a total of 168 treatment sessions and 5 clinic visits over
      a period of 12 weeks.

      For each subject, assessment data will be collected at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 weeks of
      the test phase. The average data sets will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed 2 minutes of teeth brushing in a regular manner, twice a day
      (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken using the ToothWave and standard fluoride
      toothpaste. The control group will use a regular powered toothbrush and standard fluoride
      toothpaste.
