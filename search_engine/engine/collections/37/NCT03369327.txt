      organization (WHO) a main group requiring treatment are subjects co-infected with HIV. These
      subjects offer a particular challenge as they are receiving ART which frequently interferes
      with hepatitis treatment. The number of pills they are already taking also limits the
      compliance of these patients.

      In order to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed-dose combination pill combined of 400 mg
      sofosbuvir and 30, 60, or 90 mg of daclatasvir - depending on the particular ART medicine
      being used by the patient - a multi-center study of 200 co-infected patients has been
      designed.

      The treatment duration will be 12 weeks for subjects without cirrhosis and 24 weeks for those
      with cirrhosis.

      The study is one of the pilots being run for hepatitis C elimination in Iran.
