      strategy of delivering a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in
      patients eligible for breast conserving therapy (with the addition of whole breast
      radiotherapy in those patients at high risk of recurrence elsewhere in the breast [e.g.
      lobular carcinomas and extensive intraductal component]) is equivalent to a conventional
      course of post-operative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The primary endpoints are local
      and loco-regional recurrence rates. It is a pragmatic trial in which each participating
      centre has the option to define more restrictive entry criteria than in the core protocol.
      Only centres with access to the IntrabeamÂ® (Carl Zeiss) enter patients into the trial.
      Eligible patients are those with tumours of good prognosis suitable for breast conserving
      surgery. After giving consent patients are randomised to either IORT or to EBRT. They may
      receive any other adjuvant treatments as deemed necessary, except for neoadjuvant therapy.
      The protocol requires that patients be followed at six monthly intervals for five years and
      then annually.
