      induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in obese and non obese patients. However,
      current propofol PK models, used in TCI devices, were derived from studies that did not
      include obese patients. A controversial issue for propofol dose adjustment in this population
      has been the selection of an adequate size descriptor to scale PK parameters, as drug
      administration based on total body weight can result in overdose, and conversely,
      administration based on ideal body weight can result in a sub-therapeutic dose. In a previous
      study from our group, we developed a PK model capable of characterizing the influence of
      obesity on propofol disposition. The purpose of this study is to validate this model to
      administer propofol in obese patients.
