      people with schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment sequences which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 500 mg followed by matching placebo

        -  Matching placebo followed by TAK-831 50 mg

      The first 16 participants will receive TAK-831 500 mg during the treatment period in which
      they are assigned to TAK-831. Following an interim analysis, there will be a study-wide
      decision about whether to treat the additional 16 participants with TAK-831 500 mg during the
      active treatment period to or treat them with TAK-831 50 mg during this period. After the
      interim analysis, the participant and study doctor will not be aware of which TAK-831 dose is
      being used.

      This single center trial will be conducted in United States of America. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 81 days. Two treatment periods will be
      administered for 8 consecutive days, separated by a 14 to 21-day washout. Participants will
      be admitted to the clinic for two overnight stays at the beginning of each treatment period
      and one night at the end of each treatment period. After the second treatment period, a final
      follow-up safety assessment visit will be conducted approximately 10 to 14 days after the
      last administration of study drug.
