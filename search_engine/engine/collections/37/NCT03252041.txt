      options and a lack of available resources. Their physicians were likewise perplexed, despite
      the endless acquisition of negative laboratory and imaging data as well as inconclusive
      consultations obtained. In the last 10 years, improved scientiﬁc understanding and increased
      physician awareness have lessened the confusion surrounding this condition and its distinct
      association with pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). Furthermore, reﬁnements of medical and
      minimally invasive surgical solutions give affected patients more therapeutic choices today.

      Since anatomical venous variations in the pelvis are common, it is important to know the
      anatomy of these vessels for treatment planning. Imaging is critical in the evaluation of
      pelvic varices, both to differentiate them from other condition and also because pelvic
      varices may be secondary to serious underlying pathology, such as inferior vena caval
      obstruction, portal hypertension, increased pelvic blood flow, and vascular malformations.

      The diagnosis of PCS has usually been suggested by duplex ultrasound (US), but ultrasound
      imaging does not readily show the gonadal veins. Phlebography is the "gold standard" for
      anatomic diagnostic studies. Related mortality and morbidity are low, but patient discomfort
      and costs make this an unattractive routine method of diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) can usually demonstrate pelvic and ovarian varices, as well as the gonadal veins.

      In this prospective study, we will investigate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance
      venography (MRV) in the diagnosis of PCS and evaluated its accuracy and reliability in
      comparison to phlebography.
