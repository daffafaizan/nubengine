      Baseline (After decision to use the temporary naso-duodenal tube (approximately 2-14 days)
      and after signature of the Patient Authorization/Informed Consent Form); Visit 1 (V1): At
      discharge from hospital; Visit 2 (V2): 3 months after discharge; Visit 3 (V3): 6 months after
      discharge; Visit 4 (V4): 12 months after discharge.

      All participants have a temporary naso-duodenal tube used initially with the infusion pump to
      determine if the participant responds favorably to this method of treatment and to optimize
      the dose of Duodopa before permanent treatment is started.

      Participants who choose a treatment other than Duodopa after the temporary naso-duodenal test
      phase are considered for the Standard of Care group. Participants who go on to select
      Apomorphine pump or Deep Brain Stimulation at any stage are not eligible to continue in this
      group or to continue in the observational period of study.

      Participants who continue to with Duodopa treatment after the the temporary naso-duodenal
      test phase are the Duodopa group.
