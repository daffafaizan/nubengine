      increased CD4+ cell counts which may retard HIV disease progression. Using a smaller patient
      sampling, this Phase II study helps develop the clinical experience needed to consider
      formation of a larger, more complete Phase III trial.

      Seventy-two HIV-infected patients (previously treated or naive) are randomized independently
      to receive either control therapy with antiretrovirals alone OR escalating doses of
      subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretrovirals. In the absence of dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) in at least 9 of 12 patients in Group 1, 12 additional patients are entered
      into Group 2 and treated as indicated. In the absence of DLT in 9 of 12 patients in Group 2,
      the final 12 patients are entered into Group 3. Those patients enrolled in either of the
      first 2 dose groups who complete 3 courses of therapy have their dose escalated to a maximum
      dose. A course of treatment is defined as 5 days of IL-2 plus antiretrovirals followed by 7
      weeks of antiretroviral therapy alone.
