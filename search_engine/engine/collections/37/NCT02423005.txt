      conducted in the United States of America (USA) employing Neuromuscular Electrical
      Stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles of women suffering from stress
      urinary incontinence.

      Approximately one-hundred and eighty (180) female patients diagnosed with stress urinary
      incontinence will be enrolled in this study. All patients who are considered eligible to
      participate in the clinical study and give consent will be randomised to complete either a
      12-week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital Compact device or a 12-week treatment
      programme with the itouch Sure Pelvic Floor Exerciser. The 12-week treatment programme will
      be completed by the subjects at home with treatment with the device in accordance with the
      device Instructions for Use.

      Subjects included in the clinical study will be evaluated at screening, on enrolment into the
      study (baseline) and during the 12-week treatment programme at 4 and 12 weeks. A telephone
      call will be made at 1 week to check on the patient's progress. In addition, subjects will be
      evaluated at 26 week following their commencement of the treatment.
