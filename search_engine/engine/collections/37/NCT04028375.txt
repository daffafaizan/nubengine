      StarVIBE, and iShim-DWI in evaluating the preoperative TN staging and prediction of response
      to neoadjuvant therapy and OS in patients with gastric cancer.

      Patients with endoscopically biopsy-proven gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled for
      imaging on CT and a 3T MRI scanner . The MRI protocol included T2-TSE-BLADE, T2
      maps,iShim-DWI(diffusion weighted imaging,DWI)and StarVIBE sequences, and so on. Patients
      received treatment according to NCCN guideline(the National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network,NCCN). Readers assigned a TN stage on CT and MRI, and post-operative pathologic
      confirmation was considered the gold standard.

      Inter-reader agreement, the diagnostic accuracy of TN staging on CT and MRI were analyzed and
      compared to post-operative pathologic TN staging separately. MRI features were analyzed to
      find the correlation between pretreatment MRI features and response or OS. The study will
      include 400 patients. Inter-reader agreements of TN staging were analyzed excellent for CT
      and MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI will be calculated separately.
