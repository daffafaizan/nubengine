    
      This study is an open-label assessment of the feasibility of treating adolescents with
      psychotic disorders (schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not
      otherwise specified [NOS], major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and bipolar
      disorder with psychotic features) in an inpatient and day hospital setting with ziprasidone
      (Geodon). Ziprasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) that is FDA-approved for the
      treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of the manic phase of bipolar disorder in
      adults. It is also used clinically in the treatment of psychotic disorders in children,
      adolescents and adults. This protocol will help to elucidate the feasibility of studying the
      treatment of psychotic disorders with ziprasidone in adolescents 13-17 years and help
      facilitate the further study of the treatment of psychosis with novel agents that have a
      favorable side effect and weight gain profile.

      The duration of the study can be up to 7 weeks. Depending on the level of symptom severity
      patients will be managed on either the Schizophrenia Research Unit (SRU) (GAS<35, CGI-S>5),
      or the Children's Day Unit (CDU) of the NYSPI. The seven weeks would encompass a 3 day period
      at the beginning of the study including time for screening and reviewing lab results. Over a
      period of one to two weeks patients will be titrated up to 120 mg/day (80 mg for patients
      under 45kg), and, if necessary, cross tapered off of another SGA that had not been working
      successfully. Subjects who do not respond to the medication after 1 week at the target dose
      will be discontinued from the study.
