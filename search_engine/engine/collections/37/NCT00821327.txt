      (UC), the evidence supporting co-targeting of VEGFR2 and PDGF, the safety and efficacy of
      single-agent sunitinib in patients with UC, and preclinical evidence of synergy with the
      combination of sunitinib and cisplatin, the evaluation of sunitinib in combination with
      gemcitabine plus cisplatin in previously untreated patients with metastatic UC is warranted.
