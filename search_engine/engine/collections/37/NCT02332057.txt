      have mixed results.We think that the combination of diclofenac and lidocaine gel could be
      more successful in relieving pain during IUD insertion than single therapy.The aim of this
      study is to determine the effectiveness of a combination of diclofenac and lidocaine gel in
      reducing pain during IUD insertion.
