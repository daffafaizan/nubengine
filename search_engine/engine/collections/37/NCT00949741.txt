      Lymphoma are at high risk of CNS relapse. For this reason is recommended a prophylaxis
      therapy. This suggests that negative leptomeningeal localization patients at diagnosis are
      really positive and that would be a very high risk of CNS relapse subtype patients. It's very
      important detecting neoplastic cells in cerebrospinal fluid as soon as possible. This study
      will evaluate only patients that have been flow cytometry and cytology at diagnosis.
