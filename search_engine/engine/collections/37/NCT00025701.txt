    
      Objective

        -  To find and quantify EEG/MEG correlates of cortical center-surround organization and
           intracortical inhibition.

        -  To compare these between healthy volunteers and focal hand dystonia (FHD) patients.

      Study Population

      - Healthy volunteers and FHD patients.

      Design

      - The study has two separate arms aiming to examine the same question. In the first one
      subjects perform a 4-choice contingence negative variation (CNT) type motor task while
      multi-channel EEG and EMG are recorded. In the second arm somatosensory evoked potentials
      (SEPs) or fields (SEFs) are recorded to median nerve stimulation.

      Outcome Measures

      - First arm: EEG band-power difference between "center" and "surround". Second arm: number,
      amplitude, and power of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) component of SEPs/SEFs.
