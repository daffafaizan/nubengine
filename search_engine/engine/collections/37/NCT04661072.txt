    
      Aim 1: To identify female subjects diagnosed with a Congenital Uterine Anomaly (CUA)
      receiving care at Yale New Haven Health.

      Aim 2: Identify (i) the prevalence of renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers
      associated with CUAs, and (ii) the association of environmental factors, via a survey
      obtained by phone, email or interview.

      Aim 3: Conduct genetic evaluation of the index subjects, parents, sister(s) (as feasible),
      and female offspring to identify potential causes and patterns of inheritance using whole
      exome sequencing (WES) and microarray.

      Following informed consent, blood will be collected for genetic evaluation. DNA will be
      extracted from EDTA-blood and analyzed using an integrated approach of microarray for copy
      number variations (CNV), and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for Single Nucleotide Variation
      (SNV).

      Undertaking review of the medical records will identify the cohort of patients we wish to
      survey to then ascertain further information regarding their CUA diagnosis and other related
      details. The information to be elicited from the survey are outlined in the attached survey
      questions. Key associations we seek to investigate include (1) the type and prevalence of
      renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers among patients with Mullerian Anomaly,
      and (2) identifying potential in-utero exposure to particular environmental agents in
      patients with CUAs.

      Review of the medical records will enable us to undertake this first key step of establishing
      a cohort of subjects with MA and an initial data set related to their specific health
      information. We anticipate further investigations may build upon this initial data set, both
      with the cohort established, and more broadly with collaborators and additional national and
      international cohorts of patients with MA.
