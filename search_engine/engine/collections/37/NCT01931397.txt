    
      Specific Aim 1: To validate the DBS method as a home monitoring device for use at home by
      parents and patients in 30 pediatric kidney transplant recipients. We will validate the TAC
      and creatinine (Cr) blood levels obtained by DBS method in comparison to blood TAC and serum
      creatinine levels using standard laboratory assays in CLIA approved clinical laboratories.

      Specific Aim 2: The use of DBS on filter papers is associated with better adherence to
      monthly blood testing and medication intake. This aim can be tested by assessing the number
      of DBS on filter papers that are returned to OHSU every month. Adherence with medication
      intake will be assessed by measuring the variability of TAC trough levels, and by individual
      reporting.

      We will calculate the percent of returned DBS filter papers to OHSU on a monthly basis as
      well as the percent of those that are collected properly at home and are successfully
      utilized for TAC and Cr analysis.

      Specific Aim 3: This aim will explore patient and family satisfaction and self management
      using DBS method vs. the standard method of scheduled clinic and laboratory visits.

      Design: This is a pilot study to evaluate and validate the novel use of DBS on filter paper
      as a home monitoring method. This study will involve within-subjects, repeated measures
      design to test specific hypotheses.

      Participants: The pediatric kidney transplant program at Doernbecher Children's Hospital/OHSU
      follows approximately 120 active renal transplant recipients between 2-21 years. Thirty
      patients of both genders will participate in this study and will be followed for one year.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. On Tacrolimus immunosuppression therapy

        2. At least six months post kidney transplantation
