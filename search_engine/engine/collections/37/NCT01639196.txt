      interventions are needed as part of chronic pain treatment since the pain affects many
      aspects of an individual's life. In particular, brief psychological interventions that are
      easily accessible (i.e., online) could benefit many people with chronic pain. Writing
      interventions have been used in recent years to understand difficult experiences. Writing
      interventions have been found to help individuals explore distressing thoughts and feelings,
      such as those that are associated with pain.
