      areas which the investigators call modules: diet (module 1), exercise (module 2) and
      self-management (module 3) (i.e. medication adherence, glucose monitoring). The length of the
      study was 9 weeks in duration with three weeks of content per module. Within each module new
      material was delivered each week through capABILITY. Essentially, every Monday started a new
      week's worth of educational material that was intended to last until Sunday. Each participant
      was randomly assigned to either the control group (no triggers), spark trigger group or
      facilitator trigger group. At the beginning of each module the participants would be randomly
      assigned to one of the three aforementioned classification groups (this was a 2-Factor
      Cross-Over Design).

      The investigators utilized the Perceived Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale , Diabetes Knowledge
      Test developed by Michigan University, and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
      Measures scale (SDSCA) . All the participants completed the perceived diabetes self-efficacy
      scale along with the knowledge test and SDSCA Pre/Post intervention. In addition, the
      participants answered one self-efficacy, knowledge, self-care and goal question at the
      conclusion of each week within capABILITY.
