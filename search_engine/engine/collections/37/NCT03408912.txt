      reducing both morbidity and mortality in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI). Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) of the infarct related artery (IRA) for patients presenting with STEMI,
      with residual disease initially being treated conservatively. Large meta-analyses of
      observational studies have shown that PCI of the IRA only results in a reduced mortality
      compared to full revascularization in patients with STEMI and simultaneous multivessel
      disease. However, recent small randomized controlled trials indicate that full
      revascularization reduces morbidity, but have been underpowered to show any reduction in
      mortality. Furthermore, physiological guidance of coronary intervention by fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) reduces mortality compared to angiography guided PCI in both stable angina and
      non-STEMI (NSTEMI). However, if performing full revascularization guided by FFR in patients
      with STEMI improves clinical outcome, compared to initial conservative approach is not known.

      Assessment of myocardial perfusion in rest and during pharmacological stress is widely used
      for non-invasive diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, where cardiovascular magnetic resonance
      (CMR) has a high diagnostic accuracy. Newly developed first pass perfusion imaging with
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) allows for quantification of myocardial perfusion,
      and CMR derived FFR. However, it is currently not known if FFR from CMR and invasive
      angiography correlate with each other. If FFR from CMR can predict physiological significant
      stenosis as good as FFR from invasive angiography, unnecessary invasive producers can be
      avoided in patients with STEMI.
