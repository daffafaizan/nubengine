      between weeks 4-26. A final study visit to assess symptoms after drug discontinuation will
      occur 4 weeks after drug discontinuation.

      Study duration-Maximum of 32 weeks with 26 weeks of active therapy.

      Efficacy Measures -Tissue Doppler echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning using
      radioactive NH3 PET will be assessed at weeks 0 and 26.

      Safety Measures-Adverse events rates including inter- and intra-dialytic hypotension,
      ,cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed throughout the duration
