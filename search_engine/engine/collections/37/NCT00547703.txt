      based on the best evidence. Many clinical trials of nonulcer dyspepsia suffer from important
      weaknesses in trial design. This makes it difficult to determine whether truly efficacious
      therapies exist for this disorder.

      Once a diagnosis of nonulcer dyspepsia is confirmed by normal endoscopy, a trial of therapy
      is commonly prescribed. However, the benefits of all therapies in this condition have been
      questioned. Small studies have suggested benefit in use of antidepressants such as
      Nortriptyline and even though the data is insufficient, antidepressants such as Nortriptyline
      are widely used in clinical practice largely due to lack of proven, reliable therapies for
      nonulcer dyspepsia.

      Our hypothesis is that Nortriptyline will improve symptoms of nonulcer dyspepsia and improve
      quality of life.
