      and reduced mortality in post-resuscitation patients treated with hypothermia compared to
      controls. Of the various methods of inducing hypothermia, internal cooling using an
      endovascular catheter and external cooling using gel pads with a water based circulating
      system have shown the most promise. There have not been any studies looking at outcomes
      between the two methods of cooling.
