      suggests a role via the the gastric accommodation or gastric emptying. Twelve healthy
      volunteers participated in this single blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. An
      infusion catheter and a manometry probe were positioned in the stomach. After a 15 min
      stabilization period, saline (placebo), PP 3 pmol/kg*min or PP 10 pmol/kg*min were
      intravenously infused. Thirty min after the condition, an intragastric nutrient drink (ND)
      infusion (60 ml/min) started until the volunteer felt maximal satiated. GE was evaluated
      using the 13C breath test during the 6 hours following the ND infusion. Satiation and hunger
      were scored on a visual analog scale every 5 minutes.
