      of efficacy and morbidity. Local therapies fail even in highly selected patients due to
      locally advanced disease, microscopic metastases, and a worsening of the biology of cancer
      cells. Furthermore, attempts at salvage local treatments have the complications of
      incontinence, impotence and in some cases unremitting penile pain. Pre-clinical studies in a
      mouse model of prostate cancer have noted the potential benefit of adenovirus-mediated gene
      therapy to deliver IL-12 in this clinical scenario. This treatment was able to significantly
      growth suppress the injected tumor to prolong survival and reduce the number of
      pre-established metastases. The mechanisms underlying this activity involved both innate
      immunity (neutrophils and natural killer [NK] cells) and acquired immunity ( T cells) and
      enhanced expression of Fas to further sensitize Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) killing.

      This is a Phase I study. Therefore, the primary objective is finding the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose. Within this realm will be monitoring of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secondary aspects
      will involve correlating important mechanisms identified in the pre-clinical model: induction
      of T cells.
