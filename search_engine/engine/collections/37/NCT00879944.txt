      psoriasis in adults, including obesity, depression, smoking, and other cardiovascular risk
      factors such as high blood pressure. The object of this research study is to examine these
      associations in children as very little is known about psoriasis and cardiovascular risk
      factors in the pediatric population.

      This is a multi-center study with a planned total enrollment of about 200 subjects ages 2-17
      years old with psoriasis and 100 aged-match controls. Patient and family history will be
      recorded. All subjects will undergo standard height, weight, blood pressure, and waist
      circumference (WC). For the obese and overweight subjects we will also obtain their growth
      charts to attempt to correlate weight gain with psoriasis onset and progression. All data
      will be compiled and then statistically analyzed.
