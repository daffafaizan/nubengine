    
      Objective: The purpose of the current study is to determine the feasibility of guided Spanish
      version of the Internet-based CBT (ICBT) using audiological support on tinnitus distress and
      tinnitus-related comorbidities (n=100).

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that Spanish version of the ICBT will reduce the
      tinnitus-related distress, decrease sleep disturbance, decrease anxiety and depression, and
      improve health-related quality of life in Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers. The
      investigators also hypothesize that these results will be stable in both short- and long-term
      post-intervention.

      Design: A single group assignment, with a one-year follow-up design will be used to evaluate
      the feasibility of Spanish version of the ICBT on tinnitus distress.

      Setting: This will be an Internet-based study for Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers living
      across the globe.

      Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of
      3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 100 Spanish
      speaking participants will be recruited.

      Intervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT),
      providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday
      life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and
      assignments are given to practice techniques learned.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary
      outcome measures are the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire
      (TCQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia
      Severity Index (ISI), and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L.
