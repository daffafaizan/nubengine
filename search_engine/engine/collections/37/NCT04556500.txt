      genetics and the environment. The role of the home as the first environment for child
      experiences is very important for motor development, especially during infancy. Thus, a more
      supportive and stimulating environment is associated with more affordances and challenges for
      infant motor development that may lead to improvement in social and cognitive development.

      There is no Turkish questionnaire to evaluate home environment so we aimed to translate the
      AHEMD-T for using with Turkish children and to investigate psychometric properties.
