    
      Multicentre open-labeled randomized pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacogenetic (PG) study to
      compare Advagraf and Prograf immediate post-transplantation (Day 8) and steady-state (Day 84)
      systemic exposure.

      Tacrolimus PK profile, tacrolimus systemic exposure assessed by Limited Samples Strategies
      (LSS) (i.e.: Bayesian estimators (BE) and Multilinear Regressions (MLR)), and impact of
      CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus PK will also be determined to improve
      the optimal dose of AdvagrafÂ® for kidney transplant patients.
