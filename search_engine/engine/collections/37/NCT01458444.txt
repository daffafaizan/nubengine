      thoracic surgery with acute respiratory failure or immediate after post extubation in
      patients at risk, is not less than the start a VNI per BIPAP Vision ®system. In terms of
      reintubation rates, refusal to continue the technique, or switch to another technique
      proposed.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess changes in the sensation of dyspnea

        -  To analyze the skin tolerance and the comfort in this population

        -  To analyze the evolution of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters

        -  To compare the number of bronchoscopy performed during the patient's stay in intensive
           care unit

        -  Assess the number of postoperative pneumonia and antibiotic consumption

        -  To determine whether the initiation of any treatment changes in the immediate
