      customary to prescribe a diet low in salt and low in sugar. This dietary prescription is
      based on the interest of any diet to prevent the occurrence of side effects of steroids such
      as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and congestive heart.

      However, there is no specific dietary requirements in other European countries. This lack of
      recommendations is based on the fact that there is no evidence that a strict diet reduces the
      side effects of steroids on the one hand and secondly, that the quality of life of patients
      undergoing a diet low in salt and low in sugars affects their quality of life. In addition,
      no prospective study has helped to establish the frequency of side effects of corticosteroids
      depending on dose and duration of treatment.

      The investigators therefore propose to study whether a diet intervention with low salt or low
      sugar during a prolonged corticosteroid treatment has any interest and effectively reduces
      the frequency and severity of side effects.

      The investigators propose that all parameters being equal, to randomize the diet of patients
      started on steroids for a predictable period of 3 months minimum for a dose greater than 20
      mg per day. One group will observe the low-salt diet, low in sugar and the other will follow
      a normal diet. The assessment will be made after 1 year, even if steroid treatment is
      continued beyond.
