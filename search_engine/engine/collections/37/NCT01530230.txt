      section in regional anesthesia. The investigators examined whether there was a difference in
      the occurrence of electrocardiogram changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia (ST
      depressions) in preeclamptic patients randomized to five or ten units of oxytocin during
      cesarean section with regional anesthesia.

      In a double-blind randomized controlled study preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean
      section under spinal anesthesia were randomized to 5 or 10 units of oxytocin, given as an
      intravenous bolus. A Holter monitor was used to record electrocardiograms. Non-invasive blood
      pressure and heart rate were monitored.
