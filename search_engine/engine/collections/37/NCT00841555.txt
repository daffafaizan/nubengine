      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide when given in combination with
           hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy in patients
           with newly diagnosed de novo glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to neuroradiological evidence of tumor recurrence or progression
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the survival time of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time spent in a Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide.

      Beginning 1-3 weeks following surgery or biopsy, patients receive oral temozolomide once
      daily for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 week after starting temozolomide, patients also undergo
      hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
      week for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, 2 months, and 3
      months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
