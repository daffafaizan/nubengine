      This study is conducted as a four days non-blinded randomised cross-over feasibility study
      with 24 hospitalized older patients. The intervention is conducted at the hospital. The
      intervention is two days with two protein-enriched ice cream daily with the aim of increasing
      the intake of protein and energy. The patients are asked to answer a questionnaire concerning
      the emotions the protein enriched ice cream evoke.The patients will be randomised to receive
      the standard menu the first two days followed by two days with standard menu plus
      protein-enriched ice cream or in the opposite order. The randomisation will be done by using
      sealed envelopes.

      Recruitment:

      Only admitted patients will be a part of the trial. The ward staff will identify the patients
      there are eligible to the trial as close as possible to the day of admission. The ward staff
      will ask those patients who meet the inclusion criteria if they will participate in the
      trail. The patients receive oral and written information on the trial and those who agree to
      participate are asked to sign a statement of consent before participating. The patients can
      at any time withdraw their consent and leave the trial.

      Sample size:

      The sample size is estimated to 24 patients, who will be their own control.

      Statistical analysis:

      Non-parametric statistical tests, median and range will be performed due to the small sample
      size and skew distribution. The Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data, and Fisher's exact
      test for categorical data. Evoked emotion are measured as the percentages of patients who
      choose a particular emotion term.
