      poor coverage, a PDN located between the middle of the distal phalanx and the palmar digital
      crease, and a defect of the digital nerve after neuroma resection equal to or less than 3 cm
      in length. The exclusion criteria included a PDN in healthy soft tissue, a digital nerve
      defect longer than 3 cm, injury to the course of the pedicle or the donor nerve, and a thumb
      neuroma. A finger with a small distal end of the digital nerve was also excluded, because
      neurorrhaphy was extremely difficult in this situation.
