      surgery using the AtriCure Bipolar System in conjunction with a catheter ablation procedure
      performed approximately 1-10 days after, in treating atrial fibrillation, and how effective
      is this staged procedure. The AtriCure Bipolar System will be used to perform the less
      invasive cardiac surgery and a standard electrophysiology catheter, currently available, will
      be used to perform the catheter ablation procedure. This surgical procedure is considered
      less invasive because it is done through tiny surgical punctures on the sides of the chest
      near the ribs instead of one large surgical incision of the breast bone to completely open
      the chest and access the heart, and it also avoids the need for the heart-lung bypass
      machine.
