    
      This was a monocentric, prospective, randomized, phase II and double-blind study.

      At the baseline visits, one investigator rated the severity of nasolabial folds on both left
      and right sides according to the mentioned scale, and a standard set of six photographs of
      the face (frontal, left side and right side for both the whole face and the lower face) were
      taken.

      On the day of the injection, the main investigator injected 1ml of dermal filler - hyaluronic
      acid (RestylaneÂ®, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) - for each subject. The injected amount was 0,5ml
      for the right nasolabial fold and 0,5ml for the left nasolabial fold. The sides will be
      randomized.
