      patients. Nitric oxide-signal transduction plays an important role in prevention of CI-AKI.
      L-Arginine is an amino acid involved in ammonia detoxification, and is well known as a
      precursor to nitric oxide, a key component of endothelial-derived relaxing factor.

      This is a prospective randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial among CKD stage 3-4
      patients undergoing computer tomography. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to two
      groups: (1) arginine 3 g/day or 6 capsules per day, and (2) placebo 6 capsules per day for 3
      days before contrast media injection. Serum cystatin C, serum creatinine and estimated GFR
      was measured at baseline and 48 hours after procedure.
