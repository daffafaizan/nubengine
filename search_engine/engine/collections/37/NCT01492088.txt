      being tested to treat children who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) anaplastic large-cell
      lymphoma (sALCL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This study will look at the maximum tolerated dose
      and/or recommended phase 2 dose, safety and pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin along
      with overall response of people who took brentuximab vedotin.

      The study enrolled 36 patients. In the phase 1 portion of the study, 12 participants were
      enrolled to receive brentuximab vedotin 1.4-1.8 mg/kg, 30-minute IV infusion, Day 1 of every
      21-day cycle, until there was evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Once the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose and pharmacokinetics of
      brentuximab vedotin was reached, participants were enrolled by diagnosis into two phase 2
      study arms: relapsed or refractory sALCL or relapsed or refractory HL and received
      brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg as 30-minute IV on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 16
      cycles. One participant received a maximum of 20 cycles at the joint discretion of the
      sponsor and the investigator for continued clinical benefit.

      This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 5 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were
      contacted by telephone every 12 weeks for 12 months after the end of treatment (EOT) for
      progression free survival and then every 6 months until death, study closure, or 2 years
      after enrollment of the last participant for overall survival.
