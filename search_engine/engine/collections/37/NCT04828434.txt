      Therapy (CST) is the only non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the UK government to
      improve cognition for mild to moderate dementia. It is routinely delivered in over 85% of
      National Health Services (NHS) services and offered in 33 countries. Unfortunately, this
      routine treatment is suspended due to lockdown, even though people with dementia are
      disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Accessible treatment is a pressing need. Virtual
      Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (viCST) aims to bridge this treatment gap as an
      evidence-based treatment for dementia, developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC)
      Framework for complex interventions using principles of CST. There may still be a demand for
      viCST post-pandemic because those with sensory impairments and lack of transport provision
      may prefer a virtual and individual treatment. The investigators aim to 1) design viCST; 2)
      evaluate viCST in a feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). A sample of 34
      participants will be recruited. Seventeen will be allocated to viCST, and 17 to treatment as
      usual (TAU), the control group. Data will be collected pre-and post-test. Dementia prevalence
      is projected to reach 152 million worldwide by 2050. Therefore, accessible treatment is
      paramount during the pandemic and beyond.
