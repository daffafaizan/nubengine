      ISAR tool. Those with a score of 2 or above in the ISAR will be randomised. The treatment arm
      will undergo geriatric medicine team-directed CGA from admission to Emergency Department (ED)
      or Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU) whereby the non-treatment arm will undergo usual
      patient care. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of a geriatric medicine trainee,
      physiotherapist, occupational therapist and medical social worker will carry out the
      assessment, as well as interventions that arise from that assessment. Primary outcomes will
      be time from triage to decision to admit or discharge. Secondary Outcomes will be subsequent
      Emergency Department reattendance, rehospitalisation, functional decline and mortality at 30
      days and 180 days. This will be recorded by telephone consultation and electronic records.
