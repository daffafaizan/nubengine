      (IG) and the treatment as usual (TAU) group. The IG will receive the Cardiac Lifestyle
      Intervention for Maintaining healthy Behaviors ("CLIMB"). CLIMB is a 3-session (2-week)
      intervention. One session includes health behavior feedback, and patient selection of
      relevant lifestyle modules based on values clarification. In the remaining two sessions,
      participants will complete two of five elective lifestyle modules: Healthy Eating, Physical
      Activity, Reducing Stress and Worry, Mood Management, and Smoking Cessation Education.
      Intervention components include information provision, goal setting, problem solving, and
      elements of cognitive behavioral therapy.

      Participants in the IG will complete a Baseline assessment, three intervention sessions, a
      30-day follow-up, and a 3-month follow-up. Baseline and Session 1 will take place on the same
      day. Sessions 1, 2, and 3 will be spaced approximately one week apart from one another (1
      week in-between Sessions 1 and 2, and 1 week in-between Sessions 2 and 3). The 30-day
      follow-up will occur approximately 30-days after Session 3. The 3-month follow-up will occur
      approximately 3 months after Session 3. Assessment measures will be filled out at Baseline,
      at Post-treatment (end of Session 3), at 30-day follow-up, and at 3-month follow-up. The TAU
      group will fill out assessment measures at comparable time points, with the exception that
      there will be no 3-month follow-up. After completing their 30-day follow-up measures, TAU
      members may elect to receive the CLIMB intervention.
