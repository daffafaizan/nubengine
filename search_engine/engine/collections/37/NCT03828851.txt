      long-term care and the main treatment goals in rehabilitation for patients with stroke.
      Residential rehabilitation is a direct way to observe patients' living environment and
      provides feasible ADL treatment plans for patients with stroke living at home or in the
      community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Domiciliary care-
      Activities of Daily Living program on activities of daily living, motor, cognition,
      perception, sensory, quality of life, and depression. The eligible participants were
      recruited and assigned into two groups: ADL home program and control group who received
      traditional rehabilitation in hospital. The primary outcome measures were the Canadian
      Occupational Performance Measure, the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, the Frenchay
      Activities Index, and ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale. The secondary outcome measures
      were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Test of Visual
      Perceptual Skills-Third Edition, and the Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression.
