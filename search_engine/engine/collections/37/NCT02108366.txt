      and safety of celecoxib combined with neuraminidase inhibitors in patients with severe
      influenza A infection. The hypothesis of this study is that treatment of severe influenza A
      infection with celecoxib will reduce mortality. The primary outcome to be assessed will be
      the 28-days mortality rate from hospitalization. The secondary outcomes to be assessed will
      be safety of the treatment, duration of intensive care, duration of ventilatory and oxygen
      support, the viral load and cytokine change.
