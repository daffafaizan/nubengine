    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the discriminating capacities of A2A
      adenosine receptors expression on the surface of circulating lymphocytes for the detection of
      coronary artery disease in patients hospitalized for surgery of the aorta and / or arteries
      of the lower limbs.

      The secondary objectives are:

      Assessment of the discriminating capacities of the functionality (KD / EC50) of A2A adenosine
      receptors on the surface of circulating lymphocytes, for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia
      in patients hospitalized for surgery of the aorta and / or arteries of legs.

      Determinate the best threshold for discriminating patients with coronary artery disease and
      estimate the discriminating performance associated with this threshold.

      Determinate the best threshold for discriminating patients with myocardial ischemia and
      estimate the discriminating performance associated with this threshold.
