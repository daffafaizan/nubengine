           month after randomization)

             -  Stenting, adjunct drug therapy and markers of myonecrosis

                1) PCI

                (1) All interventions are performed according to current standard guidelines. (2)
                Aspiration thrombectomy is dependent on the operator's discretion. (3) If the
                patients have multiple lesions, culprit lesion coverage is recommended if possible.

                (4) Any kind of DES is permitted for PCI. If the bare-metal stent is needed, it is
                permitted.

                (5) Direct stenting or predilation is left to the operator's decision.

                2) Antithrombotic medications

                  1. Anticoagulation is begun before PCI and performed with low-molecular-weight
                     heparin (enoxaparin) or unfractionated heparin at physician's discretion.

                  2. Only tirofiban is administered if and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI)
                     are needed.

                3) Markers of myonecrosis

                (1) Blood samples are routinely obtained from all patients before and after PCI for
                assessment of CK-MB at 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours.

                (2) In case of elevated values, measurements are repeated every 12 hours until a
                peak value reaches or values are normalized.

                  -  Assays of platelet function 1) Blood sampling.

                       1. Peripheral venous blood samples are drawn from an antecubital vein using
                          a 21-gauge needle.

                       2. Blood samples are collected using the double-syringe technique, in which
                          the first 2 to 4 ml of blood is discarded to avoid spontaneous platelet
                          activation.

                     2) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA)

                       1. Blood samples are drawn into Vacutainer tubes containing 0.5 mL of sodium
                          citrate 3.2% (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and processed within
                          60 minutes.

                       2. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained as a supernatant fluid after
                          centrifuging blood at 800 rpm for 10 min. The remaining blood was further
                          centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 min to prepare platelet-poor plasma
                          (PPP). PRP is adjusted to platelet counts of 250,000/μL by adding PPP as
                          needed.

                       3. Platelet aggregation is assessed at 37℃ using a PACKS-4 aggregometer
                          (Helena Laboratories Corp., Beaumont, Texas, USA). Light transmission is
                          adjusted to 0% with PRP and to 100% PPP for each measurement.

                       4. Platelet aggregation is systematically measured after the addition of ADP
                          at concentrations of 5 and 20 μM. Curves were recorded for 6 minutes.

                       5. Aggregation is measured at by laboratory personnel blinded to group
                          assignment.

                       6. Absolute reduction of aggregation values (∆ Aggmax or Agglate) is defined
                          as change of aggregation between pre-procedure and 30-day therapy:

                            -  Agg = pre-procedure Agg - Agg after 30-day therapy

                       7. Inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) is defined as relative change in
                          aggregation values (Aggmax and Agglate) between pre-procedure and 30-day
                          therapy:

                          IPA (%) = [(pre-procedure Agg - Agg after 30-day therapy)/pre-procedure
                          Agg] X 100

                     3) Rapid platelet function assay (RPFA: the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay)

                       1. A point-of-care system (VerifyNow; Accumetrics, San Diego, California) is
                          an automated turbidimetric whole blood assay based on the ability of
                          activated platelets using cartridges containing fibrinogen-coated beads
                          and platelet agonists.

                       2. Blood is drawn into a Greiner Bio-One 3.2% citrate vacuette tube.

                       3. The channel contains fibrinogen-coated polystyrene beads and 20 μM ADP as
                          platelet agonist. This channel also contains 22 nmol/l PGE1 to suppress
                          intracellular free calcium levels and thereby reduce the non-specific
                          contribution of P2Y1 receptors.

                       4. Results are reported in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU).

                       5. Absolute reduction of PRU is defined as change of PRU between
                          pre-procedure and 30-day therapy:

                          ∆ PRU = pre-procedure PRU - PRU after 30-day therapy

                       6. Percent inhibition (PI) of PRU is defined as relative change between
                          pre-procedure and 30-day therapy:

                          PI (%) = [(pre-procedure PRU - PRU after 30-day therapy)/pre-procedure
                          PRU] X 100

                          2-8. CYP2C19 genotyping

                       1. CYP2C19 genotype is determined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
                          SNaPshot method, using genomic DNA isolated from leukocytes of peripheral
                          venous blood with an extraction kit (QIAampR DNA Blood Mini Kit, Qiagen,
                          Hilden,Germany).

                       2. Two CYP2C19 polymorphisms, CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285, c. 681G>A, p.P227P), and
                          CYP2C19*3 (rs4986893, c. 636G>A, p. W212X), are investigated using the
                          ABI SNaPshot reaction and the ABI 3100 automated genetic analyzer
                          (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

                          cilostazol after 30 days : 24.0%

                          Absolute reduction of 5 μM ADP-induced maximal aggregation by adjunctive
                          high dose maintenance clopidogrel 150mg/day after 30 days : 11.0%

                          Relative difference of enhanced platelet inhibition between two regimens
                          :

                          54.0% - Two-sided α-level = 0.05 - Power = 95% - Triple group: high-MD
                          group = 1: 1 - Standard deviation = 0.4

                          At least 15 patients per each group were required.

                          @ based on previous another study(CYP2C19 polymorphism study)

                          The ratio of Korean patients carrying wild type CYP2C19 vs mutant
                          type=4:6

                          The required patients of wild type group : 15 patients The required
                          patients of mutant type group : 23 patients

                          Final required patients (15+23)*2=76 patients

                       2. Analysis Continuous variables are presented as means ± SD and compared
                          using Student unpaired t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Categorical variables
                          are presented as numbers or percentages and were compared using
                          chi-square or Fisher's exact tests (if an expected frequency was < 5).
                          The characteristics and platelet function measures of the 3 groups were
                          analyzed by Friedman's repeated ANOVA on ranks. After demonstration of
                          significant differences among variables by ANOVA, post hoc comparisons
                          between therapy pairs were made with the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure
                          for multiple comparisons. A p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate a
                          significant difference. Statistical analysis was performed using
                          commercially available software (SPSS version 13; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
                          Illinois, USA).
