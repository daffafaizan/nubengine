      of chronic renal dysfunction in patients undergoing liver transplantation. It will examine
      the renal function and renal morphology in patients on calcineurin inhibitors and the effects
      of Cozaar (losartan) following liver transplantation. Participants will have blood, urine and
      iothalamate clearance test, to look at kidney function prior to transplant. At the time of
      transplant, kidney biopsies will be performed in the operating room under anesthesia.
      Participants will be in the study for one year. At three weeks following liver transplant,
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a placebo (inactive drug) or the
      study drug (losartan). The participant will need to continue to return to the clinic at the
      normal scheduled intervals. During these times blood and urine tests will be done. A kidney
      biopsy will be performed at the yearly exam and study pills will be stopped. The researchers
      will continue to follow participant's creatine measurements for the next 10 years.
