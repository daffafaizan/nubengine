      alone. For Aim 1, Hypothesis Ia, this will be a randomized, controlled study. For the two
      groups, 38 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either: A) Motor + Cognitive Training;
      or B) Motor Training alone. Subjects will first be stratified according to coordination and
      gait deficit severity, as described below. After stratification, the subject will be
      randomized to one of the two intervention groups for Hypothesis Ia. All the subjects will
      receive treatment 5 times/week, 3hrs/session, for 12 weeks or for a total of 60 treatment
      sessions. Group A will receive combined motor and cognitive training; Table 2 (below) shows
      the graduated approach to providing combined gait and cognitive training. Data collection
      will be at weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24 (i.e., before, mid-treatment and after treatment, and then
      3 months after the end of the treatment protocol. Comparison will be made between the two
      groups to determine whether there was any additive effectiveness of the cognitive training.

      Aim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group A, receiving combined
      motor and cognitive training. For Aim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d, this will be a single cohort
      pre/post-treatment comparison within Group A receiving combined motor and cognitive training.

      Aim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group B, receiving motor
      training alone. For Aim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d, this will be a single cohort pre/post-treatment
      comparison within Group B, receiving motor training alone.
