      the head and neck are usually poor responders to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      The investigation of proliferation pathways involving tyrosine kinase receptors such as c-kit
      receptor (KIT) and PDGF receptor may allow to identify a molecular target for novel
      therapeutic approaches in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma who failed locoregional
      treatment.

      Several publications in the literature and the pathological study we conducted in Institut
      Gustave Roussy show that KIT overexpression is observed in at least 80-90% of the cases of
      adenoid cystic carcinoma, supporting the investigation of imatinib in patients with adenoid
      cystic carcinoma overexpressing KIT.

      Imatinib is an orally administrated, well tolerated compound that could be given on an
      outpatient schedule to patients with relapsing/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of the
      head and neck.

      Because of the infrequent occurrence of salivary gland malignancies, a multicenter trial will
      be mandatory and the study will include at least 2 centers represented by Institut Gustave
      Roussy, Villejuif; and HÃ´pital Georges-Pompidou, Paris.
