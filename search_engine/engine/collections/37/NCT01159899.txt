      for the debridement of the meniscal and cartilage lesions, with microperforation and
      abrasion, preparation of the osteochondral defect to receive the transplantation, patellar
      lateral release if necessary.

      Then, the investigators use a fresh non-culture expanded autologous bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal mononuclear stem cells, stimulated with a protein matrix and mixed in a collagen
      hydroxyapatite scaffold. This cellular paste is transplanted in the prepared defect, under
      arthroscopy, with injection of platelet rich plasma.
