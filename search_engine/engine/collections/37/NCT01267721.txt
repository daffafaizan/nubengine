      Thioredoxin - reductase (TRR) and many other antioxidant enzymes, which protect tissues from
      oxidative stress. In septic patients it has previously been shown that thioredoxin, a TRR
      regulated Redox Enzyme, has the ability to suppress the synthesis of MIF.

      Aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the relation between perioperative
      selenium decrease and the reduction of TRR activity with a possible release of MIF during the
      inflammatory response after cardiac surgery.
