      screening from January 2020 to December 2022. Inclusion criteria include: Patient above 20
      year-old with diagnosis of severe ARDS under protective lung ventilation( tidal volume 4-8
      ml/kg, plateau pressure < 30cm H2O、PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg、PEEP ≥ 5 cmH2O、FiO2 > 60%）. Patients
      were excluded if patients were not intubated and mechanically ventilated or contraindication
      for prone position ventilation (intracranial hemorrhage, massive hemoptysis, unstable
      hemodynamic status, recent pacemaker implantation, severe facial laceration, open abdominal
      wound, spine, femur or pelvis fracture or pregnancy). Patients will divide into 2 groups, one
      is patients supported by 16-hour prone position; another group is patients with 24-hour prone
      position, each group enrolled 30 patients. The medical records of these patients were
      analyzed for age, gender, body weight, diagnosis, pulmonary or extrapulmonary ARDS, acute
      physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) Ⅱscore, days between ARDS to prone
      position, ICU day, hospital day, ventilator day, pre and post prone position vital signs,
      laboratory data including arterial blood gas, lactate, respiratory parameters included
      PaO2/FiO2, peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator mode,
      steroid treatment, complications (tube dislodge, pressure sore, infection), and mortality
      outcomes.

      The primary endpoint is the difference of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2), the secondary endpoint are
      other respiratory parameters, vital signs, ICU day, hospital day, ventilator day,
      complications and survival.
