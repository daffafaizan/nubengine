      condition for atherosclerosis. Elevation of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol(LDL-C) concentration is the most important risk factor for atherosclerosis;
      however, LDL-C elevation is not a criterion for metabolic syndrome, raising the question of
      LDL's role in the syndrome's association with atherosclerosis. L5, a highly electronegative
      and mildly oxidized LDL subfraction that we recently isolated from hypercholesterolemic human
      plasma, may provide a key to answering this question. In cultured vascular endothelial cells
      (EC), L5 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis and monocyte-EC adhesion. In our
      preliminary studies, L5 could also be detected in patients with MS without elevated LDL-C.
      Because other LDL subfractions were harmless to EC, the presence of MS-L5 prompted us to
      hypothesize that the atherogenic role of LDL is not solely determined by plasma LDL-C
      concentration, but more importantly, by its composition. The proposed study is designed to
      test this hypothesis. The first question we will address is what lipid factor determines the
      prevalence of L5 in MS.

      Subsequently, we will examine whether treatment with selected medicines can effectively
      reduce L5 in MS patients by correcting the factor favorable for L5 formation.

      We are in the process of identifying the active components of L5 to fully characterize the
      atherogenic role of L5 in MS,. In the current proposal, we focus our interest on the efficacy
      of Ezetimibe, Simvastatin, and Vytorin in reducing L5 from the plasma of MS patients.
