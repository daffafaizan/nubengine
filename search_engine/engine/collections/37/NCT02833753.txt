    
      There are two common combinations of chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer of the colon,
      rectum, or appendix that has spread to the abdomen. One uses 5-fluorouracil (also called
      5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin, and is called FOLFOX. The other uses 5-FU, leucovorin, and
      irinotecan, and is called FOLFIRI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved each
      of these combinations as treatment for colon or rectal cancer. Each is given through the
      veins.

      FOLFOX and FOLFIRI do not work well for tumors growing in the abdominal cavity. The
      investigators are trying to determine if giving chemotherapy called oxaliplatin directly into
      the abdominal cavity will have a greater effect on the cancer.

      The FDA has approved oxaliplatin to be given to people through their veins to treat advanced
      colorectal cancer. Giving oxaliplatin directly into the abdomen in this study is experimental
      and is not approved by the FDA. This study will give the standard chemotherapy FOLFIRI
      through the veins and oxaliplatin directly into the abdomen. This is the first time
      intraperitoneal oxaliplatin is being given in combination with FOLFIRI.
