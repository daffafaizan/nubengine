    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various
      etiologies including fibrinolytic defects. This includes the trauma, obstetric hemorrhage and
      liver transplant populations. The cartridge consists of four independent channels each
      containing different sets of reagents, which provide four measurements performed in parallel
      yielding five parameters that depict the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra
      System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to comparable measures using conventional
      viscoelastic testing methods.
