      occur after use of a music player device for 4 hours. All participants listened to one of two
      playlists (pop or rock) set at the same volumes to provide equivalent and consistent
      exposures across participants. Participants received either a dietary supplement or a placebo
      once/daily for three days prior to the day of music exposure, and also on the day of music
      exposure. The fourth and final dose was consumed immediately prior to music listening and
      consumption was observed by a member of the study team. Changes in hearing were assessed
      15-min post-music, and then 1, 2, and 3 hours later, as well as the following day and 1 week
      later.
