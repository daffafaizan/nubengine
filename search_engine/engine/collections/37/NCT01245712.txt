      I. To assess the cosmesis, acute toxicity and late toxicity in patients treated with
      accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the convenience of accelerated partial breast irradiation and quality of life
      during accelerated partial breast irradiation.

      II. To estimate the in-breast tumor control rates in patients treated with accelerated
      partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.

      III. Compare dosimetry to alternate treatment modalities.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 10 weeks of last breast cancer surgery, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) delivered with proton radiation twice daily (BID) for 5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year,
      and 18 months, then annually for 10 years.
