      fatigue and quality of life across multiple tumor types. Thus, an exercise intervention could
      improve the tolerability of combination immunotherapy. Furthermore, functional capacity
      and/or amount of physical activity are associated with survival in several cancers. Finally,
      there is emerging evidence that exercise training may augment beneficial cancer-specific
      immune function. This study will examine parallel groups of supervised or semi-supervised
      exercise training or usual care in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab
      combination therapy. Fitness level will be evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (CPET), wearable exercise tracking devices and questionnaires after 12 weeks of
      semi-supervised, home-based exercise.
