      peptides (NPs) and obesity in humans. This association is especially pronounced in those with
      metabolic syndrome traits and elevated plasma insulin. As previously conducted study has
      shown that an increase in NPs with weight loss in obese individuals is "primary" and not
      secondary to alteration in cardiac structure or function.

      Previous experimental data suggests that Atrial NP (ANP) has a wide range of favorable
      metabolic effects including that activation of brown fat and improvement in skeletal muscle
      oxidative capacity and glucose utilization. New evidence suggests that ANP activation
      directly modulates insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, suggesting that ANP
      suppression could promote more obesity/insulin resistance. Moreover, ANP exerts potent
      lipolytic effects in vitro and in vivo. The previous study has shown that a high-carbohydrate
      challenge in healthy volunteers is associated with a reduction in N-terminal-proANP
      (NTproANP) but not N-terminal-proB-type NP (NTproBNP) levels. Nonetheless our outcomes were
      predominantly in Caucasians and warrants replication in other racial groups.

      There is no data on the ANP response to high-carbohydrate challenge in African Americans, a
      racial group with disproportionately greater rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and
      diabetes as compared to Caucasians. So the investigators have proposed to conduct a pilot
      study in otherwise healthy, normotensive subjects to examine NP system, especially the
      effects on MRproANP in response of high-carbohydrate challenge.
