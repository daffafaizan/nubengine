           cholesterol levels and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate marker
           for atherosclerotic burden used as the "gold standard" comparator.

        -  Secondary objectives of the study will be to compare the skin cholesterol levels with
           other markers of CAD as HDL cholesterol, Apo B, hsCRP, and lipoprotein-association
           phospholipase A2.

        -  Another objective is to determine the relationship between skin cholesterol levels and
           the presence of carotid plaques detected by ultrasound.
