      weight and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be recorded. A written
      informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Enrolled patients will be randomized
      to receive either 5 or 10 sprays of 10% lignocaine to the pharynx. This will be followed by
      the standard topical anesthesia procedure followed in our institution involving 5ml of 2%
      lignocaine gel into the nostril. Transnasal flexible bronchoscopy will be performed with
      additional 1% lignocaine administered as "spray as you go" method. This will be given as 2 ml
      aliquots- with similar volume in both groups as baseline. Procedure shall be performed with
      administration of sedation using Midazolam and Fentanyl if required. Primary outcome will be
      assessed by noting the operator rated overall procedure satisfaction as a VAS scale score.
