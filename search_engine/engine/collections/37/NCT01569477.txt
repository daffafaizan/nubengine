    
      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which contingent financial "treatment incentives" (i.e.,
      incentives for biochemical verification visits, treatment engagement, and abstinence) versus
      "attendance incentives" (i.e., incentives for only attending the biochemical verification
      visits), increase rates of smoking cessation . Participants will be BadgerCare Plus tobacco
      users who enroll in Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) services.

      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which treatment incentives vs. attendance incentives
      increase rates of engagement in smoking cessation treatment through the WTQL when offered to
      BadgerCare Plus members who smoke.

      Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the smoking cessation program when paired with
      treatment incentives and when paired with attendance incentives.

      Aim 4: To identify moderating and mediational effects regarding the clinical benefit of
      incentivized smoking treatment

      Aim 5: To determine the reach of an incentivized smoking cessation treatment that depends
      upon primary care clinic staff, a fax-to-quit referral mechanism and a state quit line.
