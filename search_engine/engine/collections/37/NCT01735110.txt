      80 to 90% of procedures. A recent meta-analysis indicated that TRI has advantages in reducing
      major bleeding and ischemic events compared to transfemoral intervention (TFI) after the
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no clinical trial has yet shown
      statistical equivalence in terms of long-term efficacy of TRI compared with TFI for the
      treatment of complex coronary lesions, which is simply due to limited numbers of subjects
      enrolled. The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      TRI versus TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery
      disease.
