      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in
           patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

        -  Determine the progression-free rate in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1 hour on days 1,
      8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 courses of treatment, disease response is
      assessed. Patients with stable or responding disease receive additional courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
