    
      The SENTINEL-LIR Study is a multicenter, prospective registry to observe rate and type of
      debris capture in subjects at low surgical risk undergoing TAVI to demonstrate the positive
      effects of the use of the Sentinel System. Histopathology of captured debris from the
      Sentinel System will be analyzed.

      The primary objective is to determine the presence or absence of particles of 7 discreet
      tissue types: acute thrombus (with or without associated tissue/foreign material), organizing
      thrombus, valve tissue, arterial wall/necrotic core, calcification, foreign material, and
      myocardium. Morphometric assessment of the debris (sizes >150 m, >500 m, and >1,000 m).

      Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and documents which will have
      been reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee or regulatory authority prior to
      undergoing any study related exams or procedures.

      Fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in the study from an estimated 6 different sites.
