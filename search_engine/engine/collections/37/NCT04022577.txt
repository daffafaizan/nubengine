      design will be conducted for 120 participants with schizophrenia spectrum in regional
      hospital in northern Taiwan. After baseline data collection finished, the blocked
      randomization will be employed to assign participants to two groups. The experimental group
      will participate in a eight session course of Adherence Therapy. The control group received
      routine care. The data will be collected for three times: before and after the intervention
      and 6 months after the intervention ends. A structured Questionnaire will use to collect data
      on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale, Schedule for the Assessment of Insight,
      Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire and
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Data analysis will employ IBM SPSS 20.0 with
      Generalized estimating equations approach to examine effects of Adherence Therapy and routine
