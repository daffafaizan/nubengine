      develop stress fractures compared to active duty service members. Up to 800 male and female
      recruits will be enrolled at the MCRD, Parris Island, SC over two seasons (summer/fall and
      winter/spring) in order to account for seasonal variation in vitamin D status. Ca (2000 mg/d)
      and vitamin D (1000 IU/d) will be supplied as either capsules or a fortified food product
      daily throughout training. This study will provide novel data for the military, medical and
      scientific communities regarding the relationship between Ca and vitamin D supplementation
      and biomarkers of immune function, and the requirements for calcium and vitamin D to support
      bone health during IMT.
