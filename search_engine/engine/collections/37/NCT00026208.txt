        -  Evaluate the freedom from progression in patients with stage I or IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma
           with a favorable prognosis treated with "Stanford V-C" chemotherapy comprising
           cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vinblastine, prednisone, vincristine, bleomycin, and
           etoposide with low-dose radiotherapy (RT).

        -  Minimize the early and late effects of treatment in these patients by avoiding staging
           laparotomy and its consequences, limiting cumulative doses of chemotherapy, and reducing
           the dose of RT to moderately bulky sites of disease.

        -  Assess early and late treatment-related toxicity, freedom from second disease
           progression, and overall survival at 5 and 10 years in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Participants receive Stanford V-C chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 30 to 60
      minutes weekly on weeks 1 and 5; doxorubicin IV and vinblastine IV over 5 minutes once weekly
      on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7; oral prednisone every other day on weeks 1 to 8; vincristine IV, and
      bleomycin IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; and etoposide IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 3 and 7. Prior to protocol amendment, participants were
      assigned to treatment on the basis of tumor size (< 5 cm vs 5 to 10 cm), with only the
      participants with larger tumors receiving RT. Beginning 2 to 3 weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy, participants in the +RT group will receive low-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week
      for approximately 3 weeks. Subsequent to amendment, all participants received RT.

      Participants are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
