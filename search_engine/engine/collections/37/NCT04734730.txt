      I. Increase the efficacy of first-line therapy for men with metastatic castration-sensitive
      prostate cancer by adding the PARP inhibitor talazoparib to standard therapy with androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) + abiraterone acetate (abiraterone).

      II. Study the efficacy of abiraterone and talazoparib in an ethnically diverse population.

      III. Evaluate whether androgen receptor genetic variation may identify a subpopulation of
      patients who benefit, even in the absence of homologous repair deficiency mutations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD), abiraterone acetate PO QD, and
      prednisone PO QD on days 1-28. Patients also receive androgen deprivation therapy consisting
      of degarelix subcutaneously (SC) on day 1; leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1
      and bicalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and then leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of
      subsequent cycles; leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 and bicalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 of
      cycle 1 and then leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of cycles 2, 5, 8, and 11; or goserelin
      acetate SC monthly or every 3 months. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
