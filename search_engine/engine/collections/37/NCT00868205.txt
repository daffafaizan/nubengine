    
      Objective: The main objective of the present study is to determine the short- and mid-term
      effects of a coffee, on oxidative stress parameters in humans.

      Study design: randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded, 3-arm parallel Study
      population: 168 apparently healthy volunteers: males and females aged >=35 and <= 65 years.

      Intervention: The treatments consist of daily consumption of either:

      Treatment 1: 0.45 L coffee (3 cups) and 0.30 L bottled water daily or; Treatment 2: 0.75 L
      coffee (5 cups) daily or; Treatment 3: 0.75 L water daily Duration of the treatment
      intervention is 8 weeks. Before the intervention period starts, a run-in period of five weeks
      where all subjects maintain their low antioxidant diet (Dutch average) is conducted by all
      subjects in order to standardize the antioxidant intake of the subjects.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Mean level of %T as a measure of DNA oxidative damage at
      week 8. Secondary outcome is the mean level of 8-isoprostane in 24 hr urine.
