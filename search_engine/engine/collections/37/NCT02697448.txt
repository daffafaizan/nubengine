      automaticity, accounting for secondary atrial pacemakers. Volatile anesthetics also have
      varying effects on the AV node and His-Pukinje system. These agents also prolong the QT
      interval and, for this reason, volatile anesthetics as a group have at times been avoided for
      atrial fibrillation ablation due to the fear that they may affect the efficacy of the
      ablation and increase recurrence. However, sevoflurane does not have the effects shown for
      other volatile anesthetics cardiac conduction. At this point there has not been a study
      comparing propofol, a non volatile anesthetic typically used in these cases, to sevoflurane,
      a volatile anesthetic, to determine if volatile anesthetics should be avoided during these
      procedures. This study will challenge the existing belief that sevoflurane increases the
      length of time to ablate atrial fibrillation and also decreases the efficacy of the ablation.
