    
      This study is a 12-month, double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial in 200 older
      (65-89 yrs) men and women with initial 25(OH)D concentrations of 18-<30 ng/mL to determine
      the effect of increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to â‰¥30 ng/mL through vitamin D3
      supplementation on 1) change in neuromuscular functions that are established risk-factors for
      falls in older adults; and 2) changes in the underlying physiological mechanisms over 4
      months in a subset of 40 randomly selected participants. Participants will be randomized to
      2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 or placebo. Lower extremity muscle strength and power, physical
      performance, and postural sway will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 12 months and falls
      assessed monthly. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be taken at baseline and 4
      months to assess muscle fiber type, contractility, and denervation, and number and
      differentiation stage of satellite cells.
