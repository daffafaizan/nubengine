      functional capacities of patients. After a deep evaluation of the expectations and needs of
      patients and their caregivers, the therapists propose to work one or more specific activities
      that were once pleasant through 12 to 15 sessions at home over 3 months. They also advise
      individuals to optimize home safety. A pilot observational study that we conducted reported a
      significant reduction in behavioral disorders of patients during the first 3 months followed
      by stability. According to the therapists involved in this study, the 3-month format is
      considered too short to produce perennial benefits; stimulation is often interrupted at the
      end of the 3 months, which creates a break in management that can be deleterious for
      patients.

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the maintenance of
      occupational therapy for 4 months beyond the three months provided for in the regulatory
      framework for the management of demented patients, Measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory
      (NPI). The secondary objectives will be to study the efficacy on other clinical criteria but
      also to carry out an economic evaluation of the maintenance of occupational therapy.
