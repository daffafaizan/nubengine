      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity in the basolateral amygdala. Intra-amygdala
      infusions of antagonists of this glutamate receptor in small animals (eg: rats, mice) have
      demonstrated a blockage of fear acquisition and extinction. Agonists, on the other hand,
      facilitate conditioned fear extinction.

      The animal studies are all based on the simple fear learning paradigm of conditioning.
      However, it is not clear that human anxiety disorders are based on prior conditioning
      encounter. Therefore it is important to disentangle the effect of DCS on acquisition and
      extinction in the context of a simple learning paradigm, particular its effect on the human
      amygdala.
