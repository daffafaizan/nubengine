      trial. One-hundred and fifty-four patients with symptoms of acute renal colic and a ureteral
      calculus less than 10 mm in largest diameter on flat plain abdominal x-ray (KUB) or
      non-contrast computer tomography (CT) scan will be randomized in this trial. At the time of
      presentation with acute renal colic to the Emergency Department, the patient will be
      recruited for involvement. After informed consent, patients will be provided either 200 mg of
      Celebrex or a placebo equivalent. They will be instructed to follow the recommended dosing
      regimen for acute pain, taking two tablets in the emergency room (400 mg), followed by one
      tablet 12 hours later (200 mg), then one tablet twice a day for 10 days. Patients will be
      provided a prescription for Vicodin (1-2 tablets of 5/500 every 4-6 hours) to be taken as
      required for pain. Throughout the study, patients will be asked to strain urine for passage
      of calculus and note date and time of passage. Patients will also be asked to maintain a
      daily narcotic diary and complete a daily pain analog scale provided by our institution.
      Patients will be followed in the Urology Department's Stone Clinic with weekly imaging
      studies (KUB or CT scan) and renal function tests (serum creatinine) for 4 weeks.
