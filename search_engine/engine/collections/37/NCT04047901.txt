      functional class (NYHA) I-III, under medical treatment for heart failure. Patients with
      coronary artery disease, moderate to severe valve disease, positive Chagas serology,
      inability to participate in an exercise program are excluded.

      Primary outcome: Muscle sympathetic nerve activity Secondary outcome: arterial baroreflex
      sensitivity, peripheral chemorreflex sensitivity, mecanic and muscuclar metaborreflex
      control, ubiquitin proteasome system activity.

      Patients were divided into 2 groups-trained (n = 10) and non-trained (n = 10). Patients in
      the trained group will complete 16 weeks of aerobic training. Evaluation of cardiac function,
      functional capacity, quality of life and biochemical evaluation (troponin, hs-CRP and BNP).
      For muscle evaluation will be performed biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle
