      follow-up or for the assessment of cerebral or inner ear pathology.

        -  ENT evaluation: The position of the implant will be evaluated. The distance from the
           external ear canal (center of the abutment or center of the magnet) will be measured on
           the patient using a ribbon meter. The angle between the implant and the orbital plane
           (in degrees) will be evaluated on a profile photograph.

        -  Imaging evaluation: MRI examinations will be anonymized and sent to a single core
           laboratory for reading. One reader, a board-certified neuroradiologist with 5 years of
           experience in inner ear imaging, blinded to all data, will review all MRI examinations
           on a dedicated workstation with the Carestream Vue PACS software (Carestream Health,
           Rochester, NY). The main outcome measures will be the size of artifacts and the
           interpretability of sequences. The following MRI sequences will be performed on a 1.5T
           scanner (1.5T PhilipsÂ®, Ingenia), covering the temporal bones :
