      antimicrobial conversion in hospitalized patients. Published rates of IV to PO antimicrobial
      conversion are consistently below 50% in eligible inpatients. Studies have suggested that
      nurses may be well positioned to provide a positive influence on prescriber behavior related
      to antimicrobial IV to PO conversion, however, no published research has evaluated the impact
      of nurses on antimicrobial IV to PO conversion rates. Published research has described the
      barriers and enablers to nurse participation in promoting antimicrobial IV to PO conversion
      using the COM-B model of behaviour change. This quasi-experimental study will evaluate
      whether determinants of nurse behaviour and their actual behaviour can be changed to increase
      antimicrobial IV to PO conversion rates in hospitalized patients.
