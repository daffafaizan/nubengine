      structural or functional characteristics such as hypertrophy or strength. However, the
      different nature of their methods has suggested for years the possibility that different
      neuromuscular mechanisms could be behind these observed characteristics.

      The development of a new technology, such as high-density electromyography (HDEMG), capable
      of studying new properties previously hidden from assessment methods, such as the speed of
      nerve impulse propagation or the frequency of motor unit discharge, has allowed a more
      thorough study of the mechanisms.

      This study aims to apply this new study methodology to know what are the mechanisms
      underlying the changes at the structural and functional level obtained by two different
      training methods, commonly used, facilitating their understanding, study and subsequent
      application according to specific needs.

      For this reason, the main hypothesis is the generation of different neuromuscular mechanisms
      and adaptations by executing, for 4 weeks, two different training methodologies, obtaining a
      dissociation between the results obtained at the structural level (hypertrophy), functional
      (generation of strength) and HDEMG analysis of the central and peripheral characteristics of
      the neuromuscular system in each of the programs studied.
