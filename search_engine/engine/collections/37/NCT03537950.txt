      potential to shift brain excitation and inhibition (E-I) in the healthy brain and in
      neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions, where this balance is disrupted, such as autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD). However, no study to date has investigated this. Therefore, in this
      study, we invited 20 healthy men with and without ASD. Each participant received each drug
      once (600mg CBD/CBDV, or matched placebo) and magnetic resonance imaging was used to obtain
      measures of brain biochemistry, activity, and connectivity. We further obtained
      questionnaires, task data, saliva, urine and blood samples, and conducted visual tasks using
      eye tracking, electroencephalography, and retinal imaging.
