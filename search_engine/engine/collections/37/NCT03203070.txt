      gastric bypass will be randomized into 2 groups: patients undergoing laparoscopic-guided TAP
      block with 30 ml Bupivacaine 0.5%, as part of multimodal analgesia (Group 1), associated with
      postoperative intravenous analgesia (Metamizol 2g/8h and Acetaminophen 1g/8h), and patients
      receiving only postoperative intravenous analgesia (Metamizol 2g/8h and Acetaminophen 1g/8h)
      (Group 2).

      Postoperative pain will be assessed with a Visual Analogic Scale 24 hours after surgery and
      morphine needs will be quantified.
