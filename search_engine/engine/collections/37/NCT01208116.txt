      especially in elderly. Conventional risk factors are widely used in clinical practice, but it
      is inadequate and inaccurate due to no direct evaluation of artery. However, invasive method,
      it is difficult to be applied in atherosclerosis screening and only used in advanced
      institutions, is expensive and unacceptable. We are trying to assess the value of noninvasive
      measurements in predicting cardiovascular events.

      Five invasive methods will be applied in the study, including

        -  brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity(baPWV)

        -  Carotid Intimal-Medial Thickness(CIMT)

        -  Flow Mediated Dilation(FMD)

        -  Ankle-Brachial Index(ABI)

        -  Coronary Artery Calcification Score(CACS)

      These indices represent not only different phase of atherosclerosis, but also various
      sections and arterial layers.
