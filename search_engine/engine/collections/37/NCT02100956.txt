    
      Rationale: The investigators anticipate that oxytocin will be effective after spinal
      injection in humans to acutely relieve chronic neuropathic pain.

      Objectives: Determine the effect of intrathecal oxytocin on pain and areas and intensity of
      hyperalgesia and allodynia in patients with chronic neuropathic pain.

      Interventions: A computer generated randomization will be used to determine the group for
      each subject. Subjects will be randomized to receive an intrathecal injection of saline
      (placebo) or oxytocin.
