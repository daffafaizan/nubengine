      space in the middle ear and the air cavities of the temporal bone over a period of three
      months. Although COM is defined as a multifactorial disease, its etiopathogenesis has not
      been fully elucidated. Cholesteatoma is a condition that disrupts the balance between bone
      formation and resorption in COM. The cholesteatoma is a destructive squamous epithelial
      lesion of temporal bone, it gradually expands and leads to serious complications by the
      destruction of near bone structures, ossicular chain and otic capsule. A growing debate
      examines the role of bone formation and destruction with osteoblasts, osteocytes and
      osteoclast cells in cholesteatoma formation. Sclerostin is a glycoprotein that plays a role
      in the regulation of bone metabolism secreted by osteocytes. Antibodies directed against
      sclerostin stimulate bone formation and represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment
      of increased bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis and generalized bone loss,
      inflammatory diseases with cartilage damage. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      levels of sclerostin in patients with cholesteatoma. So far, there is no study showing the
      levels of sclerostin in cholesteatoma. The investigators hope that the results of our study
      will start new processes that can be used in the clinic.
