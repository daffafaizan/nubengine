      commonly undernourished. Previous observational studies indicate that increased dietary
      administration of protein or essential amino acids might be associated with improved clinical
      outcomes. The investigators propose that the parenteral supplementation of intravenous amino
      acids in critically-ill patients will restore anabolic processes and that anabolism is
      associated with molecular markers of amino acid sensing and protein synthesis. The results
      from this study will establish biomarkers of anabolism (i.e., nutritional success) that can
      be used in future clinical trials on the use of amino acid supplementation in the
      critically-ill.
