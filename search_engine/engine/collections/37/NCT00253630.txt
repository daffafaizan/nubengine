      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of SAHA (vorinostat) as assessed by the objective
      response rate, time to progression and survival in subjects with advanced lymphoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity profile of SAHA in this patient population. III. To perform
      correlative laboratory investigations to confirm modulation of chromatin acetylation as the
      biologic target and attempt to gain insight into the downstream molecular mechanisms involved
      in the induction of apoptosis mediated by SAHA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
