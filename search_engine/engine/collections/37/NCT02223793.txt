      consent withdrawn, were invited back to pharmacies to perform the same measurements for the
      third time. However, at this third visit, pharmacies were randomized 1:2 to test an
      additional intervention. Further, an extra blood sample, dried blood spot, was taken to
      measure cholesterol, HbA1c and fatty acids.

      About half of the pharmacies (n=23) communicated cardiovasular disease (CVD) risk factor
      levels as Heart age compared to own age (British communication tool) together with tailored
      lifestyle advices on how to reduce elevated levels. While the other 25 pharmacies
      communicated CVD risk the usual way and gave general lifestyle advices on how to reduce CVD
      risk. 4 weeks later, all participants took dried blood spot samples at home. We will compare
      results from dried blood spot samples to study whether heart age and tailored lifestyle
      advice is more effective than general information in reducing CVD risk.

      The investigators will also record social security number to make connection to central
      health registry as prescription registry, patient registry and cause of death registry after
      2 years and 5 years.
