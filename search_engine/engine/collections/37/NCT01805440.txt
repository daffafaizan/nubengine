    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the investigational drug
      uridine as a treatment for depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder (i.e. "bipolar
      depression").

      In addition to treatment with the investigational drug versus placebo, the study includes a
      translational neuroimaging component: magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) brain scans
      are performed at baseline, and then repeated following 6 weeks of treatment with uridine or
      placebo. The scans do not use radiation, and are performed on a 3 Tesla MRI system that is
      approved for clinical use. The scans allow researchers to measure the concentrations of
      several chemicals in the brain that are believed to be involved in bipolar disorder and
      depression.

      The primary hypothesis is that uridine treatment will be associated with a significant
      decrease in GLX (i.e. glutamate + glutamine) levels, compared to placebo, in a part of the
      brain known as the anterior cingulate cortex.

      The secondary hypothesis is that decreased depressive symptoms measured with the Children
      Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
      (MADRS) will be correlated with reductions in GLX.

      All participants who complete the initial 6-week protocol, including two brain scans, will be
      offered 6 months of open-label treatment with uridine.
