    
      This study has 2 phases: an Induction Phase (4 Cycles) and a Maintenance Phase (Up to 31
      cycles of pembrolizumab). In the Induction Phase, participants receive pembrolizumab plus
      pemetrexed plus platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin). In the Maintenance Phase, participants
      with a partial or complete disease response or with stable disease after completing four
      cycles of induction therapy and who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to
      receive pembrolizumab plus maintenance olaparib OR pembrolizumab plus maintenance pemetrexed.
      In the Maintenance Phase, participants receive pembrolizumab for up to 31 cycles plus
      maintenance olaparib OR maintenance pemetrexed until progressive disease (PD), intolerable
      toxicities, or physician decision.
