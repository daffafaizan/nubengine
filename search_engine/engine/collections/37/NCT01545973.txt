      actually touching it. Although this technology has been applied to non-living materials (e.g.
      metal and semiconductors) before, it has not been effectively applied to biological
      materials, much less to live human skin . This project aims to evaluate the use of Scanning
      Kelvin Probe to live human skin by investigating the effects of skin thickness, skin
      moisture, and sweat glands on Kelvin Probe measurements of electrical potential. Testing will
      be performed on the arms and hands of twenty four healthy individuals under different study
      conditions.
