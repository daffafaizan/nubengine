      for cognition in health and in neuropsychiatric diseases, particularly schizophrenia.
      Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) will be measured with oxygen-15 water positron emission
      tomography (PET) while subjects are either at rest or are performing a variety of
      neuropsychological tests. Some of these tests involve cognitive operations that are posited
      to depend upon the frontal cortex, such as the use of working memory for abstract reasoning
      and problem solving, formation and maintenance of conceptual sets, set shifting, sequencing,
      and delayed response; others control for nonspecific sensory and motor aspects of these
      measurements or are contrast conditions posited to depend on other brain regions.
      Interactions between regional activation, cognitive behavior, and neuropharmacology will be
      assessed by measuring cognitively-related rCBF during treatment with drugs that may affect
      frontal lobe physiology. Hypotheses about genetic determinants of these relationships will
      also be tested by comparing rCBF measures across individuals harboring different genotypes
      (detemined through protocol 95-M-0150).
