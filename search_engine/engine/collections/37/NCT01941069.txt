      externalizing and anxiety problems with a high degree of fidelity, integrity and clinical
      effectiveness could spur more initiatives toward the adoption of EBIs in urban schools, thus
      further lowering health disparities in these settings. The overall purpose of this project is
      to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier School-wide Positive Behavior
      Support (SWPBS, an evidence based intervention) program for typically developing children as
      well as children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders can implement the
      components of the program with the same level of fidelity, integrity and clinical
      effectiveness when they receive a low level of support (consultation) from their coaches and
      supervisors as they can with a high level of support (consultation and coaching). This study
      will target six schools within the Philadelphia School District (PSD). Within those 6
      schools, research participants will consist of students (grades 4-8) and school staff
      members. The investigators will evaluate 1) the effectiveness of SWPBS with consultation and
      coaching, as compared to the baseline and to SWPBS with consultation only; in reducing office
      discipline referrals (ODRs) and improving school climate, and children's grades, diagnostic
      status, symptom severity and impairment; 2) the effectiveness of the SWPBS with consultation
      and coaching, as compared to SWPBS with consultation only, in increasing program fidelity and
      integrity.
