      in terms of tumoral answer, survival without progression and global survival. Usually
      administered in the day hospitalization department, its preparation and administration to the
      patient are compatible with hospital-at-home management. This type of management has
      particularly developed in the context of the COVID pandemic and recommendations for good
      practices in hospital-at-home immunotherapy have recently been drafted by FITC (Société
      Française d'Immuno-Thérapie du Cancer). These recommendations open the way for administration
      of immunotherapy and chemotherapy combo in hospital-at-home. At the moment, there is no study
      stating the feasibility of home hospitalization for patients treated by
      immunotherapy-chemotherapy combo. To follow up on the feasibility study of home immunotherapy
      (ImHADom) carried out at CH Pau from March 2019 to March 2021, the sponsor propose to
      evaluate with descriptive study the feasibility under the same conditions of
      chemotherapy-immunotherapy in patients treated in the maintenance phase of a first metastatic
      row.

      This study will be proposed to all the patients in maintenance phase of first row treatment
      with at least one positive tumoral imaging assessment (stable disease or partial response)
      for whom home hospitalization has been decided and scheduled by the healthcare team in a
      medical staff meeting.

      The patients included in the study will be followed according to the common practice: a
      consultation every 3 months during 1 year.
