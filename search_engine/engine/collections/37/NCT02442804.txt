      in many fruits and vegetables may help improve brain functioning (for example, memory and
      attention) in healthy individuals and prevent cognitive decline in individuals who have
      suffered a stroke. The purpose of this research study is to examine whether dietary
      supplementation with an antioxidant extract can help promote healthy cognitive functioning as
      a component of recovery after stroke. The procedures include: Administering polyphenols via 2
      POMx pills, each of which contains polyphenols derived from pomegranates equivalent to the
      content of approximately 8 ounces of pomegranate juice, or placebo pills (capsules containing
      no polyphenol ingredients), every day for one week to inpatients who are in the acute
      post-stroke phase. Neuropsychological testing pre- and post-treatment will determine whether
      cognitive functioning changes. Subjects will be randomized into either a placebo or
      polyphenol group.
