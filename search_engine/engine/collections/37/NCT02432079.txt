    
      Heterotaxy syndrome is a rare birth defect that involves the heart and other organs. Many
      cases are genetic. Fundamental lack of information about the genetic basis of heterotaxy and
      related congenital heart defects in the vast majority of children has hindered management and
      therapy. The study outlined in this protocol is designed to obtain information about the
      causes of heterotaxy and related congenital heart defects. In this study, investigators will
      perform genetic analyses on patients with heterotaxy and related congenital heart defects, or
      individuals at risk for these abnormalities. The investigators will collect medical
      information related to symptoms and disease course. These results will provide important
      information on the causes, management, and prognosis of heterotaxy and related congenital
      heart defects.
