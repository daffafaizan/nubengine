      content.

      By capturing and analyzing the breath of anti-COVID-19 vaccinated subjects during the period
      of antibody production, the investigators will determine and quantify all the compounds
      associated with the body reaction to the COVID-19 antigen.

      Rapidly growing serological evidence shows that IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against the S or
      N proteins evolve rapidly in the serum of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic COVID-19
      patients within a week of infection or symptom onset and stay elevated with progressing
      disease.

      Since the standard serology testing at Shamir Medical center tracks the presence of IgG only,
      those serologic tests will be conducted before and 48 hours following the second vaccination
      dose.

      Nevertheless, since IgM antibodies are known to be produced by four to seven days following
      the first dose of vaccination, although IgM serology testing cannot be performed, the
      investigators are interested in sampling breath at this time range, in order for them to
      correlate it with the changes in the subjects' physiologic condition.

      Since this is an unknown metabolic volatile compound mixture, the goal will be to identify
      compounds and quantify them with a high level of precision and subsequently correlate them
      with the disease.
