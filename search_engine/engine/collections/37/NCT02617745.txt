      based on a multidisciplinary approach combining an initial surgical resection, if feasible,
      then Stupp protocol. Stupp protocol consists of two phases: first phase involves external
      radiotherapy with concomitant oral temozolomide at a dose of 75mg/m2 per day for about six
      weeks. After 4 weeks of therapy break, maintenance phase begins with temozolomide alone, for
      a period of 6 cycles (1 cycle = 5 days over 28). The dose of temozolomide is 150mg/m2 on the
      first cycle followed by 200 mg/m2. One major limiting toxicity of temozolomide is
      hematologic, especially thrombocytopenia. They occur in around 15 and 20% of patients in
      maintenance phase. Thrombocytopenia has an impact on the schedule of Stupp protocol such as
      dose reduction or even early discontinuation. Currently no predictive marker of
      thrombocytopenia in the maintenance phase was identified. Such marker could be of major
      interest to adapt biological and clinical follow-up by patient in maintenance phase. We
      conduct a retrospective analysis on a cohort of patients suffering from glioblastoma and
      treated with Stupp protocol. We found that a decrease in platelet count during the
      radio-chemotherapy phase could be highly predictive of protocol changes in maintenance phase
      of temozolomide due to thrombocytopenia. The main objective of GLIOPLAK is to prospectively
      confirm the predictive value of this test and to evaluate the prognostic impact of the
      occurrence of thrombocytopenia <100,000/mm3. Secondary objective of GLIOPLAK are to describe
      all limiting toxicities in maintenance phase, to constitute a prospective biological
      collection and to collect biological samples to perform pharmacological analysis
      (pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetics parameters).
