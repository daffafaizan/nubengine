      for experiencing delirium than nonmechanically ventilated patients (20%-50%). Its occurrence
      is also more frequent in elder patients. More than that, it is often hard to identify
      delirium by physicians, leading to unreasonable management of ICU patients.

      And delirium is one of main adverse events in ventilated patients who receive long-term usage
      of mono-sedative. Sequential sedation may reduce these adverse effects.

      However, few present studies focus on delirium in sequential sedation patients. Thus, in this
      study, we aimed to determine the factors of delirium in patients who received sequential
      sedation in ICU.
