      CPAP with conventional ventilator derived CPAP. Infants of gestation <32 weeks and of birth
      weight less than 1500 grams considered by the treating team to be ready for the initial
      extubation within first week of life were screened for enrolment. All eligible neonates were
      randomly allocated to bubble CPAP or conventional CPAP.The purpose of this study is to
      compare whether infants on Bubble CPAP had more chances of successful extubation as compared
      to infants put on Conventional CPAP.
