      patients with one or more chronic diseases among heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease and diabetes. The particular target of patients selected has the particularity of
      being "frail" according to a set of social eligibility criteria, agreed by the clinicians
      participating at the study. General practitioners are the first clinicians in charge of
      managing these patients during the trial follow-up. The term of comparison is represented by
      a control group, followed by outpatient usual care.

      From a clinical point of view, the trial will investigate how the remote monitoring of some
      clinical parameters contributes to reduce the access to healthcare facilities (emergency and
      planned hospitalization, bed-days, ER, specialist and GP visits), to improve the patients
      health-related quality of life and to reduce the anxiety about health conditions. A
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and
      how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also
      with organizational changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients
      and professionals perception towards the service.
