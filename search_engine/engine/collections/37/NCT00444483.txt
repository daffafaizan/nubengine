      general practitioner to the inpatient unit of the university hospital of Jena, Germany, for
      participation in a structured DTTP for insulin therapy because of hyperglycemia, were
      candidates for successive inclusion in the study. All patients participated in a five day
      inpatient structured DTTP for single or split dose administration of intermediate-acting
      insulin which included instruction in insulin injection, self- monitoring, hypoglycemia,
      acute/late complications, nutrition and foot care. Quality of life was assessed by using a
      validated instrument, the standardised QoL- questionnaire of Lohr et al. (21) both before and
      six months after participation in the DTTP. This questionnaire consists of 58 Likert- scaled
      items comprising the subscales: social relations, physical complaints, worries about the
      future, diet restrictions, fear of hypoglycemia, and daily struggles. Higher scores reflect
      higher quality of life with 100% as an optimum quality of life. The primary outcome measure
      regarding patients metabolic control was the improvement of quality of life six months after
      DTTP.
