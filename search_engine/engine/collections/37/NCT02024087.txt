      combination with sorafenib, would be administered at increasing dose levels among 3 cohorts
      of subjects with HCC in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the
      combination. Once the MTD was determined, a forth expansion cohort of subjects would be
      enrolled at the MTD to assess safety. A total of up to 38 subjects were planned.

      The initial cohort (Cohort 1) enrolled 5 subjects at a dalantercept dose level of 0.6 mg/kg
      once every 3 weeks (Q3W) in combination with sorafenib (400 mg PO once daily). Following an
      assessment of safety/tolerability by a Safety Review Team, it was recommended to de-escalate
      the dalantercept dose for Cohort 2 to 0.4 mg/kg Q3W in combination with sorafenib (400 mg PO
      once daily); 6 subjects were enrolled.

      The 0.4 mg/kg dose level was determined to be the MTD, and an additional 10 subjects were
      enrolled at that dose level in the expansion cohort (Cohort 3).

      A formal Statistical Analysis Plan was initially planned for this study. However, due to its
      early termination, only cursory descriptive statistics were carried out on the available
      data; no formal SAP was prepared.
