      CNI for addressing cardiovascular health, physical wellness and quality of life. If these
      classes prove to be effective, online platforms could be a viable avenue for those with CNI
      to exercise and increase/maintain wellness without having to leave their homes. The
      investigators are also attempting to determine if a class with a live instructor vs a
      pre-recorded class has an effect on motivation, compliance, exertion and
      modifications/safety.

      The entire process, including screening and consenting, will be done via Zoom and Redcap,
      potentially providing a blueprint for the future studies. This process can enable
      participants to participate in studies with minimal inconvenience, expense and effort of
      traveling for the consent process.
