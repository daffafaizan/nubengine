    
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center clinical study
      whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of
      trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted with the hydrophobic IOL
      FineVision POD F GF or the hydrophilic IOL FineVision POD F (both lenses: (PhysIOL, Li√®ge,
      Belgium).

      The devices under investigation (FineVision POD F GF and POD F) are trifocal glistening-free
      acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL sa/nv.
      The main difference between the lenses is the material (hydrophobic and hydrophilic). The
      IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from
      cataract development.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 12 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 9 postoperative) over a period of 36 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the 3 months follow up visit and secondary
      endpoint data will be collected at the 3, 12, 24 and 36 months follow up visits. Data
      analyses will be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the
      study publication plan.
