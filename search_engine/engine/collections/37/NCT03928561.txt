    
      A monocentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study conducted outside of the
      pollen season. The study lasts 3 months for each patient, which includes a screening period,
      two exposure visits in the Alyatec Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) with active or
      placebo air cleaners, and a follow-up visit.

      Patients with early asthmatic reaction during baseline exposure are randomly allocated to one
      of two sequences: active air cleaners /placebo or placebo/active air cleaners. Randomization
      is balanced (1:1) between the two sequences. There is a 3-week wash-out period between the
      two exposures.
