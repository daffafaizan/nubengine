      relationship with their best friend. Doctors will review your (child's) medical chart to find
      out how severe the disease is, so that this may be compared to the answers you have (your
      child has) given on the friendship questionnaire.

      This is an Investigational Study. About 90-100 children and adolescents with NF-1 will be
      asked to take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.
