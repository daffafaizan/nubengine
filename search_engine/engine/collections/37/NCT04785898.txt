      appropriate patient management, to contain the epidemic and to better understand the global
      epidemiology of the virus. This detection will intensify in the coming months due to the
      start of the school year and university as well as the economic recovery.

      Until now, laboratory diagnostics have relied primarily on the amplification and detection of
      viral gene sequences in upper respiratory tract samples performed in a centralized
      laboratory. A new test (ID NowTM COVID-19 developed by the Abbott laboratory) is available on
      the market. This test is the first in France to be able to be carried out in a medical
      examination of delocalized biology (MEDB) and makes it possible to return a result in 15 min
      directly in the clinical department. This speed will allow faster care, isolation and
      filiarisation of COVID-19 patients. The speed of this technique is based on the use of
      isothermal gene amplification. The investigators will be the first to evaluate it in France
      in MEDB in the context of urgent care. This evaluation of diagnostic performance will be
      performed during a comparison with that of our routine PCR microbiology laboratory test
      Simplexa â„¢ COVID-19 Direct assay marketed by the company DiaSorin.

      This speed of obtaining results should lead to better efficiency of medical management,
      faster isolation and organization for COVID-19 positive patients.

      The objective of this work is to assess diagnostic performance in relocated biology in a real
      situation and to validate this rapid strategy for the benefit of patients consulting the
      emergency department.
