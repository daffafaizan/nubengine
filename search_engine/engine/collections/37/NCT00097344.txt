      These non-ovarian tissues become the dominant sources of estrogen in postmenopausal women.
      Breast cancer cells are often very dependent on estrogens to continue to grow. Atamestane
      blocks the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors in the body via the aromatase
      enzyme. Toremifene blocks circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen
      receptors in breast cancer cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase
      inhibitor, in combination with the estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve
      complete suppression of estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed
      to determine whether combined hormonal therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression
      and the rate of objective response, as compared to single agent therapy with the approved
      aromatase inhibitor letrozole.
