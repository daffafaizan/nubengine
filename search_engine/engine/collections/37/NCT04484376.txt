      disease, invasive candidiasis, and that the detection of these factors may allow detecting
      the population at risk and implementing both pharmacological measures and general strategies
      to reduce the mortality of fungal infection.

      Primary objective: To determine if candida auris is associated with increased risk of
      mortality in invasive fungal disease and the risk factors for mortality in the invasive
      fungal disease, including the species of candida that causes this disease.

      Secondary objectives:

      Determination of predictors of mortality in invasive fungal disease. Prepare and validate a
      score in our environment that allows discriminating those patients with a high risk of
      mortality.

      To analyze the pharmacological management that has been carried out in patients who develop
      candidemia due to auris.

      Detect hospital stays of both population groups, in terms of health management.

      Type of study: observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study of cases and controls of
      a selected exposed population that developed the disease over time or not.
