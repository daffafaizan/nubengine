      day. This will allow recruiting and testing of patients with CNV which is a dynamic disease
      that is most often treated on that same day. Following enrollment, patients will go through
      an examiner supervised tutorial followed by a self-performed HMP examination. In addition
      patient will undergo an Amsler grid examination, biomicroscopy, color fundus photography and
      fluorescein angiography. The HMP output shall be a test result that can be within or outside
      normal limits. Inherent to the test are reliability criteria which help to determine if the
      patient performed the test reliably. These consist of false positive and false negative
      errors. All criteria for normal limits and reliable performance are set prior to study
      initiation. The outcome measures for the study are the sensitivity in identifying visual
      functional defects in patients with CNV.
