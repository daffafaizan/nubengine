      of silver alginate (Algidexâ„¢) dressing compared to standard catheter care. Following parental
      consent, infants are randomized to receive silver alginate or standard of care dressing.
      Infants with birth weights less than 1,500 grams admitted to Baylor University Medical Center
      (BUMC) NICU with any of the following lines are eligible for inclusion into this study up to
      72 hours after birth: umbilical arterial line (UAL), umbilical venous line (UVL), peripheral
      arterial line (PAL), peripheral long line (PLL), and central venous line (CVL). Safety is
      assessed by measuring silver levels and monitoring for cutaneous reactions. Dressings are
      changed every seven days. Silver levels are drawn on study days 1, 7, and 28. Blood culture
      results are used to compare infection rates between the two groups. Patient demographics and
      clinical conditions are recorded. Results will be analyzed based on intention to treat.
