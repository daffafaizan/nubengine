      population-representative cohort study by meeting the following elements: firm knowledge
      about the population denominator, knowledge about reasons for refusal (in line with previous
      methods in HUNT), options for levels and localisation of participation (at test station, at
      home, at nursing homes), coverage of sociodemographic features by the comprehensive
      HUNT4-protocol and register linkage, inclusion of institutionalized individuals and
      individuals with reduced capacity to consent, measurement of risk and compensatory factors
      across the life course by merging with previous results in HUNT surveys and linkage to
      registries, core elements and assessment methods can be compared with other European
      populations studies including elderly people, and finally, the ability to include biobank
      results in the data analysis. The HUNT data supplemented by register linkage include all
      established and suspected risk factors of dementia.

      A particular focus on primary health care is appropriate because it is in this part of the
      health care system that the need for extra resources due to the substantial increase in
      dementia prevalence is most pronounced. Furthermore, preventive measures in a life-course
      perspective will mainly have to be implemented in the primary health care setting.
