      wide spectrum of perioperative myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injuries resulting in
      significant cardiac morbidity, namely contractile dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and low
      cardiac output syndrome requiring prolonged intensive care and hospital stay. The infusion of
      glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) is one of the oldest cardioprotective interventions during
      cardiac surgery. Although experimental evidence is strong, clinical data remain conflicting.
      We will investigate the impact of short term GIK on the extent of myocardial injuries as well
      as on the left-ventricular systolic and diastolic function in 2 high-risk groups of cardiac
      surgical patients: Patients with cardiac dysfunction undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery
      and patients with severe aortic stenosis.
