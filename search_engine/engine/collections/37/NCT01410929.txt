      fractures (VCFs) affect approximately 30% of myeloma patients. As myeloma patients live
      longer, it is especially relevant to provide the best available treatment for pain and reduce
      disabilities that can result from VCFs.

      Cement delivery is a well established treatment method for treating painful vertebrae
      compromised by tumor and/or osteoporosis. The StabiliT Vertebral Augmentation System (DFine
      Inc.) is a unique percutaneous vertebral augmentation system designed to provide the
      physician a means of creating targeted cavities and an ultra-high viscosity cement (using RF
      Energy) that can be delivered over an extended period of time in order to allow for
      controlled, targeted vertebral augmentation in multiple myeloma patients.
