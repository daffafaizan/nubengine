           part of the body. Thus, SPI - a measure that reflects pain during surgery - may not
           exceed significantly compared to baseline. It may slightly increase only during
           administration of the block.

        2. Increasing SPI values due to surgery under subarachnoid block may reflect intraoperative
           patient's stress mediated by activation of the autonomic nervous system, specifically
           sympathetic activation.

        3. In consistence with previously published data no changes of SPI should occur due to
           standardized sedation with propofol.
