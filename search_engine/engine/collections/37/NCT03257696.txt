      victims suffer from aphasia during the acute phase. These language impairments have an impact
      on caregiving. In the context of post-stroke aphasia, the most relevant means of verbal
      communication is closed-ended questioning. However, the available tools do not allow a
      professional consensus and the comprehensive assessment tools for aphasia do not provide any
      indication of the reliability of patients' answers. The investigators have developed a tool,
      the yes/no questionnaire that consists of 10 closed-ended questions designed to assess the
      patient's ability to provide a coherent answer. During one year, successive patients taken
      care in the neurovascular unit at la Rochelle hospital will be assessed for eligibility to
      the study and their relative will be informed and ask for consent. Aphasic patients will
      therefore answer the yes/no questionnaire. Based on the speech therapist evaluation, patients
      will be classified as "reliable respondent" or "unreliable respondent".
