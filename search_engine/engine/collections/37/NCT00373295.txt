      marijuana use are able to achieve sustained abstinence. The objective of this study is to
      investigate the interaction between marijuana and the potential treatment medication,
      baclofen, with the direct goal of using this information to improve marijuana treatment
      outcome. GABAB agonists such as baclofen have been shown to attenuate the self-administration
      of cocaine, heroin, alcohol and nicotine (see Cousins et al., 2002; Haney et al., 2006).
      Baclofen also appears to decrease withdrawal symptoms in heroin and alcohol abusers
      (Akhondzadeh et al., 2000; Addolorato et al., 2000). The purpose of this study is to
      determine if baclofen dose-dependently decreases marijuana's direct effects and symptoms of
      marijuana withdrawal and thus decreases marijuana relapse in our laboratory model. For the
      purposes of this model, relapse is defined as a return to marijuana use after a period of
      abstinence. The study will utilize an inpatient/outpatient, counter-balanced design, with
      each participant maintained on each of three medication conditions for 16 days: placebo and
      baclofen (60, 90 mg/day). Participants will begin taking capsules during the outpatient phase
      so that the dose can be incremented up to the maintenance dose prior to the first inpatient
      day. Further, clinical studies have shown that baclofen is most effective at decreasing
      cocaine's effects when administered for several weeks. During the inpatient study phases,
      participants will have the opportunity to self-administer placebo or active marijuana 6 times
      per day. This study will provide important information of the effect of baclofen as a
      potential treatment medication for marijuana dependence.
