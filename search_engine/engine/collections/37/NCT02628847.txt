      who are admitted to inpatient rehabilitation are randomized to receive either sildenafil
      citrate (25 mg once per day) or placebo for 14 days. These individuals receive usual
      rehabilitation and medical care. Primary outcomes are motor skills and walking speed at one
      and three months.

      If willing and able, participants undergo an MRI to measure the integrity of the white matter
      pathways in the motor system using diffusion tensor imaging. Repeat MRIs are obtained at one
      and three months. The investigators will examine if such white matter integrity predicts
      response to the drug and if the drug facilitates changes in white matter.
