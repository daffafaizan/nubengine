      high-risk MM. GC012F is an autologus dual chimeric antigen receptor T-cell(CAR-T) therapy
      that targets B-cell maturation antigen(BCMA) and CD19. This study comprises of a screening
      phase(less than or equal to 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by apheresis(will occur upon
      enroiiment); Treatment Phase including autologus stem cell transplant on Day-1 followed by
      infusion of GC012F on Day0 and then post-infusion assessments from Day1 to Day 84; and a
      Post-treatment Phase(Day 85 and up to end of the study). Efficacy will be explored to
      assessed and safety will be closely monitored during the study.
