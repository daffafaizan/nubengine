      given a 30 minute baseline ACASI survey. At the end of the baseline visit, those participants
      who reported internet use at least 1x/month (in the past month) will be offered participation
      in the Pilot Website Evaluation Component. For this component, participants will be
      instructed on how to use an educational website with health resources. Their use of the
      website will be tracked. They will be given an appointment to return in 4-weeks for a follow
      up survey at the pharmacy and a 2-week locator call.
