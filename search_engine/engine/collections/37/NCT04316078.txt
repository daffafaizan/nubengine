    
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by the last digit of the patient's identification
      number, where odd numbers will be assigned to the control group (receiving standard of care
      follow-up) and even numbers will be assigned to the experimental group.

      Patients in the experimental arm will receive automatically generated personalized
      educational videos (PEV) and questionnaires regarding side effects and quality of life (QOL)
      to either their cell phone or email. The videos will be personalized to each patient based on
      their demographics, specific medical instructions and treatment plan. Data collected
      regarding side effects and QOL in the experimental arm will be used in order to facilitate
      real time intervention through real time provider alert system.

      A link to the first PEV will be sent before the first chemotherapy cycle, addressing the
      diagnosis and type of malignancy, chemotherapy protocol, common side effects and their
      management. Side effects questionnaire will be sent every 2 weeks while QOL questionnaire
      will be sent every 6 weeks.

      Patients will be followed from recruitment through three weeks after completion of the
      planned treatment protocol. If treatment is discontinued prior to completion of the protocol,
      follow-up will end three weeks after the last administered treatment.
