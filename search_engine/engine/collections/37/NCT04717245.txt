    
      After completing the eligibility criteria, patients signed the consent inform.

      Division of groups:

      Were included in the study 75 patients, divided into three groups:

      Group 1 - Treatment with topical vaginal promestriene - 25 patients in this group were
      included patients free of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at 3 months

      Group 2 - Treatment with CO2 LASER - 25 patients, in this group were included patients free
      of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at 3 months.

      Group 3 - Treatment with microablative fractionated radiofrequency - 25 patients in this
      group were included patients free of systemic or topical hormonal treatment for at least 3
      months.

      The present study was open and randomized. The randomization was be performed through the
      software "Test Generator Software Standard Edition"

      At the first visit, all patients responded to the clinical questionnaire of female sex
      quotient (QS-F), the quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) and the urinary incontinence
      questionnaire.

      All patients were submitted to specular gynecological examination to collect cervical-vaginal
      cytology, biopsy of 1/3 proximal vaginal wall for histological analysis and
      immunohistochemistry.

      After the results of the examinations and possible treatments required, the patients were
      referred for the proposed treatments according to their randomized group.

      Sampling Cytology :Cervical and vaginal oncology cytology were collected through a smear on a
      slide with fixative.

      The histological expression of the following immunohistochemical parameters will be
      evaluated:

        -  Presence and density of estrogen receptors

        -  Vascular density

        -  Thickness of the epithelium

        -  Density of collagen fibers

        -  Vaginal microbiota

        -  Vaginal pH

      In this study, it will be done a Morphological Analysis, a Histomorphometric analysis and e
      Immunohistochemical analysis.
