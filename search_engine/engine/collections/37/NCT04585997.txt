      efficacy and adverse events in a Phase 4, parallel arm, randomized controlled trail setting
      with computer generated randomization (permuted block randomization, with block sizes of 4 or
      6, stratified by baseline eosinophil count using a median split). There is no placebo
      control. Particpants will not be blinded but masking will be used for people assessing
      outcomes and analyzing data.

      'Chossebetweenamab' will also include a secondary outcome substudy (ISS 11066) to assess
      biomarkers of efficacy response to treatment using single cell sequencing of peripheral blood
      cells. Blood samples are taken from the randomized patients in each treatment arm
      (Mepolizumab and Omalizumab) at baseline and gene expression changes assessed using
      transcriptomic single cell sequencing of patient white blood cells. The data generated from
      this will be compared to the clinical outcomes of 'Choosebetweenamab' at all follow-up time
      points. Single cell gene expression and cell type cluster patterning will be compared to the
      primary and secondary outcomes to identify baseline predictors (gene and cell type) of
      treatment efficacy.
