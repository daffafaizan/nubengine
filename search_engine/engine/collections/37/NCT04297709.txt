      suffer premature death due to respiratory failure. Patients that experience more frequent
      pulmonary exacerbations have worse prognosis and early antibiotic treatment of pulmonary
      exacerbations is therefore one of the major goals of CF care. Antibiotic treatment is often
      currently delayed, since we rely on patients contacting the CF team when they develop
      worsening symptoms. We hypothesise that if we could allow patients to detect and receive
      treatment for early pulmonary exacerbations by measuring urinary biomarkers, this would
      minimise lung damage and result in improved clinical outcomes.

      In phase 1, 40 patients will be asked to collect daily urine samples, in addition to
      recording daily spirometry and a daily symptom score for 4 months. Phase 1 aims to identify
      the urinary biomarkers that are associated with CF pulmonary exacerbations. In phase 2, the
      same 40 patients will be asked to collect and test a daily urine sample using a novel testing
      device in addition to recording daily spirometry and a daily symptom score for 4 months.
      Phase 2 aims to validate the use of the urine testing device as a method of diagnosing early
      pulmonary exacerbations.

      In summary, this study aims to develop and validate a novel noninvasive point of care
      (near-patient) diagnostic testing system, to allow people with CF to diagnose early pulmonary
      exacerbations by measuring urinary biomarkers. If successful, we hope that this will provide
      patients with an easy to use device, which will empower patients and their caregivers to
      treat exacerbations at an earlier stage, with potential health and economic benefits.
