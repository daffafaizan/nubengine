      primary care will have better retention, utilization of services, health, social and quality
      of care measures and psychiatric treatment outcomes.

      The Buprenorphine Project is an examination of two methods of service delivery. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the feasibility, cost and effectiveness of an intervention
      designed to integrate buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence into HIV primary care at
      the CORE Center. For this project we will provide buprenorphine to 60 opioid dependent
      patients at any one time and will compare this on-site treatment group to 60 opioid dependent
      HIV+ patients who select off-site methadone or no agonist treatment at the time of
      enrollment.
