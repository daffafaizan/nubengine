      Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China. These cases have been linked to a new
      beta-coronavirus (COVID-19), identified with RT-PCR method from samples taken from the
      bronchoalveolar samples of a patient with pneumonia of unknown etiology in the Wuhan
      Jinyintan hospital. Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has spread
      rapidly worldwide causing a pandemic.

      Cancer patients are considered at greater risk of viral infection and its complications,
      including SARS-CoV-2. Certain types of cancer, such as thoracic cancers, and underlying
      clinical conditions, for instance concomitant immunosuppressive therapies or immune-related
      comorbidities, are factors potentially predisposing to an increased risk of infection and
      eventually complications of COVID-19.

      In this context, it is difficult to understand where and how to identify patients with
      neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN).

      We propose a global collection of data through an international database to describe and
      monitor NEN patients with COVID-19. This retrospective/prospective collection of data can
      create a large basis to check frequency of events, clinical management, clinical outcome,
      demographic, geographical, clinical and biological correlations.
