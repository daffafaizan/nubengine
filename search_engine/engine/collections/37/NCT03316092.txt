      seriousness of these side effects all possible efforts were done to prevent them. Preventing
      these side effects would ideally need prior screening of all patients who are to use oral
      Hydroxychloroquine. If patients are not screened prior to oral Hydroxychloroquine use they
      should be examined as soon as possible after starting this medication. Advances in
      technology, specifically the advent of optical coherence tomography, made screening and
      monitoring for Hydroxychloroquine toxicity much more easier and reliable meantime.
