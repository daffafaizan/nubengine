    
      The responsive mobile-web MoodHacker app was designed to: (a) educate users about depression;
      (b) educate users about the logistics and benefits of mood and activity monitoring; (c)
      promote daily mood and activity monitoring; (d) help users increase their positive activity
      engagement; (e) help users decrease negative thinking and increase positive thinking; and (f)
      promote daily practice of the skills taught.

      Program content was adapted from the Coping with Depression group therapy course [18],
      enhanced with mindfulness-based [22] and other evidence-based positive psychology strategies
      [23-25]. Content for the application was refined based on input from experts in the field who
      had extensive experience working with adult employees at risk for depression. Additional
      program modifications were made based on data from individual interviews and iterative user
      testing with the population of interest during the formative and production phases of the
      project.

      The MoodHacker user experience is structured around twelve learning objectives delivered
      through daily emails, in-app messaging, and in the "Articles & Videos" library. Daily emails
      (Figure 1) are sent to engage users in program content, provide sequenced guidance through
      the learning objectives in the articles and whiteboard-style videos, give tips for getting
      the most out of MoodHacker, and prompt the user to track their mood and activities daily.
      Users are encouraged to view the articles and videos as ordered, but viewing is not
      restricted, and users can view content according to their interest. The emails, articles and
      videos promote practice of the featured cognitive and behavioral skills outside the app
      experience.
