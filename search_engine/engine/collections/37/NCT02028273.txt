      pre-natal development, neurogenesis persists throughout the human lifespan. In adulthood,
      neurogenesis occurs predominantly in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A
      highly novel methodology using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) has recently been
      developed to measure the formation of hippocampal newborn stem cells in the human brain. We
      propose to assess Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) in the neuropsychiatric disorder cocaine
      dependence, a chronic disease process associated with pathology of the hippocampus and
      impaired neurogenesis. In addition, we will assess other measures associated with
      neurogenesis, including hippocampal (dentate gyrus) cerebral blood volume (CBV) using
      Vascular-Space-Occupancy (VASO) Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We predict that newborn
      hippocampal cells [or neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs] will be attenuated in recently using
      cocaine-addicted participants relative to abstinent and control participants, and that these
      changes will be paralleled by changes in CBV. In this pilot study, we will assess for these
      changes in cocaine-addicted subjects who are actively using cocaine and those who are
      recently abstinent (three to six months) as well as age-, race-, and gender-similar control
      participants.
