      diseased and damaged lung. The devices are one-way valves that can be placed in the airways
      via flexible bronchoscopy limiting airflow distally. For the treatment of emphysema, valves
      are placed in airways communicating to the most diseased areas of lung tissue to re-direct
      airflow to less diseased areas. A multicenter, blinded and randomized study of these valves
      is being conducted in 7 centers in 6 European countries. The study is evaluating the
      effectiveness of this therapy for the treatment of upper lobe predominant emphysema in
      patients with severe to very severe emphysema (GOLD classification 3 to 4) that despite best
      medical management continue having poor quality of life, severe symptoms and physical
      limitations. The primary endpoints are to measure and compare responses using the St.
      George's Respiratory Questionnaire and lung volume changes as measured by CT-scans. Consented
      patients that meet the strict inclusion criteria have a bronchoscopic procedure and are
      randomized into treatment or control (no valves) groups. After the procedure, all patients
      stay blinded to their group assignment and have follow-up evaluations at 1 and 3 months.
      After the 3-month evaluation, each patient is un-blinded. The treatment group is then
      scheduled for an additional follow-up at 6 months and the control group is offered valve
      treatment (rollover) and evaluated approximately 3 months later.
