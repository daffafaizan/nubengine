      intervention on adherence to drugs and risk factors control in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease compared with tertiary A-level hospital WeChat-based intervention.

      Study design: The study was a multicenter, two-arm, parallel, open label, prospective study
      that evaluated a WeChat-based intervention offered by tertiary A-level hospital with 1 year
      of follow-up.

      Study intervention: All patients received lifestyle intervention and drug adjustment at 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow-up. In the control group, the subsequent visit
      was through an offline outpatient clinic at 4 different community hospitals. Participants in
      this group received standard outpatient cardiology follow-up with formal cardiac
      rehabilitation and secondary prevention. While in the intervention group, the subsequent
      visit was through WeChat-based online consultations.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome was MACCE. Secondary outcome included blood pressure,
      heart rates, smoking cessation, drinking cessation, body mass index, and medications
      adherence.

      Statistical analysis: Values of analyzed endpoints between intervention group and control
      group will be compared according to the analysis plan. We'll follow a prespecified analysis
      plan and subgroup analysis will be conducted accordingly.
