      of discharge from hospital (whichever occurs first), in order to determine the presence and
      magnitude of persistent kidney dysfunction after sepsis episode and to longitudinally assess
      further decline of kidney function at one year follow-up. The measure of the glomerular
      filtration rate (GRF) in patients with chronic critical illness and controls (sepsis patients
      discharged from ICU before day 14) will be used to determine to what degree of kidney
      dysfunction contributes to decreased survival and increase in chronic kidney disease at year
      one after sepsis onset.

      One and/or all of the three ways for GFR assessment will be used, both at approximately day
      14 or approximately at the day of discharge from the ICU and at the one year follow up :

        1. Determine clearance of Iohexol from blood after Iohexol injection and/or

        2. Determine apperance of Iohexol in urine after Iohexol injection (this would be the same
           injection as in one, and would not require two injections) and/or

        3. A timed urine collection to determine clearance of urea and creatinine and/or

        4. Estimated GFR using calculations with serum creatinine and cystatin C,

      This will provide an opportunity to validate the different measurements.
