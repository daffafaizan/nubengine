      maxillofacial practice. The key symptoms are jaw joint pain and limited mouth opening. Other
      than trauma, the causes remain unknown; consequently, there are no treatments based on
      specific etiologies. In our experience, patients can usually receive beneficial occlusal
      adjustments if these are carefully planned and performed in two steps: (1) elimination of
      premature contacts, which reduces loads in the temporomandibular joints, and (2)
      individualized remodeling of lateral anterior guidance to facilitate unilateral alternate
      chewing. The study will use stratified blocking randomization to blindly assign patients to
      the real or placebo treatment groups in order to evaluate the null hypothesis (H0) that
      "Occlusal adjustment of sufficient quality has no effect on chronic pain and/or limited mouth
      opening in TMD patients."
