      reward-related human brain circuits. Reward-related brain circuits will be assessed using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging.

      Participants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of MDMA (also known
      as Ecstasy), when they were 18 years or older.

      The investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried MDMA rather than those
      who are MDMA-na√Øve.

      Participants will receive an oral dose of MDMA (~.75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg) and placebo (saline)
      at 3 separate study sessions. Following established procedures, these three sessions will be
      randomized in a blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects.

      Throughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence
      after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for
      MDMA administered orally. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging
      session. Secondary effects of MDMA on behavior and self-reported experience will be assessed.

      In the assessment of the acute effects of MDMA, the investigators will take into account the
      cumulative effects of prior drug exposure.
