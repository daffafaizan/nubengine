      of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) between June 2019 and December 2022 from 41 centers across the
      country are going to be prospectively collected. The study is designed to report the clinical
      dataï¼Œoutcomes and complications of transvaginal mesh surgery in China. The information
      gathered will identify the incidence rate of complications, especially mesh exposure/erosion,
      in Chinese women and whether published, professional guidelines on POP surgical treatment as
      well as mesh complications management are being applied appropriately. Findings from this
      registry may help in knowing the current status of transvaginal mesh use in China as well as
      identify issues that may affect the surgical outcome and complications occurrence. Based on
      the registry study, clinical practice on the management of transvaginal mesh implantation
      including selection patients, pre- and post-operative evaluation and complications surgical
      database will be established.

      The follow-up process starts after patients have completed the operation; thus, our study
      does not affect patients' choice of surgical method.
