      randomized controlled 12-month intervention of 19 primary care teams at two urban healthcare
      systems with Medical Home models of care to compare the GEM intervention (intervention arm)
      with Enhanced Usual Care (educational materials; control arm).

      The specific aims of this study are:

        -  Test the impact of the GEM intervention on weight change, and clinical and behavioral
           outcomes.

        -  Identify predictors of weight loss in the GEM intervention arm related to: a)
           goal-setting processes and b) intervention components

        -  Determine the impact of the GEM intervention on obesity-related counseling practices and
           attitudes in primary care providers.
