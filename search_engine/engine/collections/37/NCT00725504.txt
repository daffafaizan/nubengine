      computer-controlled paradigm. This paradigm allows increasing plasma concentrations in a
      step-wise manner, keeping the concentration during each infusion step constant. Plasma
      concentrations will be increased gradually from 0 to 5 ug/ml in a method at the discretion of
      the medical team. This will be conducted according to standard medical practice for the
      infusion and the study procedures will not affect the infusion paradigm. Total infusion time
      is approximately 1-2 hours. During the course of the study, the primary outcome measure was
      changed from blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal to pain intensity.
