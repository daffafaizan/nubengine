      lifestyle program in volunteer community settings and to provide pilot data to inform the
      design of future randomized controlled trials that may improve physical and mental health in
      older adults (50-75) who are providing care for a family member or friend who has dementia,
      physical and/or developmental issues, or health problems. Current objectives include:

      1 . Adapt and pilot the previously studied 32-session, 13-month MOVE UP intervention to a
      streamlined 12-session (4-month) community-based translational behavioral weight management
      program. The pilot program will be delivered by a staff interventionist.

      2. Implement and evaluate the program's impact on weight and healthy lifestyle changes,
      including physical performance outcomes, at 2 sites, each with at least 6 eligible obese and
      caregiving adults ages 50-75 years old.
