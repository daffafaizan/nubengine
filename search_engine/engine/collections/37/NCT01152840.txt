      this malignancy is a distinct therapeutic challenge because of its insidious local growth
      pattern, propensity for perineural involvement, tendency for distant metastasis, and
      pronounced ability to recur over a prolonged period.

      In prospectively performed clinical trials, objective responses to any cytotoxic agent or
      regimen are infrequent, whereas stabilization of disease was observed more commonly.

      In adenoid cystic carcinoma, the study focusing on PI3-K/AKT/mTOR pathway is rare.

      According to Younes MN et al's study, adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines have increased pAkt
      activity when EGF-stimulation is added. And when treated with EGFR/VEGFR TK dual inhibitor,
      the phosphorylated form of Akt decreased despite of total level of Akt is remained unchanged.

      When the investigators consider that the increased pAkt activity is one of possible predictor
      to mTOR inhibitor, the mTOR inhibitor might have an activity in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on mTOR
      inhibition by RAD001 has been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      In phase I study of RAD001, 2 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma show some response to
      RAD001 (unpublished data).

      So the investigators design this phase II study of RAD001 in adenoid cystic carcinoma to
      evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this orphan disease.
