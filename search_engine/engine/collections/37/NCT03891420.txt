    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK), safety, and antiviral effects of galidesivir administered via intravenous (IV) infusion
      vs. placebo in hospitalized adult subjects with either Yellow Fever (Group A) or COVID-19
      (Group B). The study will be conducted in two parts, and each Group (A or B) will proceed
      independently through the study. Part 1 is a dose ranging study with three sequential cohorts
      of eight patients each that will be randomized 3:1 to receive IV galidesivir or placebo every
      12 hours for 7 days. Upon completion of part 1, an optimized dosing regimen of galidesivir
      will be selected for part 2, based on part 1 results including safety, PK, viral load
      reduction, and improvement in signs and symptoms and clinical manifestations, and mortality.
      In part 2, up to 42 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive IV galidesivir or placebo.
      After treatment, the patients will remain hospitalized until resolution of symptoms allows
      release. All patients will be followed for mortality through Day 56.
