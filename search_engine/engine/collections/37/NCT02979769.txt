      of different palovarotene dosing regimens in subjects with FOP in France. Efficacy will be
      assessed based on the ability of palovarotene to prevent the formation of new heterotopic
      ossification (HO) as assessed by low-dose whole body computed tomography (WBCT) scan,
      excluding head.

      All subjects will be treated with 5 mg palovarotene daily (weight adjusted dose for
      skeletally immature subjects) for up to 36 months. Site visits will occur at
      baseline/screening and at Study Months 12, 24 and 36; subjects will also be contacted by
      telephone every 3 months.

      In the event of an eligible flare-up, Adult Cohort subjects will receive 20 mg palovarotene
      daily for 28 days, followed by 10 mg for 56 days. Dosing may be extended if the flare-up is
      not resolved by Flare-up Day 84 and continue until the flare-up resolves (at the
      end-of-treatment (EOT)). Dose reduction, as directed by the Investigator, may occur in the
      event of intolerable side effects.

      The flare-up based dosing regimen for Pediatric Cohort subjects (those under 18 years) will
      be the same as for Adult Cohort subjects except doses will adjusted for weight.

      All weight-based dosing will cease when subjects are 18 years old, but radiographic
      assessment of the growth plate will continue until these subjects achieve 100% skeletal
      maturity at both knee and hand/wrist locations.
