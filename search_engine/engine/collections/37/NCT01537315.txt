      clinical model of accelerated atherosclerosis (AS) in the chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      population. This intervention is designed to have an impact on the initiation and progression
      of AS by reducing systemic inflammation, improving or restoring vascular endothelial
      function, and by improving the milieu of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

      The current study is a proof of concept study for the expansion of the use of HCQ for a new
      indication for the treatment of AS and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with
      CKD.University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has filed an Investigational New Drug
      (IND) for a new indication on 4/28/11. The FDA responded that this study is exempt from an
      IND.

      This "Proof-of-Concept" randomized double blinded placebo controlled study will evaluate the
      nature and extent of HCQ effects, and if found significantly beneficial, it will be used to
      guide the development of a large, multicenter, randomized control trial of HCQ to examine the
      hard clinical end points of CVD and mortality in patients with advanced CKD. The
      investigators propose to enroll 62 subjects to achieve the effects of HCQ in 52 individuals
      (39 HCQ group and 13 placebo group).
