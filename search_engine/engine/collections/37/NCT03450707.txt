    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of
      intravenous thiamine (vitamin B1) on lactate, cellular oxygen consumption, global oxygen
      consumption and biomarkers of neurologic injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
      Patients who have sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA and have a
      lactate of 3 or greater will be eligible for the study. Enrolled patients will be randomized
      to intravenous thiamine 500mg twice daily for 5 doses or matching placebo (100cc normal
      saline). Blood will be drawn at several time points and patients will be connected to a
      noninvasive monitor for continuous measurement of global oxygen consumption. The primary
      endpoint is change in lactate level. Secondary endpoints include change in pyruvate
      dehydrogenase activity, change in cellular and global oxygen consumption, change in NSE and
      S100 (biomarkers of neurologic injury) and CPC-E score (a score that assesses neurologic and
      functional impairment) at hospital discharge, 30 and 90 days.
