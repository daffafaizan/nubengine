      patients in need of an elective vascular operation. Exclusion criteria include urgent
      operation, known allergic reactions to CoQ10 and participation in another research study.
      Suitable participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CoQ10 (400 mg per day)
      versus Placebo for 3 days prior to surgery. A randomized, double blind trial will be used and
      a research pharmacist will guide the randomization process, blinded to clinical information.
      The primary end-point measures are BNP levels at 24 and 48 hours following the operation as
      well as the incidence of myocardial injury, defined by an elevated post-operative
      high-sensitivity troponin following high risk surgery. Secondary outcome measures include the
      magnitude of the troponin level, which is the change in the level compared with preoperative
      baseline troponin levels and adverse clinical cardiac outcomes during the hospitalization
      period, including death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, diagnosed by a cardiologist who is
      blinded to the treatment strategy and any coronary artery revascularization procedure. The
      study will be focused on 30-days following the vascular procedure but the investigators may
      plan to extend secondary outcome measures for 1 year post-randomization.
