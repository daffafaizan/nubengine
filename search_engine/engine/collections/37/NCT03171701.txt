      without ionizing radiation associated or iodized contrast.

      Vascular procedures and their complications represent a major cause of morbidity
      hospitalization and cost for patients in hemodialysis .

      Many fistulas do not mature appropriately for being used in dialysis. So,The early
      recognition through the ultrasound examination of problems in the arteriovenous fistula
      maturation or possible complications that may compromise their viability, offers the
      opportunity of correction or appropriate treatment .

      Criteria for maturation after arteriovenous fistula creation:

        -  Vein diameter larger than 4 mm remote from the site of fistula.

        -  Vein located at a depth of <5 mm from skin surface.
