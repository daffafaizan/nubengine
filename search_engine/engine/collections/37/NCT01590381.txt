      This study is designed to determine HBV vaccination policy among new HCWs in the IDF, who
      were vaccinated during infancy. This population was recruited to the IDF since the second
      half of 2010. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct this study on new HCWs that will be
      receiving the routine HBV vaccination and that will be at risk for HBV infection in the
      future due to their occupation in the army (HCWs, etc).
