      correlation between the total dose of cytostatics per measured fat-free mass (FFM) (mg
      cytostatic agent/kg FFM) and toxicity of cytostatics among cancer patients. The study will
      include patients with a primary diagnosis of any stage colorectal or pancreatic cancer.

      The hypothesis is, that a higher total dose of cytostatics per FFM will correlate to more
      frequent and/or more severe toxicity than a lower total dose. In extension to this, we
      hypothesize that a loss of FFM during treatment, and thereby an increased total dose of
      cytostatics per FFM, will lead to more frequent and severe toxicity.

      Recruitment and data collection will take place at the department of Clinical Oncology at
      Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde over about a five month period. Each patient will be
      included for two-four cycles of cytostatic treatment. FFM will be measured by bio impedance
      spectroscopy as close to the first day of each cycle of cytostatic treatment as possible.
      Information about toxicity will be obtained from patient records and through interviews with
      the patients. Interviews will be conducted at day 5 (4-6) of each cycle and at the end of
      each cycle. The interviews include questionnaires about specific toxicities, using National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and overall health and quality of life, and 24-hour recall of
      dietary intake and questions about physical activity level.

      In short, relevant outcomes are change in FFM, hematology, grade 3/4 hematological toxicity
      as defined by NCI CTCAE, dose-limiting toxicity, hospitalization, patient-reported adverse
      events, overall health and quality of life, and nutritional intake.
