    
      SMART-MED is a large, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial of 0.9% saline versus
      physiologically-balanced isotonic crystalloids (Lactated Ringers or Plasma-LyteÂ© A) with
      regard to the incidence of major adverse kidney events by 30 days in patients admitted to the
      medical intensive care unit. Between June 2015 and April 2017, all patients admitted to the
      medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University medical center who are 18 years or older
      will be enrolled. The study will occur in one-month blocks. The ICU will be randomized to an
      initial fluid group (0.9% saline or physiologically balanced crystalloids). The assigned
      fluid will be used exclusively for all patients receiving isotonic crystalloid for the
      duration of the month-long block (except in the presence of pre-specified contraindications).
      The assigned study fluid will switch at the end of each month-long block such that half of
      the months are assigned to 0.9% saline and half of the months are assigned to physiologically
      balance fluid. It is anticipated that around 5,300 patients will be enrolled from the medical
      ICU during the study period. All aspects of study design, intervention, and data collection
      will be harmonized with an independent study addressing the same question in the non-medical
      intensive care units at Vanderbilt University during a similar study period (SMART-SURG). A
      pre-specified data analysis plan will dictate the harmonized analysis of SMART-MED and
      SMART-SURG.
