      trial assigning participants to receive 400 mg of oral magnesium in the form of magnesium
      citrate once daily or placebo. The investigators will recruit 60 individuals 55 years of age
      and older without a prior history of cardiovascular disease. At baseline, participants will
      undergo a basic examination, answer questionnaires and provide a blood sample to determine
      circulating magnesium levels. Participants will then wear an FDA-approved heart rhythm
      monitor (Zio Â® XT Patch) for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks they will begin taking their
      assigned treatment (magnesium or placebo), and will continue doing so for a total of 12 weeks
      (through study week 14). After 10 weeks of taking the supplement or placebo (study week 12),
      they will have a final study visit in which the participants will provide another blood
      sample for assessment of circulating magnesium, and will be asked to wear the heart rhythm
      monitor for another 2 weeks (through study week 14). The primary endpoint will be the change
      in burden of premature atrial contractions (PACs), measured in episodes per day, between
      baseline and final follow-up visit. A secondary outcome will be the change in circulating
      magnesium between both exams.
