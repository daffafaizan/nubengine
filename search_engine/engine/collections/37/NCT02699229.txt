        1. To characterize human lung lesions by nonlinear microscopy using ex vivo tissues. In
           particular, to investigate collagen content and ultrastructure with SHG (second harmonic
           generation) microscopy, to characterize cell and nuclear morphology and lipid vesicle
           content with THG (third harmonic generation) and CARS (coherent anti-Stokes Raman
           scattering) microscopy and to conduct spectroscopic and lifetime characterization of MPF
           (multiphoton fluorescence) signals in cancerous, benign, and normal tissues.

        2. To establish the first spectral/structural database for nonlinear optical microimaging
           of normal and abnormal lung tissue, from which to generate diagnostic algorithms, both
           to optimize the operating parameters of planned nonlinear endoscopic imaging and to
           serve as the basis for nonlinear optical histopathology.
