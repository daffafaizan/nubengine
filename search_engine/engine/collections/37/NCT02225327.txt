      effective strategy to enhance pneumococcal vaccine coverage rate in high-risk adults.
      However, the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant vaccination need to be further
      investigated. There is data on immunogenicity and safety after concomitant administration of
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and unadjuvanted influenza vaccine; no interference
      was noted between two vaccines. However, there are no data for MF59 adjuvanted influenza
      vaccine with pneumococcal vaccine. MF59 only locally reacts for immune response, so
      immunogenicity should be assessed for both vaccines injected in same arm versus different
      arms.

      This study is intended to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant
      MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (MF59-aTIV, Fluad) and 23-valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23, Prodiax) vaccination in the elderly subjects aged â‰¥65 years.
      Healthy elderly subjects (N = 424) are randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive MF59-aTIV
      alone (group 1), MF59-aTIV +PPV23 at different arm (group 2), MF59-aTIV +PPV23 at same arm
      (group 3) or PPV23 alone (group 4).

      Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and multiplex opsono-phagocytic killing assay (MOPA)
      will be used to compare the immunogenicity of each vaccine after single or concomitant
      vaccination at pre-vaccination and 1 month post-vaccination. MOPA will be taken for four
      serotypes (5, 6B, 18C and 19A).
