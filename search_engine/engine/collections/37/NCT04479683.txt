      short full-time hospitalisation compared to a prolonged full-time hospitalisation aiming at a
      healthy weight on the evolution of BMI at 1 year in children aged 8 to 13 years suffering
      from anorexia nervosa, with severe undernutrition.

      The minimum healthy weight is defined by a weight corresponding to the BMI corridor prior to
      the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, +/- 1 corridor).

      Randomized controlled trial, open-label, single-centre.

      Patients will be randomized into one of the two arms of the trial:

        -  Group 1 (control group): continuation of full-time hospitalisation until reaching the
           minimum healthy weight, defined as the weight corresponding to the return to the
           previous BMI corridor (previous BMI +/- 1 BMI corridor, e.g. change from 25th to 10th
           percentile).

        -  Group 2 (experimental group): Exit from FTH (full-time hospitalisation ) and relay to DH
           (day hospitalization ) one day per week until the minimum healthy weight. This treatment
           combines a one-day medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist, family sessions (parents
           group and multi-family therapy session), a therapeutic education group, a cognitive
           remediation group and a dietary follow-up with therapeutic meals.

      Statistical analysis of the data will be carried out with the intention to treat. The BMI at
      1 year between groups, as well as its bilateral 95% confidence interval (equivalent to a
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval), will be estimated and compared with the predefined
      margin of non-inferiority (1 BMI point).
