    
      Background:

      -Plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1 are a significant cause of morbidity but little
      is known about the natural history of these lesions.

      Objectives:

        -  The purpose of this study is to monitor the natural history of plexiform neurofibromas
           and to evaluate the usefulness of volumetric MRI tumor measurements in this disease.

        -  Other goals of the study are to provide a body of normative data on the growth rate of
           plexiform neurofibromas and to establish a tissue repository and pathology review center
           to allow future studies of the pathogenesis of neurofibromas and clinical trials of
           potential therapeutic agents.

      Design

      - This study is coordinated by Dr. Bruce Korf, and was initiated when he was at the Partners
      Center for Human Genetics, Boston, MA.
