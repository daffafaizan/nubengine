      States are well documented across racial and ethnic groups. One area of particular interest
      to health disparities researchers has been solid organ transplantation. Both provider and
      patient behaviors are implicated as contributing to ethnic variance of medical care in kidney
      transplantation. This pilot study will explore the perceptions of trust among patients in the
      kidney transplant process at the Warren Magnuson Clinical Center at the National Institutes
      of Health and at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. For sampling purposes the transplant
      process is defined as 1) patients currently on dialysis; 2) patients on the transplantation
      waiting list receiving dialysis; 3) patients on the transplantation waiting list not
      receiving dialysis; 4) patients newly transplanted (less than or equal to one year since
      transplantation) and 5) patients transplanted for greater than one year. Five dimensions
      contributing to trust have been identified in the literature: competence, compassion,
      control, communication and confidentiality. Face-to-face interviews to explore these five
      dimensions will include questions regarding demographic variables, the Trust in Physician
      Scale; the Trust in Nurse Scale, and the Patient Trust Scale. Results will be analyzed using
      descriptive statistics, Chi-square for categorical comparison of means and multivariate
      analysis for differences between groups.
