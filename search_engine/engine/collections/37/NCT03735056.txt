      going through diagnosis process), and who are aged 18 years or over, recruited through MS
      clinics. Participants, after consent, will complete baseline measures before being randomised
      into to one of three groups: (1) usual care; (2) usual care + Support 1 (MS Nurse Support);
      (2) usual care + Support 2 (MS Nurse Support plus Peer Support). Group 1 (20 patients) will
      not receive any intervention. Group 2 (20 patients) will receive Support 1 which will include
      one face-to-face support session delivered by an MS Nurse. Group 3 (20 patients) will receive
      Support 2 which includes MS Nurse Support (i.e., Support 1) plus Peer Support. Peer Support
      will include a minimum of two peer support session delivered by Peer Support Workers (i.e.
      patients with lived experiences). All groups will receive usual care. The outcome measures
      will be collected at 3 and 6 months after randomisation by all participants. Feedback
      interviews with up to 21 participants (7 from each group) and up to 10 service providers (5
      MS Nurses who delivered the MS Nurse Support and 5 Peer Support Workers who delivered the
      Peer Support) will be conducted to assess what parts of the intervention were helpful or
      unhelpful, the acceptability of randomisation and trial procedures, and the appropriateness
      of the measures used.
