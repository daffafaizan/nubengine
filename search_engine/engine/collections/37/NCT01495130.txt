      mechanically-manipulated transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe for TRUS evaluation during a da
      Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). II. To collect TRUS evaluation data
      during RALP to guide us in deciding whether and how the mechanical manipulation of the TRUS
      probe will allow sufficient clarity of ultrasound imaging. OUTLINE: Patients undergo TRUS
      during RALP. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days.
