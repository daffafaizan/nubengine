      prevention. Engaging in frequent hand washing is especially effective in preventing the
      spread of viruses, as this removes microbes and prevents the spread to others. Hand
      dermatitis, however, is a common occurrence in certain occupations, such as healthcare
      workers. With the onset of the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic, hand hygiene measures are
      further enforced as there is no cure or vaccine for this virus.

      The stratum corneum is in the outer layer of the epidermis, and it contains several proteins
      and lipids that are important for skin health. This skin layer can be disrupted by agents
      that cause skin dryness and irritation, resulting in a dysfunctional skin barrier when there
      is loss of filaggrin breakdown products, also referred to as natural moisturizing factor
      (NMF), and lipids. This then leads to the unwanted dermatologic effects of skin dermatitis,
      and in some patients, contact dermatitis. While it is known that frequent hand washing and
      hand sanitizer use causes hand dermatitis, the effects on skin barrier proteins and lipids
      has not been studied.

      In this study, the effects of hand washing and the use of hand sanitizer on epidermal
      proteins and lipids will be assessed. The skin barrier will be examined with skin tape strips
      (STS) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) before and after topical skin exposure to hand
      sanitizer use and hand washing. Questionnaires will be administered to inquire about allergy
      history, frequency of hand washing, and use of detergents and soaps.
