    
      This study consists of a screening period of up to 42 days, core period of 24 weeks,
      extension period of 23 weeks and long-term extension period of up to approximately 4 years.
      The study will enroll adult participants (Group 1), 6-17 years old pediatric participants
      (Group 2), and an exploratory set of 2-5 years old pediatric participants (Group 3). At study
      start, only the participants of Group 1 and Group 2 will be enrolled.

      Eligible participants aged â‰¥6 years old will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to alpelisib or
      matching placebo. Both age groups will be enrolled in the study in parallel. In the core
      period, participants will receive treatment in blinded fashion, with an upfront 16-week
      placebo-controlled period. After Week 16 those participants who were randomized to receive
      placebo will be switched to active treatment with alpelisib. Those participants who were
      randomized to receive alpelisib will continue their active treatment.

      Group 3 will be enrolled later, after 24-week efficacy, safety and PK data are available from
      the first two age groups, in order to select the recommended dose for this group.

      The planned duration of alpelisib treatment in the study will be up to 5 years after
      randomization for all age groups. Participant may be discontinued from treatment with
      alpelisib earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression, death, and/or
      any other reason at the discretion of the investigator or the participant.
