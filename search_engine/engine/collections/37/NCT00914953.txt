      course of exogenous oxytocin (OT) will induce changes in social activities in residentially
      housed older adults (OAs) during a 10-day treatment period, and after it ends. Because OT is
      associated with peri-reproductive behaviors, OT release in OAs is expected to be attenuated
      relative to younger adults. If OT release is low in OAs as we hypothesize, augmenting OT may
      increase their desire for social interactions, increase the frequency of participation in
      social activities and augment the number of and quality of social ties, thereby providing
      protection against disease, early death, cognitive decline, and depression. Research in
      rodents suggests that social interactions themselves may change chronic OT levels (Carter &
      Keverne, 2002; Carter & Altemus, 1997), in a positive feedback loop. In order to demonstrate
      OT as the causal mechanism, we propose to infuse oxytocin and then track the desire for,
      quantity of, and quality of social activities.
