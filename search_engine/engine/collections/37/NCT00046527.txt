      esophagus and head and neck. A number of dose schedules of Taxol have been tested in breast
      cancer. Initial trials used 250 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion over 24 hours. Subsequently,
      shorter infusions of Taxol over three hours were tested at a dose of 175 mg/m2, with response
      rates of 30%-40%. Phase II studies using higher doses of Taxol at 200-250 mg/m2 had a
      response rate of 56% in metastatic breast cancer patients. However, at these doses,
      significant toxicities occurred, including neuropathy. There was a median granulocyte count
      nadir at 100-200 cells/mm3 for the majority of courses administered. There were also
      significant side effects associated with hypersensitivity to the Taxol vehicle, Cremophor-EL.
      These hypersensitivity reactions require a premedication schedule that includes a
      corticosteroid, an H2 antagonist and an antihistamine.

      Abraxis BioScience is testing a reformulated form of paclitaxel without Cremophor. This
      formulation is a protein-stabilized, nanoparticle suspension of paclitaxel and human serum
      albumin in normal saline. The potential advantages of this formulation are:

        -  Higher tolerated doses, with greater efficacy

        -  Longer drug persistence in tumor as a result of the nanoparticle formulation

        -  Reduced infusion time

        -  Reduced risk of hypersensitivity with no required premedication schedule

        -  More rapid distribution of paclitaxel to the tissues based on pharmacokinetic data

      This study will evaluate ABI-007, as compared to Taxol, in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer.
