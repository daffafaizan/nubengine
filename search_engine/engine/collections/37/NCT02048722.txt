      I. To define the progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months with daily oral regorafenib (160
      mg) in previously treated locally advanced/metastatic angiosarcoma patients

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free rate at 3 and 6 months. II. Progression-free survival. III. Overall
      survival (up to 5 years). IV. Response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST] version [v] 1.1).

      V. Rate and duration of tumor control (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +
      stable disease [SD]).

      VI. Safety/tolerability of regorafenib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
