      treadmill exercise on changes in the MDS-UPDRS Part III score at 12 months. 370 persons
      diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who have not yet initiated dopaminergic therapy, age
      40-80, will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1)60-65% HRmax or 2)80-85% HRmax 4 times per
      week. Secondary objectives will test hypotheses related to striatal specific binding ratio
      (SSBR) at 12 months, MDS-UPDRS Part III score, ambulatory mobility (6-minute walk), daily
      walking activity (steps), cognition, quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      blood-derived biomarkers of inflammation and neurotrophic factors at 12 and 18 months.
      Tertiary objectives will test hypotheses related to 2 characteristics of ambulation at 12 and
      18 months. Exploratory objectives will test hypotheses related to the effects of removing the
      study support that was provided over 18 months on the sustainability and durability of the
      exercise effects at 24 months. Approximately 29 sites will enroll participants: 27 sites that
      cover all geographic regions of the USA and 2 sites in Canada. All sites will have a
      collaboration between movement disorders and exercise specialists.
