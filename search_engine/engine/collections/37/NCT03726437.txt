      college women report being sexually assaulted. The purpose of this study is to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial study with 750 female college students from three universities to
      test the efficacy of RealConsent, a sexual violence risk reduction program for college women,
      compared to an attention-placebo control. RealConsent is a multi-media 3-hour program based
      on social cognitive theory and alcohol myopia theory. The primary outcome will be
      self-reported sexual violence victimization and the secondary outcomes will be alcohol and
      dating protective- and risk-related behaviors and resistance strategies. The investigators
      expect that women in the treatment group will report less sexual violence victimization than
      women in the control group. Expected outcomes are demonstrated feasibility and efficacy of a
      technologically novel risk reduction program for female college students.
