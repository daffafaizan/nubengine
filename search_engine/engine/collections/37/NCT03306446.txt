      discontinuation of a 12 month course of adalimumab in adult patients with early CD who have
      achieved deep remission at 12 months AND who were already in clinical remission (CDAI < 150)
      and biomarker remission (CRP < 5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin < 250) at 6 months. The study
      will also address several questions:

        -  What is the rate of deep remission after a 12-month course of adalimumab in early CD
           patients?

        -  What is the rate of deep remission 12 months after adalimumab discontinuation in
           patients with deep remission after a 12-month course of adalimumab (thus defining
           sustained deep remission) AND who were already in clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and
           biomarker remission (CRP < 5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin < 250) at 6 months?

        -  What are the consequences of a treatment with adalimumab on the natural course of CD and
           long-term clinical outcomes (bowel damage, CD related surgeries and hospitalization, and
           patient-reported outcomes)? Therefore the study will give information on the effect of a
           12-month course of adalimumab in early CD patients, impact of "drug holiday" after deep
           remission has been achieved, and long term effect of adalimumab on early CD course
           (relapses, CD-related surgery and hospitalizations, bowel damage, and patient-reported
           outcomes). The study will also assess predictors of loss of deep remission at 2-year
           evaluation in patients who achieved 1-year deep remission. Efficacy and tolerability of
           adalimumab will be assessed.
