    
      Prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase II study, designed to determine efficacy and
      safety of a Chemo-immunotherapy with the combination of bendamustine + rituximab in patients
      with splenic marginal zone lymphoma.

      Study Population: previously untreated (except for splenectomy and/or antiviral therapy for
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection) and symptomatic Splenic Marginal Zone patients.

      Objectives: evaluation of the efficacy and the safety of R-Bendamustine in symptomatic
      Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma patients.

      Primary Objective: efficacy of R-Bendamustine measured by Complete Response rate. Complete
      response rate defined as regression to normal size on CT of organomegaly (spleen, liver,
      lymph nodes); normalization of the blood counts and no evidence of circulating clonal cells,
      and no evidence or minor (â‰¤ 5%) Bone Marrow (BM) infiltration detected by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC).
