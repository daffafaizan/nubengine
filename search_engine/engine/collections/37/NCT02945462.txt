      be selected. This diagnosis is based on medical history, validated questionnaires, physical
      examinations, laboratory tests and specific diagnostic tests. Patients with any evidence of
      untreated hypogonadism, current urinary tract or bladder infection, clinically evident penile
      anatomical deformities, previous penile implant or penile vascular surgery, uncontrolled
      hypertension or hypotension, reported unstable Cardiovascular diseases, uncontrolled diabetes
      (HbA1c > 10%), or primary hyperlipidemia will be excluded. The investigators hypothesize that
      the intracavernous injection of stem cells will facilitate the recovery of erectile function
      resulting in satisfying clinical outcomes in patients.

      This study was performed:

        1. To test the safety of autologous intracavernous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

        2. To evaluate benefit for the patient concerning recovery of natural erection by
           performing detailed and specific diagnostic tests prior and post MSCs injection by a
           team from Jordan University Hospital and Cell Therapy Center in Jordan University.

        3. To study the feasibility, indication criteria and application modalities of Bone marrow
           mesenchymal stem cells for further wider study.
