      study is to compare short-term radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy(Experimental group)
      with preoperative long-term chemoradiotherapy(Control group) for middle-lower locally
      advanced rectal cancer. The primary endpoint is 3-year disease-free survival, and the
      secondary objectives are 3-year local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free
      survival and overall survival. Furthermore, the late toxicity profile and quality of life
      (QoL) after 3 years follow-up are secondary endpoints. For each group, a plan for collection
      of serum/plasma/feces at different stages of treatment and for obtaining fresh tumor tissue
      for freezing prior to treatment was defined in the protocol.

      The STELLAR-trial has been designed by National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese
      Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, and the hypothesis is 3-year
      disease-free survival in Experimental group was non-inferior to that in Control group.
