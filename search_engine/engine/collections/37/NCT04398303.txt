      intravenously to subjects with moderate to severe COVID-19 related pneumonia in two parts.

      Part 1 is an open-label study of 10 subjects, 5 with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia and 5 with
      severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Of these 10 subjects, 5 will receive ACT-20-CM and 5 will receive
      ACT-20-MSC resuspended in ACT-20-CM.

      Part 2 is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study of 60 patients, 30 with moderate
      COVID-19 pneumonia and 30 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Randomization will be 1:1:1
      ACT-20-MSC in ACT-20-CM, ACT-20-CM or placebo. The placebo is MEM-Î±, a widely used sterile
      culture media that contains non-essential amino acids, nucleosides, vitamins, glucose, sodium
      pyruvate and lipoic acid.

      Subjects treated at each investigative site will provide written informed consent prior to
      the conduct of any study-related procedures. Thereafter, they will be screened and those
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial and undergo all the
      study procedures including the intravenous administration of the investigational medical
      product (IMP = ACT-20-MSC in ACT-20-CM or ACT-20-CM) or placebo. The IMP will be administered
      in addition to any standard of care treatment the subject is receiving.

      Subjects will be assessed daily while in hospital. Following discharge from hospital,
      subjects will be following for an additional three month period.
