      Develop a system for monitoring the effect of anesthetics on consciousness and pain, based on
      synchronous changes in functional neuroimaging, EEG and clinical responses.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Analyze the changes produced in the cortical connectivity map during the induction of
           anesthesia to understand the process of "advancement".

        -  Know more accurately the neuronal circuits involved in propofol-induced sleep.

        -  Study if the application of a known painful stimulus modifies in any way (clinical, EEG
           or by RMf) the LOC that has just been reached.

        -  Establish propofol dosing guidelines adjusted to each patient, studying if they reach
           the LOC at "sedative" or "hypnotic" doses.

        -  Establish remifentanil dosing guidelines, adjusted to each patient, studying the
           concentration of remifentanil to which the pain response in neuroimaging is inhibited
           (activation deactivation neuronal in fMRI).

        -  Validate existing mathematical models in relation to plasma and brain concentrations of
           propofol and remifentanil.

        -  Validate the value of clinical signs to predict whether a patient feels the painful
           stimulus received.
