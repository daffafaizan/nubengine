      People with severe haemophilia usually suffer from recurrent life threatening bleeds (e.g.
      into the brain, digestive system or abdomen) and/or disabling degenerative disease of weight
      bearing joints (e.g. knees, elbows and ankles)resulting from haemorrhage into the joints.
      Daily activities of people with haemophilia has been shown to be dramatically hampered by the
      resultant joint damage. Evaluation of quality of life issues in people with severe
      haemophilia would help to create awareness of their problems and limitations. This would also
      set up the scene for developing policies to improve the treatment options/facilities and
      social life of the patients. Current study aims to assess the quality of life of adult
      patients with severe haemophilia in a developing country (Turkey) by using a validated
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (Turkish version of Haem-A-QoL).
