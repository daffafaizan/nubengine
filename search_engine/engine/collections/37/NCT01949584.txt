    
      In this a prospective, interventional, study, each patient will be studied four times.
      Subjects without OSA will undergo an initial observational control study to establish the
      presence of snoring (session 1); a single CPAP titration night to determine the minimally
      effective CPAP level (session 2) to alleviate snoring; a subsequent full night of CPAP
      treatment at this CPAP level (CPAP not to exceed 6 cm H2O) using the Cloud9â„¢ low-pressure
      CPAP device (session 3); and a final control night of study conducted off CPAP to assess
      whether the patient's snoring remained stable over time (session 4). In this study, each
      subject shall serve as his/her own control.
