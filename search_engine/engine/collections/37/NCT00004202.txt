      survival rate in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer
      treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by radiotherapy plus RSR13. II. Determine
      the complete and partial response rates and progression free interval in the chest (radiation
      portal) of these patients on this regimen. III. Determine the time to disease progression
      outside of the radiation portal in these patients on this regimen. IV. Determine the toxic
      effects and adverse events associated with this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV
      over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Radiotherapy:
      Beginning 3 to 4 weeks after induction chemotherapy, patients receive RSR13 IV over 30
      minutes, followed by fractionated radiotherapy 5 times weekly for 6-7 weeks. Patients are
      followed monthly for 2 months and then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression or
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
