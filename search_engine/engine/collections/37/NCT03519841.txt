      Part A) Subjects will collect spectral Raman data on device every 15 minutes for 10 hours a
      day for five days. The five days will be distributed within a timeframe of ten days. A Flash
      Glucose Monitor will be used as a comparator. In addition to this, four daily capillary Blood
      Glucose readings will be collected.

      Part B) Subjects will perform four daily measuring sessions in which optical Raman readings
      are paired with capillary Blood Glucose comparator. Measuring sessions are performed in
      subjects' own home while maintaining usual diabetes management routines. Subjects will
      collect data for 30 days during a 60 days' period.
