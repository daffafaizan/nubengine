      90 subjects to receive a single dose of TLC599 or DSP via IA injection, followed by a PK
      evaluation period up to 24 weeks and an additional follow-up period of 1 to 5 weeks.
      Additional subjects will be recruited as needed, to achieve at least 6 subjects per cohort
      with adequate SF volume for DP and DEX concentration analysis at EOPK.
