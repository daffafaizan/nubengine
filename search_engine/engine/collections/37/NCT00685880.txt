      decrease knee joint pain. Similar to ACL laxity leading to knee osteoarthritis, laxity of the
      "beak" ligament can lead to worsening thumb CMC osteoarthritis. We hypothesize that dextrose
      intra-articular prolotherapy will have similar results in treating the pain and instability
      related to symptomatic thumb CMC osteoarthritis. This will be a prospective randomized double
      blind comparison study comparing Celestone to Dextrose intra-articular injections as adjuncts
      to hand therapy for the treatment of symptomatic thumb CMC osteoarthritis. Twenty patients
      will be randomized to each treatment arm to provide enough power to show a 20% change in
      visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain to be significant. We will utilize the ultrasound guided
      injection protocol described by the co-investigators for both treatment arms to ensure proper
      placement of the respective solutions. We will measure various grip strengths, and VAS pain
      scales prior to the first injection, prior to the second injection at 6 weeks and at the
      final visit at 6 months. A telephone follow-up with pain scale will be administered at 3
      months. A Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire measuring
      upper extremity functional impairment will be obtained at initial and final visits.
