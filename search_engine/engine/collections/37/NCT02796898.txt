    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalating, dose-expansion study of SM88 in
      patients with prostate cancer. This study includes 2 phases, a dose-escalation phase that
      includes PK evaluation, and a dose-expansion phase.

      During the first stage, at up to 2 institutions, up to 2 cohorts of 1 to 6 patients each will
      be enrolled.

      During the second stage, the dose selected for evaluation from the Phase 1b will be
      administered for a total of 30 evaluable patients (inclusive of those treated at the same
      dose during the dose selection phase) for 6 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, disease
      progression, or until any of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met.
