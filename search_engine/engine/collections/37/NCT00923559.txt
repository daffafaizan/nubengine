      Eighty dyads with infants below 1½ years of age were interviewed and then randomly assigned
      to MIP or TAU. An end-point interview followed after ½ year, evaluating the intervention
      effects.

      The MIP treatments were performed by IPA psychoanalysts at the Infant Reception Service of
      the Swedish Psychoanalytic Society. TAU implied contact with a nurse at a Child Health
      Centre, as part of regular Swedish health care of infants and mothers. Additional treatments
      within the TAU framework suggested at the initiative by the health visitor or the mother were
      registered at the end-point interview.
