      diagnostic tools in both children and adults with small bowel CD. We will determine the
      accuracy of a composite tool (including its multiple individual biomarkers) for defining the
      relative amounts of intestinal inflammation versus scarring in patients at the time of
      surgery (B2 disease) and in patients at an early stage of disease prior to complications (B1
      disease).
