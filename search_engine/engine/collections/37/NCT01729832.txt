      I. To analyze the accuracy of preoperative CT angiography in determining the location of
      perforator vessels. Through the use of an intraoperative navigation system, we will
      objectively locate perforators during surgery and compare the results to the preoperative
      imaging assessment of the flap's vascular anatomy.

      II. To determine whether the preoperative CT angiogram allows the microsurgeon to correctly
      identify the perforators that are ultimately used as the pedicle for the flap.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction using
      the StealthStation navigation system.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks and 1 month, then
      every 3 months for 2 years.
