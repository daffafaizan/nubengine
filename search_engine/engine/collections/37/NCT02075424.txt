      confidence intervals Quantitative variables will be expressed as means, standard deviations
      or medians, range, interquartile intervals Description of biological stress : it will be
      described by calculating the difference between the observed peek or peeks of cortisol ans
      the cortisol level measured at rest (means, standard deviations or medians, range,
      interquartile intervals) Description of perceived stress : the AVS will be described in terms
      of means and standard deviation Comparison of the peek-delta/base level of cortisol in the 3
      different workstations of the call center operators according to the non parametrical
      Kruskall Wallis test. Same for the lengthof service of the call operator, the severity of the
      call and the status of the doctor The AVS score (perceived stress) will be compared to the
      peek-delta/base level of cortisol (biological stress) thanks to the Spearmann correlation
      coefficient.
