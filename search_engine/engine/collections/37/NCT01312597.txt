      compounds found in foods such as fruit and vegetables, to ameliorate age-related cognitive
      decline. Research suggests that flavonoids improve memory and learning, possibly as a result
      of their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects for example by
      increasing cerebral blood flow, protecting vulnerable neurons, enhancing existing neuronal
      function or by stimulating neuronal function. The research will initially involve a
      randomised cross-over human dietary intervention trial using two flavonoid-rich drinks
      (flavanone-rich and flavanone-poor) to investigate changes in cerebral blood flow in young
      adults (n=6; age range 18-30 years). Changes in cognitive performance and measures of serum
      BDNF levels will then be investigated in a second randomised cross-over trial using the
      intervention drink showing the greatest effect on cerebral blood flow in young adults (n=24;
      age range 18-30 years) and using a range of sensitive tests of executive function. The study
      is designed to measure acute effects of types of flavonoid supplementation and, as well as
      the primary cognitive outcome, will assess flavonoid/metabolite and BDNF (brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor) levels in blood and changes in vascular reactivity.
