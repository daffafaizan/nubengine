      instructed by two physiotherapists with expertise in cardiac rehabilitation. Each training
      session takes 60 minutes and is based on current evidence for physical training for IHD and
      CHF patients. Exercise intensity progresses within the first week of the training program
      from moderate intensity (40-59% of VO2max), to high intensity (60-84% of VO2max). Exercise
      intensity of the individual training sessions is monitored by heart rate.

      The training program includes the following:

      Warm-up and stretching: Each training sessions starts 10 min. warm-up and ends with 5 min.
      stretching.

      Aerobic exercise : Takes place on treadmill, stairs, ergometer bikes and interval training
      with different strength-endurance exercises.

      Muscle strength: Is performed on machines with weight training equipment or by floor
      exercises. 10-15 repetitions are performed with a load equivalent to 50-60% of 1 RM.

      The exercise programs for both groups are performed using a standardized exercise protocol.

      All patients per a sub-maximal and a maximal exercise test prior to participation in the
      physical exercise training program.
