      defined by the RECIST criteria) in women with recurrent or refractory advanced ovarian or
      primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Median survival time. II. 6-month survival rate. III. Objective tumour stable disease
      rate. IV. Response duration. V. Toxicity. VI. Time to disease progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Course 1 (56 days): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-56 and gemcitabine
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      Course 2 and all subsequent courses (28 days): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on
      days 1-28 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with a complete or partial response receive at least 2 additional courses beyond
      documented response. Patients with stable or responding disease who have received at least 6
      courses may discontinue gemcitabine and continue sorafenib alone until disease progression.
