      Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative and debilitating change that affects the
      synovial joints.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
      combined with closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises in patients with knee OA.

      Methods: Nineteen patients with knee OA were enrolled and randomized into two groups: group I
      was treated with CKC + NMES, and group II was treated with CKC + NMES placebo. Both groups
      underwent 20 sessions of mini-squat exercises at 30 degrees of knee flexion that were
      associated with and interspersed with NMES for 5 minutes at a frequency of 40 hertz (Hz), 10
      minutes at 70 Hz and an addition 10 minutes at 150 Hz, for a total of 25 minutes. The data
      were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 17.0. Data
      were expressed as a frequency, mean and standard deviation and were statistically analyzed
      using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements followed by
      Bonferroni's post-hoc test. The investigators also used an unpaired Student's t-test and
      Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests with a level of significance of P < 0.05.
