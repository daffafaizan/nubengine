      non-CTO artery (non-CTO PCI group), and those undergoing PCI of the non-CTO artery
      concurrently with the CTO artery (CTO-PCI group). The primary outcome assessed will be the
      change in cardiac function evaluated via CMR at a 12-month of follow-up appointment, which
      will be compared to a baseline measurement. Secondary outcomes include occurrence of major
      cardiac events, CMR-assessed myocardial viability in the CTO-supplied territory, and quality
      of life assessed by Seattle angina questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 after 12-month follow-up.
