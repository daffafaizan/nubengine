      metformine 500 mg to determine if they are bioequivalent and identify the occurrence of
      adverse events.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was approved by research Ethics Committee and all
      twenty-eight volunteers signed the selected IC. An open, randomized, crossover study with two
      periods of confinement and an interval of seven days between them was performed. Twenty (20)
      blood collections were performed between 30 minutes and 36 hours after drug administration.
      Plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
      Statistical analysis was conducted based on pharmacokinetic parameters: maximum concentration
      (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC 0-te AUC 0-inf). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) model
      appropriate was employed for the two periods cross under the logarithmically transformed
      data.
