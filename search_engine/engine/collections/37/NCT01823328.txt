    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of etomidate versus ketamine during rapid
      sequence intubation (RSI). RSI refers to the process by which patients who require emergency
      airway management undergo sedation and paralysis prior to insertion of an endotracheal
      tube(airway tube). Patients who require intubation will be randomized to have intubation
      performed with either ketamine or etomidate. All other care will be at the discretion of the
      treating physicians. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      ketamine and etomidate during rapid sequence intubation.
