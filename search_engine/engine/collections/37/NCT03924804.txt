      Ringer's solution acetate (2 ml/kg,8ml/kg, 16ml/kg) on bladder volume,
      hemodynamics,transthoracic echocardiography and vascular ultrasound including the inferior
      vena cava(IVC) and the right subclavian vein(SCV) diameter and the IVC and SCV collapsibility
      index in patients undergoing daytime surgery through a randomized controlled clinical study,
      so as to provide better guidance for clinical transfusion avoiding bladder catheterization .
      The patients in this trial were visited before induction and discharge from the
      postanaesthesia .We also collected the first time and times of micturition and whether the
      patients have the dysuria.
