      dose whole thorax megavoltage radiotherapy (LD-WTRT) can produce meaningful clinical benefit
      in COVID-19 patients. In Step 1, patients would be randomized 1:2 to standard of care without
      or with LD-WTRT. Patients randomized to LD-WTRT would be further randomized to either 35 cGy
      or 100 cGy. After 20 patients have been enrolled on each low-dose radiotherapy arm, they will
      be evaluated to determine the selection of the "best radiotherapy dose-arm" for the remainder
      of the patients. This will be done by analyzing clinical benefit, risk profile, and the
      dynamics of biomarker change, specifically focusing on IL-6

        1. If the rate of Grade 4 toxicity is lower by an absolute rate of 15% when comparing the
           35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the arm with the lower toxicity rate will be used for Step 2 of
           the trial.

        2. If the crude clinically meaningful event rate (CMER) which is a composite endpoint, is
           lower by an absolute rate of 20% when comparing the 35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the lower
           CMER rate arm will be used for Step 2. CMER is defined as a composite of :

             1. Rate of mechanical ventilation (MV)

             2. Rate of prolonged hospital stay >10 days (PHS)

             3. Crude all-cause mortality rate at the time of analysis

        3. If the crude CMER is < 20% difference between the 35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the
           investigators will determine whether there is a trend suggesting less Facility Resource
           Utilization Rate (FRUR). If the FRUR is 20% lower in either the 35 cGy or 100 cGy arms,
           that dose will be used for Step 2. The FRUR is based upon:

             1. Days of mechanical ventilation

             2. Days of hospitalization.

        4. If both crude CMER and FRU rates do not differ by at least 20%, the investigators will
           evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) for IL-6 levels drawn within 24 hours before
           LD-WTRT and at 48 hours (2d) and 168 hours (7d) after radiation. If one of the two arms
           has a 20% lower serum IL-6 AUC one week after radiotherapy, the investigators will
           select that arm for Step 2.

        5. If none of the parameters in numbers 1-4 above differ in the criteria listed, the
           investigators will use the lower dose of 35 cGy for Step 2.
