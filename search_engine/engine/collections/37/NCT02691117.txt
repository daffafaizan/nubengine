      It is an open label, prospective cohort pilot study. Patients enrolled in the study will be
      followed at the Hospital for Sick Children for 6 months. Participants will come for the study
      visits every month (7 study visits). During each study visit two investigators will
      independently access patient's hair density and calculate the SALT score (Severity of
      Alopecia Tool Score), using the participant's digital photographs.

      Patients will be provided with the study medication for all duration of the study.

      The results of the treatment will be compared with the baseline data ( pictures/ scores/ hair
      density) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of garlic concentrate in children with patchy
      alopecia areata.
