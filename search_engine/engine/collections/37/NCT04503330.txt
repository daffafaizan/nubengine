    
      A graft of buccal mucosa will be used to augment either the narrow unhealthy pelviureteric
      junction or a narrow long segment of the ureter.

      after freeing the narrowed part, a posterior incision will be made in the ureter or renal
      pelvis then the graft will be implanted on the psoas muscle using interrupted sutures in a
      position the allows easy anastomosis to the ureter or renal pelvis.

      Alternatively a lateral incision in the renal pelvis or the ureter may be done for the graft
      anastomosis and then surrounded with omenal flap to ensure a good blood supply for the graft.
