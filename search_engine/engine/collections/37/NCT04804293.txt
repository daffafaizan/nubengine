      beyond the normal risk of conventional ultrasound and should not cause you any discomfort.
      Ultrasound at the intensity levels and duration used in this study has not been shown to
      present risk to humans. The investigators will conduct the SWE study on the set time point
      when the patient returns for follow-up after the therapy (surgical decompression or
      corticosteroid injection).

      A set of pictures will be taken of patients wrists by the FDA approved ultrasound system.
      This system uses a special type of ultrasound for imaging your wrists.

      The ultrasound study will be repeated after 3 and 6 months after the treatments.
