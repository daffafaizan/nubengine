    
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against wild-type
      c-Kit, the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit, and PDGFR. In addition to its direct inhibitory
      action against these kinase targets, masitinib is also thought to promote survival via
      modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor
      microenvironment. The objective of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      active-controlled study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib with respect to
      imatinib in the first line treatment of gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Treatment
      will be given until disease progression, limiting toxicity or patient consent withdrawal.
