    
      This multi-arm, multi-site study investigates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of stem
      cell therapy for the treatment of various acute and chronic conditions. Clinically observed
      initial findings and an extensive body of research indicate regenerative treatments are both
      safe and effective for the treatment of multiple conditions.

      This study investigates clinical outcomes of treatments for numerous indications including:
      Autoimmune, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Integumentary, Neurologic / Neurodegenerative,
      Pulmonary, Orthopedic Diseases, Sexual Dysfunction, Urologic Disorders and Viral Illnesses.

      Our hypotheses posit that regenerative treatments are both safe and statistically beneficial
      for a range of conditions. Outcomes will be determined by multiple valid outcome instruments
      that measure general quality of life information along with condition-specific information.
