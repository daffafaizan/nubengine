      protocol CALGB C9781 to treatment with surgery alone vs trimodal therapy combining
      preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in addition to surgery. II. Examine the
      incremental cost and cost effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in
      the treatment of esophageal cancer. III. Examine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted
      life year (QALY) of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of
      esophageal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a companion study to CALGB C9781, a phase III randomized study. Prior to
      treatment on CALGB C9781, patients complete forms assessing quality of life, psychological
      functioning, specific areas of dysfunction, resource use, and time lost from work; subsequent
      assessments are completed by telephone interview at 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the
      initiation of study treatment, regardless of disease status (patients with hearing impairment
      and those speaking only a translatable foreign language may mail responses). Patients also
      keep a diary of medical resource utilization at sites other than the treating institution.
