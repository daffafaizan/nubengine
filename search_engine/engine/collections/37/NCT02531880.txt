    
      Objective: The primary goals of this pilot study is to (1) describe the safety profile of
      administration of mangafodipir in patients with epilepsy and (2) determine if peri-ictal
      administration will allow focal entry of mangafodipir through the blood-brain-barrier and
      manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) visualization of seizure foci.
      Secondary objectives are further exploration of MEMRI properties in patients with epilepsy.

      Study population: 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

      Design: Screening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam,
      blood and urine laboratory testing. Patients will be imaged interictally with a gadolinium
      enhanced MRI session. The administration of mangafodipir will be done as an inpatient during
      long-term video EEG recording, to ensure administration in the periictal period. Patients
      will receive a baseline MRI scan, IV mangafodipir injection and will then be serially scanned
      with non-contrast MRI scans.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are (1) description of the safety profile of
      mangafodipir administration in patients with epilepsy, and (2) evaluation of the difference
      between T1-weighted signal intensity in the brain measured after mangafodipir administration
      in the seizure onset zone identified by standard clinical, EEG, and imaging studies, and the
      homologous contralateral region.
