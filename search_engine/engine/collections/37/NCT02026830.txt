      Infections) in different regions of the world . In contrast to Western countries, studies
      from Asia and Africa have demonstrated that aerobic gram-negative organisms, particularly
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are far more common . The majority of current guidelines for the
      management of DFIs have been prepared in Western countries . Based on the results of more
      recent studies from the Asian continent, however, empiric antibiotic therapy for DFIs may
      need to be directed at organisms with substantially different antibiotic susceptibility
      patterns than those recommended in current guidelines. Thus, suggested antibiotic regimens
      for DFIs should be optimized for local clinical practice. The aim of the current trial is to
      provide an up-to-date view of the causative microorganisms and their antibiotic sensitivity
      patterns in diabetic patients with a foot infection in Turkey.
