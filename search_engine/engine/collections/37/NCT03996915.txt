      worldwide trend towards a rise in halitosis prevalence. Studies show halitosis returns in a
      week after treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Probably, bacteria residing in the
      periodontal sulcus could recolonize the dorsum of the tongue. To date, there are no study in
      adult population that associate halitosis and periodontal treatment with follow-up
      evaluation. The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to treat oral halitosis
      in healthy adults with photodynamic therapy associated with periodontal treatment and follow
      them up for 3 months. The participants (n=40) with halitosis will be randomized into two
      groups: G1-treatment with photodynamic therapy (n = 20) or G2-cleaning of the tongue with a
      tongue scraper (n = 20). Halitosis were evaluated measuring volatile sulfur compounds using
      gas chromatography After the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a
      microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria T. denticola. The
      evaluation of halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. After that,
      patients will receive periodontal treatment. The participants will return after 1 week and
      three months for an additional evaluation. Quality of life will be measured by Oral Health
      Impact Profile (OHIP-14) Comparisons will be made with ANOVA test, with the level of
      significance of 5 %. This protocol will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding
      the reduction of halitosis in adults.
