    
      Periodontal phenotype, also known as periodontal biotype, has been recognized as one of the
      key factors that may potentially impact the outcome of a variety of esthetic restorative
      procedures. With the increasing esthetic demand of patients in the context of tooth
      replacement therapy in the anterior esthetic zone, the ability to determine the prognostic
      value and the influence on treatment outcomes of this parameter has become a critical
      component of contemporary treatment planning. Periodontal phenotype encompases "bone
      morphotypes, shapes of the teeth, morphologic characteristics of the gingiva and the
      periodontium".
