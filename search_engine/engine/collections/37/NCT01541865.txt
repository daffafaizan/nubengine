      employed to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 6 months as compared to
      pre-treatment baseline blood pressures.

      Patient blood pressure will be measured by in the office according to recognized
      international techniques and standards.

      Procedural success shall be defined as ability to complete the renal denervation treatment
      using the V2 balloon catheter device and RF generator.
