      I. To perform standardized molecular analysis for patients at MD Anderson to assist in
      personalized cancer therapy.

      II. To determine the frequency of mutations and co-mutations and other alterations in
      cancer-related genes in different tumor types.

      III. To establish a database of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, gene
      fusion/translocation information and other biomarker alterations and clinical characteristics
      that can be used to select patients that may be eligible for new targeted therapy trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine enrollment to pathway-targeted therapy trials by cancer genotype and
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression, and plan additional pathway-targeted therapy
      trials.

      II. To determine how somatic and germline mutations in cancer-related genes, other molecular
      alterations affect response to commonly used anti-tumor therapies and cancer outcomes.

      III. To determine genomic alterations detectable in plasma and their evolution with
      treatment.

      IV. To perform multiplex and non-multiplex protein and protein/RNA screening using different
      platforms such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence, (IF) mass spectrometry
      (MS), and nanostring of slides or tissue microarrays.

      V. To determine feasibility of identifying actionable targets and rationale drug combinations
      based on gene expression profiling and systems biology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' previously collected tissue samples are analyzed. Patients may also undergo
      collection of blood, saliva or buccal samples for analysis. Patients' medical records are
      reviewed.
