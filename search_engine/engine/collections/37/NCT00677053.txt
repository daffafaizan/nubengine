      and stable or unstable angina, is acknowledged to represent collectively a major global
      healthcare problem. Despite existing treatments, the rates of patient mortality, myocardial
      infarction and hospital readmissions during follow-up remain very high.

      Due to its critical role in propagating the blood coagulation cascade, activated factor X now
      is considered to be a major therapeutic target in the development of novel antithrombotic
      therapy by blocking thrombin generation and attenuating the formation of fibrin. Therefore,
      activated factor X inhibitors, exhibiting either indirect or direct modes of action, are
      among the novel agents under investigation in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-442 compared with placebo in
      post-acute coronary syndrome subjects who are also receiving standard antiplatelet and other
      cardiovascular therapy.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 3.5 months. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, physical examinations, electrocardiograms and bilateral venogram.
