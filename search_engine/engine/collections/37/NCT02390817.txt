      group S, TIVA will be stopped and 2 mg/kg of sugammadex will be given intravenously. BIS,
      TOF, MEP, SSEP will be measured. In group N, TIVA will be stopped and 0.04 mg/kg of
      neostigmine will be given. Also BIS, TOF, MEP, SSEP will be measured. Sugammadex will be
      given group S and Neostigmine will be given group N at the end of the operation. At
