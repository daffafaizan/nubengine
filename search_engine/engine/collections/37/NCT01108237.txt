    
      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, clinical investigation
      to determine whether TruMatch™ alignment is non-inferior to alignment achieved in a recently
      completed study (historical control) with conventional instrumentation.

      Each enrolled Subject will undergo a total knee replacement using the TruMatch™ surgical
      technique. This investigation will require the Subject to be followed once postoperatively to
      collect radiographs. Follow-up will occur typically 2 to 12 weeks after surgery and when the
      Subject can achieve full leg extension (+/-5 degrees) and can tolerate weight-bearing.
