      mitral regurgitation (MR). Multiple 2D and Doppler parameters are assessed in an integrated
      fashion and the proximal flow convergent zone of the mitral regurgitation jet is used to
      calculate effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume. These measurements have
      been shown to have important prognostic information. In the last two years, the development
      of transesophageal imaging with 3D capability has allowed a better visualization of mitral
      leaflet pathology. Color Doppler 3D studies have shown that 2D methods generally
      underestimate mitral regurgitant volume. Magnetic resonance techniques have recently been
      developed to quantitate flow and calculate regurgitant volumes.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate newer methods of quantitating mitral regurgitation
      severity using real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      (CMR). Although RT3DE measurements have been shown to correlate well with CMR measures of LV
      volumes, using a 3D volumetric method to calculate mitral regurgitant volumes has not been
      well studied. In patients with more than mild mitral regurgitation, we will obtain
      transthoracic RT3DE measures of mitral regurgitant volume and compare them with traditional
      2D measures of MR severity. We will also compare RT3DE and CMR measures of mitral regurgitant
      volume.
