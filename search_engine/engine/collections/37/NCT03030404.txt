    
      Background:

        -  An estimated 1-3% of gastric cancer cases occur within a familial background as part of
           an inherited cancer syndrome

        -  Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is the most frequent form of familial gastric
           cancer and has been linked to a germline mutation in the CDH1 gene

        -  Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS) is a more recently
           described autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by fundic gland polyposis with
           antral sparing

        -  Other germline mutations that predispose to gastric cancer such as SDH (succinate
           dehydrogenase protein subunits) gene and CTNNA1 (alpha catenin).

      Objectives:

      - Characterize the natural and clinical histories of hereditary gastric cancer syndromes

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals, and family members, who fulfill clinical criteria for a hereditary gastric
      cancer syndrome irrespective of previous genetic testing or treatment

      Design:

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis and study the
           natural history of hereditary gastric cancers

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.
