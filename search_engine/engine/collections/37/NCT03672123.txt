      pulmonary embolism (APE).

      In APE right ventricle failure developing due to ischemia and myocarditis is considered the
      primary cause of death, however, its pathomechanism has not been fully established yet.
      Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a chemokine secreted by activated macrophages in
      response to oxidative stress. It has now been shown that ischemic injury, mechanical stretch,
      and pro-inflammatory cytokines also stimulate the expression of GDF-15 in cardiac myocytes.
      The objective of this project is to describe the role of GDF-15 in the pathomechanism of
      acute right ventricle failure in the setting of acute pulmonary embolism and to verify the
      hypothesis that higher serum concentrations of GDF-15 are associated with more advanced right
      ventricle dysfunction and failure.
