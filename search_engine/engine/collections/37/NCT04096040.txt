    
      Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will wear the μCor for up to 90 days.

      During the study, face to face follow up will occur every 30 days. For all subjects, each
      scheduled clinic visit will include assessment of cardiac signs, symptoms, and any relevant
      clinically actionable events.

      The subject will be given a daily diary to track symptoms, hospital visits, medication
      changes, and all other heart failure related clinical events.

      Weekly phone calls to the subject will be given throughout the duration of the study to
      remind the patient to use the subject diary and to collect and record heart failure related
      clinical events.

      The subject's health care provider team will receive the μCor data through access to a
      clinical tool interface. The clinical tool will send data updates that are dependent on the
      μCor data trends. The data updates will allow the health care provider team to take action
      when the data indicate worsening heart failure, within the context of standard of care
      medical practice and patient specific parameters. Weekly data reports will be delivered to
      the investigators.

      Subjects will be contacted six months and one year from initial enrollment to assess the
      vital status of the subject, any heart failure related clinical events since the end of μCor
      wear, and any health care utilization since the end of μCor wear.
