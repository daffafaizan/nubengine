        -  Determine the frequency of ligand-independent phosphorylation of Stat3 in a small cohort
           of samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia including, but not
           limited to, samples known to express mutated c-kit.

        -  Measure the level of Stat3 phosphorylation in these samples after stimulation of three
           key cytokine receptors expressed on hematopoietic cells IL-6R, G-CSFR, and c-kit.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for levels of various components of the Stat3
      pathway via western blotting.
