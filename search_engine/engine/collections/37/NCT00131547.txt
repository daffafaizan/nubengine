    
      The purpose of the study is to determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle
      modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with
      mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to usual patient care. The
      secondary purpose of the study is to determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6
      month period results in improvements in snoring and other symptoms and in the frequency of
      apnea on overnight monitoring.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle modification (dietary
           education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with mild-moderate
           OSA when compared to usual care.

        -  To determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6 month period result in
           improvements in objective measures of sleep disordered breathing (AHI).

      Secondary Objective

        -  To determine if the weight loss achieved in 6 months result in improvements in OSA
           symptoms (e.g., snoring, sleepiness) and quality of life.

        -  To determine if metabolic parameters (e.g., lipids, glucose) improve.

        -  To determine if there is improvement in sleep structure and oxygenation during sleep.
