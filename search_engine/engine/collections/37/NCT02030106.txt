      asked to participate in three visits total. Visit one/enrollment occurs between 16 and 20
      weeks of gestation, visit two at 20-24 weeks, and visit three at 24-28 weeks. At each visit,
      vaginal swabs will be collected. The patient will also be asked to fill out a series of
      surveys related to stress, anxiety,and depression in pregnancy. Research coordinators will
      perform chart abstraction after delivery.
