      count in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in preparation for an
      allogeneic stem cell transplant with acceptable toxicities that are no worse than current
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The known dose-limiting toxicity at 75 mg was excessive
      fatigue in a previous phase I trial which in this study may be irrelevant as all study
      participants will have an in-patient status.
