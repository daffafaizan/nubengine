      with pancreaticoduodenectomy between antecolic and retrocolic gastrointestinal
      reconstruction. Delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy is important to affect
      the postoperative course and QOL. We conducted a prospective randomized trial on 240 patients
      who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for comparing between antecolic and retrocolic
      gastrointestinal reconstruction.

      The primary endpoint was defined as incidence of delayed gastric emptying by ISGPS criteria.
      The secondary endpoint was defined as incidence of other postoperative morbidity. Patients
      were recruited into this study before surgery, on the basis of whether pancreatic head
      resection was anticipated for pancreatic head and periampullary disease, and an appropriate
      informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria was 1) patients who have the history of
      gastrectomy, 2) patients who have severe cardiorespiratory dysfunction, 3) patients who have
      liver cirrhosis or are receiving dialysis, and 4) patients who were diagnosed inadequate for
      this study by a physician.
