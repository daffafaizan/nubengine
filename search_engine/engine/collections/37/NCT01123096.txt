      hours and returning them to the clinician for weighing. This allows for accurate
      quantification of urine loss. This test is often used in clinical studies before and after
      intervention to assess efficacy of treatment.

      The cough stress test is an alternative testing modality used to evaluate stress
      incontinence. It is an easy test to perform in a single visit to the clinician's office and
      the results are immediately available. It involves the patient coughing forcefully with a
      full bladder and watching for leakage of urine through the urethra.

      In our study, our primary aim is to compare the equivalency of the cough stress test to the
      24 hour pad test as a measure of stress urinary incontinence. Our secondary aim will be to
      assess patient comfort and satisfaction with each of the testing modalities. If the cough
      stress test is equivalent, it will provide an additional, easy to use tool for patient
      evaluation.
