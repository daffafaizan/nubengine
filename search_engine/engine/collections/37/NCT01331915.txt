        -  second cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 150 µg Theravac®

        -  the third cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 250 µg Theravac® and
           eventually a total of 14 patients will complete the step with the highest dose.

      All the patients will receive four immunizations every three weeks in two intradermal sites
      and in two subcutaneous sites.
