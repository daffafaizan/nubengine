      altered mental status, and/or neurological deficit; between birth and the twenty-eight
      postnatal day for which a pattern of ischemic brain injury in an arterial distribution is
      evident by neuroimaging. Following perinatal stroke, approximately 60% of children develop
      cerebral palsy (usually presenting as spastic hemiplegia), 30-60% experience epilepsy, 25%
      show language delay, and up to 22% manifest behavioral problems.

      The current most predictive tools for early diagnosis of CP are a combination of brain
      MRI/cUS and a general movements (GM) assessment in the fidgety period (9). Asymmetry of
      fidgety GMs around 12 weeks post term can be the first clinical signs of hemiplegia.

      There are currently two intensive therapy approaches aiming at improving upper limb
      performance in adults and children (average age 8 years) with established hemiplegic CP:
      constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) and Hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT).
      Those current therapy approaches fundamentally comprise repeated practice of desired
      movements based on motor learning principles with the adult/ child as an active participant.

      Both therapies, in adults and in children with established hemiplegic CP (average age 8
      years) are effective and show similar improvements if the dosage of therapy is similar. In
      contrast, the feasibility and the effects of both therapy approaches at very young age (under
      age 1 year) is still unknown (22). Exploring these options to treat even before asymmetric
      hand use has appeared is interesting and promising enough since recent animal studies have
      demonstrated that there is a critical period of motor system plasticity, and that
      activity-dependent reorganization of the motor-projection pattern to the hand occurs before
      about 1 year of age
