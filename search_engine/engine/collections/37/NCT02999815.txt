      First, adults admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases Ho
      Chi Minh City will be randomized to receive either human (3000 IU) or equine (21,000 units)
      intramuscular antitoxin. Second, participants will be randomized to receive either standard
      treatment with intramuscular antitoxin alone or with the addition of 500 IU intrathecal human
      antitoxin. Patients with prior antitoxin treatment and those with contra-indications to
      lumbar puncture or antitoxin treatment will be excluded.

      All patients will receive other standard tetanus treatment as deemed necessary by the
      attending physicians. Spasms will be treated with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy.
      Patients with spasms not controlled with benzodiazepines will receive tracheostomy,
      paralysis, magnesium sulphate and mechanical ventilation. Heart rate, BP, temperature and
      daily drug use will be recorded throughout the ICU stay. Patients will be followed following
      discharge from hospital until 240 days for disability/ death.
