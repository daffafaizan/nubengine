    
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a congenital genetical disease characterized by moderate
      retardation, food-seeking behavior and a serious risk of developing health threatening
      overweight, low stature, abnormal body composition and a lack of growth- and sex-hormones.
      They can not live an independent life and are reliant of help from care personnel.

      People with PWS react abnormally to signals from their own bodies. E.g. they have a reduced
      sense of pain and can have a lacking urge to urination despite a full bladder. Most of the
      patients also have a relatively slow pulse, which can be consistent with a dysfunction in the
      nervous system (the parasympathetic nervous system) which also has large significance for the
      bladder- and bowel function.

      The Intestinal function in people with PWS is a sparse described subject, which has not been
      systematically examined in scientific context. We therefore want to examine whether the bowel
      function in people with PWS are different from the bowel function in healthy people.

      The subject is elucidated by a medical examination, a questionnaire, a registration of toilet
      habits, a measurement of the rectal diameter by an ultrasound scan and a measurement of the
      colonic transit time.

      The results will be compared to findings in normal healthy people. Because no normal material
      exists for rectal diameter measured by ultrasound, we will establish one.

      The result of the project will increase our knowledge of possible bowel dysfunctions such as
      constipation, in people with PWS and can immediately lead to improved care for and optimized
      treatment of the patients.
