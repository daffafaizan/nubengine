      body weight, risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. With rising public health
      awareness of these potential adverse effects, consumption of artificially sweetened beverages
      (ASB) has increased dramatically. These low-calorie products are marketed as "diet," with the
      implication that they promote weight loss and improved health. However, there are no
      long-term experimental studies of ASB and body weight or any other health outcome. Several
      recent prospective observational studies have linked intake of ASB to increased risk of the
      metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. In the proposed clinical trial, 270 young
      adults who habitually consume SSB will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) to
      continue consuming habitual levels of SSB; 2) to substitute ASB for SSB; or 3) to substitute
      unsweetened beverages for SSB. Each group will receive home delivery of the targeted beverage
      for 1 year, using methods that build upon previous successful work. Careful attention will be
      given to assuring treatment fidelity, equivalence of treatment intensity, and avoidance of
      experimental confounders. The primary study endpoint will be the ratio of serum triglyceride
      to HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Secondary endpoints will include changes in other
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, body weight, dietary quality, and taste preferences.
