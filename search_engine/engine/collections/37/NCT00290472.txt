      I. Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with CCI-779.

      II. Determine the toxicity and safety of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate the
      degree of activation of P13/AKT/mTOR pathway and levels of CDK inhibitors with response in
      patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate CCI-779 induced inactivation of mTOR with response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (aggressive lymphoma [group A] vs
      follicular lymphoma [group B] vs small lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      [group C]).

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.
