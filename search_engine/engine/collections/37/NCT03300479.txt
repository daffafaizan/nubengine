      (ICH) are evaluated for enrollment. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher than 160 mmHg
      or SBP <160 mmHg under intravenous antihypertensive drug (e.g. Urapidil), started less than 3
      h before randomization, the patient will be randomized in one of the two study groups and
      intravenous therapy with Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®) will start
      immediately. Data of systemic haemodynamics will be collected continuously by online
      monitoring, starting at baseline and ending after 24h (study data measurements). In
      particular, all blood pressure measurements are extracted via an arterial line, which is
      placed as standard of care in these patients. If the target values are not attained within 30
      minutes, the investigators can add or switch to alternative antihypertensive drugs of their
      choice. 24h after initiation of Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®), all
      patients receive Nicardipine (Cardene®) (standard care in daily clinical routine) for another
      24h followed by orally administered antihypertensive medication.

      Intracerebral hematoma volume will be determined by readings of noncontrast brain computed
      tomography (CT) scans using the ABC/2 rule to calculate the volume. As a standard in these
      patients a CT scan is performed 6 hours after admission to the ICU.
