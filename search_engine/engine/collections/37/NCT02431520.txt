    
      Women living in the community of the Morro dos Macacos, Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, were
      randomly allocated for self-collection of specimens for HC II for detection of HPV-DNA or to
      Pap smear collection by medical personnel, as screening method to identify precursor lesions
      of cervical cancer.

      The compliance was measured by the delivery of the specimen obtained by self-collection or to
      attend to a visit at the community health center to be submitted to Pap smear collection,
      within a week.
