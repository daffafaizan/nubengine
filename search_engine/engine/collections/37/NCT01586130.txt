      especially the quadriceps; leading to disease progression. Advantages of muscular strength
      training for the treatment of this kind of O.A. is now well established. In this therapeutic
      field, isokinetic exercises seem to have a better efficiency than other, more frequently
      used, kinds of exercises such as isometric or isotonic exercises.

      Functional impairment caused by knee O.A. is mainly affecting walking. Walking induces
      muscles to work in eccentric mode.

      The hypothesis of this study is that muscular strengthening using isokinetic exercises in
      eccentric mode would have a more important benefit than isokinetic exercises in concentric
      mode. Such an hypothesis, if verified, could lead to a better management of rehabilitative
      knee exercises in the treatment of knee O.A.
