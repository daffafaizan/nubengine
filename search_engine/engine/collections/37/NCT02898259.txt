    
      Primary:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of the combination of oral ixazomib and
      lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma
      having high tumor burden by GELF criteria or FLIPI 3-5

      Secondary:

        -  To determine overall response rate in an expanded cohort at the MTD for follicular
           lymphoma and for non-follicular low-grade B cell lymphoma

        -  Duration of response, time to progression, progression free survival, time to treatment
           failure and overall survival

        -  Create tissue microarray from paraffin embedded tissue for future studies.

        -  Assessment of baseline lymphocyte subsets as prognostic markers.

      Overview of Study Design:

      This study combines three classes of agents that have non-overlapping mechanisms of action
      and toxicity profiles, with each pair having demonstrated clinical evidence of benefit
      without unexpected toxicity. We use the lenalidomide-rituximab backbone, feasible and active
      in lymphoma, and add a novel oral proteasome inhibitor to potentially enhance efficacy,
      minimize toxicity and limit patient visits for treatment.

      Patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma having high tumor burden by GELF
      criteria or FLIPI 3-5 will be treated with the combination of oral ixazomib + lenalidomide +
      rituximab.

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of this
      regimen. The study will use a standard 3 + 3 design for determination of MTD during cycle 1.
      There will be three dose levels for escalation, followed by two expansion cohorts of 12
      patients each at the MTD, one cohort with follicular lymphoma and one cohort with
      non-follicular low-grade lymphoma (SLL, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic).
