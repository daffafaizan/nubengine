      little design change despite risks associated with Foley catheter use including cather
      associated Urinary Tract Infections(UTIs). However, recent incentives and penalties related
      to iatrogenic bladder infections have encouraged healthcare providers to search for ways to
      decrease catheter-associated infections. Data suggests that the design of the traditional
      Foley catheter may be responsible for bladder mucosal injury due to contact with the drainage
      tip, which in turn contribute to bladder infections associated with long term indwelling
      Foley catheter usage. The Cystosure catheter is an FDA approved bladder drainage device, with
      a shortened drainage port, designed to avoid contact with the bladder mucosa. It is
      postulated that the lack of contact with the mucosa would decrease mucosal injury, possibly
      leading to decreased incidence of catheter related bladder infections. Early sheep bladder
      microscopy studies have suggested that the Cystosure catheter produces significantly less
      mucosal injury compared to the Foley catheter following a short period of indwelling bladder
      catheterization. The present study is designed to compare bladder wall geometry around the
      drainage balloon in the Foley versus the Cystosure drainage catheters in living women. It is
      hypothesized that the "tip-less" cystosure catheter will have a smoother, more continuous
      bladder contour around the drainage port, compared to the traditional Foley catheter tip.
