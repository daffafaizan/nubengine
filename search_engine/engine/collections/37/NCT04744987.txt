      between euvolemia and hypovolemia in hyponatremic patients. Changes in serum creatinine were
      retrospectively analyzed . The latter was calculated subtracting the serum creatinine value
      of eunatremia from that of hyponatremia, and was categorized as an increase when it was
      "positive", or "decrease/no change" when it was negative or equal to zero. The percentual
      change in serum creatinine was also calculated.

      Two groups of patients were selected for the current study. First group was conformed by
      patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, and second group by patients with euvolemic
      hyponatremia. Data from eunatremia as well as the hyponatremic episode were collected. Both
      groups were matched in Receiver operating characteristic curve analyzes where both
      arithmetical and percentual changes in serum creatinine were assessed and cut-off points were
      selected for an additional Odd Ratio analysis.
