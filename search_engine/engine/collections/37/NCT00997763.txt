      diseased vessels (1) and exhibit exaggerated neointimal hyperplasia after bare-metal stent
      (BMS) implantation as compared with nondiabetics (2). Although drug-eluting stent (DES)
      implantation significantly reduced the neointimal hyperplasia and angiographic restenosis
      compared to BMS in diabetic patients (3), presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) have been still
      associated with an increased risk of restenosis and unfavorable clinical outcomes in the era
      of DES (4,5). Recently, the relative efficacies of sirolimua-eluting stent (SES) and
      paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) in patients with DM have been evaluated in randomized and
      registry studies (6-10). The present study, ESSENCE-DIABETES Study, compare 8-month
      angiographic and 1-year clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with
      sirolimus-eluting stent (CYPHER) or everolimus-eluting stent (XIENCE V)
