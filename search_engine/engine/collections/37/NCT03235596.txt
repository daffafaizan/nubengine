      for autism without mental retardation or Asperger syndrome and they have adaptive capacity
      and autonomy complaints. They stable treatments for at least 4 weeks prior and during all the
      study and no history of tDCS. Women of childbearing age with no adequate contraception,
      pregnant or lactating women are excluded.

      This is an interventional, prospective and monocentric pilot study. The patient is informed
      about the clinical study during the psychiatric consultation. The patient is provided with a
      cooling-off period of several days. During the inclusion visit, the executive functions of
      the patient are assessed (WSCT, Stroop, TMT A and B and verbal fluency test). If 2
      pathological tests are found among all measured scores: administration of ISDC and EC2R
      (interview of the person accompanying) and planning of the first tDCS session 15 days later.
      If no pathological test is found : study exit.

      The treatment consists in 10 sessions of cathodal tDCS applied over the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at 2mA. Each session lasts 15 minutes. They are 2 sessions per day.

      Ten days after the end of tDCS treatment, patients are assessed for executive functions and
      behavioral dysexecutive functions (EC2R and ISCD).
