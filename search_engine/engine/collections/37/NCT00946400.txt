      often a difficult diagnosis to make, and its diagnosis is dependent upon both clinical and
      serologic criteria. Due to this ambiguity, increased testing and treatment may occur until
      serologic test results return. Recently, scoring tools have been developed to assist with the
      diagnosis of this disease. However, these scoring tools have yet to be validated. Thus, we
      plan to conduct a prospective, observational study to validate two scoring tools, the 4Ts and
      the Chong scale, in the diagnosis of HIT.

      In order to validate these scoring tools, two physicians will independently score the 4Ts and
      the Chong scale for all patients suspected of having HIT. These patients will be identified
      if a physician has ordered HIT antibody testing using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method.
      Confirmatory testing with a serotonin release assay (SRA) will also be performed.
