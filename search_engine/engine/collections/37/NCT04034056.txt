      combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated advanced FL patients, in the real world
      setting in Italy. The study will allow to collect real-life data in a significant number of
      Italian patients when compared to participants in pivotal studies of obinutuzumab and thus
      will allow to verify in routine practice (after physician hands-on) the effectiveness and
      safety management in 50 reference sites all over the country.
