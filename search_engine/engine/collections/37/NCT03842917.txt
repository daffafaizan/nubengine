      1 to 2 weeks before starting bevacizumab treatment, as part of standard treatment. They will
      finish the research at the end of the third infusion of bevacizumab.

      Patients will perform a home blood pressure self-measurement over three days and will collect
      urine over 24 hours prior to the start of each bevacizumab infusion at cycles 1, 2 and 3.
      Blood pressure measurements will also be performed during each bevacizumab infusion and blood
      tests will be performed before each infusion to measure the following biomarkers:

        -  Salt consumption as estimated by 24-hour natriuresis measured before each of the first 3
           infusions

        -  24 hours aldosterone excretion measured before the first and third infusions

        -  plasma methoxylated derivatives measured before the first and third infusions

        -  NTproBNP measured before the first and third infusions

        -  24 hours urinary free cortisol measured before the first and third infusions

        -  bevacizumab trough concentration measured before the first three bevacizumab infusion
