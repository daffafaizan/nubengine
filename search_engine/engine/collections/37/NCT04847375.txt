      pulmonary improvement; the latter being one of the most important applications of exogenous
      surfactant. In adults with underlying lung disease, especially Adult Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome (ARDS), there are controversial findings regarding the efficacy of surfactant.

      However, in a previous study, it was shown that surfactant in COVID-19 patients with
      pulmonary intubation improved pulmonary function and gas exchange and also, reduced patient
      mortality.

      However, none of the other repurposed drugs in COVID-19 have yet been able to prove
      significant effects in the treatment of patients; based on a recent study on more than 11000
      COVID-19 patients (i.e. the SOLIDARITY study).

      Due to the significant worldwide challnege with COVID-19, many efforts have been made in this
      regard, but the definitive cure has not yet been obtained, and therefore, efforts are being
      made to find an effective method to treat the disease and improve patients' symptoms;
      parallel to the efforts to increase the vaccination coverage.
