    
      A single group of thirty smokers will be recruited for the study to provide initial data to
      inform follow-up randomized controlled trials.

      Dependence and concurrent use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes will be assessed by a battery of
      self-report, biochemical, and behavioral indices. This is not a tobacco cessation study and
      there is no intent to use e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation treatment. Smokers will be
      asked to use the e-cigarettes instead of their regular cigarettes during the study.
      E-cigarettes will not be used for the purpose of reducing urges, withdrawal or nicotine
      dependence; and e-cigarettes will not be described or used as a medical device or therapy.

      Specific Aim 1: To assess the extent of switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes
      delivering nicotine along with NNTAs.

      Switching will be assessed by self-report diaries and by reductions in expired air carbon
      monoxide, an index of combustible cigarette use.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess the acceptability of e-cigarettes delivering nicotine along with
      NNTAs.

      Ratings of user satisfaction and other subjective effects will be collected from
      participants, for both their customary brand of cigarettes and the e-cigarette to be used.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the extent of dependence maintained during use of e-cigarettes
      delivering nicotine with NNTAs, as well as the relationship between dependence and
      self-reported use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
