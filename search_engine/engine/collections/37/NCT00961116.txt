      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of fenofibric acid and
      fenofibrate under fasting conditions. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of the study
      treatments will be evaluated. Fifty-four healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, 18-45 year old,
      male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each
      of two dosing regimens, fenofibric acid (Fibricor™) and fenofibrate (Tricor®) in sequence
      with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. On the morning of Day 1, after an
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either a single oral dose of the
      test formulation, fenofibric acid (1 x 105 mg tablet) or a single oral dose of the reference
      formulation, fenofibrate (1 x 145 mg tablet). After a 7 day washout period, on the morning of
      Day 8 after an overnight fast, subjects will receive the alternate regimen. Fasting will
      continue for 4 hours after each dose. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants
      before dosing and for 72 hours post dose at times sufficient to adequately define the
      pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid and fenofibrate. Subjects will be monitored throughout
      their participation for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures. Seated blood
      pressure and pulse will be measured prior to each dose and approximately 2 hours post-dose.
      All adverse experiences, whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or observed by
      clinic staff, will be documented in the subject's case report form.
