      vedolizumab. These investigational drugs were given along with standard of care checkpoint
      inhibitors ([nivolumab in Arms 1 and 2] or nivolumab + ipilimumab in Arm 3). This study
      looked at the safety profile of the combination treatments in each arm when administered to
      participants with metastatic melanoma.

      The study planned to enroll approximately 156 participants. Participants were assigned to one
      of the 3 treatment groups:

        -  TAK-580 + nivolumab

        -  TAK-202 (plozalizumab) + nivolumab

        -  vedolizumab + nivolumab + ipilimumab

      This study consists of 3 parts. A dose-escalation safety lead-in phase, confirmatory safety
      phase and a cohort expansion phase. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United
      States. The overall time to participate in this study is 50 weeks. Participants may make
      multiple visits to the clinic and 30, 60, and 90 days after last dose of study drug for
      follow-up assessments.
