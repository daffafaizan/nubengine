      and preliminary efficacy of EXP039 in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma. 10 patients are planned to be enrolled.

      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of EXP039. Following manufacture of the drug
      product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
      prior to EXP039 infusion. All subjects who have received EXP039 infusion will be followed for
      up to 12 months.
