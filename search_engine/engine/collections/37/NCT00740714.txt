      1,000,000 Americans. Currently there is no proven therapy to reduce the rate of progression
      of PD. In a previous phase II clinical trial, investigators demonstrated that Coenzyme Q10
      (CoQ) at dosages of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/day was safe and well-tolerated in individuals with
      early, untreated PD. The findings also suggested that CoQ may slow the progressive impairment
      of PD as measured by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

      In this study, researchers will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of
      CoQ to confirm and extend the results of the earlier phase II study. The primary objective of
      this trial is to compare the effect of two dosages of CoQ (1200 and 2400 mg/day) and placebo
      on the total UPDRS score in people with early PD. The study also will evaluate independent
      function, cognition, and quality of life. Plasma CoQ levels will be measured at months 1, 8
      and 16 and correlated with changes in UPDRS scores.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a placebo (an inactive substance), 1200
      mg/d CoQ, or 2400 mg/d CoQ. They will be evaluated at screening, baseline, and during visits
      at months 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Information gained from this trial could lead to changes in
      management of people with early PD.
