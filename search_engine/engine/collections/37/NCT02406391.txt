      care, the investigators will conduct interviews with patients seeking care for cervical
      cancer prevention at an inner city medical center. The investigators will ask questions
      related to previous screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices as well as barriers
      experienced in seeking such care. The investigators will also explore patients' level of
      resiliency and coping as predictors of adherence to timely care. Furthermore, among
      immigrants, questions about acculturation and discrimination will be asked. Additional
      measures of socioeconomic status, such as education, income and occupation will also be
      collected.
