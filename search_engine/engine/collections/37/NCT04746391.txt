      hemodialysis (HD) patients who experienced stable dialysis sessions during the last 4 weeks,
      and had no known coagulation disorder, active inflammation or malignancy. Double-needle
      vascular access is achieved through a native arterio-venous fistula or a well-functioning
      double lumen tunnelled central venous catheter. Patients are followed during 6 consecutive
      midweek dialysis sessions. At midweek, patients receive only 1/4th of their regular brand of
      Low-Molecular Weight Heparin anticoagulation at the beginning of the dialysis session. All
      test sessions are performed with blood flow at 300mL/min and dialysate flow at 500mL/min in
      post dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) mode (substitution flow 75mL/min). Ultrafiltration
      rates are set according to the patient's interdialytic weight gain and clinical status.

      Patients are randomized for hemodialyzer type and dialysis duration:

        1. ATA™ Solacea 19H - 60min dialysis

        2. ATA™ Solacea 19H - 120min dialysis

        3. ATA™ Solacea 19H - 240min dialysis

        4. polysulfone FX800Cordiax - 60min dialysis

        5. polysulfone FX800Cordiax - 120min dialysis

        6. polysulfone FX800Cordiax - 240min dialysis

      Just before the termination of the 6 experimental midweek sessions, blood is sampled from the
      inlet and outlet blood lines. Blood samples are immediately centrifuged and serum vials are
      stored at -80°C until batch analysis. Post dialysis, dialyzers are rinsed and dried and
      scanned with micro computed tomography (CT) to count the number of open fibers.
