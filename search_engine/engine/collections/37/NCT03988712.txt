      anaemia (IDA) to fast track colorectal cancer (FT CRC) clinics for further assessment and
      investigation, patients with other types of anaemia are still referred by primary care
      physicians in the UK. Investigators aim was to find out whether this practice is correct, or
      if it is causing an overburden on colorectal clinics and endoscopy services. Investigators
      also want to find out whether true/absolute IDA has a higher predictive value for diagnosing
      colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to other types of anaemia and specific bowel symptoms.

      Investigator's hypothesis was that patients with IDA are more likely to have CRC compared to
      patients with no anaemia or non-IDA anaemia. By confirming this hypothesis, Investigators can
      identify high risk patients from the population who can then be preferentially subjected to
      investigations mandated by guidelines. This strategy can help to increase the diagnostic
      yield of FT CRC clinics.

      A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2016-18 in a single busy district general
      hospital providing services to a population of 700,000 people.

      In the study, patients with true IDA (low MCV and ferritin) were found to be more likely to
      have CRC compared to any other type of anaemia which confirmed the latest guidelines for
      management of IDA. Compared to symptoms, only the presence of a mass on abdominal examination
      and rectal examination was found to be more likely associated with cancer.

      Physicians should be able to stratify patients based on blood indices when referring them to
      FT CRC clinics. Diagnostic yield of these clinics can be increased if clinicians strictly
      adhere to fast track guidelines and confirm true IDA before referring patients to clinic.
