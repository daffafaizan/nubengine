      acute respiratory failure, because of its remarkable tolerance (in comparison with NIV) and
      its physiological effects (nasopharyngeal dead space washout, positive end-expiratory
      pressure effect with possible alveolar recruitment, better matching with the patient's
      inspiratory flow, more reliable and adjustable FiO2); that together contribute to a reduction
      in respiratory workload and better oxygenation.

      Although many studies have investigated the clinical benefits of nasal high flow during acute
      hypoxemic respiratory failure, there are no data (and even less recommendations) on how to
      best conduct this technique, including its initiation and its weaning periods.

      Because different approaches exist among clinicians, investigators believe that a multicenter
      observational study that would collect data regarding the different ways high flow is
      conducted in patients with acute respiratory failure is necessary before performing an
      interventional study that would test and compare different strategies in order to answer the
      question: what are the best strategies (in terms of flow and FiO2 settings) to initiate and
      to wean high-flow oxygen therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure?

      Investigators will assess in a multicenter, observational study, the way clinicians use nasal
      high flow therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure in order to try identify one or
      more strategies that may be then compared in an interventional study.
