      admitted to hospital. There are also few registered cases of Legionnaires disease every year,
      compared to our neighbour countries.

      Therefore 500 patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted to Telemark hospital and
      Ostfold hospital in Norway will be tested by urin antigen test for the detection of
      Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We will also perform routine
      bacterial culture of sputum and culture on medium for isolation of Legionella species. A
      throat swab from the patients will be tested for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila
      pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis using PCR-techniques. Legionella-serology will also be
      performed. In addition all the included patients are invited to fill in a questionnaire in
      order to look for risk factors for developing community acquired pneumonia.
