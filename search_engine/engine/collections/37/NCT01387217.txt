      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending
      doses of GSK2018682. The study will also provide preliminary evidence of the potential
      therapeutic dose-range by measuring the inhibitory effect of GSK2018682 on total lymphocyte
      counts.
