      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. Current treatments for PTSD (which frequently
      co-occurs with depression) remain limited, with many patients remaining symptomatic despite
      single or combination administration of SSRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and
      sedatives/hypnotics. In addition, many patients treated for depression remain symptomatic.
      New interventions are thus urgently needed in PTSD with co-occurring depression to ensure
      optimal functional outcomes for our Service members and their families.
