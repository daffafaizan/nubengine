    
      This is a pilot study done in a single center (ISSSTE Regional Hospital, Puebla, Mexico).
      Consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were assigned, in an
      unblinded and non-randomized fashion, to receive either steroids plus CsA (intervention
      group) or steroids only (standard of treatment in this hospital, control group), as per
      individual clinical judgment. The primary outcome was the number of days to clinical
      improvement until hospital discharge or death. The secondary outcome was the improvement of
      patients, defined by the following parameters: lower oxygen requirements (2 liters per
      minute, or less), absence of fever by three consecutive days, respiratory rate <22, a
      decrease of 50% or more in the C reactive protein on admission, and length of hospital stay.

      Adult patients attending to the hospital between April 15, to May 31, 2020, fulfilling
      symptoms compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia, according to the WHO guidance, were invited to
      participate and all the patients gave their written informed consent.
