    
      A recent large multi-center national surveillance survey of almost 5000 nosocomial (hospital
      based) urine isolates from medical intensive care units demonstrated that fungi comprised
      nearly 40% of urine isolates. Little is known about distinguishing fungi that cause
      colonization from those causing infection.

      The objective of this study is to define the epidemiology of nosocomial funguria and natural
      history of patients that develop funguria while hospitalized.

      Patients who may have eligible for this study will be identified from microbiology laboratory
      specimens at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
