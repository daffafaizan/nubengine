      randomisation protocol receiving either a Fitmore short or a CLS straight stem. The short
      stem was assigned in 57 (37% females) cases and the straight stem in 83 (38% females) hips.
      Periprosthetic bone mineral density was measured before surgery, 7 days, 3, 12 and 60 months
      postoperatively, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the first
      postoperative measurement served as the baseline value. Because of the different length of
      the two prostheses we used adapted Gruen zones to divide the periprosthetic bone in seven
      regions of interest (ROI) with equal length in the proximal zones 1,2,6 and 7, only the
      regions 3 and 5 featured different sizes. Clinical results were recorded using the WOMAC and
      the Harris hip score (HHS).
