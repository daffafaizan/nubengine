    
      Different techniques will be used during this study :

      First, the FOT. The measurements will be performed using a Tremoflo-type (Thorasys Thoracic
      Medical System Inc.) device that generates an oscillating pressure waveform and measures
      impedance of the respiratory system and its components (resistance and reactance) as a
      function of frequency, as well as the respiratory system resonant frequency. Measurements
      will be performed during tidal breathing, the subjects breathing through the pneumotachograph
      of the system, with nose occluded, the cheeks supported by the hands (of the subjects or of
      an operator) to reduce the influence of the compliant upper airways. Three measurements of
      minimum 20 seconds duration will be recorded in the sitting position.

      Second, the spirometry. The measurements will be carried out using a Medisoft Exp'air type of
      equipment. The parameters will be successively measured in the sitting position :

        -  The inspiratory capacity (IC) will be measured by maximal inspiratory maneuver starting
           from the functional residual capacity

        -  The thoracic gas volume (TGV), total lung capacity (TLC), as well as the airway
           resistance will be measured by plethysmography

        -  The diffusion indices (CO transfer factor (DL,CO) and CO transfer coefficient (KCO))
           will be measured in apnea

        -  A spirometry will then be carried out. Three maneuvers with acceptability and
           reproducibility criteria will be performed

      All these measurements will be carried out before the administration of the bronchodilator
      and 30 minutes after the administration of the bronchodilator (4 puffs of DUOVENT HFA, using
      an inhalation chamber).
