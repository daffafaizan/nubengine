      Patients with UVFP may have significant impairment of vocal fold function, including a
      breathy paralytic dysphonia. There are several available approaches for the treatment of this
      condition. Vocal fold medialization is currently used by most otolaryngologists and is
      probably the standard of care for treating UVFP. An alternative approach is laryngeal
      reinnervation, which has a number of potential advantages over medialization but which
      requires several months before a final result is achieved. The primary goal of this
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial is to determine which approach produces a better
      outcome.

      Patients with UVFP meeting all inclusion criteria and released from therapy by a
      speech-language pathologist will be randomized into either the medialization arm or the
      reinnervation arm. The data collection protocol consists of voice recordings, aerodynamic
      measurements, electroglottography, videostroboscopy, and a clinical outcomes questionnaire
      collected pre-treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.
