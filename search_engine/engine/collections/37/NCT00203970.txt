    
      The design of our study is retrospective in nature. We are interested primarily in the use of
      LMWH in patients admitted to the general medicine services between January 1, 1997 and
      February 1, 2001 with a primary and secondary diagnosis related to Venous Thromboembolism,
      including specific ICD-9 codes.

      Using a data abstraction form, we gather the following information: 1) patient demographics,
      2) identity of the attending, resident, and interns caring for the patient, 3) whether the
      patient had any absolute or relative contraindications for receiving LMWH, as delineated by
      the DVT critical pathway, including insurance status and 4)how the patient was treated for
      his/her condition. To examine whether the identity of the primary care physician affects
      whether LMWH is given, we also collect the name of the primary care physician if it is listed
      on the chart.
