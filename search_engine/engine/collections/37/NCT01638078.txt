      restenosis in approximately 10% to 50% of cases.

      Stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction and inflammatory reactions, which in turn
      delay healing and endothelialization and may lead to restenosis and atherosclerosis within
      the stented segments.

      Indeed, experimental studies indicate a marked activation of inflammatory cells at the site
      of stent struts, which is likely to play a key role in the process of neointimal
      proliferation and restenosis. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor and interleukins 1 and 6 are
      powerful stimuli for smooth muscle cell proliferation.

      The sedative and antinausea drug thalidomide has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory
      and antioncogenic properties that could be of benefit in case of PCI with stenting.

      The primary objective of this study is to carry out a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of oral thalidomide on restenosis rate after
      successful stent implantation.
