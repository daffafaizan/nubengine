      transition participants.90 patients were randomly assigned to electro-acupuncture or sham
      electro-acupuncture group with a ratio of 1:1.During the whole process,all participants,
      evaluators and statisticians apart from acupuncturists remained strictly blinded.The changes
      of average 24 h hot flash scores of week8 from baseline was set as primary outcome. With
      statistical power of 90%, and a two-sided Î± at 0.05, as well as a drop-out rate less than
      20%, sample size was estimated at 90 participants. Data analysis was based on ITT principles,
      and 89 participants were included in data analysis(1 participant didn't want to
      participate).According to methods of LOCF, missing data were imputed to fill any gaps
      according to the last visit. For comparison between baseline and treatment (average 24h hot
      flash scores, MRS, hormone levels), data was tested by the t test or nonparametric test; for
      comparison between two independent samples, data were tested with t test, nonparametric test
      or X2 test. P<0.05 was regarded as statistically significance.
