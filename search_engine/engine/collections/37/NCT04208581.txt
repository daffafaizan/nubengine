    
      COPD is a highly prevalent disease, with a prevalence among people 40 years of age or older
      of 10.1% worldwide and 13.7% in China. COPD has become the third leading cause of death
      worldwide. COPD complicated by CRF is serious and has a high mortality rate. At present,
      ideal and effective treatment is inadequate. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has some
      potential in improving outcomes in COPD with CRF.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      effect of Yiqi Huoxue Huatan granule on reducing mortality and improving quality of life in
      COPD with CRF. After a 14-day run-in period, 372 subjects will be randomly assigned to
      treatment group or control group for 52-week treatment, followed by 52-week follow-up. The
      primary outcomes are all-cause mortality and frequency of acute exacerbation of COPD. The
      secondary outcomes include clinical symptoms, COPD assessment test (CAT), arterial blood gas
      analysis, pulmonary function and duration of mechanical ventilation. Safety will also be
      assessed.
