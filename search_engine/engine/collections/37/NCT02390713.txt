      of liver tumor. An hepatectomy that preserved a remnant liver volume < 0.5% of the body
      weight is associated with a very high risk of post-operative liver failure. In such
      situation, liver volume is not sufficient to support local hemodynamic consequences of the
      hepatectomy that is responsible of intrahepatic endothelial cell injury that impaired liver
      function and regeneration. To date, preoperative vein embolization (PVE) associated or not to
      liver transection (ALPSS procedure) that increased future remnant liver from 20% to 90% is
      the only method to prevent this complication. Even this preparation is necessary for the
      moment, PVE increased cancer cell proliferation and is associated with lower recurrence free
      survival than without PVE. Despite a potential PVE, POLF occurred in 5% to 7% after major
      hepatectomy and stayed the first cause of death after hepatectomy. It has been demonstrated
      that portal pressure superior to 20 mm Hg and/or porto-caval gradient superior to 12 mm Hg at
      the end of hepatectomy was associated to the occurrence of POLF. Aim to avoid this acute
      intra hepatic portal hypertension associated to major hepatectomy that is associated with an
      early liver endothelial cell injury, we had developed an silicon ring to dispose around the
      portal vein that contained an circular inflatable balloon to narrow precisely the portal vein
      lumen (MID-AVRTM).
