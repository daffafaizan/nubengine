      phase. Patients with relapsed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled in
      both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T
      cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product
      AUTO2. AUTO2 has a dual target BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) and TACI (Transmembrane
      activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor). Following
      pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO2 intravenously
      as a single or split dose and will then enter a 12-month follow-up period.
