        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and prednisone or
           methylprednisolone in patients with CD20-positive and Epstein-Barr virus-positive
           post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after solid organ transplantation.

        -  Determine the 2-year event-free survival, defined as alive and in continuous complete
           remission with a functioning original allograft, of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the PTLD gene expression profile by microarray analysis and fluorescent in
           situ hybridization in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the accrual rate of patients to this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone or
      methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days 1-5. During courses 1 and 2 only, patients also
      receive rituximab IV over 2-5 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression, a new primary or secondary malignancy,
      or unrelated disease.

      After finishing study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (50 with non-fulminant post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disease [PTLD] and 10 fulminant PTLD) will be accrued for this study
      within 2.5-3 years.
