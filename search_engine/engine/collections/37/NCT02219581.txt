      maximize patient comfort, but also to ensure optimal outcomes after surgery. This study is
      designed to assess whether the use of two small doses of intravenous (IV) steroids around the
      time of surgery decrease a patient's pain or use of pain medication. Secondly, the
      investigators will also determine if the use of these steroids as part of a multimodal pain
      management strategy leads to improved patient outcomes, including pain, nausea and vomiting,
      knee function and length of stay in the hospital after surgery. The study will compare the
      effect of two different doses of IV dexamethasone given preoperatively before TKA, when
      compared to placebo.
