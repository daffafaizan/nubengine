    
      It is planned to randomise approx. 284 subjects at approximately 130 study sites worldwide.
      Subjects with LTB-FL will be randomized to receive either DRL_RI or MabTheraÂ®. Till date, 68
      patients have been randomized for the study.

      The study specific objectives are mentioned below:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of DRL_RI (biosimilar rituximab) and MabThera in
           subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL, as measured by overall response rate (ORR) at Week
           28 Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of
           response (DOR) of DRL_RI with MabThera in subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL.

        -  To compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of DRL_RI with MabThera in
           subjects with CD20-positive, LTB-FL.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera, using a
           population-PK modelling approach.

        -  To explore the pharmacodynamic parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera.
