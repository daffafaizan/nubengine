      reduction after 15 seconds of hand rubbing has been recently shown to be non-inferior and
      shortening application time to 15 seconds has been suggested to improve the frequency of hand
      hygiene actions in a neonatal care unit. This study is to investigate that non-inferiority in
      terms of reduction of bacterial counts will be retained when combining the simpler three-step
      technique for the use of hand rub with a shorter application time of 15 seconds.
