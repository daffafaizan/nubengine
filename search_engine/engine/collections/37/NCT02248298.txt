      an excellent cosmetic outcome, and it could be considered the first-line therapy for Actinic
      keratosis (AK). In PDT incubation time is required so that the photosensitizer can be
      converted to PpIX. The recommended treatment regimen of PDT requires a relatively long
      incubation time with ALA (4 hours) and MAL (3 hours) before illumination. Theoretically,
      ablative fractional laser (AFL) pre-treatment may facilitate the penetration and distribution
      of topically applied drugs, since the ablated laser holes extend into the dermis, thereby
      possibly acting as channels for drug uptake. However, knowledge on the optimal
      photosensitizer incubation time for AFL-PDT is limited. The objectives of this study were to
      compare the efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic outcome, and safety between AFL-PDT with 2
      and 3hours of incubation vs. conventional MAL-PDT in patients with facial and scalp AK.
