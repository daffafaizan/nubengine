      will be collected by members of the Hematology Branch and the conditions under which the
      sampling will be performed. Samples of blood and bone marrow from healthy volunteers and from
      patients are indispensable for many research projects, including studies of normal and
      abnormal hematopoiesis, the viral etiology of blood diseases, and the role of the immune
      system in marrow failure and related conditions.
