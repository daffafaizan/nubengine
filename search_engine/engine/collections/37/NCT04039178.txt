      function of acute stroke patients.

      The BQ device (BrainQ Technologies Ltd., Israel), a Brain Computer Interface based
      stimulation device, uses machine learning tools to identify high resolution spectral patterns
      associated with motor functions in EEG measurements of healthy/non healthy subjects. These
      patterns are then translated into a tailored frequency dependent low intensity, non-invasive
      electro-magnetic treatment protocol.
