      of high-dose L-methylfolate in combination with bevacizumab at 10mg/kg IV every 14 days, a
      5-day regimen per month of temozolomide at 150 mg/m2/day and a 250 mg tablet of vitamin C.
      Dose escalation will involve 3 patients treated at each dose level of L-methylfolate (15mg,
      30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg), and the MTD will be confirmed by expansion of 3 additional patients.
      It is anticipated that 6 to 15 patients will be enrolled in the phase 1 part of the study.
      Patients will continue treatment until disease progression. Once the MTD of L-methylfolate
      has been determined, patients enrolled at a lower dose level may increase L-methylfolate dose
      to the MTD dose, per investigator discretion.

      The phase II part of the study will consist of patients taking the MTD of L-methylfolate
      daily in combination with bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg IV every 14 days, a 5-day regimen per month
      of temozolomide at 150 mg/m2/day and a 250 mg tablet of vitamin C. There will be 32 patients
      treated in the Phase II study and the patients will continue treatment until progression. The
