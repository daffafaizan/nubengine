      We aim to randomize 100 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We
      consecutively screen patients during the study enrollment period and seek informed consent
      from all eligible patients. In each patient, one saphenous vein graft (SVG) will be
      randomized to be the proximal segment, while another will be the distal segment as control.
      Healing of leg wounds will be assessed on day 6 post-operatively. Follow-up will be performed
      via face-to-face interview until at least 1 year after the operation by CT angiography.
