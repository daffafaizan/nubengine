      of a conditioned stimulus (CS) in the absence of an unconditioned stimulus (US, CS-noUS). The
      CS first elicits a behavioral response through excitatory learning - repeated pairing with
      the US that naturally elicits the same behavioral response (CS-US). One way that inhibitory
      learning can be maximized in exposure is by violating one's expectancy about CS-US
      relationship, such that the individual is surprised by the outcome (e.g., CS-noUS). The
      purpose of the present study is to evaluate the recommendation to avoid cognitive
      interventions before exposure. Specifically, the aim is to discover whether cognitive
      interventions before exposure prematurely reduce expected feared outcome ratings, leading to
      smaller expectancy violation and poorer inhibitory learning (i.e., exposure session or
      intervention gains) compared to conducting exposures with a consolidation period following
      exposure.
