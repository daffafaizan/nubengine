      neurological complications, a group of research hospitals are collaborating to track
      neurological outcomes. We know that COVID-19 can invade our nervous system, but little is
      known about the range of effects that COVID-19 might have on the brain. This study aims to
      gain real-time information about the neurological health of the U.S. population to advance
      knowledge of COVID-19.

      At the conclusion of the study, you will receive non-medical information on your brain
