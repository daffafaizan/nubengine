      control group for smoking cessation. The goal of this aim will be to compare the rates of
      point prevalence abstinence at the 6 month post-intervention follow-up. It is expected that
      smokers who receive the behavioral experience of the NRT In Vivo intervention will have
      higher rates of abstinence at the 6 month follow-up compared to the control group. Aim 2:
      Compare medication adherence between groups over the 12 week intervention. The goal of this
      aim is to determine the impact of the In Vivo behavioral experience intervention on promoting
      medication adherence to NRT. It is expected that individuals in the In Vivo NRT group will
      have better medication adherence relative to control participants. Exploratory: Examine
      moderators and mediators of the experimental intervention on smoking abstinence. The goal of
      this aim is to explore whether demographic and smoking characteristics (e.g., sex, race,
      nicotine dependence, motivational status, legal charges) moderate the effect of treatment on
      abstinence after 12 weeks of treatment and 6-month follow-up. In addition, we will look at
      changes in expectancies about NRT, medication adherence, and withdrawal symptoms to determine
      if these changes mediate the relationship between the experimental intervention and smoking
      abstinence.
