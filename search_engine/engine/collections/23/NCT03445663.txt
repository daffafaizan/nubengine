      AMG 424 while determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically active dose in
      subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate safety and tolerability of the AMG 424 MTD dose
      determined in Part 1, in groups of subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma that
      include those with high or low cytogenetic risk.
