      patient's respiratory needs with adequate ventilator settings is necessary to ensure a low
      work of breathing (WOB) and maximal patient comfort. The inspiratory rise time (IRT)
      determines the time to reach the selected airway pressure. A short IRT results in a high peak
      inspiratory flow and a short time to reach that peak, but is also associated with the
      development of turbulent flow, resulting in increased WOB. Aim of this study is to
      investigate the effects of different IRT settings on WOB and patient comfort during pressure
      support ventilation.

      Methods We will performed a prospective, single blind cohort study in patients on Pressure
      Support Ventilation. 10 healthy adult patients admitted to the ICU after elective facial or
      neck surgery will be included. All patients will be ventilated in pressure support mode using
      a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens. Elema, Solna, Sweden), with a positive end expiratory
      pressure of 5 cm H2O, pressure support level of 12 cm H2O above PEEP and an inspiratory
      oxygen fraction of 0.40. Patients have to be awake and cooperative (Ramsay 2). WOB will be
      measured with an esophageal balloon, and miniature flowmeter (Bicore system). Breathing
      comfort will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10. WOB and
      patient comfort will be measured (in random order) at 0, 5, and 10% IRT. For statistical
      analysis the two-way analysis of variance will used. A p value of < 0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant.
