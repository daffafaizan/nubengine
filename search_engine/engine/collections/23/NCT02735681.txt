      obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (o-MGD). It involves topical anesthesia of the eyelid
      margins and insertion of a 2 mm or 4 mm sterile, beveled, solid stainless steel probe at the
      slit lamp. Meibomian gland probing has been reported to alleviate symptoms (lid tenderness /
      lid margin congestion) of o-MGD (Maskin, 2010). It has also been shown to improve meibum
      lipid levels, viscosity, and tear breakup time (Nakayama, Kawashima, Kaido, Arita, & Tsubota,
      2015). Though probing has been investigated in a few small studies of o-MGD, only one small
      study of 10 participants has investigated meibomian gland probing in ocular rosacea (Wladis,
      2012). This study showed improvement in ocular surface disease index (OSDI, a standardized
      questionnaire assessing dry eye) but did not show objective improvement by way of examination
      findings or analysis of meibum (Wladis, 2012).

      In our study, Investigators intend to further investigate meibomian gland probing in
      participants with diagnosed ocular rosacea. Investigators hypothesize that after probing of
      one eye, Investigators will note improvements in participants symptoms as reflected in
      improvement in OSDI scores, Reductions in Inflamma-Dry measures (measure of matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP-9), an inflammatory marker elevated in tears of participants with dry
      eye), decreased tear fluid osmolarity, decreased meibum viscosity on expression . Objective
      improvement in lid margin disease (noting collarettes, pitting, telangiectasia of lid
      margins, thickening / irregularity of lid margins, lid margin tenderness; improvement in tear
      break up time (TBUT); and improvement in corneal fluorescein / lissamine green staining).
