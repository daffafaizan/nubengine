      removal improves outcome in patients with severe ARDS (PFs ≤ 200 and PEEP ≥ 10) compared to
      ventilation with a VT of 6 ml/kg PBW. The study will accrue a maximum of 230 patients over
      approximately 12-18 months.

      PRIMARY END-POINT: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) during the 28 days immediately after
      randomization

      SECONDARY END-POINTS: 28 and 90-day all-cause mortality; number of ICU-free days during the
      28 days immediately after randomization; cumulative incidence of: first episode of refractory
      hypoxemia (during 28 days after randomization), use of rescue therapies, first day that meet
      criteria for weaning, SOFA-free and severe adverse events.

      Patients in CONTROL will be treated according to a modified, simplified version of The
      ARDS-Network lung protective lower tidal volume. Patients in TREATMENT group will be treated
      according to the ARDS-Net protocol modified (VT reduced by 1 ml/kg PBW at intervals ≤ 2 hours
      until VT = 4ml/kg PBW and the use of low-flow CO2 removal with a Plateau Pressure Goal: ≤ 25
      cm H2O).
