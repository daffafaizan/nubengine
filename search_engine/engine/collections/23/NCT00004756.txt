    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      One group participates in an educational program administered and coordinated by a health
      educator. The program includes 1 or 2 educational sessions emphasizing practical advice, each
      lasting approximately 1.5 hours; social support from a patient-identified management partner;
      and behavioral reinforcement from health center staff, the patient partner, and written and
      audio materials.

      The control group receives patient educational materials consistent with usual care
      (pamphlets).

      Patients are followed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.
