      interviewing participants about their health/asthma. The information collected includes birth
      date, gender, ethnicity, height/weight, body mass index, medical history (smoking history and
      exacerbation history), current and past asthma related medications, and any recent test
      results available pertaining to blood work, lung function, allergen skin prick, and imaging.
      This information will be collected at the baseline visit, and then once a year at a follow up
      visit, for five years (total of five visits).

      Participants will be assigned a unique study number to protect the confidentiality of their
      personal health care information. All study data will be de-identified and then stored in a
      secure information management system, hosted at the study sponsor, Optimum Patient Care
      Global Limited in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Participant identities will always be kept
      confidential and will not be included in any research that is published. Data collected
      across the Canadian sites will be used to find ways to improve asthma treatments in Canada,
      to report on current patterns of managing severe asthma in Canada, to identify different
      sub-groups of severe asthma, and to carry out various medical research to understand asthma
      better and develop new treatments.

      Research records and health or other source records may be inspected in the presence of the
      Principal Investigator or by representatives of the University of British Columbia's Clinical
      Research Ethics Board for the purpose of monitoring the research. No information or records
      that disclose participants' identities will be published without subject consent, nor will
      any information or records that disclose participants' identities be removed or released
      without subject consent unless required by law.
