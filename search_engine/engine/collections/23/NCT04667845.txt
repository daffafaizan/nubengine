      lay-users for one cycle in their home environment. The home ovulation test to be used in the
      study is a digital home ovulation test used to detect luteinising hormone (LH) and
      Estrone-3-Glucuronide (E3G) in urine to identify when ovulation is imminent.

      A sample size of 120 volunteers (minimum) will provide adequate information for assessing the
      usability of the home ovulation test. Usability of the test will be assessed through a
      questionnaire completed at the end of the study.

      This observational study will be conducted remotely and volunteers representative of the
      intended user (lay-users) will be recruited.
