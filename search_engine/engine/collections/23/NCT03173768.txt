      period), in which the intravenous antibiotics at hospital discharge were prescribed by the
      primary care team. The post-intervention period was started from May 1, 2016 to February 28,
      2017 (10-month period), in which the intravenous antibiotics at hospital discharge were
      reviewed and intervened by ID team.

      The appropriateness of intravenous antibiotics was assessed separately by the ID fellow and
      ID specialist. If disagreement occurred, the feedback to the ID fellow was performed and the
      decision by ID specialist was used in the final analysis of appropriateness.

      In post-intervention period, ID fellow modified the intravenous antibiotics ordered by the
      primary team if those intravenous antibiotics were judged as inappropriate by ID fellow as
      follows: 1) discontinue intravenous antibiotics (treatment was complete), 2) switch to oral
      antibiotics, 3) change intravenous antibiotics to cover isolated pathogens, 4) adjust the
      dose of intravenous antibiotics, and 5) change the duration of intravenous antibiotics

      Finally, ID specialist retrospectively assessed the appropriateness of intravenous
      antibiotics at hospital discharge managed by ID fellow in post-intervention period.
