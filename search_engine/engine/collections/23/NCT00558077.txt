      be enrolled and randomized into two groups of treatment of 25 subjects each. Group A will
      undergo diagnostic laparoscopy followed by metformin plus CC, whereas group B will undergo
      LOD followed by observation. Anovulatory patients will receive IM progesterone. The treatment
      will be of six months followed by nine-month of observation for pregnant patients. The
      incidence of spontaneous menses, and the pregnancy, abortion, and live-birth rates will be
      recorded.
