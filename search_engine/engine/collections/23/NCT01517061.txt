      The proposed clinical trial will investigate the role of the human genome including genetic
      variations and gene expression profiles on the development of phantom limb pain (PLP).

      Study population:

      Patients will be recruited from military personnel with major limb amputations. A total of
      one thousand subjects with upper or lower extremity amputations of any level will be enrolled
      in this study.

      Design:

      Eight hundred subjects with chronic PLP (PLP patient) and 200 patients without PLP (non-PLP
      patient) will assess the severity of their pain symptom. Each participant will undergo a
      routine blood draw from which DNA and RNA will be harvested.

      Outcome measures:

      Using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 technology, which identifies up to 1 million single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 million copy number variations in the human genome, the
      differences in genomic variations between the PLP and the non-PLP patients will be analyzed.
      An extreme subset of PLP patients will be tested for their quantitative sensory function and
      profiled gene expression and epigenetic pattern with the Affymetrix Human Exon ST 1.0 and
      Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. These integrative genomic analyses using genetic variations,
      gene expression and epigenetic profile could explain why some amputees experience chronic PLP
      and some do not. By studying these responses in patient samples, we will evaluate the role of
      genomic factors in PLP. SNP frequencies, gene expression and epigenetic profiles between PLP
      and non-PLP groups will be analyzed.
