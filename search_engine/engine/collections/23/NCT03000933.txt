    
      HYPER-2, will be a cross-section study, using the same recruitment and testing strategies
      used in HYPER 1, which determined the prevalence of anal, genital and oral HPV among men who
      have sex with men aged 16-20 years. Given the differing age groups that will have been
      offered vaccination over the 2 study period, men aged 16-19 will be recruited in the first
      year (2017) and men aged 16-20 will be recruited in the second year (2018) to ensure that the
      participants included in the HYPER-2 study would have been eligible for the free male HPV
      vaccine in Australia. A total of 200 men will be recruited over a 2-year period, and HPV
      vaccination status for each participant will be verified against the National HPV Vaccination
      Program Register.

      This 2-year cross-sectional study will recruit men who report sex with men aged from 16 to 20
      years.
