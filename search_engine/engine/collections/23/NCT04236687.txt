      prostatic hyperplasia that are treated with prostatic artery embolization (PAE) or with
      Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). For PAE a catheter is placed in the
      prostate artery, a fluid containing thousands of tiny particles (microspheres) is injected
      through the catheter into these small arteries which nourish the prostate. The injected
      microspheres will slow the blood flow to the prostate. For HoLEP a Holmium laser will be used
      to enucleate the prostatic hyperplasia trough the urethra. Clinical follow-up include
      clinical visit after 1, 6 and 12 months. Acute as well as long term complications will be
      recorded. The patients fill in the questionnaires for urologic disease. Urodynamic
      examination will record functional outcome.
