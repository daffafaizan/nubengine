      immunomodulatory steps. The first is the innate immune local tumor killing induced by
      intratumoral Hiltonol (via NK, TNF, etc). A very close second step is optimal Th1-weighted
      priming through the in-situ combination of the poly-ICLC danger signal with the tumor
      antigens released in step 1 and further processed and cross-presented by poly-ICLC activated
      mDC, etc. The repeated administration of the Hiltonol danger signal IT in the context of the
      patient's own tumor antigens and in a way that mimics a natural viral infection may be
      critical to this step. Once the system is optimally primed, the third step is targeting and
      maintenance of the immune response and its facilitation at remote tumor sites with IM
      poly-ICLC through chemokine release, inflammasome activation and other costimulatory factors.
