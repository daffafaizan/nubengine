    
      Between four (4) months and 14 months after receiving a kidney transplant and, per standard
      of care (SOC), having been placed on an immediate-release (IR) tacrolimus immunosuppressant
      regimen, participants in this study will undergo cognitive and motor function testing and
      have a blood sample collected (BASELINE). Half of the participants will then be randomly
      converted to extended-release (XR) tacrolimus (Envarsus® XR) while the other half will remain
      on IR tacrolimus for the duration of the study. Both the IR and XR groups will repeat the
      cognitive and motor function testing and have a blood sample collected at 6, 12, and 24 weeks
      Post-BASELINE. A practice version of the cognitive and motor function tests will be
      administered no more than 60 days prior to the baseline visit (Pre-BASELINE). Alternate
      versions of the cognitive and motor tests will be used at each Post-BASELINE testing session
      to control for possible practice effects.

      The primary objective is to compare the effect of treatment with an immediate-release
      tacrolimus to an extended-release tacrolimus (i.e., Envarsus® XR) immunosuppressive regimen
      on cognitive and motor function in kidney transplant recipients.

      The secondary objective is to determine the factors that explain inter-individual variability
      in cognitive response. Pharmacokinetic and demographic factors will be explored. Variability
      in cognitive response between individuals can be large. A population approach (nonlinear,
      mixed effects) will be used. Measurement of drug concentration will be the dependent
      variable.
