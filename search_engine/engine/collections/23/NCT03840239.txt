      radiotherapy, followed by total mesorectal excision.

      A new concept suggests organ preservation as an alternative to rectal excision in good
      responders after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to decrease surgical morbidity and increase
      quality of life.

      The rational is the fact that 15%-20% of patients have sterilized tumours after
      chemoradiotherpay for locally advanced rectal cancer. As compared to capecitabine alone,
      oxaliplatin and more intensified chemotherapy have been shown to increase tumor regression in
      the neoadjuvant chemoradiation setting. Meanwhile, prolong of time interval from the end of
      radiotherapy to assessment of tumor response could further increase pathologic complete
      response rate and complete clinical response rate.

      The objective of this trial is to increase the proportion of sphincter preservation rate for
      distal rectal cancer patients by optimizing tumour response. The investigators expect to
      increase chance of organ preservation rate by using total neoadjuvant treatment regimen as
      compared to conventional chemoradiotherapy alone.
