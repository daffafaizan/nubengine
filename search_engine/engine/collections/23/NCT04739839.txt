      to be clarified, why some individuals develop severely disabling low back pain while others
      never experience noteworthy back pain.

      There is no evidence that numbers of chronically affected individuals have diminished;
      rather, the incidence of LBP has increased continuously over the last 20 years, which is also
      reflected in rising numbers of lumbar surgical treatments and rising costs due to health care
      expenses and sick leave. Hence, prevention of LBP in the working population seems more urgent
      than ever.

      As LBP is undoubtedly a multifaceted disorder that tends to fluctuate throughout life, there
      is a need for longitudinal research, exploring the effect of both lifestyle and psychosocial
      factors on the development of chronic low back pain.

      The main aims of this study is to identify the prevalence of low back pain and identify
      whether a history of low back pain during adolescence represents an increased risk of
      experiencing low back pain later in life.
