    
      Each patient will commence the study with a one month run-in period in which he/she will be
      administered individual patient Standard of Care :anti-histamines and steroids as needed plus
      placebo (olive oil).

      At the end of the one month run-in period, all trial subjects will continue on individual
      Standard of Care plus increasing doses of CBD during the first six weeks of the study. Dosage
      of CBD will start at 25 mg twice daily and will be increased once every 14 days, if no side
      effects are observed, to 50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day and finally to 150 mg twice a
      day CBD respectively. Treatment will be given with food.

      At the conclusion of the six weeks CBD dose escalation segment of the study, if the 300 mg
      CBD dose level is deemed safe for two weeks with standard of care doses of anti-histamines,
      patients will continue receiving 300 mg CBD with Anti-histamines as needed for an additional
      follow-up period of three months. In the case of flare, the patient will be treated with
      higher dose of Anti-histamines and Steroides if needed in addition to CBD. Once the flare has
      been brought under control, then another attempt will be made to discontinue the steroids and
      continue treating with CBD + Anti-histamines only. Each patient will serve as his/her own
      control.

      Laboratory studies will be carried out at the beginning of the study (baseline), and then on
      a monthly basis until the end of the study.

      Adverse events will be continuously assessed throughout the study
