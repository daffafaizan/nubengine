    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of one year progression-free survival (PFS) when hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate (hydroxychloroquine) or placebo is added to dabrafenib mesylate (dabrafenib) and
      trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide (trametinib) in advanced BRAFV600E/K melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the PFS of both arms. II. To evaluate the best overall response rate by
      treatment arm. III. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate by treatment arm. IV. To
      evaluate the adverse event rate by treatment arm. V. To evaluate overall survival (OS) by
      treatment arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive dabrafenib mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib
      dimethyl sulfoxide PO once daily (QD), and hydroxychloroquine sulfate PO BID on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive dabrafenib mesylate PO BID, trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide PO QD, and
      placebo PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
