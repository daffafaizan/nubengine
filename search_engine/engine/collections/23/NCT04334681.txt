      Limberg flap method after the Rhomboid excision due to pilonidal disease, and those operated
      with the un-roofing curettage method will be screened retrospectively. Patients who are well
      followed up will be included in the study. Demographic features will be recorded. Patients
      will be divided into two groups, the un-roofing curettage group (UC group) and the Modified
      Limberg Flap group (LF group). Surgery time, hospital stay, return to work time, recovery
      time, painless walking time, days, painless sitting time in the toilet, days, postoperative
      VAS, and recurrence will be compared between both groups. In addition, mobilization time,
      days, recovery time, days, exclusion time, days, wound infection, wound distribution will be
      compared between groups. The results will be analyzed with the SPSS statistics program.
      Factors affecting recurrence wound infection, recovery time, hospital stay, operation time,
      early mobilization will be evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression
      analysis.
