      structures while Positron emission tomography (PET) scans allow for the observation of
      molecular and cellular activities. Using a PET/MRI in patients with vascular injury post
      intervention with help evaluate the vascular inflammatory and resolution response in vivo.

      Acute vascular injury through endovascular intervention results in recruitment of
      inflammatory cells such as macrophages to the vessel wall. Macrophages are very metabolically
      active and consume glucose at a high rate. In PET/MRI, subjects are injected with
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), a radioactively labeled glucose molecule which is consumed
      by macrophages.

      When 18F-FDG is consumed, it is retained within macrophages more avidly than other
      atherosclerotic lesion elements. Thus, FDG-PET provides a unique and noninvasive approach to
      quantitatively measure macrophage activity at the intervention site.

      This study will provide key pilot data for developing an imaging surrogate endpoint for
      pro-resolving mediator treatment intervention trials going forward.
