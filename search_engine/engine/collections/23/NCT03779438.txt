      placenta previa.

      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for
      Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) both recommend the use of 17-OHPC to prevent recurrent
      spontaneous preterm birth.

      Preterm deliveries account for 75% of perinatal mortality and surviving preterm infants are
      at risk for neurological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal complications. So, it is
      therefore very important to try to prolong the pregnancy without increasing the risk of
      emergent delivery in cases with placenta previa. The authors hypothesized that a
      pharmacological strategy like 17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate may improve pregnancy
      outcomes and may also allow obstetricians to tailor their approach to save delayed scheduled
      cesarean section women with a placenta previa.

      The aim of this study to evaluate the role of17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the
      prevention of preterm cesarean delivery (CD) in cases with symptomatic placenta previa with
      avoids of an emergent CD which affects the maternal outcome and prevents prematurity which
      affects the prenatal outcome.
