    
      Controlled, randomized, split-face study in which subjects receive JUVÉDERM™ Injectable Gel
      with Lidocaine (Ultra or Ultra Plus) in one nasolabial fold and JUVÉDERM™ Injectable Gel
      without Lidocaine (Ultra or Ultra Plus) in the other nasolabial fold. The investigator
      determines whether the subject receives JUVÉDERM™ Ultra or Ultra Plus per the level of
      correction desired; the lidocaine assignment is randomized.
