      Stanford-Asian Pacific Program in Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe) is an
      international genetic study, which intends to map the major genetic loci underlying
      hypertension in sibpairs of Asian-Pacific Chinese and Japanese origin.

      Success in genetic studies may depend on many factors including the selection of the patient
      population, the identification of intermediate phenotypes, the disease subsets, and the
      genetic strategy and methodologies employed.

      In order to reduce heterogeneity of the genetic and environmental background, we will focus
      our investigation on the Chinese population. Furthermore, besides the variables associated
      with insulin resistance, which were collected and studied in year 1 through 5 of SAPPHIRe,
      some more variables from echocardiographic examination and multi-detector row computed
      tomography (MDCT) will be collected and studied.

      Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infraction and renal disease.
      Hypertension often occurs in combination with other metabolic complications such as
      hyperlipidemia, obesity and insulin resistance. The combined disorder is often called the
      metabolic syndrome.

      Our general approach is to continue analyzing candidate genes as well as perform a complete
      genome search based on the exiting genome-wide scan data together with old and new phenotype
      variables. Our objective is to identify susceptible gene for hypertension through
      incorporating intermediate phenotypes and to find gene markers for developing useful
      screening tools for the high risk group in order to prevent or early detect cardiovascular
      disorder patients.
