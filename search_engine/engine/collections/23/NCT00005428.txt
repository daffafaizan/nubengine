      Given recent advances in the analyses of genetic epidemiologic data, the database presented a
      unique opportunity to address timely issues pertinent to the contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors to individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Secondary data analyses were performed on family data obtained in an ongoing hypertension
      genetic study conducted at the University of Utah with Roger R. Williams as principal
      investigator. The available data represented one of the largest studies of cardiovascular
      reactivity among genetically related individuals. During 1981-83, a total of 2,548 subjects,
      members of 98 extended families (multiple generations and multiple nuclear families)
      participated in an extensive cardiovascular examination and were assessed on a comprehensive
      battery of cardiovascular tests. Annual follow-up questionnaires obtained information about
      the onset of hypertension and new medication prescribed. In 1991-92, a follow-up exam was
      conducted on 1,500 subjects.

      The data analysis attempted to confirm or refute hypotheses postulating a
      reactivity-hypertension association; investigated whether there was a sex limitation in the
      genetic and environmental determinants of reactivity; explored genotype-by-age interactions
      in the control of reactivity;and determined whether there was shared genetic and/or
      environmental variance between reactivity and other recognized cardiovascular risk factors
      such as obesity or lipids.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
