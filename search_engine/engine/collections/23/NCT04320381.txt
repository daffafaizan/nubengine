      burden for many people with CF (PwCF). Newly developed triple combination CFTR modulator
      therapy (TCT) has shown dramatic health benefits on top of standard CF therapies in a pivotal
      clinical trial and will soon be a treatment option for a larger population of PwCF.
      Widespread implementation of TCT will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously
      study whether PwCF can safely discontinue some previously prescribed daily therapies. The
      randomized, open-label SIMPLIFY study has been designed to test the hypothesis that
      withdrawal of dornase alpha and/or nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) is not inferior to
      continuation of one or both treatments with respect to short-term change in lung function. As
      this is the first of its kind study design in CF, it unknown how people with CF thinking
      about withdrawal studies or discontinuing treatments.

      Here, the investigators intend to conduct a qualitative interview study that complements the
      SIMPLIFY protocol in which the investigators aim to assess the experiences of PwCF
      participating in a treatment withdrawal study. In particular, the investigators will examine
      post-hoc the beliefs and opinions of a representative subgroup of SIMPLIFY participants about
      treatment withdrawal research and perceived treatment burden. This qualitative study will
      provide the opportunity to learn about behaviors after the SIMPLIFY trial, including
      restarting vs. continuing to maintain medications, withdrawing other medications or
      therapies, and how patients and families partner with care teams around these decisions.
      Through these interviews, the investigators will learn how individuals with CF perceive
      taking part in a drug withdrawal study and how participants discern treatment assignment.
