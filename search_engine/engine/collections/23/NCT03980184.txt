      specific aims: (1) assess GUA's target engagement of drug craving and cognitive flexibility
      in a laboratory challenge session and in a 10-week outpatient clinical study, (2) demonstrate
      target validation by showing that reduced drug craving and improved cognitive flexibility
      will predict lower drug use outcomes during the 10-week clinical trial in SUD women, and
      finally, (3) evaluate data replication and scalability of GUA target effects across two
      clinical sites (Yale and SUNY-Stony Brook).
