      receive a 15-gram test dose, and a maximum of 3 cycles, each composed of 4 doses of high-dose
      ascorbic acid (HDAA) and 2 doses of melphalan. This study will enroll 9 patients with
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. The starting dose of ascorbic acid will be 50 grams.
      Using a 3+3 dose escalation, the dose will potentially increase to 75 grams then 100 grams.
