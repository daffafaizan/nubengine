      Children's manual skills classified with MACS. To assess the quality of the upper extremity,
      the Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test (QUEST) which assessed four areas including
      dissociated movement, grasp, weight bearing and protective extension, was used. Upper
      extremity functions were assessed using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT). The
      Selective Control of Upper Extremity Scale (SCUES) was used to evaluate the selective
      movements of the upper extremity. The SCUES evaluates the movement of the trunk during the
      upper limb movements and mirror movements via video recording.
