      for participants who failed prior therapy with a grazoprevir regimen. Participants with CKD
      enrolled from MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) will continue enrollment regardless of prior
      treatment-response and remain in this study for five years, while participants enrolled from
      all other studies with HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be
      discontinued and end their participation after the next scheduled visit. In addition,
      participants who receive other HCV treatments concurrent with this follow-up study or
      received other HCV treatments prior to this study will be discontinued and their data
      excluded from analysis.

      As of Amendment 04, the protocol has been updated to include enrollment of pediatric
      participants from protocol MK-5172-079 (NCT03379506). Enrollment is limited to participants
      who experienced virologic failure associated with 1 or more treatment-emergent resistant
      associated substitutions (RASs) present at 12 weeks after receiving grazoprevir treatment in
      prior treatment study MK-5172-079 (NCT03379506).
