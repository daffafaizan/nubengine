    
      This is an expanded access-physician sponsored trial of PF-03084014, a novel gamma-secretase
      inhibitor being developed for cancer therapy. This trial is designed for patients who have
      been on a previous Industry-sponsored phase I trial using PF-03084014 for> 1 year. The study
      is designed to evaluate the safety of prolonged oral administration of single agent
      PF-03084014. There are two study subjects with desmoid tumor who have been on the trial for a
      prolonged period of time (54 and 77 months, respectively) with either stable disease or
      response, indicating significant clinical benefit for a patient population in which there are
      few options. The goal of this protocol is to allow these subjects, who are clearly benefiting
      from PF-03084014, to continue to receive it
