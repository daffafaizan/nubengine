      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate (complete remission, partial remission [PR], or
           nodular PR) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
           (CLL) treated with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR) followed by
           CAMPATH-1H .

        -  Determine the presence of minimal residual disease in patients treated with this regimen
           who achieve a CR or nPR

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Evaluate the number of patients who after PCR (or during PCR for PD), only achieve a PR,
           SD, or PD and who subsequently convert to a higher response category after CAMPATH-1H .

      Exploratory

        -  Assess the angiogenic profile (i.e., secretion levels of pro- versus anti-angiogenic
           molecules) of CLL B cell clones as well as bone marrow angiogenesis (i.e., vascular
           density by immunohistochemistry) at baseline, after PCR, after CAMPATH-1H, every six
           months (serum only), and at time of response assessment (marrow).

        -  Determine the V_H gene mutation status and CD38 expression of the B-CLL clones at study
           entry and at the end of the therapy and assess the association between the VH gene
           mutation status and CD38 expression and clinical outcome.

        -  Determine surface phenotype (by flow cytometry) and genetic defects (by CLL FISH panel)
           information on CLL-B cell clones and associate with clinical outcome.

        -  Monitor the T-cell status by repertoire and flow cytometry analysis to determine the
           nature and extent of T-cell deficiency induced by the PCR and CAMPATH-1H treatment and
           assess any association with clinical outcome and toxicities.
