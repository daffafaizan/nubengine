      over the last years and has enabled occupational therapists to work more efficiently,
      minimizing costs and time for analysis, management, and design of activities.

      Objective. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of cognitive
      intervention using the web platform Neuronup in a group of elderly subjects; the study is
      based on the dependent variables (memory, attention, and language) analyzed with the
      abbreviated Barcelona Test.

      Subjects and Methods. Aquasi-experimental design was carried out with subjects assigned to
      two groups: a control group (20 subjects) and an experimental group (20 subjects). The
      abbreviated Barcelona Test was administered to assess patients before and after the
      intervention with this software to draw conclusions.

      Results. Analyses of variance (ANOVA), analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), and multivariate
      analyses of variance (MANOVA) were perfomed in the memory, orientation, reading, and language
      domains. Statistically signifcant differences were recorded in all domains except language
      where scores remained the same.

      Conclusion. It has been demonstrated that Neuronup is an effective program for improving
      cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and orientation in older adults, hence it
      would be beneficial to implement technology-based treatments conducted by specialized
      professionals.
