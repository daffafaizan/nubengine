    
      The primary objectives is to estimate the event-free survival (EFS) at one-year
      post-transplant for research participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using single unit umbilical cord blood (UCB).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  Describe the clinical outcome of patients undergoing a double unit UCBT.

        -  Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease
           (GVHD) of patients enrolled in the research arm.

        -  Estimate the incidence and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment among patients
           enrolled in the research arm.

        -  Estimate the incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) and transplant related
           morbidity in the first 100 days after transplantation among patients enrolled in the
           research

      Exploratory Objectives are:

        -  Assess the relationship between pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) with
           transplant outcomes.

        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative
           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and spectratyping.
           Immunophenotyping and functional assays of T, B and NK cells and lymphocytes will also
           be evaluated.

        -  Evaluate the determinants of engraftment.
