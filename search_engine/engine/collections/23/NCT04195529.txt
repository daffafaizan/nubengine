    
      The primary outcome is to determine the association between specific phenotypic
      characteristics of osteochondrosis, in particular linked to osteo-cartilaginous degeneration,
      with the identified vitamin D receptor genotypes.

      The secondary outcomes are to evaluate the circulating levels of the osteo-cartilage
      degradation markers, of the vitamin D and to evaluate the association of the osteochondrosis
      phenotype with variants in genes involved in inflammatory processes.
