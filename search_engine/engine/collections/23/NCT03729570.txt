      areas, addressing known barriers of transportation, access to providers, and privacy, is most
      likely to yield high levels of PrEP initiation and persistence in care. The study sites are
      Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Mississippi.

      Using a smartphone application (app), participants assigned to the intervention will receive
      and maintain a PrEP prescription without needing to leave their home (excepting pharmacy
      pick-up in some cases) - achieved through app-based surveys/screenings, telemedicine
      consultations, and home specimen self-collection.
