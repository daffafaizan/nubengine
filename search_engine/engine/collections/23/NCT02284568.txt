    
      Due to serious cardiovascular adverse events, Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) made a
      recommendation to stop all laquinimod treatment arms above 0.6 mg in the multiple sclerosis
      (MS) trials; therefore the 1.5 mg treatment arm in the ARPEGGIO study was discontinued as of
      01 January 2016.

      The DMC did not identify any definite cardiovascular risk in the 0.6 mg treatment arm, but
      felt that long term monitoring for emergence of any potential signal was necessary.
      Therefore, the 0.6 mg treatment arm was continued while the sponsor closely monitored
      cardiovascular events in all laquinimod studies. Prior to 01 January 2016, eligible patients
      were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of the following treatment arms (a total of 286
      patients were randomized 1:1:1 prior to

      01 January 2016):

        -  Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily

        -  Laquinimod 1.5 mg daily

        -  Daily placebo

      As of 01 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm,
      additional eligible patients (87 patients) who were enrolled were randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      into one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily

        -  Daily placebo
