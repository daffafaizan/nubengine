    
      HMPL-306 is a dual IDH1/2 inhibitor

      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of HMPL-306 administered orally in treatment
      of subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory, or resistant hematological malignancies that
      harbor IDH mutations (or co-mutations).

      The study consists of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose-expansion part
      (Part 2). The dose-escalation part will determine the MTD/R2PD. The dose-expansion part will
      administer the MTD/RP2D to subjects with mIDH-positive hematological malignancies including,
      but not limited to, AML, MDS/MPN, AITL.
