      facilities. Investigators will work with the exercise sites to recruit up to 125 individuals
      (5 per exercise site location) to serve as the Group leaders at each site location. Group
      leaders will be trained on the exercises and leadership roles to help lead the group. The
      investigators will ask them to come at least once per week, so the time commitment is
      minimal.

      The investigators will be recruiting 1130 patients who have suffered a fragility fracture and
      will randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (A) Control Group - Enhanced Usual Care
      and (B) Intervention Group - Enhanced usual care plus Exercise coaching that includes
      in-person and phone coach contacts to encourage and support strength, balance and walking
      activities.
