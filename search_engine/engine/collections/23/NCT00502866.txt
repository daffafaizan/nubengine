      pediatricians in the Puget Sound area and at the University of Washington and Children's
      Hospital and Regional Medical Center. The network has extensive experience in conducting
      large studies on contentious issues that are pertinent to children, their parents, and
      primary care providers. In 2004, vitamin D supplementation was recommended for all
      exclusively breastfed infants. This recommendation was based on sporadic reports over the
      last 30 years of vitamin D deficient rickets in infants and toddlers who have been
      exclusively breastfed. The recommendation has been controversial because it might undermine
      efforts to promote breastfeeding, and because the prevalence of rickets in these patients is
      unknown. PSPRN proposes to conduct a preliminary study to determine the feasibility of a
      larger planned project by the network to determine the prevalence of rickets in breastfed
      infants and toddlers who do not receive supplemental vitamin D. Systematic surveys will be
      conducted in PSPRN practices to determine current levels and trends in vitamin D
      supplementation. Current practices of PSPRN pediatricians regarding supplementation, and
      their effect on parents, will also be assessed. The utility of a serum alkaline phosphatase
      level as a screening test for vitamin D deficient rickets will be determined in the proposed
      study by obtaining levels on approximately 300 patients, 6-15 months old, seen by PSPRN
      practitioners, who have been breastfed. In addition to assessing possible methodologies for
      the larger project, the preliminary study is designed to yield standalone results with
      important implications.
