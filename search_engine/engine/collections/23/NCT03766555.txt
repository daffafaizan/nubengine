      with increasing frequency because of the wider implementation of screening programs. Whether
      liver resection or local ablation should be the first-line treatment in early HCC remains a
      hot topic for debate. Both are regarded as acceptable curative treatment for early HCC in
      many international guidelines. Underlying liver function is the key in treatment selection.
      The general consensus is that liver resection should be the treatment of choice in patients
      with good liver function while local ablation should be considered in patients with poor
      liver function. There exists a group of patients with apparently good liver function that
      harbor significant liver cirrhosis which is not easily picked up by the current assessment or
      scoring systems. Liver resection in this group of patients is burdened by potentially
      life-threatening complications and the overall survival is limited by their underlying liver
      cirrhosis. This is particularly important in early HCC as local ablation is another curative
      treatment option. In order to improve the prognosis of patients with early HCC, it is
      important to identify (1) patients with liver dysfunction to the extend that the risk of
      liver resection will outweigh the survival benefit it provides; (2) the best ablative method
      for HCC.

      The investigators propose to carry out a prospective randomized controlled study to compare
      the treatment outcome of microwave ablation with liver resection in patients with borderline
      liver function whose HCC that are amendable to both liver resection and microwave ablation.
