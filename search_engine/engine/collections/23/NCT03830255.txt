      organ transplant recipients to prevent and treat allograft rejection.They both exert their
      immunosppressive action by inhibiting the calcinurein in T-lymphoctes.
      Subsequently,Cyclosporin and tacrolimus are both metabolic substrates for cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 3A enzymes - in particular, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 - and are transported out of cells by the
      P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) efflux pump. Different expression of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and P-glycoprotein
      causes patient to-patient variability in the absorption, metabolism and tissue distribution
      of calcineurin inhibitors. This different expression is likely to be at least partially the
      result of mutations in the genes encoding for these enzymes and drug transporter. This may
      lead to variable drug concentrations within the systemic circulation and at target sites,
      influencing drug efficacy. Moreover, it will influence the individual's susceptibility to
      drug interactions and drug toxicity
