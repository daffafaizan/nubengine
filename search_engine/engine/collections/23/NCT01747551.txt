      person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs).
      These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer
      tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blood vessels and oxygen to grow.
      Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody, a "targeted therapy" called a "VEGF Trap", that "traps"
      (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow. Ziv-aflibercept has
      recently been approved by the FDA for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.
      Patients who received standard 5-fluoruracil based chemotherapy pus ziv-aflibercept lived
      significantly longer than those patients who received standard 5-fluoruracil alone.

      The study was designed to have an 80% power, at a 0.20 significance level, to detect a
      difference in 6-month progression-free survival of 15%, between 65% and 50%. A one-sided log
      rank test was utilized and all patients treated with at least one dose of mFOLFOX6 and
      ziv-aflibercept/placebo were included in the statistical analysis.
