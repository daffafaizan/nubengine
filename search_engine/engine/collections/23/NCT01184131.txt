      collection, nine months for the intervention, three months for follow-up, and three months
      for analysis. The trial will be conducted to determine whether the resultant skills-focused,
      case-based, mentor training program can improve the mentoring skills of K series mentors. Our
      modified Wisconsin Mentoring Seminar Curriculum will consist of four 2-hour sessions
      administered within an 8-week period, using trained facilitators. Scholars will include all
      recipients of a K-Series Award at the 3 CTSA sites (e.g., K01, K08, K12, K23, K24, K99, KL2),
      who will be funded during the two-year cycle of this Administrative Supplement. We will
      randomly assign 300 K-award mentors of these scholars to a control group (n=150) or to the
      experimental intervention (n=150).
