      treat chronic ABMR (including plasmapheresis (PF) 7x, intravenous immune globulins 100 mg/kg
      7x, corticosteroid) and MSC infusions (2x106cells/kg bw after PF) (Group 1) and be compared
      to historic controls according to "propensity score matching" (treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy alone (Group 2)). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study after
      each PF. One year post- infusions, patients will be evaluated and undergo kidney biopsies.
      Blood collection will occur at regular intervals, serum creatinine and the estimated
      creatinine clearance will be monthly recorded. The transplanted kidney function and
      morphology (US Doppler) will be evaluated.
