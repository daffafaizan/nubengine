      with anxiety disorders than in healthy individuals. However, despite it's immediate
      plausibility, there have been relatively few tests of this hypothesis. Specifically, there
      have been very few explorations of the performance of patients with anxiety disorders on
      measures known to implicate the amygdala.

      Although the high co-morbidity of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety
      Disorder (SAD) complicates the issue, the fact that the disorders doubly dissociate suggests
      that they are due to dysfunctional activity in separable neurocognitive systems. We would
      suggest that the hyper-responsive amygdala hypothesis is more likely to be linked to the
      explanation of GAD. In contrast, SAD may be due to reduced activation thresholds for units in
      a system that responds to social threat and which recruits lateral orbital frontal cortex.
      Thus, the current project will determine the performance of patients with GAD and SAD on
      measures in which the amygdala is known to play a role and also measures that recruit lateral
      orbital frontal cortex and the system for social response reversal. In addition, two proposed
      neuro-imaging studies will directly assess neural responses in these two systems in both
      patient populations. The project should provide clear data that will constrain future
      theorizing on the pathology implicated in these two disorders.
