        -  To assess the role of DICER1 mutations and miRNA pathways in the etiology and
           progression of ovarian or testicular sex cord stromal tumors.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for D1CER1 mutation and mRNA expression
      by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and laser micro dissector.
      Results are then correlated with medical data, including age at diagnosis, diagnosis,
      pathology report, presenting symptoms, family history, treatment, outcome, and length of
      follow-up, when available.
