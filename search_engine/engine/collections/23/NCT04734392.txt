      implantation protocol (regarding membranous septum length and implantation depth) will
      decrease the need for permanent pacemaker stimulation following TAVR-procedures.

      Patient profile and sample size The study cohort will comprise of patients referred to
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Patients will be prospectively and consecutively
      screened and enrolled at a tertiary high-volume center in Germany. TAVR will be performed
      according to a modified implantation technique regarding membranous septum length. Pacemaker
      rates will be analyzed and compared to a historical control. Taking into account a
      contemporary pacemaker rate of 15%, a reduction to 7% will require a sample size of 239
      patients per group to achieve statistically significance (Chi-squared test, alpha 0.05, beta
      0.80).

      Regarding the prospective cohort, interims analysis will be performed after each 10 TAVR
      procedures. In case a signal towards worse outcomes with the modified implantation technique
      will be observed, the institutional safety and endpoint adjudication committee will stop
      further execution of the study.
