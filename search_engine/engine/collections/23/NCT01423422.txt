      therapeutic potential on the human body, however, to very limited extent on the heart. In the
      current study cardiac patients suffering from exercise-induced-angina will undergo two
      consecutive stress tests, one test after being exposed for 30 minutes to the magnetic field
      and the other test after being exposed to placebo (magnetic field not operated). The order of
      which the magnet will be operated will be randomly assigned for the patients so a group of
      patients will be exposed to the magnetic field at their first stress test and another groups
      of patients will be exposed to the magnetic field at their second stress test. During resting
      period, and while the patients are subjected to the magnetic field, a 12 lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) will be monitored. Thereafter the magnetic field and frequency will
      be turned off and the patients will be subjected to graded exercise stress test during which
      they will be monitored for ECG and blood pressure changes. Similar monitoring will be
      documented during the recovery period following the stress test. In addition, the patients
      will grade their angina score as documented during the stress test. The data will be compared
      between the two stress tests and to document any advantageous of the magnetic field on
      exercise time, workload, ECG changes and/or chest pain.
