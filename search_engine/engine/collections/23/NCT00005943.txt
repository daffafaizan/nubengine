      enterotoxin B and interleukin-2 plasmid DNA in patients with metastatic melanoma. II.
      Determine local gene expression in tumor tissues in this patient population treated with this
      regimen. III. Determine if plasmid DNA can be detected in circulation following intratumoral
      injection of this regimen in this patient population. IV. Evaluate the antitumor immune
      responses induced by this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Characterize the clinical
      response to this treatment regimen in terms of tumor size and histology in these patients.
      VI. Determine the clinical response to this treatment regimen in terms of complete remission,
      partial remission, stable disease, and disease progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intratumoral liposome complexed
      staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) plasmid DNA injections into 1-3
      tumor nodules once every 2 weeks. Treatment continues for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete regression during therapy may
      receive additional therapy to previously untreated tumor nodules. Patients with partial
      response at 4 weeks following the last injection may continue therapy once every 4 weeks
      until no residual tumor remains. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of SEB
      and IL-2 plasmid DNA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients
      are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
