      I. To determine the radiation dosimetry of 18F-FMAU in humans, confirm absence of adverse
      events in humans from intravenous (i.v.) injection of 18F-FMAU for PET imaging, and
      characterize the incidence of circulating metabolites of 18F-FMAU in humans.

      II. To simply find out whether there is any visual uptake change of 18F-FMAU in tumors
      post-therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorine F 18 d-FMAU IV followed by PET/CT prior to start of cancer
      treatment. Patients may undergo 2 additional scans at one week prior to second course of
      chemotherapy and after completion of cancer treatment depending on cancer type.
