    
      Vasomotor symptoms, commonly known as hot flashes or hot flushes, are the most common
      symptoms experienced by women who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal. FP-101 is postulated
      to mediate one of the mechanisms thought to drive hot flashes in post-menopausal women. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of FP-101 for the treatment of hot flashes in
      post-menopausal women.
