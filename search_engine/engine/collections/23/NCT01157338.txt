      for cerebrovascular emboli and stroke. We describe the incidence of clinically silent and
      apparent retinal emboli following diagnostic and interventional coronary catheterization and
      associated risk factors.

      Methods Three hundred selected patients attending a tertiary referral center for diagnostic
      and therapeutic cardiac catheterization were studied. Direct retinal examination and
      examination of the visual field and acuity were done before and after catheterization by a
      retinal specialist.
