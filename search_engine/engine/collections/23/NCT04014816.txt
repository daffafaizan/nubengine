      demonstrate a systemic inflammatory response coupled with complications of increased
      infectious morbidity, multiple organ dysfunction, prolonged hospitalization, and
      disproportionate mortality. Suspension of feeding and the resultant inability to reach
      nutritional goals is one complication of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, but there are
      others (mucosal barrier disruption, altered motility, atrophy of the mucosa, and reduced mass
      of gut-associated lymphoid tissue) that may explain the greater length of stay (LOS) and
      death rate with GI dysfunction. In Europe and the United States, nutritional administration
      guidelines recommend primarily enteral nutrition (EN) for hemodynamically stable intensive
      care unit (ICU) patients. Providing EN in these patients has been shown to be superior to
      parenteral nutrition. GI complications such as constipation, delayed gastric emptying,
      diarrhea, and vomiting may occur in up to 50% of mechanically ventilated patients and
      adversely affect ICU mortality and LOS. Nevertheless, there is no consensus for obtaining a
      precise assessment of GI function.Diagnosis of GI dysfunction in ICU patients is complex and
      relies on clinical symptoms. Lack of validated markers of GI system dysfunction is often
      misdiagnosed and poorly managed in the ICU. The role of nutrition in critical illness is
      important, but there is an increasing evidence and broadening consensus that aggressive early
      feeding as well as prolonged underfeeding both should be avoided. Avoidance of complications
      like malnutrition, aspiration of gastric contents, wound infections, and decubitus through GI
      dysfunction is an important part of management of patients with GI failure.
