      comprises a significant proportion of the musculoskeletal complaints presenting to primary
      care doctors. Ultrasound is a readily available and cheap modality for looking more
      specifically at the rotator cuff and surrounding structures. More recently, ultrasound
      guidance has become a commonly employed method to perform diagnostic or therapeutic
      interventions. Despite the long history and the fact that this is a common diagnosis made in
      clinical practice, the exact cause and best treatment for this condition still are being
      explored. Although there are a few high-quality studies demonstrating the efficacy of sodium
      hyaluronate injection for rotator cuff disease, this study will be performed to examine the
      effect of ultrasound-guided subacromial sodium hyaluronate injection in patients with
      impingement syndrome without rotator cuff complete tear.
