      disease). The hypothesis is that F-18 florbetapir will detect amyloid deposition in
      myocardium prior to current non-invasive diagnostic measures, particular electrocardiography
      with strain and technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy. The investigators intend to use F-18
      florbetapir and assess its correlation between standard non-invasive diagnostic modalities.
