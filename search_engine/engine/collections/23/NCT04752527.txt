      LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratification, are more likely to be refractory to intensive
      induction and have low rates of long-term survival. Venetoclax plus decitabine or azacitidine
      showed tolerable safety and favorable overall response rate (ORR )(CR+CRi rate: 67%) in
      elderly AML patients. In addition, combination therapy with sorafenib, cytarabine and
      idarubicin was able to induce a high CR rate in non-elderly AML patients with FLT3 mutations
      and a 1-year probability of survival of 74%. The fast next-generation sequencing together
      with FISH can identify the adverse genetic risk features in AML patients within 72 hours.
      Individualized induction therapy will be applied to the non-elderly AML patients with adverse
      genetic risk features guided by rapid screening with FISH and NGS, such as the combination of
      venetoclax plus decitabine, and Sorafenib for patients with high FLT3-ITD allelic ratio. This
      study aims to improve induction therapy for non-elderly AML patients with adverse genetic
      risk features, reduce treatment-related complications, and improve overall survival.
