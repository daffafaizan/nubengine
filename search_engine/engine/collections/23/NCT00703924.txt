    
      WR 279,396 is a paromomycin-based topical cream that has shown some suggestion of being
      effective for the treatment of non-serious, non-complicated cutaneous leishmaniasis in
      previous clinical studies. The goal of this study is to expand those observations in a
      larger, more rigorous study to clearly define the efficacy of this product and collect
      information about adverse effects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either WR 279,396
      or vehicle placebo; applied twice a day for 20 days.
