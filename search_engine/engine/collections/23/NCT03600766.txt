      affects 26/1000 man yearly (Gonzalgo et al., 2003). The prevalence of ED increases with age
      from 2-9% in men between 40-49 year, to 20-40% between 60-69 and between 50-100% over 70
      years (Gur et al., 2006; Hojanned et al., 2000; Gades et al., 2009; Braun et al., 2000). Many
      factors may contribute in the occurrence of ED including neuronal, vascular, myogenic and
      psychological causes (Gur et al., 2016; Johannes et al., 2000, Lewis et al., 2000; Wu et al.,
      2010; Mallis et al., 2005).

      Researchs during the past decade have ﬁrmly established that ED and ejaculatory dysfunction
      (EJD) are highly prevalent in aging men, particularly those with LUTS of BPH. Furthermore, it
      has been demonstrated that LUTS of BPH is an independent risk factor for male sexual
      dysfunction (Hansen BL. et al., 2004).

      Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for the relationship between LUTS and male
      sexual dysfunction are not fully elucidated, possible common links are present including
      activation of a-adrenergic receptors, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in sex hormone
      concentrations and receptor subtypes. Thus, it is now recommended that men presenting with
      LUTS should be evaluated for sexual dysfunction and those presenting with sexual dysfunction
      should be evaluated for LUTS (Price DT., et al., 1993).

      Also , it is now recognized that certain oral therapies for LUTS/BPH can adversely affect
      sexual function in patients who are already at increased risk for sexual dysfunction.
      Moreover, the correction of LUTS was associated with improvement of ED. (De Rose AF., et al.,
      2002) Healthcare providers should discuss sexual function with BPH patients both before and
      during treatment. (Raymond C. Rosen et al., 2005) So, use of ED-treating drugs
      (phosphodiestrase -5 inhibitors) is now a guideline recommendation in the lines of treatment
      of BPH/LUTS alone or in combination with α blockers. (EUA guidelines, 2015, Gratzke C et.,
      al., 2015).

      Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are effective in treatment of ED. They treat ED
      through enhancement of the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibition of cyclic guanosin
      monophosphate (cGMP) breakdown, therefore, increase blood flow through penile arteries. PDE5i
      are the first-line treatment of ED. Nevertheless, many patients may discontinue the treatment
      because of side effects, poor response or cost.

      It has been shown that B3-adrenoreceptors are mainly localized in the smooth muscle cells of
      human corpora cavernosa (HCC) (Cirino et al., 2003). The activation of B3-adrenoceptors cause
      relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle of HCC. Investigators showed that a B3-
      adrenoreceptors agoinst named "BRL37344" induces relaxation of the HCC. This relaxation has
      been shown to be linked to inhibition of the RhoA-Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)
      pathway (Cirino et al., 2003). The effect of BRL37344 is mediated by cGMP-dependent but
      NO-independent mechanisms, altering CC smooth muscle tone and promoting erectile function
      (Cirino et al., 2003). Thus, b3-adrenoceptor agonists may also serve as potentially useful
      drugs for the treatment of ED.

      Mirabegron is a selective B3-adrenoreceptor agonist and is currently approved in many parts
      of the world for treatment of overactive bladder (Chapple et al., 2013; Khullar et al., 2013;
      Chapple et al., 2013; Nitti et al., 2013). Mirabegron displayed 20-200 times higher relative
      efficacy for human B3-adrenoceptor than that BRL37344 (Takasu et al., 2007). Mirabegron
      increases intracellular cAMP levels and activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A resulting
      in relaxation of the human urinary bladder through a cascade of mechanisms including decrease
      in intracellular cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Imran et al., 2013; Matanake et al., 2013).

      Recently , Gur et al studied the effect of mirabegron on HCC in vitro study and also examined
      the impact of the drug in vivo, after intracavernosal injection of rats. Authors showed that
      mirabegron caused marked relaxation of HCC by activating B3-adrenoceptors independently of No
      pathway. So it appears that mirabegron may be apotential safe and effective therapeutic agent
      for ED. (Gur et al., 2016) Herein, we designed this protocol to evaluate the role of
      mirabegron in treating ED in men with BPH/LUTS with concomitant ED.
