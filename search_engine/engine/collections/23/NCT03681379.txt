      or chronic heart failure in children has yet to be defined. Due to physical proprieties of
      levosimendan and metabolites, we hypothesized that concomitant use of extracorporeal devices
      such as ECMO will cause major pharmacokinetic variations. Furthermore, pharmacokinetics of
      levosimendan in children with multiple organ failure has to be specify.
