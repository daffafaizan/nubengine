      However, the exact pathophysiology or mechanism of recurrent cholangitis has not been
      established. Periampullary diverticulum and narrow angle of common bile duct have been
      postulated as risk factors of recurrent common bile duct stone. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the association between periampullary dierticulum, angle of common bile duct and
      recurrent common bile duct stone.

      This study is patient-control setting study. Firstly, from July 2007 through February 2014,
      all the patients who were performed ERCP will be enrolled. The inclusion criteria is the
      patients with common bile duct stone. The exclusion criteria is patients with biliary
      stenosis, PSC, retained GB stone, or who were lost to follow-up. The main outcome is the
      association between periampullary diverticulum, common bile duct angle, and recurrent CBD
      stone. This will be evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.
