      • To establish the progression free survival rate at 2 years, using RECIST criteria, to
      induction treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by
      chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      • To evaluate complete response rates, safety and feasibility of TPF followed by
      chemoradiation in patients with NPC

      OUTLINE: This is a single site study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on Day 1;
      cisplatin IV over 1 to 3 hours (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) on Day 1; and fluorouracil
      IV continuously over 24 hours on Days 1 to 5. Each cycle is 21 days, with treatment
      consisting of up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONCURRENT CHEMO-RADIOTHERAPY: Beginning within 3 to 6 weeks after initiating the last course
      of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy once daily for 6.5 to 7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour
      (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) once weekly in weeks 1 to 6 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All study treatment is admininstered over the course of 21 weeks. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed periodically for 24 months.
