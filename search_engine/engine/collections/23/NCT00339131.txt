      cancers caused by what are known as neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma,
      paraganglioma, and carcinoid. Iobenguane is absorbed by neuroendocrine tumor cells. The
      radioactive portion of the study drug, Ultratrace iobenguane, is a form of iodine called I
      131. The I 131 is absorbed into the tumor with the iobenguane, and the radioactivity should
      kill the tumors. The type of iobenguane being studied is called Ultratrace because of the new
      way in which this form of iobenguane is made. This study is the first time in which
      Ultratrace iobenguane will be given to patients. The purpose of the study is to give a low
      dose of iobenguane just to find out if the drug is safe, to measure how long it takes the
      drug to be absorbed and passed out of the body, and to see how much radioactivity is absorbed
      by different types of tissues of the body.
