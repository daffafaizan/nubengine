      observed in patients with no prior systemic therapy. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic
      interaction and acceptable toxicity at a dosage of sorafenib of 400 mg twice daily (BID) and
      everolimus 5 mg daily. Based on these data and the need for more effective front-line therapy
      for renal cell carcinoma, the plan is to investigate this regimen in patients who have not
      undergone prior therapy. A sunitinib arm is being included as a concurrent reference to help
      provide a guideline of an activity level and toxicity that would be meaningful to move
      forward to a phase III study. Therefore, this study is designed as a non-comparative
      investigation and patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to everolimus/sorafenib or to
      sunitinib, respectively.
