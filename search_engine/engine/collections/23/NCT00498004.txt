      and quality of life . Poor subjective wellbeing induced by prolactin elevation after
      antipsychotic drug treatment can complicate the clinical outcomes of treatment.Quetiapine has
      negligible effects on the elevation of prolactin and does not produce hyperprolactinemia
      related adverse events such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea that may disturb quality of life in
      famel patient. In this Randomized, Open Label, 8-week Study, the impact of quetiapine and
      risperidone on quality of life in female patients with schizophrenia will be compared.
