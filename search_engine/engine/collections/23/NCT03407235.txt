    
      Healthy volunteers who are laparoscopic novices will perform four validated laparoscopic
      training exercises on both the laparoscopic computerized trainer and on a simple box trainer
      with an eye patch.

      Novices will be allowed to familiarize themselves with the laparoscopic instruments and will
      be shown short video clips to demonstrate tasks.

      They then will have five minutes to complete each of the four tasks. They will return 1-2
      weeks later to complete the same process on the alternative training method.

      All participants will complete the tasks on both the computerized lap simulator and the box
      trainer.
