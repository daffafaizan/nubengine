    
      The coflex® Interlaminar Technology - manufactured by Paradigm Spine - is intended for use as
      a permanent implant between the lamina of 1 or 2 lumbar motion segments in the treatment of
      moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis. The device is specifically designed to provide
      stabilization without fusion in cases of stenosis with or without facet joint hypertrophy,
      subarticular recess stenosis or foraminal stenosis. It is restricted for use to one or two
      levels in the region of L1 - L5.

      The height of the neuroforamen is maintained and the facet joints will be relieved. By this a
      further destruction is prevented. Unlike conventional stabilization methods as for example
      spinal fusion, the function of the segment will be maintained and adjacent structures will be
      effectively protected.

      Possible risks, which could occur after implantation of the coflex® Interlaminar Technology
      are breakage of the implant, displacement of the implant, pain which is caused by the
      implant, infections, bleedings and hematoma. The benefit of the study lies in the fact that
      first-time retrospective data is raised for potential improvement regarding therapy of lumbar
      back pain with the treatment of the lumbar spinal stenosis, which, in the future, can lead to
      an improvement of the therapy.

      In this study, Paradigm Spine will retrospectively collect clinical and radiographic data for
      patients treated with the coflex® Interlaminar Technology during normal conditions of use.
      This data will provide evidence to support publications and marketing.
