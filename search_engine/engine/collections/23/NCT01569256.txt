      risk of OHSS, however the possible mechanism of action has not been clearly known. In
      experimental studies, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor based pathway was
      proposed as a possible action of mechanism of dopamine agonists. However the role hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF), insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), inhibin B and antimullerian
      hormone (AMH) on cabergoline action in OHSS prevention has not been known.
