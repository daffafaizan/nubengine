    
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disease caused by a mutation that codes for
      an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. An
      absence or deficiency of this enzyme activity results in a Phe elevation, where higher Phe
      levels result in neurological damage. Diurnal variations of Phe levels have been observed in
      PKU patients in a 24-hour period.

      As Kuvan has shown to stabilize Phe levels in PKU patients over time, our hypothesis is that
      this can be demonstrated within a 24-hour period of observation and indicate therefore that
      Kuvan may correlate with a lower plasma Phe variability. This study on PKU patients' diurnal
      variation will also provide important information as to the current method of blood Phe
      monitoring in a clinical setting to learn more about the optimal way to measure Phe
      concentration.

      The study will last about 4 weeks (6 study visits) for the PKU participants and about 1 week
      (2 study visits) for the control group.

      Participants will be required to follow a recommended diet, complete a dietary log, and
      undergo several blood draws, including a 24-Hour Blood Assessment in which blood will be
      obtained 8 times throughout the day.
