      are at risk of having allergic inflammation in the lower respiratory tract. About 60% of
      children with seasonal allergic rhinitis present bronchial hyperresponsiveness and signs and
      symptoms of asthma.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of montelukast and cetirizine on allergic
      inflammation measured by exhaled nitric oxide concentration in children with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis.
