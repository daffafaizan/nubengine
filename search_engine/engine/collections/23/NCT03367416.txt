      have similar characteristics and response patterns to previous studies.

      The preliminary summary data provided by the participating dental clinics, the current
      average no-show rate is approximately 20%, which would reduce to 10% using the upper limit of
      the confidence interval from the preliminary data. Based on a simulation study incorporating
      the above assumptions, with 5 sites each contributing 160 appointments before and after the
      intervention, the study will have 84% power to detect the hypothesized effect (OR=0.44) at a
      two-sided 5% significance level. The probability of observing a decrease in no-show rates in
      at least 4 out of 5 of the clinics is approximately 90%. We expect over 80 appointments per
      month in each clinic, so the target number of appointments would be expected to be available
      in 2-3 months.

      For the NIATx Fidelity Scale, if an organization has an average score of 2 or higher on the
      NIATx Fidelity Scale for 8 of the 13 measures that will be considered significant. In a
      previous study using a similar process, 73% of the organizations that achieved gains of +10%,
      had 8 measures or more with an average score of 2 or greater, compared to 40% of those who
      had gains at <10%.
