      role in the lung as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. A1AT deficiency is associated with
      decreases in plasma A1AT levels and is associated with an increased risk for developing
      asthma, emphysema/COPD, and bronchiectasis. Much of the lung damage is thought to be caused
      by proteolytic damage from neutrophil elastase and other proteases.

      ADVM-043 is an investigational gene therapy product (serotype AAVrh.10 vector) expressing
      human A1AT that is intended to deliver a functional gene to the liver of patients with A1AT
      deficiency. Study ADVM-043-01 will study up to 4 dose levels in up to 20 patients and assess
      the hypothesis that a single administration of an AAV vector expressing the human M-type A1AT
      (i.e., ADVM-043) to patients with A1AT deficiency is safe and results in persistent
      therapeutic levels of A1AT in blood and alveolar epithelial lining fluid (epithelial lining
      fluid is only to be collected in subjects who are dosed intrapleurally). The primary endpoint
      is safety, and changes in plasma A1AT levels at multiple time points up to 52 weeks after
      dosing. A prophylactic tapering corticosteroid regimen will be used to protect against
      potential vector induced transaminitis. Subjects will be followed for up to 52 weeks after
      dosing. Safety and efficacy data from the IV cohorts will be considered when determining
      whether to proceed to intrapleural administration. After completion of this study, subjects
      will be asked to enroll in a Long Term Follow Up study.
