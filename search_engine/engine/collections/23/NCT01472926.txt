      binding specificity and longer half-life) that may be advantageous when compared to older
      agents such as alteplase with respect to arterial recanalisation, ease of administration, and
      reduced bleeding risk. No other clinical trial is currently evaluating alternative
      thrombolytic strategies in patients who are eligible to receive standard intravenous
      alteplase, instead concentrating on extending the population for IV thrombolysis.

      The ATTEST pilot phase will use brain imaging as a biomarker for key clinical response
      variables, with penumbral salvage as the primary end-point and secondary end-points including
      recanalisation as well as conventional clinical scales.

      The findings of this study are anticipated to provide data on sample size and event rates to
      inform the design of a definitive, confirmatory, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial with
      clinical endpoints.
