      critically ill patients. Subjects will be mechanically ventilated patients needing alveolar
      RMs. After a period of stable lung protective approach ventilation, they will receive the
      "40/30" RM; lung mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamics and plasmatic concentration of
      inflammatory mediators will be obtained before and after the RM. An ultrasound score,
      established from the lung aeration status of upper and lower parts of anterior and lateral
      chest wall, will also be calculated before and after the manoeuvre.In selected patients
      cytokine release in the bronchoalveolar lavage will be measured as well.
