      and reduce gingival inflammation. Unlike most common conventional manual toothbrush, this new
      toothbrush was designed to employ a vertical motion on all tooth surfaces which simulates the
      natural up and down movement of the hand, suggesting that this makes the brushing process to
      be more controlled and stable.

      One hundred and ten participants were assigned randomly to conventional toothbrush (Kid's
      Soft Toothbrush, Colgate) as a control group, while another half were assigned the T-shaped
      toothbrush (Denson™, Malaysia) as an experimental group.

      Gingival status was scored using the Loe and Silness Gingival Index 25. The amount of plaque
      was scored using the modified Quigley and Hein Plaque Index (TQHI) 26. Both indices were
      recorded at 6 sites around all the teeth (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiopalatal,
      midpalatal, distopalatal). All teeth were included except teeth with prosthetic crowns or
      cervical restorations.

      One hundred children completed the study.
