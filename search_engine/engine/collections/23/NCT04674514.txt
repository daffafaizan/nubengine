    
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability,
      efficacy, and PK/ Pharmacodynamics of APG2575 monotherapy or in combination with lenalidomide
      (R) and dexamethasone (d) in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM).
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, identify dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RP2D) of
      APG-2575 monotherapy or in combination with Rd in Chinese R/R MM patients.

      This study consists of two arms of APG-2575 single agent (arm A) and APG-2575 in combination
      with Rd (arm B). All subjects will receive consecutive treatment in 28-day cycles.

      All subjects will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicities, or other treatment discontinuation criteria fdefined by the protocol. All
      subjects will complete survival follow up after treatment discontinuation until end of the
      study, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, or death.
