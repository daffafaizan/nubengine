      surgical departments. The complications carried by post operative period includes pain,
      swelling, trismus , along with disturbance in post extraction wound healing which may
      significantly affect patient's quality of life.

      PRP is an autologous concentrate of platelet suspended in plasma and accelerate healing by
      production of various growth factors. PRP is prepared from patient's own blood and later
      packed with gel sponge (Spongistone) in the experimental group immediately after surgical
      extraction of mandibular third molar teeth, followed by suture placement to close the
      surgical site. PRP speeds up healing by concentration of growth factors which can lessen the
      inflammation and decreases trismus and pain.
