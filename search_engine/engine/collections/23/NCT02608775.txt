      Bispectral index (BIS), entropy,.â€¦ However, monitoring analgesia or more precisely the
      nociceptive-antinociceptive (analgetic) balance during anesthesia proved more difficult.
      Clinical signs such as heart rate (tachycardia) or blood pressure (hypertension) are usually
      observed and used to assess nociception and a patient's autonomic unbalance. During general
      anesthesia administration of opioids like sufentanil and remifentanil decrease the ANS
      reactivity to noxious stimulation. Recently two variables based on standard anesthesia
      monitor equipment have been introduced into clinical practice: the Analgesia Nociception
      Index (ANI), derived from analysis of the small beat-to-beat oscillations of the heart rate
      during respiration, the heart rate variability (HRV), and the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI),
      calculated from the plethysmographic amplitude and heart beat interval.
