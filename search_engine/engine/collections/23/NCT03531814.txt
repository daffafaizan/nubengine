    
      Background:

        -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in
           3,500 individuals and is associated with a broad variety of symptoms and physical
           findings.

        -  Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are histologically benign tumors which occur in 25-50% of
           patients with NF1 and can lead to significant morbidity.

        -  Oral therapeutic options for the treatment of plexiform neurofibromas are being actively
           developed, however early clinical data indicate that prolonged treatment over the course
           of months to years will likely be needed to maintain clinical efficacy

        -  Long-term medication adherence is an ongoing challenge for patients with many types of
           chronic illness, and clinical experience makes us strongly suspect patients with NF1
           will likely have this issue as well.

        -  In other diseases, such as HIV and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, decreased medication
           adherence has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and this may be the case
           for NF1 as well.

        -  The medication event monitoring systems (MEMSTM) uses a computerized method of tracking
           the dates and times of a pill bottle being opened, and has been shown to be a more
           accurate measure of medication adherence than patient diaries or pill counts in other
           patient populations.

        -  Assessing medication adherence over time in this unique population will be essential for
           assessing any impact on medical outcomes, identifying potential behavioral
           interventions, and targeting patients most at risk for nonadherence moving forward.

      Objective:

      - To establish the feasibility of using MEMSTM to monitor medication adherence in the NF1
      population

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of NF1 and be between 3 and 59 years of age

        -  Participants must be enrolled on a clinical trial for an oral medication in pill (tablet
           or capsule) form directed at the treatment of plexiform neurofibroma(s)

      Design:

        -  This single-site, longitudinal study will recruit children and adults with NF1 who are
           currently enrolled in a treatment protocol for a drug targeting PN volume reduction.

        -  MEMSTM caps will be used to monitor adherence over time along with patient diaries and
           pill counts.

        -  Patients with MEMSTM cap data indicating <90% adherence at any study visit (typically
           across 3 - 6 cycles) will be administered a measure assessing barriers to adherence
           electronically and will be interviewed to evaluate what factors might contribute to
           decreased medication adherence and what potential interventions they consider useful.
