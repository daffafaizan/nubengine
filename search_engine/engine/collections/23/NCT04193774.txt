      publication showed a significant lower alpha diversity when using an anesthetic. However, the
      diluting effect of the anesthetic drop itself was not accounted for. On the other hand, using
      anesthetics will enable patients to tolerate sampling better and this might allow better
      sampling. To analyze the effect of anesthetic drops on the composition of the ocular surface
      microbiome, we sampled volunteers undergoing general anesthesia. By using artificial tears as
      a control, we aimed at accounting for the diluting effect of the anesthetic. By using
      volunteers under general anesthesia, we wanted to assure similar pressure with or without
      topical anesthesia since the executor was not influenced by the patient's reaction.

      Furthermore, the effect of different extraction protocols on sequencing results will be
      assessed by sampling different volunteers in both eyes on non consecutive days.
