    
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-881 in gliomas, that harbor an IDH1and/or IDH2
      mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients
      will receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion
      phase where patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. The anticipated time on study treatment
      is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the
      discretion of the investigator
