    
      Objective: To determine whether the application of non-invasive intermittent positive
      pressure ventilation (n-IPPV) increases the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in
      patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) secondary to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema
      (ACPE), as opposed to non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP).

      Background Both n-CPAP or n-IPPV are used to treat ACPE complicated by ARF. Two previous
      studies, however, report an increased rate of AMI associated with the use of n-IPPV.

      Methods: Fifty-two patients with severe ARF consequent to ACPE were randomized to receive
      n-CPAP (n=27) or n-IPPV (n=25), both associated with standard medical therapy. Cardiac
      markers, electrocardiogram and clinical-physiological parameters were monitored at study
      entry, after 30 and 60 minutes, and every 6 hours for the first two days.
