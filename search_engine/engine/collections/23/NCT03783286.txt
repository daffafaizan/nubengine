      months and older. This investigator-Initiated study is designed to evaluate the nutritional,
      growth and GI impact of ivacaftor treatment for the youngest (6-24 months) patient cohort and
      for whom FDA approval has recently been granted. This proposal directly extends the previous
      highly informative nutrition and weight gain investigation of ivacaftor treatment in the
      older patient cohort (1). The primary aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of 12
      weeks of ivacaftor treatment in 6-24 month old subjects with CF and gating mutations on
      sleeping energy expenditure, growth status and gut health and function in 18 children with
      protocol evaluations at baseline (pre-treatment) and 6 and 12 weeks after clinically
      prescribed ivacaftor treatment has begun. Other outcomes of significant clinical interest in
      young subjects with CF will be explored. All subjects will be evaluated at the Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and will be recruited both regionally and nationally to
      ensure timely enrollment.
