      progression of disease in patients with early ALS. The drug to be tested is R(+) pramipexole,
      an antioxidant that concentrates into brain and mitochondria. R(+)PPX will be administered at
      30 mg/day over 6 months, following a 3 month lead-in period without drug therapy. For
      purposes of this study, futility is defined as failure to decrease the slope of ALS-FRSr
      decline by less than 40%.
