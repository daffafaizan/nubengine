      administered. It is agreed that all patients should receive premedication with dexamethasone,
      an H1 antagonist, such as diphenhydramine, and an H2 antagonist before the administration of
      paclitaxel. There are several cases where undesirable effects (eg. drowsiness, dry mouth,
      motor impatience) have been reported following the administration of this conventional
      premedication. Diphenhydramine is often accused because of its pharmacological properties.

      A definitive, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study can assess whether cetirizine,
      a non-sedating H1 antagonist, can be used as an effective and safe alternative to
      diphenhydramine in the prevention of paclitaxel infusion-related reactions.

      In the current proposed feasibility study, patients will be followed for the first two doses
      of paclitaxel. The goal is to explore the randomized, controlled, double-blind design
      targeted for the final clinical trial to assess the acceptability of interventions and
      clinical outcome measures and to provide data making it possible to estimate the parameters
      necessary for the preparation, modification or even abandonment of the final study.
