      The therapy will be based on principals of exposure therapy, but will also incorporate
      aspects of physiological monitoring, and cognitive restructuring. The therapy will be
      modified as indicated by clinical feedback, with a fixed protocol to be developed (with
      length of treatment and exact methods to be used to be determined). After a fixed protocol is
      agreed upon, the project will enter the randomized phase. In this portion, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive either the Virtual Reality Treatment, or sent back to a waiting
      list during which time they will receive usual treatment. Participants will be assessed to
      determine which treatment (VR or treatment as usual) results in the greatest improvements in
      PTSD, as measured by independent assessors using the Clinician Administered PTSD scale.
