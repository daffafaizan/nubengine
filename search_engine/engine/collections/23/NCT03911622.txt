      should increase. CSD is defined by ultrasound imaging as a triangular hypoechoic defect in
      the myometrium at the site of the previous cesarean section scar. However, patients with CSD
      are sometimes asymptomatic. Yet, some patients with CSD can have symptoms of abnormal uterine
      bleeding, pelvic pain, infertility, uterine rupture, and potential risks of adverse pregnancy
      outcome .There is an association between the size of a niche and postmenstrual spotting.
      women with a history of CS, the depth and shape of the niche were not significant factors,
      while a larger niche volume was described in women with postmenstrual spotting. in women with
      gynecological symptoms, the niches were significantly wider in women with postmenstrual
      spotting, dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain, and the prevalence of postmenstrual spotting
      or prolonged menstrual bleeding was higher with a larger diameter of the niche .Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) has recently shown a promise tool for evaluation of uterine scar
      thickness. As opposed to ultrasonography (USG), which is the current gold standard for this
      purpose, MRI reduces observer dependence and has a superior multiplanar capability.

      MRI can be used for assessment of lower uterine segment. It provides accurate tissue
      characterization, independent of patient body mass index .
