      linkage to deficits in pitch recognition. Pitch recognition in subjects will be tested to
      identify individuals and families with poor pitch recognition, known as tune deafness,
      defined as the inability to recognize wrong notes in a popular melody. We will undertake a
      2-stage process, first a screening to identify probands, and secondly a full family
      ascertainment and enrollment. Probands and family members will be given an auditory and
      verbal attention test, and additions listening tests to measure aspects of center auditory
      processing and attention. Family phenotypic data will be used for additional epidemiological
      studies of tune deafness. Affected and unaffected members of families containing multiple
      tune deaf individuals will have 20 cc of blood drawn to obtain DNA. These DNA samples will
      then be genotyped using markers distributed across the human genome, and the genotypic
      information analyzed to determine which markers show linkage to tune deafness. Genetic
      linkage is the initial step in the process of positional cloning, and cloning the defective
      genes which underlie tune deafness is a long term goal of this research.
