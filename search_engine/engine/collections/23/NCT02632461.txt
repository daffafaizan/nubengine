      meeting at the beginning of the study and a 2-hour baseline assessment and training meeting.
      Additional assessments will be conducted at 3 months and 6 months. Weekly questionnaires will
      be administered. Everyone in the study will be asked to listen to 2 podcasts per week. Each
      of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to listen to and so participants should
      expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to podcasts. Participants will also be
      randomized to either track diet with an app on their smartphone or using a device they wear
      on their wrist. Each week, participants will be sent an email as a reminder on how to use
      their diet tracking device. They will also be encouraged to monitor their exercise and body
      weight.
