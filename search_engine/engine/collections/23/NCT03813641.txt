      two groups: the experimental group (group A) will be administered with raltitrexed 3mg/m2
      intravenously combined with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, repeated every 21 days. The control
      group (group B) will be administered with orally capecitabine (1000mg/m2, d 1-14) combined
      with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, repeated every 21 days. After 8 cycles of treatments, if
      evaluated as complete response(CR),partial response(PR) or stable disease(SD), CRC patients
      will go into maintenance therapy wtih raltitrexed combined with bevacizumab in group A or
      capecitabine combined with bevacizumab in group B respectively, ended in disease
      progression(PD) , symptoms deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of
      consent (whichever occurs first). The radiological efficacy will be evaluated every 6 weeks
      (2 treatment cycles) and non-PD (PD criteria referring to RECIST 1.1 criteria) patients will
      continue to be treated until the cancer progression or the patient's intolerable toxicity or
      death. Toxic side effects and quality of life will be assessed at the same time.

      Follow up participants and analyse primary endpoint (PFS) and secondary endpoints (OS,ORR and
      DCR).The causes of confirmed missing data in the trial should be recorded in detail to
      determine the mechanism of missing data and choose the suitable missing data handling
      methods.
