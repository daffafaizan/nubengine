      (VTE). The frequency of inherited Factor V Leiden and other risk factors for VTE in the
      general population is estimated at 5-10%. This population has a 5-21 fold greater risk to
      develop VTE. Therefore, given the high thrombotic risk for the combination of hormone use and
      hereditary prothrombotic abnormalities these women's symptoms frequently go untreated for
      lack of alternative therapies. DT56a (Femarelle) is a soy derived compound that has been
      shown to act as a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in the alleviation of
      menopausal symptoms and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss without effecting the
      endometrium or the sex hormone blood profile. The research question of the current study is
      to assess the effect of femeralle on the coagulation system and determine if it is a
      reasonable and safe alternative for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in thrombophilic
      women.
