    
      The Phase I part of this study will perform a dose-escalation to identify the recommended
      Phase II dose of LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib in m-CRPC patients.

      In the Phase II part of this study, the anti-tumor efficacy of LAE001/prednisone plus
      afuresertib and of afuresertib alone the anti-tumor efficacy of LAE001/prednisone plus
      afuresertib and docetaxel/prednisone plus afuresertib will be assessed in mCRPC patients with
      PTEN loss and/or PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alteration who have progressed on, or who are intolerant of,
      1-3 prior standard treatments for mCSPC, or nmCRPC, or mCRPC, including at least one
      antiandrogen treatment and no more than one chemotherapy. These study results will provide
      preliminary efficacy and safety information of the combination of LAE001/prednisone plus
      afuresertib and docetaxel/prednisone plus afuresertib as requested in the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) combined therapy guideline.
