      preventing relapse in participants with schizophrenia who were previously stabilized on
      corresponding doses of PP1M or PP3M. The study consists of mainly 3 phases: a screening phase
      (up to 28 days), a maintenance phase (of 1 or 3 months), and a double-blind phase (of 12
      months [neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving]). Additional/conditional phases include a transition phase (before maintenance
      phase). Study evaluations include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety.
      The study duration will vary from approximately 13 months to 19 months.
