    
      This is a proof-of-concept phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the long-term safety and
      efficacy of Allo to function as a regenerative therapeutic to restore structural integrity
      and cognitive function of the brain in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      dementia. Study participants will be male and female, APOE Îµ4 positive diagnosed with
      probable AD, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 20 to 26, ages 55 to 80 years old.

      After a 2-4-week screening period, participants will be randomized to 4 mg Allo (administered
      intravenously over 30 minutes, once per week, in clinic) or matching placebo, 1:1 allocation,
      for a period of 12 months. After 12 months, all participants in the placebo group will be
      crossed-over to receive Allo for the remainder of the study (6 month open-label phase). Brain
      imaging to evaluate the primary endpoint will be conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months.
