      Disorder (ASD), with some surveys estimating that 1 in 12 children with autism have undergone
      chelation. This widespread use reflects the hypothesis that many cases of ASD are caused by
      exposure to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based compound used previously in the US as a vaccine
      preservative for routine childhood immunizations. The prevalent use of chelation therapy
      stands in stark contrast with the lack of scientific or clinical evidence of efficacy, and
      creates a public health imperative for empiric data. Thus we propose a controlled trial of
      the effects of chelation on the core behavioral symptoms and overall functioning of children
      with ASD. The present investigation is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of
      the oral chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer) among 120
      children, ages four to ten years, who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment
      behavioral ratings will be used to evaluate the efficacy of chelation. In addition, children
      will undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination and laboratory analyses.

      Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the chelation
      treatment group and the placebo control group. Analysis of mercury levels before and during
      the course of treatment will be used to confirm the expected DMSA-induced excretion of
      mercury and to identify differences among children in the extent of excretion. Our primary
      hypothesis is that, on average and relative to the control group, children with ASD who
      undergo chelation with DMSA will show greater improvements in communication and social
      behavior.
