      peritoneal cancer is maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy with
      or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP). Recently, the organizations of SGO and ASCO
      recommended that women with Fagotti score by laparoscopic exploration < 6 would benefit from
      primary cytoreductive surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy, and are likely to
      attain optimal cytoreduction (residual lesion â‰¤ 1 cm).

      Hyperthermia promotes chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue. Therefore,
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as newly postoperative chemotherapy after
      primary cytoreductive surgery in the treatment of ovarian cancer could lead to higher
      response rate and better survival outcomes.
