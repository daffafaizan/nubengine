    
      An open label, monocenter pharmacokinetic study will be carried out in critically ill
      patients, admitted at the University Hospitals Leuven, receiving multiple dose treatment with
      fluconazole.

      The exposure to fluconazole in the ICU cohort over multiple days of treatment will be
      documented. Moreover, variability and the correlating covariates that can influence the
      fluconazole concentration, will be determined.
