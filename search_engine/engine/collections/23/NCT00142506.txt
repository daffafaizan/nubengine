      Sildenafil Citrate usage administered during and after radiotherapy in combination with or
      without hormone therapy versus radiotherapy alone for the preservation of erectile function
      in potent patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The primary objectives of this
      protocol are to determine if prophylactic and on demand usage of Sildenafil Citrate can
      preserve spontaneous erectile function as well as diminish the time to restoration of
      erectile function in potent men receiving radiotherapy with or without hormone therapy for
      localized prostate cancer. Secondary objectives of this study are: to determine whether
      prophylactic and on demand use of Sildenafil Citrate during therapy may improve the long-term
      response to the drug following treatment; to determine whether prophylactic and on demand use
      of Sildenafil Citrate during therapy will reduce acute and late urinary effects of
      radiotherapy; to determine the impact of dosimetry and radiation exposure to both the
      neurovascular bundle and bulb of the penis on erectile function preservation in the study
      population undergoing brachytherapy and hormone therapy; to asses the impact on quality of
      life following prophylactic and on demand Sildenafil Citrate usage in the study population;
      to determine the relationship between testosterone levels, erectile function and efficacy of
      prophylactic and on demand Sildenafil Citrate usage in the study population.
