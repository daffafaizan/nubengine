    
      This experimental study aims to examine the effects of PREG on a) repeated cocaine craving,
      mood and neurobiological reactivity to brief, guided imagery exposure to stress, drug cues
      and neutral situations in the laboratory and b) daily cocaine intake, craving, cognition and
      mood in men and women with CUD; and c) sex differences in all of these outcomes. The study's
      hypothesis is that PREG vs PLA will dose-specifically decrease stress-induced and drug-cue
      induced cocaine craving, improve mood and cognitive performance, and normalize hypothalamic
      pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress and drug-cue imagery, and reduce cocaine
      intake and craving in daily life in individuals with CUD.
