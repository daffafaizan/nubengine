      the scene will take a blood sample for thrombelastometry immediately after i.v. access is
      established. According to the initial trauma life support protocols a number of patients will
      receive a dose of tranexamic acid during the initial treatment on the scene or during
      transport to the hospital. A second blood sample will be taken after arrival in the
      resuscitation area of the hospital. Thrombelastometric measurements will be performed with
      both blood samples and the extent of hyperfibrinolysis in both samples will be compared. In a
      second step the outcome of the patients who received tranexamic acid on the scene will be
      compared to those who did not receive the drug before reaching hospital.
