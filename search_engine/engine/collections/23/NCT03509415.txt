      study to look at the efficacy of in vivo RCM as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of BCC.

      Study Hypothesis The hypothesis of this study is that the use of RCM is would enable a
      reduction in the number of diagnostic biopsies taken before definitive treatment of BCC by at
      least 50%.

      The secondary hypothesis is that the intra- & inter-observer agreement for interpreting the
      RCM images will have kappa scores 0.6 or greater (indicating good agreement).

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of Skin Care Network London.
