      Southern blot and methyl-specific quantitative PCR) in 3 groups of patients: 150 children
      naturally conceived, 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation but with in vivo
      fertilization, and 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation and in VITRO
      fertilization. These analyses will be performed on cord blood. Fragments of placental tissue
      will also be collected for further analyses. Patients will be selected in maternity hospitals
      associated with ART departments ( ANTOINE BECLERE HOSPITAL, Cochin HOSPITAL, Saint-Vincent de
      Paul HOSPITAL, Jean VERDIER HOSPITAL, Tenon HOSPITAL and Dijon Hospital).

      This work is also a unique opportunity to establish a DNA, RNA and tissue collection allowing
      further investigation regarding other epigenetic modifications than DNA methylation, not only
      at imprinted loci, but also in other genomic regions regulated by epigenetic modifications.
