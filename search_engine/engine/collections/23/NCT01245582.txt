    
      For each patient, the study consists of a baseline period of screening up to 2 weeks, a
      treatment period with 2 weeks as one study treatment cycle.

      Each patient will be randomly assigned to receive either SECOX (Sorafenib, Oxaliplatin with
      Capecitabine) or Sorafenib alone every 2 weeks until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity, or patient's refusal of further study treatment. There will be a 30-day follow-up
      visit after the last study treatment.

      All patients will be follow-up every 2 months until death is observed during post-treatment
      follow-up period.
