      schools. We will randomize teams to intervention and control groups. We will train
      intervention coaches to implement a 20-minute neuromuscular warm-up and tracked training
      costs. Control coaches will use their usual warm-up. All coaches will report weekly athlete
      exposures (AEs) and injuries resulting in a missed practice/game. Research assistants will
      interview injured athletes. We will compare injury rates between control and intervention
      groups.
