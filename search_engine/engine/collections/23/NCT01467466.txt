      common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and a leading cause of iatrogenic renal disease.
      Contrast-induced AKI is associated with serious adverse outcomes including death, need for
      dialysis, prolonged hospitalization, and acceleration in the rate of progression of
      underlying chronic kidney disease. The benefit of IV isotonic bicarbonate compared to IV
      isotonic saline and of N-acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced AKI and
      associated adverse outcomes remains unclear. The purpose of this trial is to compare the
      effectiveness of IV isotonic sodium bicarbonate with IV isotonic sodium chloride and oral NAC
      with placebo for the prevention of serious adverse outcomes in 7,680 high-risk patients
      scheduled to undergo coronary or non-coronary angiography. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design,
      patients will be randomized to receive: 1) either peri-procedural IV isotonic sodium
      bicarbonate or peri-procedural IV isotonic saline and 2) either oral NAC or oral placebo
      prior to and for 5 days following the angiographic procedure. The primary study endpoint is a
      composite outcome comprised of death, need for acute dialysis, or persistent decline in
      kidney function within 90 days following the index angiogram.
