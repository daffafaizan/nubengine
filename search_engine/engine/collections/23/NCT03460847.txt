      in part responsible for the inability of some patients to response to steroid therapy and
      probably also for the failure to other immunosuppressive therapies. Certain pathobionts have
      the capability to stimulate the mucosal immune system, thereby leading to chronic
      inflammation. On the other hand, commensals are necessary for repair processes in the mucosa
      and are providing metabolites that are used as an energy source for the colonic epithelium.
      An increase in pathobionts in combination with a lack of certain commensals might therefore
      maintain colonic inflammation despite immunosuppressive therapy with systemic steroids in
      patients with UC.

      The investigators therefore plan to investigate the intestinal microbiota in UC patients
      before and 4 weeks after a systemic corticosteroid therapy and correlate potential
      alterations of the microbiota to the therapeutic response. Other factors like concomitant UC
      treatment, disease severity, disease extent and environmental factors will also be correlated
      to changes in the microbiota.

      In the subgroup of patients not responding to steroids and requiring a rescue therapy with
      infliximab or a calcineurin Inhibitor, the predictive value of microbiota alterations will
      also be investigated.

      If certain bacterial taxa can predict a steroid refractory and an unfavorable disease course,
      the results of this study will help in identifying possible microbiota based biomarkers for
      an individualized treatment approach in UC patients in the future.
