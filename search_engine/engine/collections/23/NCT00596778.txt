      Spirometry, pulse oximetry and anamneses were performed before (pre-operative) and in the
      second post-operative day. Chest physiotherapy group received treatment at the
      post-anesthesia unit care and control group did not. Chest physiotherapy improved
      oxygen-hemoglobin saturation in elective post-operative abdominal surgeries.
