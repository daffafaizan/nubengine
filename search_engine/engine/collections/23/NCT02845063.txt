      pro-angiogenic and mitochondrial gene transcript expression. Exercise-induced muscle
      plasticity importantly interacts with the insertion/deletion genotype of ACE and the training
      modality and intensity. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the
      interaction between training modality, ACE genotype and disease in heart patients whom
      complete a cardiovascular rehabilitation program.

      There are two training modalities being used: The first modality involves cardiovascular
      training by an interval type of protocol that includes a high repetition number of shortening
      (i.e. concentric) type contractions on a softrobotic device. The second modality includes a
      high repetition number of lengthening (i.e. eccentric) type contractions on a softrobotic
      device. In both training modalities the same muscle groups are exercised over the same range
      of motion, with the same speed of movement, but with widely differing pedal force. Total
      absolute external mechanical work will be matched.

      In order to assess the baseline values and the effect size of the muscle and training
      adjustments made, healthy male and female volunteers will be included who are matched with
      respect to age and sex to the patient population and undergo the same training program.
