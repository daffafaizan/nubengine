      clinic of Dhulikhel Hospital-Kathmandu University Hospital, Nepal from March 2017 to May
      2017. Patients diagnosed of having COPD, Asthma or Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) and
      were under inhalation bronchodilators in the form of Dry Powder Device via Rotahaler were
      included. Enrolled patients are assessed for inhalation technique compliance at their routine
      medical (pre-training) visits by physician. The use of inhaler device is evaluated in a
      practical manner by asking the patients to demonstrate their inhalation technique. After the
      assessment, instructions and training are given until they can use the device correctly. One
      month later (post-training), all patients are re-evaluated in regards to inhalation technique
      and subjective improvement of symptoms.
