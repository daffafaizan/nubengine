      Primary

        -  Evaluate reduction in toxicity, in terms of pulmonary hemorrhage, in patients with
           recurrent, unresectable or stage IIIB or IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer treated
           with radiotherapy followed by paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy to the primary tumor, clinically involved lymph nodes,
      and any other disease-causing symptoms or bronchial compression once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 2 weeks in weeks 1 and 2. Beginning in week 4, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours, carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response, partial
      response, or stable disease after 4 courses receive bevacizumab alone as above in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
