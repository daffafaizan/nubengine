      even when they express desire for change. These behaviors seem to override all other
      potential responses, and can appear perseverative, or habitual. The purpose of this study is
      to investigate thought processes and neural mechanisms that may contribute to the development
      of habitual behaviors. The investigators hypothesize that patients with AN will perform
      differently than people without eating disorders on a series of neuropsychological tasks and
      will show different neural activation patterns in functional neuroimaging scans.
