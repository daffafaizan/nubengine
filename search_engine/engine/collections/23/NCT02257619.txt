      conducted.

      In Part 2, the randomized portion, the objective is to evaluate and compare the overall
      survival of subjects with previously treated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) when treated with itacitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel
      alone.

      The secondary objectives of this study (Part 2) are to evaluate and compare the efficacy of
      the 2 treatment groups with respect to progression-free survival, overall tumor response, and
      duration of response, and to evaluate and compare disease control, safety, and tolerability
      of itacitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone.
