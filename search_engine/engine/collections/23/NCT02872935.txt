      spinal anesthesia, co-loading of 1 liter of crystalloids, with placing the spinal, along with
      administering a phenylephrine infusion and glycopyrrolate, enables placing a spinal with
      minimal perioperative nausea and vomiting and good intra and post-operative pain relief.

      The study group will receive phenylephrine infusion [dilution 100micrograms /cc] Rate of
      infusion 50micrograms /hour, approximately 30ml/hour To be started immediately after the
      placement of the spinal anesthetic Patient will also be given .4mg [1cc of glycopyrrolate],
      with the starting of the infusion

      The control group, will receive phenylephrine infusion [dilution 100micrograms /cc] Rate of
      infusion 50micrograms /hour, approximately 30ml/hour To be started immediately after the
      placement of the spinal anesthetic Patient will also be given a placebo [1cc of N saline],
      with the starting of the infusion

      Following the administration of the study drug/placebo, the patient will be monitored for
      severity of nausea , vomiting and pain at 5 minutes intervals from placement of the spinal to
      delivery of the baby, and then at 15 minutes intervals from delivery of the baby till the end
      of the surgery ( the cesarean section)
