      with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Subjects charts were divided into two groups
      based on surgical technique and the following parameters were reviewed retrospectively:
      surgical time, blood loss, uterine weight, patient weight, patient age, post operative fever
      >100.4 F, readmission to hospital within one week, return to operating room within 24 hours,
      length of hospital stay, and blood transfusion. Group A, N=35 used traditional suture
      technique vaginally. Group B, N=44 used Enseal coagulation cutting device vaginally.
