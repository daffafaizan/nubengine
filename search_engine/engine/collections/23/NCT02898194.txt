      to make treatment decisions for patients who cannot decide on their own. This decision-making
      process is meant to promote medical care that accords with the patient s own preferences and
      values. However, empirical data suggest that this model faces two significant challenges.
      First, both surrogates and clinicians have trouble predicting which treatment course patients
      would have chosen. Second, given the nature of the decisions, surrogates often experience
      significant emotional distress as a result of making treatment decisions. To address these
      concerns it has been suggested that the shared decision-making process might be supplemented
      with a Patient Preference Predictor (PPP). A PPP would provide a prediction of which
      treatment a given patient would want based on the treatment preferences of similar patients
      in similar circumstances. The present study proposes to interview surrogates who have been
      involved in making decisions for an incapacitated patient to explore their perspectives on
      the PPP and how to incorporate it into medical decision-making for incapacitated patients..
