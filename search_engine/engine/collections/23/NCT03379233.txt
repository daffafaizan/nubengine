    
      This study was evaluating whether subjects with COPD on Ultibro® Breezhaler® clinical trial
      formulation once daily dosing regimen using the Concept2 inhaler in conjunction with a
      patient application collecting data and sending reminder notifications and
      motivational/adaptive messages aimed at encouraging treatment adherence, have improved
      treatment adherence compared to subjects using the Concept2 inhaler alone (usual care). The
      delivery of the medication and tracking of inhaler use is done by the Concept2 inhaler. The
      reminder notifications, feedback on inhaler use and motivational messages for the subject are
      sent by the patient application based on the received subjects inhaler use information from
      the Concept2 inhaler.

      The effect will be measured over 24 weeks on the subject's on time treatment adherence (days
      when the subjects inhaled within +/- 2 hours of the subjects preferred inhalation time) and
      total treatment adherence (days when patient inhaled at least one dose).

      The study population consisted male and female adult patients, 18 years or older with a
      clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of 10 pack years, receiving Ultibro Breezhaler
      treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening and documented poor treatment adherence.

      After 6 weeks of screening patients will be randomized to either the Usual Care group in
      which they will continue to receive Ultibro Breezhaler treatment via the Concept2, or the
      Telehealth group in which they will additionally receive a tablet device pre-installed with a
      patient app.

      In addition to on time treatment adherence and total treatment adherence, illness and
      treatment beliefs will be collected via a questionnaire and patient's health status from the
      EQ5D-5L and SGRQ-C Questionnaire. Key safety assessments are COPD exacerbation and AE/SAE,
      device deficiencies and device events, drug administration errors, physical exam, vital signs
      and urine or serum pregnancy test.
