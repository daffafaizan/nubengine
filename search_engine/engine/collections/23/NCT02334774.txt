      increased. Although endotracheal intubation is a life-sustaining procedure, its presence can
      deteriorate the structure and function of oropharynx, which may contribute to the
      difficulties in swallowing and subsequent oral intake. Estimated 62% of patients who had been
      intubated ≥48 hours will experience post-extubation dysphagia. Clearly, intervention is
      needed but studies are lacking in this regard. Thus, the objective of this pilot trial is to
      evaluate effects of an Oral Swallowing Care Program on swallowing and oral intake status in
      patients following prolonged endotracheal intubation.

      This study employs a pre-and post-intervention design. The investigators were enrolled 63
      post-extubated adult patients (50 years old and older) who had prolonged (≥48 hours) oral
      endotracheal intubation from six medical intensive care units at a medical center in Taipei,
      Taiwan.

      Participants were assessed within 48 hours post-extubation for the baseline data, then a
      14-day, daily Swallowing and Oral Care (SOC) Program involves toothbrushing/salivary gland
      massage, oral exercise(i.e., active/resistive range-of-motion[ROM] exercises for tongue,
      lips, and jaw), and advice on safe-swallowing strategies.

      Outcome were assessed on 2nd, 7th, 14th, and 21st day post-extubation including oral health
      status, oral sensation (stereognosis, light touch and two-point discrimination), tongue and
      lip strength, salivary secretion, body weight. In addition, Three-Step Swallowing Screen
      (3-SSS) and Functional Oral Intake Scale(FOIS) were assessed daily. The data were analyzed by
      SPSS 12 software package.
