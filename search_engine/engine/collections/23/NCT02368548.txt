    
      Clinical trial aimed to assess the impact of a pharmaceutical care program initiated in the
      Emergency Department vs standard care in patients with heart failure and/or COPD, conducted
      at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain) between Jan12-Feb13.

      The researchers hypothesize that a systematic, standardized pharmaceutical care program may
      be related to a lower frequency of drug related problems (DRP). Moreover, the investigators
      also hypothesize that 6-month mortality, the average length of the hospital stay, and its
      related cost may also be decreased.

      This study was approved by the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau Ethics Committee. Written
      informed consent will be obtained from the participants .

      The study will include 100 patients who fulfill all the inclusion criteria, described in the
      Eligibility Section.
