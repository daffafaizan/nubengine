      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as a maintenance therapy following standard rTMS treatment in major
      depressive disorder.

      A total of 45 patients will be recruited for this study. Patients who have completed a
      standard six-week rTMS treatment for major depressive disorder will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups: cluster rTMS, taper rTMS, and treatment as usual. Patients in the
      'cluster' group will receive two weeks of daily rTMS (10 rTMS sessions) six months after
      completing their rTMS treatment. Patients in the 'taper' group will receive rTMS immediately
      after completing rTMS treatment and the frequency of the sessions will be tapered as follows:
      three sessions a week for two weeks, and then two sessions a week for two weeks. The
      maintenance plan for patients in 'treatment as usual' group will be decided individually and
      may include any or all of the following: continue or start on medication, start psychotherapy
      and/or follow-up visits with psychiatrist or primary care provider.

      Each session of rTMS will be identical: lasting about one hour and consisting of 3000 high
      frequency (10 Hz) pulses. After finishing their last session of rTMS treatment, all patients
      will be seen by the rTMS psychiatrists bi-monthly for one year. Each visit will last
      approximately half an hour during which time the Hamilton Depression (Ham-D) Scale will be
      administered.

      Given the high relapse rates following rTMS treatment for depression, the investigators hope
      that results from this study will be very helpful to patients suffering from major depressive
      disorder in improving their quality of life by reducing their rate of relapse.
