      method of promoting access to care and provision of surgical services in the setting of an
      academic medical center teaching program. Target enrollment is 100 subjects having cataracts.
      Potential subjects will be identified through vision screening programs and if cataracts are
      found they will be offered MSICS at a price deemed to be affordable by individuals without
      insurance.

      A survey of Pima County providers found that $3500 was the lowest price offered to a self-pay
      patient for one-stage cataract extraction (CPT 66984) for PCS facility fee, surgeon fee, and
      anesthesia fee. The expectation is that MSICS can be delivered in a teaching environment at a
      cost of $500. The investigator wishes to determine if this price point is sustainable and if
      a continuing model of cataract visual rehabilitation service delivery can be safely,
      affordably, and ethically delivered to those who cannot afford to pay, while integrating
      resident education and autonomy into the delivery model.

      The proposed outcome measure is the proportion of eyes that see 20/40 or better while wearing
      glasses for those participants that do not have comorbid conditions.
