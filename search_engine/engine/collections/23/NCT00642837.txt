      especially in chronic diseases. Rheumatic disease is a chronic disease, which can result in a
      functional disability and impaired HRQOL. Because of this chronic pain, patients with
      rheumatic disease have lower scores on HRQOL than general population. A several studies have
      indicated Ultracet as an add-on treatment to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) for
      osteoarthritis(OA) pain, fibromyalgia pain and chronic low back pain significantly improved
      HRQOL, compared with placebo. We will use the KEQ-5D (a Korean version of the EQ-5D which is
      a health related quality of life questionnaire) to assess HRQOL. The KEQ-5D has been shown to
      be effectively sensitive in several rheumatic conditions. The study hypothesis is that the
      quality of life will be improved after Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets
      administration in outpatients who need Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets
      administration at the investigator's discretion. This is a multicenter, open-label,
      prospective, observational study to compare HRQOL using Korean version of EQ-5D before and
      after the treatment with Tramadol 37.5mg/Acetaminophen 325mg tablets and to assess the
      correlation among each measurement. Observational Study - No investigational drug
      administered
