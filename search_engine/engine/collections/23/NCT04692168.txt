      neuropathies are primarily sensory impairments that can alter the signals for somatosensory
      feedback and thus affect the control of balance in the standing position. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy and peripheral neuropathies on static
      balance in the standing position. As balance maintenance is a complex construct involving
      different systems, this study will evaluate maintenance strategies during sensory
      disturbances in order to better understand post-chemotherapy coping strategies. These sensory
      disturbances concern vision (eyes closed) and the alteration of the somatosensory system
      (foam under the feet and vibration system). In addition, this study will evaluate balance in
      double task situations and dynamic balance. Given the consequent impact of chemotherapy and
      peripheral neuropathies on quality of life, a quality of life questionnaire will also be
      administered.
