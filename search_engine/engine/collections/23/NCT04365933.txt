    
      In total 30 eligible patients will be enrolled and randomized at approximately 7 study sites.

      Patients will be randomized prior to study drug (EYP001a, ETV and peg-IFN) administration on
      Day 1 in the ratio of 1:1 into 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm 1: EYP001a QD + ETV 0.5 mg QD + peg-IFN dosed per body surface area (180 µg, 135 µg
           or 90 µg) QW (± 3 days) (15 patients)

        -  Arm 2: EYP001a QD + peg-IFN dosed per body surface area (180 µg, 135 µg or 90 µg) QW (±
           3 days) (15 patients)

      Patients enrolled in the study will be assessed as outpatients. Patient screening will occur
      no more than 37 days prior to the Day 1 visit. Eligible patients will undergo further
      assessments on Day 1 to qualify for study drug administration on Day 1.

      The visits during the study are planned as below:

        -  Screening visit: 5 weeks (37 days)

        -  16 weeks treatment period

        -  24 weeks maintenance period. During maintenance period patients are kept on ETV until
           the end of the trial at Week 40.
