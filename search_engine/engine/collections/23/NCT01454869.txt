      will be randomized to receive either standard care alone (control group) or standard care
      plus heparin nebulization in combination with intravenously administrated fresh frozen plasma
      (study group). Standard care treatment consist of: chest physiotherapy ,early ambulation,
      airway suctioning, bronchial hygiene therapy , salbutamol nebulization (100-200
      ÂµgQ4h)/N-acetyl cysteine 20% nebulization (3cc Q4h) and if needed mechanical ventilation
      support. Study care treatment consist of: Standard care + Heparin nebulized
      administration(5000U every 4 hours for 7 days) and fresh frozen plasma intravenously
      administration (10 cc/Kg daily for 7 days) The patients' primary outcome will be assessed for
      Lung Injury Scale (LIS) every day by using fallowing parameters: (1) chest X-ray evaluated
      for alveolar consolidation (2) ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to
      the inspiratory fraction of oxygen (3) PEEP level if ventilated (4) respiratory compliance if
      known Parameter Finding Value Rx.Torax no alveolar consolidation 0 alveolar consolidation de

      mL/cm H2O 3 compliance <= 19 mL/cm H2O 4 2 The patients' secondary outcome will be assessed
      for mortality(for 28 days post injury), Coagulation tests(PT,PTT) (for 7 days post
      injury),ICU and hospital stay(for 7 days post injury) and duration of mechanical ventilation
      support(for 7 days post injury). In each group 85 Patients will be selected by simple
      randomization. Allocation ratio is1:1. Blinding of this study was not possible.

      PEEP: positive end expiratory pressure- PaO2: partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood-
      FIO2: inspiratory fraction of oxygen PT: prothrombin time- PTT: partial thrombin time- ICU:
      intensive care unite- Rx: X-Ray
