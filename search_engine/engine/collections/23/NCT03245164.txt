      problems arising from childhood obesity should be determined. Although the effects of
      exercise and various sport branches on decrease obesity and obesity related problems, the
      effects of group exercises managed by physiotherapists and team sports on body composition
      and motor skills of obese children are not clear so health professionals may have
      difficulties while suggesting better physical activity for this population.

      Thus, body composition and motor skills of the included children were recorded at the
      beginning. They were then grouped into three in order to compare the effects of group
      exercises and basketball. Children in the control group did not participate in any of them.
      Intervention lasted 12 weeks so they were then taken to the assessments at the end of this
      duration.
