      combination with Rebetol will enhance the elimination of Hepatitis C in treatment na√Øve
      patients with genotype 1 and 4.

      Currently PEG-Interferon alfa-2b plus Ribavirin results in a sustained response in 54-61% of
      patients with Hepatitis C. Those with genotype 1and 4 and high viral loads are the most
      likely to have a less favorable response. The administration of induction dose interferon in
      combination with Ribavirin may yield an improved sustained response rate in these more
      difficult to treat patients with chronic Hepatitis C.
