      to 1-3% of the active population. Invalidity and health care costs incurred by this condition
      are posing a real challenge to our societies knowing that the natural history of the lateral
      epicondylitis can last from 1 to 2 years. Many therapies have been tested and so far none has
      proven conclusive when used alone so far (Blanchette and Normand 2011). The use of
      cryostimulation is widespread in the sport scene without strong literature supporting its
      evidence. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of cryostimulation when added to
      conservative care in the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylitis.

      Thirty (30) patients will be divided randomly in two groups:

        -  The control group (n=15) will receive conservative care including myofascial trigger
           points (involved forearm) and radial head mobilisations (Bergmann & Peterson, 2010).

        -  The experimental group (n=15) will receive the cryostimulation and the conservative
           treatment as mentioned above.

      A total of eight treatments will be given to each patient; the whole protocol lasting four to
      six weeks. The treatments will be delivered by experienced and trained clinicians in
      cryostimulation and myofascial treatment protocols.

      The effects of the two treatment protocols will be monitored by a validated elbow
      questionnaire (PRTEE, (Rompe, Overend et al. 2007)), a visual analog pain scale and the pain
      free grip strength at three moments: at inclusion, at the ninth visit and 3 months after the
      last treatment.
