      reduce the risks of neonatal death and morbidities, such as respiratory distress syndrome.

      Standard of care for women at risk of preterm birth includes 2 doses of 12 mg betamethasone
      (for a total of 24 mg) to accelerate fetal lung maturity. There are no published clinical
      trial data on the benefits or risks of a single dose of antenatal corticosteroid vs. standard
      double doses.

      Pilot trials are now viewed as an "almost essential prerequisite" to large, expensive, full
      scale studies. Thus, we plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial to determine the feasibility
      of a trial comparing half the usual dose (12 mg of betamethasone + placebo) to the standard
      double dose (12 mg + 12 mg of betamethasone), as well as the feasibility of the study
      protocol. Secondary outcomes will include process outcomes, clinical outcomes, maternal
      experiences, and provider outcomes.
