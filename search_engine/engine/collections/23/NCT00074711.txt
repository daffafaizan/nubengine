    
      Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease. Calcium supplements normally used in
      anti-osteoporosis treatment are calcium salts of carbonate or citrate; however, these salts
      bind phosphorus from food in the intestine and restrict phosphorus available for bone
      building. This study will evaluate the efficacy of adding calcium phosphate to a regimen of
      teriparatide and vitamin D in increasing bone mineral density in women with osteoporosis. It
      is hypothesized that the group taking the phosphate-containing calcium supplement will have
      greater gains in bone mineral density (BMD) during the course of the study than the group not
      receiving phosphate.

      All participants will receive teriparatide and vitamin D during the course of the 12-month
      study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive
      calcium phosphate and the other will receive calcium carbonate. BMD will be measured at spine
      and hip at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment.
