      surgery will suffer brain injury during surgery (the perioperative period). Some infants with
      congenital heart disease have neurological injury prior to cardiac surgery as a result of
      cyanosis, acidosis and abnormal circulation. The spectrum of neurological injury ranges from
      agitation and subtle disturbances in learning and new memory acquisition to visual and motor
      development abnormalities, seizures, stroke and encephalopathy.

      The patient will be identified from the cardiothoracic surgery database. Their hospital
      medical records and the neurological database will be reviewed for type of neurological
      complication (i.e. seizure, stroke), neuro-imaging and any mortality for these patients. We
      will review the patient outcome data that is available, after the initial surgery, through
      June 20, 2006. No patients will be contacted.
