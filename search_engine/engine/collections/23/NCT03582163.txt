      All patients with PD two or more years status post DBS will be contacted via phone and/or
      mailed letter. Any interested patient will be mailed or e-mailed (via RedCAP) a copy of the
      study informed consent form. Willing patients will present to the Vanderbilt Movement
      Disorders Clinic for an opportunity to inquire further about the study and sign the informed
      consent form in person.

      Participants will have a single study visit, ideally coordinated with their regularly
      scheduled neurology follow-up. During the study visit, the following evaluations will be
      performed by a trained research assistant:

      Video-recorded UPDRS III BDI MMSE PDQ-39 In addition, current PD medications and number of
      falls in the past 6 months will be recorded. Assessments will occur in the on-medication,
      on-DBS state.

      The video-recorded UPDRS III will be reviewed and score at a subsequent date by a blinded
      rater (movement discord trained neurologist).
