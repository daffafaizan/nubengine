      the GLA gene coding for the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (Î±-GAL A). As a consequence
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the enzyme's substrate, is not metabolized efficiently. The
      result is progressive accumulation of Gb3 and related glycosphinglolipids, particularly in
      blood vessels of the skin, kidney, heart and brain, causing severe complications such as
      cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and other cardiovascular related issues, as well
      as renal failure and end stage renal disease, ischemic stroke and peripheral neuropathy.

      RVX000222 is a BET inhibitor which modulates the expression of a variety of genes; in a
      number of Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials RVX000222 significantly affected markers of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alkaline
      phosphatase, components of the complement and coagulation cascades, and markers of reverse
      cholesterol transport in patients with CVD. Due to its beneficial effects on several pathways
      downstream of Gb3 accumulation and MACE reduction, RVX000222 holds promise as a potential
      add-on therapy to accompany enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in FD patients. In addition to
      regulating disease related pathways, RVX000222 treatment significantly affects putative
      markers associated with FD such as Afamin and intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules
      in cell cultures.
