      taking dopamine agonist (DAA) medications. While these abnormal social behaviors have been
      studied in other neurodegenerative disorders, the true incidence of social problems, and the
      relationship to dopamine therapy, in PD patients remains unknown. This study is aiming to
      determine if dopamine agonists alter social decision-making and to determine if impaired
      social decision-making relates to dopamine-induced mesolimbic network dysfunction in PD
      patients. The protocol will include a screening visit, and on-DAA visit, and an off-DAA
      visit. For both the on and off DAA visits, participants will continue taking
      Carbidopa-Levodopa, but will withdrawal off of other PD related medications to reduce
      circulating drugs and residual drug effects. Both visits will include an MRI, fMRI shock
      task, questionnaires to be filled out by other the participant and the caregiver,
      moral-decision making computer tasks, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      (UPDRS) part II and III. For the on-DAA visit, participants will take Carbidopa-Levodopa 1
      hour before the scan and will take 1mg of Pramipexole 1 hour before the scan. For the off-DAA
      visit, participants will take Carbidopa-Levodopa 1 hour before the scan and will take a
      placebo 1 hour before the scan. Participants will remind blinded to which medication they are
      receiving that day and will be counterbalanced such that all participants will not take the
      Pramipexole or placebo on the same days.
