      antibody A33 (MOAB A33) when combined with carmustine, fluorouracil, vincristine, and
      streptozocin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. II. Determine the effect of
      chemotherapy on human antihuman antibody response and on the pharmacokinetics of humanized
      MOAB A33 in these patients. III. Define the humanized MOAB A33 dose for a phase II study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (MOAB A33).
      Patients receive humanized MOAB A33 IV once a week for 14 weeks. Chemotherapy begins on day
      29 and consists of carmustine IV on days 29-33, fluorouracil IV on days 29-33 and 64-68,
      vincristine IV on days 29 and 64, and streptozocin IV every 7 days, beginning on day 29, for
      10 doses. Courses repeat every 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of humanized MOAB A33. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-18 patients accrued into this study over 2-9 months.
