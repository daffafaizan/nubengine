    
      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational, no profit study
      including adult patients with LCH, diagnosed starting from January 2001 to two years after
      the first enrolled patient. Data from patients, diagnosed from January 2001 to the date of
      patient enrolment, is considered retrospective, while data collected after patient enrolment,
      and up to two years after the first enrolled patient, is considered prospective. At least one
      year of follow-up is expected for each patient. Each patient will be followed up to one year
      after the last enrolled patient. This study plans to collect clinical information at the time
      of diagnosis and at various follow-ups to evaluate the efficacy of first-line therapies.
      Diagnostic and therapeutic data will be collected from routine clinical evaluations and
      laboratory and instrumental investigations carried out during clinical practice. A sub-cohort
      of patients with available biological data on somatic mutations of the RAF-MEK-ERK genes will
      also be evaluated.
