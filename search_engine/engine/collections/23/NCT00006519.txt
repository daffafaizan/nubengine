    
      This is a pediatric phase I dose escalation study to determine a biologically active dose and
      to obtain information concerning the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      capravirine (AG
      1549)(5-[(3,5-dichlorophenyl)thio]-4-(1-methylethyl)-1-(4-pyridinylmethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-meth
      anol carbamate), a potent non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, that
      induces a novel pattern of resistance mutations. In addition to obtaining needed biological
      activity, pediatric safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, the study will utilize
      capravirine's potent antiretroviral activity and novel resistance mutation pattern, together
      with serial measurements of plasma HIV viral load, flow cytometry, and genotypic and
      phenotypic viral resistance analysis to conduct pilot studies in pediatric HIV pathogenesis,
      the response to antiretroviral therapy, and to develop strategies to optimize the management
      of pediatric antiretroviral therapy. We will also use initial viral decay dynamics and other
      patient characteristics to model predictions for the long-term response to antiretroviral
      therapy. We will enroll children who have become refractory to or have experienced toxicity
      on prior therapy. The study will include resistance testing on the failing regimen, a one
      week period off antiretrovirals (washout period), an initial 6 days of capravirine
      monotherapy followed by capravirine in combination with the optimal antiretroviral therapy as
      determined by their baseline viral resistance mutation pattern and history. The patients will
      be followed for at least 48 weeks to assess long-term tolerability and toxicity, and to
      assess the clinical, virological, and immunological response to capravirine.
