      interventions were occurred in post anesthetic care unit (PACU). In the operating room, all
      patients received a standardized anesthetic regimen by one anesthetist. Sevoflurane was used
      for maintenance without any opioids. Before the end of the procedure, spontaneous respiratory
      was recovered. All the patients were given 1 mcg/kg fentanyl intravenous injection after the
      end of the procedure. The positive result was defined as spontaneous respiratory rate
      decreased more than 50%, the others were defined as negative result. The result of fentanyl
      test submitted to assistant, and prepared the rescue analgesic drugs according to this
      result. One group: positive result 10μg/kg morphine; negative result 50μg/kg morphine.
      Another group: all received 25μg/kg morphine .The trachea was extubated when patients were
      awake, and then transported to the PACU. Patients with a Children's Hospital of Eastern
      Ontario Pain Scale score>6 received rescue analgesic drugs and observe respiratory morbidity
      in each group.
