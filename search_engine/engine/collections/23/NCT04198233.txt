      techniques for hysterectomy including vaginal and laparoscopic routes are preferred over the
      more invasive abdominal procedures, which are associated with more pain, longer hospital
      stays, and increased rates of complications.

      Research has continued to provide evidence that same day discharge (SDD) after hysterectomy
      is safe, cost effective, and well received by patients. Pain is a common concern for patients
      undergoing major pelvic surgery and pain must be well controlled prior to discharge home.

      Rectal administrations of medications are an attractive option postoperatively in patients
      desiring SDD. Rectal analgesia avoids 1st pass metabolism in the liver, leading to increased
      bioavailability of many medications and fewer side effects such as nausea and vomiting.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether perioperative administration of a rectally
      administered diazepam suppository results in improved pain scores between 3.5 and 6 hours
      postoperatively in patients undergoing major vaginal pelvic reconstructive surgery.
