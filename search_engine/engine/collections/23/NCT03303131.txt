    
      Comparison of patient characteristics and treatment outcomes was conducted between two
      groups: 1) children discharged as recovered from September 2007 to March 2009 with at least
      15% of their weight at admission (Period A); and 2) children discharged as recovered from
      April 2009 to December 2011 with MUAC ≥ 124 mm (Period B).

      A total of 50,841 children were admitted with MUAC ≤ 118 mm to the MSF therapeutic feeding
      program and were included in this analysis: 24,792 children in Period A (2007-2009) and
      26,049 children in Period B (2009-2011).

      Overall, 89% of admissions were directly into outpatient care and the majority (53%) entered
      with a MUAC 116-118mm; 48% of children were male and 80% of children < 2 years of age (Table
      1).

      Compared to children admitted in Period A, children admitted in Period B were statistically
      more likely to be female, younger, and of better anthropometric status (e.g. higher mean
      MUAC, WHZ and HAZ).

      There was a greater proportion of children admitted directly to inpatient care in Period B
      than in Period A (10.6% vs 8.0%).
