      about definitive chemoradiation (CRT) compared with esophagectomy in Chinese patients with
      locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is limited.

      Aim: to compare outcomes in Chinese patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal
      squamous cell cancer who have received either surgery or definitive chemoradiation (CRT).

      Methods: 176 ESCC patients with T1bN+M0, T2-4aN0-2M0 will be randomized to CRT group or
      Surgery group.In the CRT group, patients will be given intensity modulation radiation therapy
      (IMRT) with 50Gy/25 fractions , and current chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) basic
      regimens. In the surgery group, patients will received standard esophagectomy. 5 years
      follow-up for both groups patients.

      Primary endpoints: 2 year and 5 year Disease free survival, Overall survival Second
      endpoints: treatment-related adverse events; the quality of life
