      safety follow-up period, and extended progression free survival (PFS) follow-up period, as
      defined in Dose Escalation Stage (Stage I). Dose escalation will be performed according to a
      modified toxicity probability interval scheme-2 (mTPI-2).To further characterize safety and
      efficacy of HMPL-689 at RP2D, expansion stage of the study will enroll 56 patients with B
      cell lymphoma, including CLL, SLL, FL, MZL, WM, DLBCL, burkitt lymphoma and MCL. Patients
