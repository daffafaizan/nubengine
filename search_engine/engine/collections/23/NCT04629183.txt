    
      Patients with inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria, evaluated in the
      participating EDs, will be enrolled in the study. Patients will undergo standard medical
      evaluation by the attending physician(s), following local guidelines and best medical
      practice, independent of participation to the study.

      The following data will be recorded, when available:

        -  Demographic/clinical: age, gender, symptoms (type, time from onset), comorbidities,
           Glasgow Coma Scale score, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation

        -  Biochemical: urea, creatinine, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase,
           white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, d-dimer

        -  Lung ultrasonography: site/type of B lines, consolidations, pleural effusion

        -  Radiology: chest X-ray result, chest CT result

      Upon discharge, patients will be encouraged to contact emergency medical services or return
      the ED if needed, in case of clinical worsening.

      The following endpoint will be assessed at 30 days after ED discharge, through standardized
      telephone interview and healthcare/other database query: any further hospital admission (for
      COVID-19 or other disease), death (for COVID-19 or other disease), respiratory
      failure/ventilation/intensive care admission (only for hospitalized COVID-19 patients).

      Data analysis will focus on the outcome incidence in the study cohort, stratified by a
      composite of demographic/clinical, biochemical and imaging variables. A key stratification
      tool will be the 4C mortality score (BMJ 2020; 370 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3339).
      Additional integration of study variables will be evaluated to improve stratification and
      prediction.
