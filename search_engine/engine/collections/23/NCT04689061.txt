      and Biocomposite FastThread Interference Screws used for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and
      Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) repair or reconstruction (PCL at US sites only,
      Biocomposite screw PCL only).

      To assess safety, device-related adverse events will be reported and evaluated over the
      course of the study. To evaluate effectiveness, patient reported outcomes will be collected
      at 3 months postoperative, 6 months postoperative, and one year postoperative using the
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for measuring pain in the affected knee and the Knee Injury and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) as well as Range of Motion (ROM, optional) for measuring
      knee functionality.
