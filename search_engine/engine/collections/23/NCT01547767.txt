      the official human gene name for a gene involved in assembly of iron sulfur clusters, and is
      abbreviated from Iron Sulfur Cluster assembly protein, U, which was identified as the cause
      of a rare myopathy that affected about 25 patients in Sweden. This protocol is intended to
      allow for the collection and analysis of clinical specimens and medical information from
      several research subjects who previously participated in studies that led to identification
      of the disease gene.
