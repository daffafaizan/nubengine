      hospitalized in Veneto Region (Italy) for SARS-COVID-2 infection in 2 types of settings,
      medical environment (COORTE MED), and intensive / sub-intensive (COORTE ICU), to assess the
      safety and possible efficacy of the anticoagulant treatments used for thromboprophylaxis, or
      in preventing thrombotic complications related to hospitalization from COVID-19.

      Furthermore, the possible association between the observed clinical evolution and the type of
      antithrombotic prophylaxis performed (class of drug and dose intensity) will be assessed in a
      large cohort of patients hospitalized in the various participating hospitals in the Veneto
      region and observed with follow-up. in the short term, gathering information on:

      Clinical outcomes, Survival, Concomitant pathologies, Adverse events of anticoagulant drugs,
      Interactions with other concomitant drugs, and Risk factors.

      The collected data, suitably anonymized, will be used to produce scientific works, the
      standardization of care paths, and the planning of targeted training events.
