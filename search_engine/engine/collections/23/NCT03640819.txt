      with newly diagnosed breast cancer is becoming routine practice. Tagging of biopsied axillary
      lymph nodes with metal markers, similar to what is done for suspicious breast lesions, is
      being adopted in clinical practice. The need to mark a positive axillary lymph node becomes
      especially relevant in cases where neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is anticipated so that
      these nodes may be identified at the time of surgery. Measures that improve both the accuracy
      of nodal evaluation after NACT and the ability to assess treatment response are desirable in
      order to tailor therapies for breast cancer treatment. The investigators sought to test
      tattooing of biopsied axillary lymph nodes with a sterile black carbon suspension (Spot dye).
      The concept is based on the experience in the gastrointestinal tract wherein tattooing is
      widely used for marking lesions or tumours biopsied during endoscopy. India ink tattoos of
      colonic lesions remain identifiable over a long period of time. Spot is routinely used in the
      UK for tattooing gastrointestinal tract lesions and is used to mark the axillary lymph nodes
      in breast cancer by some centres in the US and Europe. The intraoperative success of
      identifying tattooed axillary lymph nodes and their concordance to sentinel nodes will be
      determined.
