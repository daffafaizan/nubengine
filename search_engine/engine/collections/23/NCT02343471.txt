      diabetes will consume a test meal prior to a fat-rich meal. The test meals contain 2
      different meal types; on where whey protein is consumed as a pre-meal and another where water
      is the pre-meal. In the second meal type whey protein is instead consumed as a part of the
      fat-rich meal. Blood samples are collected before consumption of the pre-meal and after
      consumption of the fat-rich isocaloric meal during 360 minutes. The fat-rich isocaloric meal
      is a breakfast containing 1043 kcal (15 E% protein, 65 E% fat and 20 E% carbohydrates). The
      main-meal is composed of white bread, rye bread, butter, cheese (45 %), salami, egg, bacon,
      milk (1.5 % fat) and coffee (decaffeinated) and should be consumed over 15 min. Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) will be used for determination of subjective satiety feeling.
