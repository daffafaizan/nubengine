      and post-traumatic headache with migrainous features. More and better prophylactic drugs with
      fewer side effects (such as weight gain) are needed to treat these disabling, refractory
      conditions which generally have less than a 50% response rate to preventative treatments.

      Rare forms of severe familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) are considered channelopathies and
      can be caused by mutations in a calcium channel gene. Serotonin is also known to be a
      critical neurotransmitter in migraine based on the pharmacology of acute and preventative
      treatments. We previously identified a "migraine" signaling pathway in an invertebrate C.
      elegans "hemiplegic migraine" model of a mutant calcium channel upstream from transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and showed that low serotonin levels can be rescued by
      treatment with the childhood antiepileptic drug ethosuximide (ESX).

      Objective: We propose to test our findings from this invertebrate migraine model to determine
      its relevance to humans in the prevention of episodic migraine.

      Primary Aim: Determine whether ethosuximide (ESX) will be significantly more effective than
      placebo in reducing migraine headache days. We propose a 3 year, double blind, phase 1/2
      randomized, 2:1 ESX:placebo controlled parallel trial in episodic migraineurs comparing
      migraine headache days during the last 4 weeks of treatment to a pre-treatment 4 week
      baseline.
