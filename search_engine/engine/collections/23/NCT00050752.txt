    
      Background:

        -  Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) is a rare autosomal dominantly
           inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to develop cutaneous and uterine
           leiomyomas and renal cell carcinoma.

        -  HLRCC is caused by mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase localized on
           chromosome 1q42.3-q43.

      Objectives:

        -  Define the risk of developing renal cancer, cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma in
           this hereditary cancer syndrome

        -  Define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer
           associated with HLRCC.

        -  Determine the incidence and characteristics of HLRCC-associated fumarate hydratase gene
           mutations.

        -  Determine genotype/phenotype correlations.

        -  Determine if other genes caused HLRCC.

      Eligibility:

      -An individual from a family in which one or more biological family members have:

        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and kidney cancer.

        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma.

        -  Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma.

        -  Kidney cancer and uterine leiomyomata.

        -  Renal tumor histology consistent with HLRCC including, but not limited to: Collecting
           Duct and/ or Papillary, Type II.

      Design:

        -  These rare biological families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis,
           determine size and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and
           metastatic potential of renal tumors.

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.
