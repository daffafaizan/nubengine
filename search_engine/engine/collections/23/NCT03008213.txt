    
      This is a Phase II, single-center, single-arm, open-label, feasibility trial using a fixed
      dose combination of netupitant and palonosetron (Akynzeo速) in the treatment of refractory
      CINV. The primary aim of this study is feasibility, defined as 70% completion rate of all
      study procedures over 7 days.

      Eligible subjects will be identified in weekly palliative care patient triage meetings.
      Patients who are 18 years of age or older, have histologically confirmed cancer, and
      confirmed refractory CINV will be eligible. After obtaining written informed consent and
      verifying that the study subject meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will be enrolled
      in the study through the University California San Diego (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center Clinical
      Trials Office. Subjects will be allowed to participate only once in the study. Study Day 1
      will be the day of Akynzeo速 dosing. Subjects will receive a single capsule of Akynzeo速 (300
      mg of netupitant and 0.5 mg of palonosetron) on Study 1. Study drug may be taken with or
      without food. Subjects will complete a study drug diary to document date and time of Akynzeo速
      administration. On Study Day 1, the study coordinator will educate the subject on how to
      complete the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Antiemesis Tool,
      and Functional Living Index Emesis (FLIE) scale, and medication diary and each of these
      documents will be completed for that day. An adequate number of copies of each subject
      questionnaire and diary will be provided to the subject on Study Day 1 for completion at home
      during the post-treatment observation portion of the study (Study Days 2-7) as needed.
