      administered rectally to HIV-1 seronegative adults.

      Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of either rectally administered
      dapivirine gel (0.05%) or placebo gel at study entry (Day 0). Following a minimum 2-week
      washout period, participants or study staff will administer daily rectal doses of the
      assigned gel for 7 consecutive days under direct observation in the clinic.

      Participants will be in the study for approximately 40 days, and they will attend 16 study
      visits. Study visits may include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and
      urine collection, and pelvic and anorectal sample collection. Some visits will include
      intensive PK sampling. Study staff will contact participants 1 week after Visit 16 for
      follow-up safety monitoring.
