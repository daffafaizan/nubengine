      participate in congregate meal sites or other community groups in Florida. Demographic
      information will be collected and participants will be assessed by the MNAÂ® (Mini Nutrition
      Assessment) and screened by the COAST nutrition screening tool. Participants' hand grip
      strength and performance on the five times Sit to Stand test will be used to evaluate their
      functional status. Weight, height, mid-arm circumference and calf circumference will be
      measured as part of the MNA screening tool.
