      upregulating the bone remolding process, resulting in the deposition of calcium phosphate
      minerals into the collagen matrix of bone. Bone remodeling is a continually active process
      that involves both activation cells regulating bone formation (osteoblasts) and resorption
      (osteoclasts). Alterations in the balance between formation and resorption are critical for
      changes in bone density and mineral content to occur, which is regulated by several hormones
      including vitamin D and growth hormone, the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone, and
      parathyroid hormone. Importantly, it remains unclear how single bouts of physical activity
      contribute to the overall changes in remodeling and whether those acute alterations can be
      detected in the hours after exercise. Additionally, research studies examining the effects of
      exercise on bone remodeling often draw blood samples after 24 hours of physical inactivity,
      potentially diminishing the magnitude of the exercise response. Therefore, we plan to
      evaluate the acute effects of plyometrics and resistance exercise on changes in serum
      hormones and markers of bone turnover in non-sedentary, healthy males, with or without a
      moderate calorie supplement.
