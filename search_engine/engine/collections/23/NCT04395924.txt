      SARS-Cov-2 on nasopharyngeal swabs and/or by serologies.

      After informed consent the ivestigators will proceed during labor to:

        1. A vaginal swab of amniotic fluid during the rupture of the water pocket during labor.

        2. a blood sample from the umbilical cord after delivery of the newborn and clamping and
           sectioning of the cord. PCR Covid-19 and serologies (Ig M and Ig G) as well as
           investigating viral proteome and cytokines.

           These are additional samples in addition to the routine samples which have no impact and
           without risk for the mother the newborn since they are taken after delivery from the
           side of the placenta after clamping and sectioning of the cord.

        3. Samples of 2 fragments of placenta after delivery of the placenta for COVID-19 research,
           which usually goes to waste or to pathology depending on the clinical context or for
           infectious tests. In all cases, samples of 3 to 4 cm3 will be taken which will in no way
           interfere with current analyzes carried out on the placenta which weighs one third of
           the fetal weight on average. A viral search by COVID-19 PCR will be carried out on the
           placenta fragment and another part will be frozen for analysis by electron microscopy
           and study of the viral proteome, cytokines and immune mechanisms. Placenta samples will
           be frozen at -80 degrees.
