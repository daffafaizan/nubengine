      Thirty older adults (aged 60-80) at-risk for diabetes will be randomly assigned into one of
      two groups: 1) Resistance training, or 2) Balance and Tone training (control). All
      participants will engage in three one-hour exercise classes per week. Once a month, a neutral
      assessor will visit the classes to evaluate the quality of the classes for participants.
      Assessments will be made at baseline, midpoint (three months) and trial completion (six
      months), and will include cognitive testing, health questionnaires, physical testing, and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; to assess structural and functional brain changes).
      Throughout the study, investigators will examine data for trends in successful recruitment
      strategies and rates of recruitment and adherence to inform future clinical trials in this
      population. Research assistants (n = 30) in the study will complete an anonymous feedback
      survey upon completion of their volunteer term, to assist in improving the study for future
      participants and volunteers.
