      specific treatment for urethral pain syndrome (UPS), and it is recommended this type of
      patients should be treated in a multi-disciplinary and multi-modal program. Since some
      mechanisms for the development of UPS suggest it may be a form of bladder pain syndrome (BPS)
      due to the intimate relation of the urethra with the bladder (both covered with urothelium),
      a combination of intravesical hyaluronic acid and lidocaine plus sodium bicarbonate, the more
      widely used regimen for BPS in China, is also applied to UPS here in China. However, the
      symptom relief of the intravesical irrigation won't last long and patients usually report
      recurrence in 2-3 weeks. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore whether the
      electrical pudendal nerve stimulation（EPNS）, which has been proven effective in treating BPS,
      is more effective than intravesical instillation (intravesical hyaluronic acid and lidocaine
      plus sodium bicarbonate) in patients with UPS.
