      patients with advances non-small cell lung cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of SUV and metabolic volume
      measured by FDG PETScan in the early prediction of treatment response.

      80 patients will be included in 2 years. They will be follow up for one year for monitoring
      the progression free survival.
