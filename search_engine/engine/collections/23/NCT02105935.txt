      changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which
      are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions
      of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both
      a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal
      information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by
      using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is
      improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological
      knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA™) to
      temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization.

      The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the
      BNA™ test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain
      functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.
