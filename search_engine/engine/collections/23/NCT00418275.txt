      developed countries, has an overall prevalence of 794 per 100,000. In the United States, it
      is estimated that more than 400,000 patients are discharged each year from hospitals after a
      stroke. The loss of these patients from the work force and the extended hospitalization they
      require during recovery make serious economic impact. In Taiwan, Cerebrovascular disease is
      the second cause of death.
