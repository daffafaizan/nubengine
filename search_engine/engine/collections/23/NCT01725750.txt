      in reducing post-TBI fatigue, an 8-week, randomized parallel-group clinical trial will be
      performed. Outcome assessment will be blinded. Participants will complete a baseline battery
      (T1) including 72 hours of actigraphy. Participants will then be randomized to either the
      Bright White Light (BWL) or the Dim Red Light (DRL) group. After 4 weeks of daily, 30-minute
      light treatments, the baseline battery will be re-administered (T2) along with 3 more days of
      Actigraphy. A follow-up assessment involving the same measures will be administered 1
      month-post cessation of light therapy (T3). Participant treatment allocations will be masked
      for research team members conducting outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will be
      administered to explore the effects of light therapy on mood, daytime sleepiness, sleep
      quality, circadian rhythms, anxiety, cognition and life satisfaction.
