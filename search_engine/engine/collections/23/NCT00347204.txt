      United States. Although Laser-Assisted in-situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) is the more popular
      technique, a growing number of surgeons have switched to surface ablation techniques,
      including PRK, LASEK and Epi-LASIK.1 With surface laser procedures, the corneal epithelium is
      removed by a variety of techniques (laser, manual debridement, diluted alcohol2,3,
      epi-keatome) prior to laser reshaping of the corneal stroma. Following the procedure, a
      contact lens is placed on the eye to promote epithelial regeneration. Due to the size of the
      epithelial defect, it can take between 3 to 6 days for the epithelium to regenerate. During
      this healing process, patients often complain of moderate to severe ocular pain, and delayed
      healing may result in an increased risk of infection or corneal haze4.

      Over the past decade, a variety of methods have been used to assist with reducing pain
      following surface laser procedures. Topical Nonsteroidals have been shown in a number of
      studies to help reduce the degree of pain following PRK. Topical dilute tetracaine has also
      been shown to assist with the reduction of pain following PRK. Oral pain medications, such as
      Vioxx, Celebrex, and even Prednisone have been recommended as additional treatment options
      for pain control.

      In October 2005, a new topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drop, Nevanac, was approved by
      the FDA. Nevanac was approved with a a TID dosing schedule.

      Acular LS is the current market leader for topical NSAID eye drops. Acular LS is typically
      used on a QID dosing schedule.
