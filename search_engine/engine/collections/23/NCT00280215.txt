      disposition of glyoxylate results in marked hyperoxaluria. Calcium oxalate crystals and high
      oxalate concentrations in the renal filtrate result in inflammation and injury in the renal
      parenchyma. Loss of renal function over time is characteristic, with end stage renal failure
      occurring in half the patients by age 35 years, but as early as infancy in some patients.
      Experience in animal models of hyperoxaluria, and from other renal diseases, supports a role
      for ACEI and ARB medications in ameliorating inflammation and injury thus providing a renal
      protective effect.

      We propose to study the short-term effect of combined angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
      (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) therapy in patients with PH, in a controlled,
      randomized, two-year study. Primary endpoints will be urinary markers of renal tubular injury
      (retinol binding protein (RBP), alpha 1 microglobulin (α1m), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT))
      and interstitial fibrosis (transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1). Secondary endpoints
      will be the rates of change in renal tubular injury and renal function as determined by serum
      creatinine and creatinine clearance.
