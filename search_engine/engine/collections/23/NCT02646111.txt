    
      Patients with genotype 1 HCV, who underwent past triple therapy (Telaprevir, Boceprevir or
      Simeprevir with Pegylated interferon / Ribavirin) and are non-responders, partial responders
      or in relapse - will be screened in all research centers up to 30 days before the first
      treatment.

      At the end of the initial assessment - the recruited participants will be allocated to
      different treatment groups in accordance with the hepatitis virus subtype 1a, 1b and presence
      of cirrhosis, as follows:

        -  Group A - genotype 1b without cirrhosis - 12 weeks of treatment *

        -  Group B - genotype 1b with cirrhosis - 12 weeks of treatment

        -  Group C - genotype 1a without cirrhosis - 12 weeks of treatment

        -  Group D - genotype 1a with cirrhosis - 24 weeks of treatment

      (* Only this group will not get Ribavirin)

      During the treatment period, participants will be asked to describe the treatment's
      tolerability (in terms of side effects) using self-administered questionnaires: SF-36, and
      WPAI Hep C v2.0.

      The follow up will also include physical assessments, side effects documentation, blood
      tests, abdominal Ultrasound and Fibroscan.
