      who are younger than 5 years of age and have a venipuncture blood sample taken at the babies
      Milk Fund Clinic will be eligible for this study. After checking the lists for errors and
      duplications, we will randomly permute the sampling frame, stratifying on children's blood
      lead concentration. Stratification will be used to enroll about 33% of the sample with blood
      lead concentrations below 5 mg/dl, 33% between 5 to 10 mg/dl, and 33% of 10 mg/dl or higher.
      Stratifying the sample will improve our chances of testing the predictive validity of home
      sampling kits to identify children who have blood lead concentration > 10 mg/dl collected by
      families. In addition this study will:

        1. Develop a pesticide wipe sampling kit to accompany our lead-sampling kit.

        2. Evaluate the predictive validity of home sampling kits for lead-contaminated floor dust
           to identify children who have blood lead levels of 10 mg/dl or higher by community
           participants compared with repeat samples taken by trained, community workers.

        3. Evaluate the reliability of home sampling kits for pesticides in dust collected by
           community participants compared with trained, community workers.

        4. Disseminate data on the reliability of home sampling tests and provide tools for
           families to collect environmental samples for large, population-based studies.

        5. Develop a Healthy Homes Resource Center at the Better Housing League to disseminate
           information to the community about residential hazards.
