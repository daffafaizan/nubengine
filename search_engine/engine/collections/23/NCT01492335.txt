      obtain services solely through the general practice/family practice sector of healthcare.
      Effective and optimal management of older patients with multiple complex medical conditions
      and compromised cognitive functioning will be a challenge for the primary care physician
      (PCP). Early identification of older patients with cognitive deficits should allow early
      referral for diagnostic work-up and earlier treatment and better patient outcomes. The goal
      of this study is to investigate the utility of providing cognitive testing in the PCP office.
      PCPs will be randomized to either Treatment As Usual (TAU) or Cognitive Report (CR). The
      study hypotheses are (1) patients of physicians in the CR group will have improved clinical
      outcomes i.e. cognitively impaired patients in the CR group will have a slower rate of
      progression of cognitive deficits over two years than cognitively impaired patients in the
      TAU group; (2) PCPs in the CR group will order dementia screening tests, refer to specialists
      and prescribe anticholinesterase inhibitors more frequently than PCPs in the TAU group.
