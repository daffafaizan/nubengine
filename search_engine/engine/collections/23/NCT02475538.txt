      insomnia. Primary insomnia patients receiving electroacupuncture showed an increase in sleep
      diary-derived sleep efficiency from an average of 69.8% at baseline to 81.2% at 1-week
      post-treatment. A similar result was found in patients with residual insomnia associated with
      major depressive disorder.

      Acupuncture is efficacious in alleviating anxiety and insomnia symptoms; hence, it may help
      to reduce the impacts of withdrawal symptoms during benzodiazepine tapering. However, there
      has been no randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on
      benzodiazepine discontinuation.
