      dose of 100 mg per day for 12 weeks or matching placebo. The chances of receiving anamorelin
      or placebo are 1 in 2. Which subject receives anamorelin or placebo will be decided at
      random. Neither the subject nor the study doctor will know which study drug the subject is
      receiving. The subject will be asked to visit the clinic at Day 1, Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84.
      There will also be a Day 112 follow-up visit and the medical records will be checked after
      that to see how the subjects are doing.
