      the largest health risks facing the world today. In recent years, foreign and domestic
      scholars have gradually introduced the concept of " Exercise is Medicine " guide the the
      public exercise scientifically. However, under the special cultural background of China, it
      is urgent to answer how to help the public to realize reasonable scientific exercise, how to
      choose the popular exercise mode and whether the exercise mode is scientific and effective.

      Previous meta-analysis studies on the improvement of blood pressure and blood glucose by
      walking have been published, but few studies on Chinese square dancing have been conducted.
      Previous studies on whether Chinese square dancing was scientific and effective were mostly
      small sample population studies carried out by Chinese scholars. The research results were of
      large heterogeneity, and the research design lacked reasonable consideration.

      This study intends to select two common exercise mode for scientific evaluation, one is
      walking and the other is Chinese square dancing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two common types of exercise (walking and Chinese square dancing) in
      Chinese patients with hypertension and patients with hypertension complicated with diabetes.
