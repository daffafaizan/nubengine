      parenteral nutrition or vasopressors administration.

      They will be randomised either in the midline group or in the PVC group.

        -  In the midline group, a midline catheter will try to be inserted before the 48th hour
           after last indication for CVC disappeared.

        -  In the PVC group: a PVC will try to be inserted before the 48th hour after last
           indication for CVC disappeared.

      If successful, CVC will then be removed. If not, a PVC will try to be inserted daily till
      success or worthlessness of a venous line or death.

      The presence of a CVC will be assessed at the 96th hour after disappearance of last CVC
      indication.
