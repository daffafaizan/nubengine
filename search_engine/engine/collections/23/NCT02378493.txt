      A. Should a first regimen of antibiotics fail, to describe the bacterial community present in
      the wound, and its potential to create biofilms.

      B. To investigate the role of antibiogramme-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S.
      aureus strains and prescribed antibiotics) in wound healing.

      C. To study the potential role of additional antibiofilmogramme data, as well as that of
      other pre-defined co-factors, in predicting wound changes.

      D. Create an S. aureus strain collection for future ancillary studies.
