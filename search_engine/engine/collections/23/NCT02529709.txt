      lipids is controversial (1,2), In addition, these studies did not examine the effect of a
      high-protein compared to a high-monounsaturated meal on postprandial lipid concentrations.
      Postprandial lipid responses are important to examine since they are associated with heart
      disease (3,4). In addition, most individuals in Western countries are in a postprandial state
      for majority of the day. The present study will compare the effect of a high-protein meal
      versus a high-monounsaturated fat meal on postprandial lipid responses.
