      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in patients with recurrent or metastatic
           HER2/neu-overexpressing cancer.

        -  Determine response in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the number of circulating tumor cells with radiographic imaging in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral imatinib
      mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
