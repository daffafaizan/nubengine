      arthroscopic meniscectomy have pain, effusion, loss of range of motion, functional,
      neuromuscular and biomechanical changes, loss of quadriceps muscle strength, and a reduced
      quality of life (Durand et al.,1993;Goodwin and Morrissey,2003; Glatthorn et al.,2010). With
      changes in service delivery patients following arthroscopy only receive a printed leaflet.
      Web-based physiotherapy may offer offer cost effective support to patients. Therefore, the
      aim of this study is to undertake a single blind, randomised controlled pilot study examining
      the effectiveness of a six week web-based physiotherapy programme compared to usual care
      alone, for people following knee arthroscopy and to gather essential information for the
      planning of a definitive trial.
