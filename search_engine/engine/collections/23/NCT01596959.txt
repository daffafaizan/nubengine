      randomised to ablation using tissue contact data provided by the St. Jude medical ECI
      technology (active arm), or standard ablation as per physician practice, without the use of
      contact data to guide ablation (control arm). The endpoint measures will include RF ablation
      time, procedure time, time to achieving cavotricuspid isthmus block, the need for "touch up"
      ablation to achieve conduction block, the recurrence rate of isthmus conduction on isuprel
      infusion at 20 minutes post-isolation, and clinical recurrence of atrial flutter
      post-operatively.
