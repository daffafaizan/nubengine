      thereby preserving bone density, and preventing long term instability and loosening secondary
      to proximal bone resorption. The primary aim of this study is therefore to compare the
      postoperative changes in bone density with the Taperloc Microplasty stem, using the standard
      length Taperloc stem as a control.

      In addition, the Taperloc stem has historically had a neck angle of 138°. There have been
      criticisms that this neck angle is too high for the typical Korean population. The newer
      Taperloc Complete system (both Microplasty and standard length) has a neck angle of 133°. A
      secondary aim is Occurrence ratio of thigh pain difference between Microplasty and standard
      stem in Korean Population
