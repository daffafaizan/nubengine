        -  To provide a mechanism for sample collection and submission for diagnostic review to
           determine eligibility of patients with suspected leukemia or related hematologic
           disorders for enrollment on ECOG leukemia clinical trials.

        -  To obtain baseline samples for correlative studies outlined in parent clinical trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a cohort, multicenter study.

      Patients submit bone marrow and/or blood samples. The samples are studied to determine
      patients' eligibility for ECOG leukemia treatment clinical trials. Samples may be stored for
      future correlative studies related to ECOG treatment clinical trials.
