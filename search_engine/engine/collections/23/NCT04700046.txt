    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study
      intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mexiletine in patients with myotonic
      dystrophy type 1 and type 2 (DM1 and DM2). The study will consist of a 4-week screening
      period and a 26-week treatment phase with patient visits as screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2,
      6, 14, 18, and 26. Eligible patients will be randomized to mexiletine or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. Approximately 158 DM1 patients (79 active: 79 placebo) are planned to be enrolled
      across 10-15 experienced investigational centers in Europe. In addition, up to 16 DM2
      patients are planned to be enrolled (sub-group - 8 active: 8 placebo).

      Study drug (mexiletine 167 mg or placebo) will be started as a once a day (QD) treatment
      regimen. The dose will be titrated up at the Week 1 and Week 2 visits to a maximum of 1
      capsule three times a day. Depending on tolerability, the dose can also be either maintained
      or - if required - reduced by one dose step at any time during the study to a minimum dose of
      167 mg QD.
