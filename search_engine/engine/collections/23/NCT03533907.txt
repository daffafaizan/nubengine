      Acetate treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women:
      initially proposed only as pre-surgical treatment, the UA was subsequently also used for the
      long-term treatment of uterine myomas symptoms.

      However, few data are available on the effects of UA in terms of increasing fecundability,
      implantation and pregnancy outcome and safety in the general population, and in infertile
      patients in particular.

      This retrospective study aims at describing the correlation between the use of Ulipristal
      Acetate and pregnancy outcome in infertile patients and at comparing the UA plus surgery
      approach to the UA-only treatment in terms of pregnancy outcome.
