      repetitive pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) i.e. targeted at the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC), affords relief of 'air hunger' in patients with breathlessness
      refractory to maximal medical therapy, compared to 'control' TMS directed at a remote site
      independent of the area of interest (within the lateral right parietal region of the brain).

      12 right-handed patients suffering from refractory dyspnoea will receive pulses of targeted
      TMS or control TMS (crossover design), in a random order. The order will be random and use a
      minimisation procedure for baseline dyspnoea severity and sex. Repetitive targeted TMS (or
      control) pulses at 110% motor threshold at a frequency of 1Hz will be given for a 15 minute
      period1.

      On a second, later, day the same subjects will perform the same protocol after receiving
      inhaled menthol or control (normal, non odorous air), in random order.

      Outcomes will be assessed during the 10 minutes after targeted TMS/control TMS during which
      post stimulation inhibition of neural activity is expected.
