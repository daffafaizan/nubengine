      breast cancer. In such situations a biopsy has to be taken to confirm the diagnosis
      histologically. Once informed consent will be obtained, the physician will collect a biopsy
      sample using the standard procedure with US- or MG-guided Biospy. Immediately prior to gold
      standard pathology workflow (formalin fixation), HistologTM Scanner will be used to image the
      fresh biopsy specimens. The HistologTM Scanner (v1.0, SamanTree Medical SA, Lausanne,
      Switzerland, CE marking) is based on confocal fluorescence and displays microscopic histology
      images of superficial layers of fresh tissue after nuclear staining with Acridine Orange (30
      seconds) and rinsing in saline solution.

      Finally, the specimen will be processed following the gold standard workflow (H&E-stained
      images).

      Two independent pathologists will assess the HistologTM Scanner- and H&E-stained images
      subsequently according to the B-classification (categories B1-B5; "0" was defined as "no
      diagnosis possible") and determine the correspondence of the results.
