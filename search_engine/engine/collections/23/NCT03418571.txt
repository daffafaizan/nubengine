      Japanese infants and young children aged 28 days to <2 years with a gestational age â‰¥33 weeks
      who were hospitalized for and diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower
      respiratory tract infection (LRTI):

        -  Dose level 1: target dose of 1.5 mg/kg

        -  Dose level 2: target dose of 3.0 mg/kg

        -  Dose level 3: target dose of 6.0 mg/kg

        -  Dose level 4: target dose of 9.0 mg/kg

      Each cohort was planned to consist of 15 subjects enrolled and randomly assigned to receive
      ALX-0171 or placebo, in an allocation ratio of 4:1 (N = 12 active versus N = 3 placebo per
      cohort).

      Due to early termination of the trial, only enrollment of Cohort 1 could be completed as
      planned. For Cohort 2, only 1 subject was screened but did not meet the eligibility criteria
      and was considered a screen failure. Therefore, data were not available for treatment groups
      ALX-0171 3.0 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg, and 9.0 mg/kg.

      Of note, in line with applicable guidelines, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)
      was assigned to monitor the study. Upon completing of Cohort 1, the IDMC reviewed the
      available unblinded safety data and unanimously recommended to continue the study with no
      changes to the protocol.
