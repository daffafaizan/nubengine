      have significant relevance in the context of radiation therapy, in particular proton
      radiotherapy. Tumor motion reduction has favorable implications for reduction of radiation
      doses to adjacent healthy organs, radiation plan robustness (accuracy/quality) and for
      treatment efficiency (reduction of treatment times). Using non-ionizing MRI with volunteers,
      the investigators will determine the extent to which continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) reduces breathing motion (diaphragmatic excursion). The researchers will also
      investigate the parameter space associated with breathing motion reduction versus the amount
      of pressure applied, as well as timing of initiation of CPAP in relation to the imaging time
      point (to address whether an initial transient breathing state exists).
