    
      A double blinded randomized cross-over acute meal study will be carried out in which 15
      healthy male participants will attend two study visits, separated by at least one week. On
      each study visit, fasted participants will consume either the solid or the liquid emulsion,
      in a randomized order. Both emulsions tested will have the exact same composition only
      differing in the physical state of the lipid emulsions, in order to isolate the impact of
      physical state, specifically, on metabolic response. Postprandial lipemia and satiety will be
      measured for 6 hours after consumption of the test beverage. The study meals will include
      crushed acetominophen, the appearance of which will be measured in plasma as a measure of
      liquid content gastric emptying. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual lifestyle
      habits throughout the study, with some changes in the 48 hour period leading up to each of
      the two visits.
