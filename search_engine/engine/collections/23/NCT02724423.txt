    
      Diazepam rectal gel (Diastat) is the only formulation of diazepam indicated for the
      management of selected, refractory patients with epilepsy on stable regimens of antiepileptic
      drugs (AEDs) who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure
      activity, i.e., Acute Repetitive Seizures (ARS).

      A diazepam nasal spray is being developed for patients who experience ARS to provide an
      alternative more convenient and acceptable route of diazepam administration.
