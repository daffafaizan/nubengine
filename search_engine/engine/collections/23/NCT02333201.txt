      (as e.g. in stroke). Long term consequences of dysphagia include, among others, malnutrition,
      prolonged enteral tube feeding and increased risk of aspiration. In the present observational
      analysis, we aim to elucidate the incidence and the impact of dysphagia on the clinical
      course of a mixed population of ICU patients post invasive mechanical ventilation.

      ICU patients are at increased risk for oropharyngeal dysphagia following endotracheal
      intubation. However, the incidence, respective underlying causes and clinical consequences of
      dysphagia in ICU patients are currently understudied. The impact on clinical outcomes of
      respective ICU patients thus remains currently unclear. A systematic review [1] reported
      highly variable dysphagia frequency rates depending on the time of mechanical ventilation/
      intubation.

      However, previous clinical trials were heterogeneous in design, methods of screening, and
      study outcome. The overall quality of evidence is considered low. The systematic review
      highlights the limited available evidence for dysphagia following intubation and hence the
      need for high-quality prospective trials. A recent retrospective single-centre trial [2] in a
      tertiary care ICU demonstrated a high presence of dysphagia in mechanical ventilated (MV)
      patients following extubation. Screening was performed using bedside swallowing evaluation
      (BSE).

      In a prospective observational analysis, we aim to further elucidate the impact of dysphagia
      on respective clinical outcomes in ICU patients after mechanical ventilation.
