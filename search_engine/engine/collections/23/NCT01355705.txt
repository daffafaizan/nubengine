    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile for the combination of
           amrubicin with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in previously treated adult patients with
           multiple myeloma during Phase I

        -  Determine the combined rate of complete response (CR) and very good partial response
           (VGPR) for this combination in this population as defined by the International Myeloma
           Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWGURC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Determine the overall response rate (CR, VGPR and PR)

        -  Assess additional evidence of ant-tumor activity as measured by duration of response
           (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall
           survival (OS)
