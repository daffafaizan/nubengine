    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether short-term treatment with
      colchicine reduces the rate of death and lung complications related to COVID-19. The
      secondary objective is to determine the safety of treatment with colchicine in this patient
      population.

      Approximately 6000 patients will be enrolled to receive either colchicine or placebo (1:1
      allocation ratio) for 30 days. Follow-up assessments will occur at 15 and 30 days following
      randomization for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other adverse
      events.

      Safety and efficacy will be based on data from randomized patients. An independent data and
      safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically review study results as well as the overall
      conduct of the study, and will make recommendations to the study Executive Steering Committee
      (ESC) to continue, stop or modify the study protocol.
