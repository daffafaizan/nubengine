      diabetes, HbA1c >9% (75 mmol/mol), multi daily insulin injections ( MDI) and who perform less
      than 2 SMBG /day. Patients will be switched to insulin pump and started a FGM system (Free
      Style LibreÂ®) during 6 months, hoping this intervention can reengage patients in
      self-management, reduce HbA1c without increasing the risk of ketoacidocetosis (DKA) and
      severe hypoglycemia (SH), and keep the DTSQ (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire)
      and HFS (Hypoglycemia Fear Scale) at good levels.
