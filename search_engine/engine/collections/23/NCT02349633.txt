      the single activating mutations of del 19 and L858R, and the secondary resistance mutation
      T790M, while sparing WT EGFR. Drugs active against the resistance mutation will enable
      molecularly targeted therapy with a more favorable toxicity profile than the current standard
      of cytotoxic chemotherapy platinum based doublets. Furthermore, by having a wide margin of
      selectivity favoring the EGFR mutants versus WT EGFR, PF 06747775 is likely to be positioned
      to improve patient outcomes from an efficacy and safety perspective.
