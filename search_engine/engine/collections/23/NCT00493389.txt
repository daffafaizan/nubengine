      stimulation test is done under stressful conditions. This important information is currently
      not available in the literature. To achieve this, we will perform the ACTH stimulation test
      in a cohort of patients who are booked for elective surgery. By choosing elective surgery
      patients, we afford ourselves the opportunity of performing the test once before surgery. The
      test is then repeated within 12 hours of surgery. The first test will be done on an
      out-patient basis under usual conditions (minimal stress) while the second will be done under
      intense physical stress. The 2 sets of results will be compared and the effect of stress on
      test results will be determined. For the sake of uniformity, we have chosen patients who are
      booked to undergo repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) as our study cohort.

      The ACTH stimulation is an important test that suffers from limitations resulting from lack
      of clear guidelines for the interpretation of results done under stressful conditions. This
      study will thus improve the usefulness of an important tool in the evaluation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in stressed patients.
