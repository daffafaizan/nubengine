      ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with structural heart disease by noninvasive
      strategy, stereotactic radiosurgical ablation in an indication of bail-out procedure after
      failed catheter ablation. The arrhythmogenic substrate will be identified by imaging
      techniques and functionally by electroanatomic mapping and pacing. The recipients of
      stereotactic surgery will be patients after 2 unsuccessful catheter ablations for monomorphic
      VTs (one of the procedures will be performed in an expert center). The target volume for
      stereotactic radiosurgical ablation (single dose of 25 Gy) will be a critical region of the
      substrate defined by a combination of imaging and functional methods with an export of the
      merged image-electroanatomical map into the radiosurgery planning console. Primary endpoints
      will be a reduction of the burden of sustained VT, time to death or arrhythmic storm or
      appropriate therapy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for isolated VT and/or
      time do development of radiation toxicity (both acute and late).
