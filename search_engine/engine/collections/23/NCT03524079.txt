      screened. A total of 30 BrS patients and 30 normal age, sex and BSA matched normal controls
      will be selected and enrolled. Patients will perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to
      evaluate and compare morphological and functional characteristics of the 2 groups before and
      after ajmaline. BrS patients will also perform a standardized programmed ventricular
      stimulation protocol and electroanatomical mapping to determine the substrate size.
