      Group 1 = 900 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, BIA 2-093); Group 2 = 450 mg of
      S-licarbazepine plus 450 mg of R-licarbazepine; Group 3 = 450 mg of S-licarbazepine; Group 4
      = 450 mg of Rlicarbazepine. In each group, the study consisted of a single-dose period (Phase
      A) followed by a repeateddose period of 7 days of duration in which the investigational
      product was administered once daily (Phase B). The repeated-dose phase started 96 h post
      single-dose.
