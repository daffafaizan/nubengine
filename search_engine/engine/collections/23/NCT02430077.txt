    
      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Patients who are
      considered eligible for the study will undergo screening evaluation to determine their
      eligibility for the trial. For those who are found to be eligible, during the baseline
      period, they will continue their usual diet and other lifestyle measures without changing any
      medications for 1 month in order to establish a baseline state. Three blood samples will be
      obtained during this period at the Clinical and Translational Research Center. Following the
      baseline period, the patients will receive obeticholic acid (OCA) or an identical placebo in
      the dose of 25 mg/day for a period of 4 months and then will receive the other treatment (OCA
      or placebo) for 4 months. There will be a wash-out period of 4 months in-between the two
      study periods.

      Patients will be educated to maintain their usual physical activities and diet during the
      study. The subjects will be admitted to the Clinical and Translational Research Center for
      the baseline evaluations (at the beginning of the two study periods), and at the end of four
      months during each study period.
