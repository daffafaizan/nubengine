    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The safety of NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic adoptive cell transfer (ACT) has
      been reported. The current protocol includes the addition of the cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) blocking monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to NY ESO
      TCR ACT in a dose escalation scheme in two study cohorts at 1 and 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab
      intravenous (i.v.) every three weeks with a maximum of 4 doses (q3wx4).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the TCR transgenic cell dose and CTLA blockade
      to patients.

      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) in serial peripheral blood samples and in biopsies of accessible metastatic
      lesions.

      III. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET
      tracer [18F] fluorodeoxy-glucose ([18F]FDG) with the goal of determining if the adoptively
      transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered PBMC when administered with ipilimumab home and expand in
      secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits.

      IV. Clinical antitumor activity recording objective response rate will be an exploratory
      endpoint in this pilot clinical trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 and -4 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -4 to -1.

      NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC INFUSION: Patients receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector
      transduced autologous T cells IV on day 0.

      IPILIMUMAB ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes before the NY-ESO-1
      TCR PBMC infusion on day 0 or after the infusion on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NY-ESO-1(157-165) PEPTIDE PULSED DENDRITIC CELL (DC) ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive
      NY-ESO-1(157-165) peptide pulsed DC vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 14, and 30.

      LOW DOSE INTERLEUKIN-2 (IL-2) ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive aldesleukin (IL-2)
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 90 days, every
      3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
