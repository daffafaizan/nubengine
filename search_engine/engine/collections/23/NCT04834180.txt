      single-blinded study was conducted. The sample included 31 adult women with ages ranging from
      20 to 51 years old. The groups had a frequency of physical activity ≥ 2 and ≤ 4 times per
      week. Individuals with BMI ≤ 24.9 Kg/m2 and pregnant women excluded from the study. All
      participants were then randomized into one of three groups: group 1 was treated with Vaccaria
      seeds plus diet therapy, group 2 with ASP needles plus diet therapy and finally, group 3
      received only diet therapy. A licensed nutritionist prescribed the hypocaloric diet plan.
      Baseline evaluation included anthropometric measures collected according to standardized
      procedures. They received two treatments per week for a total of 6 weeks. After one month of
      follow-up, all the anthropometric measures were reevaluated. Main Parameters: Weight/body
      composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Secondary parameters: Waist to height ratio
      (WHtR), weight and Body Mass Index (BMI).
