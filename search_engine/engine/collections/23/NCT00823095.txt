      nitric oxide on the bio-burden of chronic non-healing wounds of the lower extremities.
      Reports will include:

        -  Comparisons of the demographics and diagnoses of those patients treated with ViaNOx-H.

        -  Tabulation as to the organisms found and the bio-burden as measured by counts (0 to +4).

        -  Tabulation of the number and types of adverse events during ViaNOx-H treatment.

        -  Comparisons of the response of different organisms to ViaNOx-H treatment.
