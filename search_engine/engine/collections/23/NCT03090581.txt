      monitoring (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate), Oxygen therapy with
      high flows and surveillance by anesthesiologist. The bronchopulmonary lobe where the biopsies
      will be performed is determined prior to the procedure based on an imaging study (chest x-ray
      or computed tomography). Transbronchial biopsies will be obtained using a flexible
      bronchoscope (Pentax, 3.2 mm working channel), which approaches the subsegment where the
      affected area is located. The 2.4 mm diameter cryoprobe is placed (ErbokryoÂ®), and moves
      forward until it encounters a soft resistance. The cryoprobe is removed between 5-10 mm and
      the freezing is applied for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, the probe is gently removed together
      with the bronchoscope and frozen tissue sample at the tip of the probe. In the case of strong
      resistance, the process is stopped and then repeated. In the case of the use of forceps, the
      conventional technique is used.
