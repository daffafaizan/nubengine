      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized (539 patients; 554 arthroplasties) at the time
      of their preoperative clinic visit. Patients in the chlorhexidine protocol group (275
      arthroplasties) applied 2% chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated cloths to their skin the night
      before and the morning of surgical admission. Patients in the standard of care group (279
      arthroplasties) took a bath with soap and water the night before surgical admission. Both
      groups were subject to standard infection control practices during admission. The primary
      outcome was periprosthetic infection incidence within one year of surgery, and secondary
      outcomes included the potential influence of risk factors for periprosthetic infection and
      incidence of adverse events.
