      high-dose enteral glutamine and enteral nutrition will be given to research subjects while
      controls will receive isocaloric, isonitrogenous enteral support. Enteral tolerance, bowel
      integrity and permeability will be evaluated. The systemic appearance of glutamine will be
      measured.
