      increases compliance. Access to reliable information is a key factor in fostering trust.
      However, migrant workers are a disadvantaged population that traditionally lack access to
      reliable sources of information.

      In this study, we seek to document (i) migrant worker's trust in their host country's
      government, (ii) migrant worker's exposure to unreliable COVID-19 information (i.e.,
      rumours), (iii) the situational and demographic variables that predict degree of exposure to
      unreliable information.

      Data was taken from the COVID-19 Migrant Health Study, a cross-sectional study of male
      migrants employed in manual labor jobs within Singapore.
