           cerebral blood flow in neonates with HIE before and during (i.e. cooling lasting for
           24~36 hr) selective brain cooling.

           1.2 Secondary object To compare the differences in temperature between brain (thalamus
           and HIE lesions) and nasopharynx and rectum of HIE neonates during the cooling.

        2. Methods Prospective observational study; the MR thermal imaging and phase contrast MRI
           will be used to estimate brain temperature and cerebral blood flow.

      Neonates with HIE who fulfilled the moderate hypothermia criteria will be recruited from the
      neonatal intensive care units. MR scans will be performed twice after informed parental
      consent. The first scan will be before the hypothermia and the second scan will be during the
      hypothermia. The first scan will be performed while the neonate is still in the intensive
      care unit. At the time of the second MR scan, the neonate is still in the intensive care
      unit, and the neonate in hypothermia group is receiving the brain selective cooling. Sedation
      would be used if required in these babies.
