      and is considered an investigational drug in this study. It has helped make chemotherapy more
      effective in animals. The investigators will be testing to see if it can increase the
      effectiveness of mitoxantrone and etoposide. It has been combined with other types of
      chemotherapy for humans with other types of cancer. Most of the patients were able to take
      hydroxychloroquine safely at the doses studied in this clinical trial.

      Hydroxychloroquine is approved by the FDA for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and other
      autoimmune diseases. Mitoxantrone is approved by the FDA for use in AML, and it is one of the
      most common drugs used in the treatment of AML. Etoposide is not approved by the FDA for AML.
      It is approved for small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. It is commonly used in AML.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the recommend phase 2 dose (RP2D) for HCQ
      combined with mitoxantrone and etoposide, while secondary objectives include efficacy
      estimates of this combination at the RP2D, a safety and tolerability profile of this
      combination, as well as the correlation of pharmacodynamic assessments of autophagy
      inhibition with dose and clinical response.
