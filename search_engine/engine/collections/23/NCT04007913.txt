      efficacy for treating persistent tic disorders (e.g., Tourette Syndrome) in youth and adults.
      Lack of access to a local CBIT provider prevents treatment access for many patients who could
      benefit from CBIT. Providing CBIT to patients in their homes via videoconferencing technology
      (i.e., teleCBIT) is a promising approach to increasing CBIT access. This study investigates
      treatment uptake, acceptability, feasibility, and clinical effectiveness of teleCBIT among
      pediatric and adult patients enrolled as patients in a state-of-the-art medical tic program.
