      hepatic blood flow and liver functions among postmenopausal women using black cohosh
      (cimicifuga racemosa) extract for twelve consecutive months for relief of vasomotor symptoms.

      Prior to using a daily dose of 40 mg of a dry extract preparation of cimicifuga racemosa
      (KlimadynonÂ®) and twelve months after, total hepatic blood flow will be assessed by color
      Doppler ultrasound. Moreover, prothrombin time & concentration, serum albumin, bilirubin,
      gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
      and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) will also be measured.
