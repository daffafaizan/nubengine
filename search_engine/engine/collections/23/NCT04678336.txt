    
      This is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, manufacturing feasibility, and efficacy of
      CART123 cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in pediatric subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML.

      Subjects will receive CART123 cells via a single IV infusion at a dose of 2x10^6 CART123
      cells/kg, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The total dose administered to each subject
      will be based on the subject's body weight obtained at the time of apheresis. The minimum
      acceptable dose for infusion is 1x10^5 CART123 cells/kg.

      There will be a 28-day stagger between the first 3 subject infusions, such that the next
      subject may not receive treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy plus CART123 cells) until the
      previous subject has completed their Day 28 safety follow-up visit and a DLT assessment has
      been performed. Subsequent infusions will be staggered by a minimum of 14 days.

      It is recommended that subjects with marrow aplasia at Day 28+/-5 undergo an allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a rescue strategy. If required, this
      procedure will be performed as part of routine care, outside of the scope of this research
      study; however, subjects will continue to be followed onstudy. All subjects must, therefore,
      have a previously identified stem cell donor as part of their eligibility to participate in
      this study.

      All subjects will be followed monthly for up to 6 months after the CART123 cell infusion (Day
      0). Thereafter, subjects will be transitioned into LTFU for up to 15 years post infusion.
