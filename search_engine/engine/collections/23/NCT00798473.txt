    
      -  This study is recruiting 40 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18, who have a proven
           abnormal bone density as measured on a special type of x-ray called a DEXA-scan.

        -  Participants are allocated at random to one of two groups: either treatment with
           zoledronate, or a placebo.

        -  Neither the participants or the physicians are aware of which group each participant is
           in.

        -  Participants are followed every three months for one year, and assessed with blood
           tests, urine tests, physical examination, diet questionnaire and exercise questionnaire.

        -  Participants have a repeat DEXA scan at 6 and 12 months after beginning the study.

        -  Once all participants are enrolled and followed for one whole year, we will compare the
           bone density of the group treated with zoledronate with the group treated with placebo.
