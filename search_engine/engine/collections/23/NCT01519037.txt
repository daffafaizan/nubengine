      Lausanne) and will include 24 patients. The volunteers will get involved after inclusion
      (Inclusion Visit) in a crossover study over two double-blind periods. The order of the two
      periods (placebo or cinacalcet) will be randomized. Each period comprises 3 days of a
      low-sodium diet (50 mmol of Na+ per day, equivalent to 3 grams of salt/day), followed by an
      investigation day at the hospital during which the subjects will be studied before and after
      exposure to the cinacalcet or placebo. The 2 periods will be separated by a therapeutic
      wash-out lasting 14-28 days. The total length of the study per participant will be 1, max. 2
      months.
