      Primary: To demonstrate the ability of reslizumab to improve asthma control in subjects with
      active asthma and eosinophilic airway inflammation.

      Secondary:

        -  To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce induced sputum eosinophil (EOS) counts in
           subjects with asthma.

        -  To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce the number of eosinophilic clinical asthma
           exacerbations (CAE) in subjects with asthma. A CAE is defined as a â‰¥ 20% decrease in
           forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; absolute value) from the baseline value or a
           requirement for emergency treatment of asthma, hospital admission for asthma or
           treatment with three or more days of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for asthma worsening.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of reslizumab in subjects with asthma.
