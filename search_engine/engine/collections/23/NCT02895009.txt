      coronary intervention (TRI), prevents subsequent use of the same radial artery for coronary
      angiography and intervention. Comparing to the overseas counterparts, most Chinese medical
      workers put more emphasis on prevention of postoperative puncture site bleeding, so longer
      compression hemostasis time is applied but this prolonged compression may underestimate or
      even ignore an increasing risk of RAO. Therefore, this study intends to compare short term TR
      Band compression and the routine long term one on transradial coronary occlusion after
      transradial coronary intervention.

      Participants allocated to the control group will receive a routine long term postoperative
      puncture site compression via TR Band. In control group, TR Band deflation is commenced at
      the 2nd hour with successive 5 mL air released at 2 hours intervals until the bladder was
      empty at the 6th hour, and the TR Band is removed at the 24th hour.

      Participants allocated to the experimental group will receive a short term postoperative
      puncture site compression via TR Band. In experimental group, TR Band deflation is commenced
      at the 1st hour with 3 mL air released, and at the 2nd hour with 5ml, and at the 3rd hour
      with the remainder air in the bladder, and the TR Band is removed at the 12th hour.

      At the 24th hour, RAO incidence, postoperative puncture site bleeding incidence and patient
      comfort level will be evaluated.
