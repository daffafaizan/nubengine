      accurate and less invasive approach for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. The
      primary objectives are:

        1. To develop advanced MRI methods and optimal MRI protocols for detection, staging, and
           follow-up of prostate cancer.

        2. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-guided biopsy methods and correlate MRI
           findings with the pathological grade of cancer.

        3. To correlate prostate MRI findings and biopsy results with patient progress and
           outcomes.

        4. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in disease re-classification in patients on
           active surveillance.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To apply computer-aided advanced image analytic techniques (Computer-assisted
           diagnostics- CAD) to extract MRI features of patient clinical scans that correlate with
           diagnosis and grade of prostate cancer.

        2. To study MRI features of lesions that mimic prostate cancer on imaging eg - chronic
           prostatitis, post treatment changes.

        3. To evaluate the impact of MRI in decision making and choice of treatment by physicians
           and patients.
