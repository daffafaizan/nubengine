      volunteers participating in the study as well as to study staff) study to assess the effects
      of multiple doses of probenecid on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and
      its metabolites in healthy volunteers. The study will last up to approximately 49 days
      (includes a Screening Phase of up to 19 days, an Open-Label Treatment Phase of 20 days, and a
      Post-Treatment Phase of up to 7 to 10 days). Healthy volunteers will take orally (by mouth)
      one 300 mg canagliflozin tablet once daily and/or one 500-mg probenecid tablet twice daily in
      sequential order as follows: Days 1 to 14 (administration of canagliflozin alone) and Days 15
      to 17 (administration of canagliflozin + twice-daily administration of probenecid). On days
      when both canagliflozin and probenecid are taken, both doses must be taken at approximately
      the same time.
