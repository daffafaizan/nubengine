      Name of Investigational Product: Evotaz速, Rezolsta速

      Name of active ingredients: Atazanavir, darunavir and cobicistat

      Study title: Steady-state Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir/Cobicistat and Darunavir/Cobicistat
      Once Daily Over 72 Hours in Healthy Volunteers

      Phase of study: Phase I

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      -To assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/cobicistat and
      darunavir/cobicistat over 72 hours, in HIV negative healthy volunteers.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the inter subject variability in atazanavir, darunavir and cobicistat plasma
           concentrations over 72 hours

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of atazanavir/cobicistat and darunavir/cobicistat
           over 10 days of administration to healthy volunteers

        -  To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes
           and drug exposure

      Study design: 33 days (excluding screening and follow up), open label, pharmacokinetic study.

      Indication: Not applicable

      Methodology: Measurements of steady state pharmacokinetic profiles of plasma
      atazanavir/cobicistat and darunavir/cobicistat in male and female healthy volunteers.

      Planned sample size: Up to 30 male and female healthy volunteers will be enrolled at baseline
      in order to achieve 16 completing the study

      Summary of eligibility criteria: Healthy participants as determined by medical history,
      physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory evaluations will be
      eligible to participate in the study. Women of childbearing potential must not be nursing or
      pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

      Number of study centres: One

      Duration of treatment: 33 days (excluding screening and follow up visits)

      Dose and route of administration: All participants will be administered Evotaz速) (atazanavir
      300mg + cobicistat 150mg) once daily for 10 days, undergo a ten-day wash out period and then
      take Rezolsta速 (darunavir 800mg + cobicistat 150mg) once daily for 10 days.

      Criteria for evaluation:

        -  Pharmacokinetic parameters of atazanavir/cobicistat will be evaluated on blood drawn on
           day 10 at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24 hours post dose and days 11
           to 13 (up to 72 hours post dose).

        -  Pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir/cobicistat will be evaluated on blood drawn on
           day 30 at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24 hours post dose and days 31
           to 33 (up to 72 hours post dose).

        -  Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical
           examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals
           during the drug study.

      Primary Endpoint:

      -Steady state plasma concentrations of atazanavir/cobicistat and darunavir/cobicistat up to
      72 hours post-dose.

      Secondary End point:

        -  Safety and tolerability of the studied drugs over 10 days of administration.

        -  Relationship between genetic polymorphisms and exposure to the studied drugs.
