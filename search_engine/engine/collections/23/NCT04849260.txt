    
      The study will be divided into two stages: phase Ib and phase II. The safety and phase II
      recommended dose (RP2D) of Pexa-Vec combined with ZKAB001 in patients with local progression
      of failed first-line treatment or metastatic melanoma will be evaluated in phase Ib.

      Objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of ZKAB001 combined with
      RP2D's Pexa-Vec or ZKAB001 monotherapy in patients with local progression or metastatic
      melanoma will be evaluated in phase II.

      The study is also going to evaluate the combination therapy or monotherapy:

        1. overall survival time ((OS)), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of remission (DOR)
           in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        2. safety

        3. the relationship between the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissue and clinical effectï¼›

        4. the changes of immune microenvironment (CD8+ expression) in tumor tissue before and
           after Pexa-vec treatment.
