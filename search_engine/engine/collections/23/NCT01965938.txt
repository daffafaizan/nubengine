      night prior to their surgery based upon the examination documented in their preoperative
      history and physical. If their body mass index achieves a calculated score of 35 or greater
      or they have an oropharyngeal class 4 airway then they will qualify to participate.

      After written informed consent is obtained, The intubation method would be randomized as one
      of two groups: intubation via use of the fiberoptic bronchoscope or the RIFL. The intubation
      attempt will be terminated if the SpO2 <90, HR<50, there is traumatic injury, or time >
      100sec. If terminated, the patient will be mask ventilated and the attending anesthesiologist
      would determine the subsequent technique that will be used for airway management.
