      decreased taste and smell sensory abilities. Since 2006, we have implemented various sensory
      workshops: olfactory, tactile-kinesthetic and auditory. The establishment of this therapeutic
      practice that is centered on oral sphere and all respect, it was observed a decrease of 30%
      of the length of hospitalization. All the data we currently have in the field, suggests a
      rehabituation food odors and facilitate the recall of memories related to food in anorexic
      patients. However in the literature the use of olfactory dimension in the treatment of
      anorexia has not been verified experimentally. The investigator hypothesize that the
      therapeutic use of a dietary nature olfactory stimuli in anorexia nervosa promotes food
      recovery. The team propose a prospective study over a period of 12 months in which we use the
      Body Mass Index (BMI) as the primary endpoint of the state of anorexia nervosa patients.
