      nutrients for many nutrition research studies. The interviewer administered 24-hour diet
      recall is generally considered the best available method; however, it is limited by a high
      degree of participant burden and cost. A web-based, automated, self-administered 24-hour
      recall (ASA24-Kids-2014) was recently designed by researchers at the National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) to mimic the interviewer administered 24-hour recall approach to collecting
      high quality dietary intake data in children and adolescents while minimizing time and cost.
      Although the ASA24-Kids-2014 is a potentially useful and cost-effective tool for collecting
      dietary data for research studies in children and adolescents, it has not been validated for
      use in pediatric populations. A total of 30 adolescents will be recruited to achieve the
      study aims. For Aim 1, 10 participants will complete one diet recall using ASA24-Kids-2014
      and one interviewer administered 24-hour recall. Their feedback on both methods and
      preference will be assessed. For Aim 2, 20 participants will be randomly assigned to complete
      six (one per week) web-based or interviewer administered 24-hour recalls. Data from Aim 2
      will be analyzed to determine whether the reporting quality decays over time for each method.
      In addition, feedback from participants in both aims will be collected on specific factors
      related to the recall methods such as ease of use, technical challenges, flexibility,
      duration, and database completeness. Results obtained from this pilot study could provide
      critical information to design a larger method comparison study to rigorously assess the
      performance of the ASA24-Kids web-based diet recall.
