      but the exact mechanism remained to be elucidated. Many connective tissue diseases such as
      rheumatoid arthritis are often associated with antiphospholipid antibodies-associated
      endothelial impairment. In the present study, we'll analyze the presence of antiphospholipid
      antibodies in the serum of the patients with gout/ asymptomatic hyperuricemia, with a
      comparison to the patients of osteoarthritis but without hyperuricemia and gout. We expect to
      find a correlation between these pathogenic antibody and those cardiovascular co-morbidities.

        3. Patients of osteoarthritis but without hyperuricemia and gout Exclusion Criteria：
