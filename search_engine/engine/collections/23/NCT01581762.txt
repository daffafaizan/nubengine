      technique for tissue sampling of intestinal and extra-intestinal mass lesions. The accuracy
      of EUS-guided FNA varies from 60% - 100% with a complication rate of 0% - 3%. The diagnostic
      accuracy of the procedure can be improved by the use immunohistochemical studies and genetic
      analyses.It may also be improved by obtaining a larger biopsy specimen with a core biopsy
      needle. However, puncturing with a core-biopsy needle may not be always feasible due to the
      technical difficulty of inserting the larger needle through the bended endoscope. As a
      result, the advantage of a core-biopsy needle on providing a larger amount of cellular
      material is offset by a higher rate of technical failures, especially in the setting of a
      transduodenal puncture. Recently, a new 22G FNA needle with a reverse bevel at the tip has
      become available (ECHO-HD-22-C, Cook Endoscopy, USA.). The design of the device promotes the
      collection of core samples by shearing material from target lesion during retrograde movement
      of the needle in the lesion. Hence, the aim of this study is to compare the tissue-sampling
      rate and the diagnostic accuracy rate of EUS-FNA using 22G conventional and Procore needles.
