      formulation of dexlansoprazole, referred to as dexlansoprazole modified release
      (dexlansoprazole MR) was tested to treat people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD). This study looked at the healing of the esophageal lining of the GERD participants
      who took dexlansoprazole MR.

      The study enrolled 296 patients. Participants were assigned to two study groups based on the
      endoscopy screening procedures to receive treatments as follows:

        -  Dexlansoprazole 30 mg to participants with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg to participants with erosive esophagitis (EE)

      All participants were asked to take one capsule in the morning each day throughout the study.
      All participants were asked to record the presence and maximum severity of daytime and
      nighttime heartburn and regurgitation symptoms during screening and, if assigned to a
      treatment group, throughout the duration of the study using the supplied paper diary.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea). The overall
      time to participate in this study was up to 8 weeks. Participants would make up to 3 visits
      to the clinic, and would be contacted by telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug
      for a follow-up assessment.
