      investigational products (donor-derived Wilm's Tumour Antigen-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes and with cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for multiple opportunistic pathogens
      (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Adenovirus (Adv), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella-Zoster virus
      (VZV), Influenza, BK virus (BKV), and fungal infections), hereafter referred to as P-CTLs)
      for the prophylaxis of relapse, viral and fungal reactivation and infection following
      allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia. P-CTL will be given
      prophylactically a minimum of 28 days after transplantation followed by administration of
      monthly infusions of WT1-CTL for up to four doses. Our aims are to study the safety of
      combining WT1-CTL and P-CTL infusions; their persistence, effect on relapse of disease,
      effect on minimal residual disease, reconstitution of WT-1 and pathogen-specific immunity,
      viral reactivation, infection rates after transplantation, viral load; use of antiviral and
      antifungal pharmacotherapy for specific infections, hospitalisations and overall survival.
      Safety of infusions with respect to the development of adverse events within the first 12
      months post-transplant will be assessed.
