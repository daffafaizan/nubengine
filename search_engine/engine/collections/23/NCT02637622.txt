      with a local community board and a national diabetes advisory board in key decisions in the
      project. During year 1, the investigators will utilize mixed methods to develop, pretest, and
      pilot the survey instruments to assess the preferences of patients with type II diabetes. In
      year 2, the investigators plan further engagement to finalize the survey instruments, and
      will implement a nationally representative, racially/ethnically diverse sample of patients
      with type II diabetes. Based on further consultation, the investigators will conduct
      statistical analysis, including stratified analyses and segmentation of patients with similar
      preferences. In year 3, mixed methods will be applied to assess beliefs of patients and other
      consumers about the relevance of this work and its generalizability to other PCOR topics.
      Finally, lay language reports will be developed to highlight patient and stakeholder
      engagement and the application of stated-preference methods to the study of the preferences
      of patients with type II diabetes.
