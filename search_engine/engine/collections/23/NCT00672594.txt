      weeks off treatment prior to undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patients with palpable disease
      (cT2-3) and patients with 3 or more positive prostatic biopsies from one lobe may undergo an
      additional study of IFP monitoring before treatment and during week 4 of study treatment.
      Safety and tolerability of Sunitinib malate therapy at this dose and schedule in this patient
      population will be assessed. Extensive correlative science evaluations, including assessment
      of physiologic, cellular, molecular and genetic changes during treatment with Sunitinib
      malate, will be performed
