      greatly reduced due to the potent immunosuppressive agents like calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)
      that include cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Venous thromboembolism (clots in legs or lungs) in
      transplant recipients is often difficult to manage due to polypharmacy and potential for drug
      interactions. More than 90% of renal transplant (RT) recipients are maintained on a CNI-based
      immunosuppressive regimen. Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of many metabolic pathways including
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and, breast cancer resistance
      protein (BCRP). Tacrolimus shares some of the distributive and metabolic pathways of
      cyclosporine. Apixaban is a combined substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and, BCRP and thus has the
      potential for drug interactions with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Apixaban levels that are
      too high or too low could be a problem for transplant patients. The purpose of this study is
      to determine what happens to apixaban blood levels when given in combination with
      cyclosporine or tacrolimus.
