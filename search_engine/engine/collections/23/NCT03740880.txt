      development. The final step in this stimulation process is "the trigger" that will induce the
      final maturation of the oocytes. This timing is historically put once at least one follicle
      of 16-17 mm is obtained.

      When looking at poor ovarian responder (POR) patients (characterized by a low AMH), the
      investigators observe shorter menstrual cycles and thus it is thought that the oocyte
      selected for ovulation, will also mature faster. This observation may indicate that POR
      patients potentially do not benefit from a trigger performed once a leading follicle of 17 mm
      is present, but rather from an earlier trigger.

      The main objective is to analyse if an early trigger (leading follicle of 14 mm) results in
      the same maturation rate in POR patient as compared to a late trigger (17 mm). As the embryos
      will be cultured in a time lapse imaging system, annotations on the developmental kinetics
      can be made and the differences in fertilization rate and embryo development can be analysed
      as secondary outcome parameter. On top of this, patients will undergo a genetic testing of
      their embryos and this genetic analysis , together with the mtDNA copy number will also be
      compared between patients with early or late trigger. Euploid blastocysts will be transferred
      in subsequent frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles and give an indication on the clinical
      outcome between IVF and ICSI.
