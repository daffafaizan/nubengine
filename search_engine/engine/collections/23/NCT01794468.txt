      8-hour period. DBF was measured using the I.S. MedTech DBF monitor, based on the hot-wire
      principle of thermal balance of a heater cooled by a moving medium, via a skin probe placed
      on the anterior chest wall. Sensitivity was evaluated by visual inspection during active
      states, either induced, e.g. fluid administration, or spontaneous, e.g. altered hemodynamics.
      Specificity was evaluated during stable states (minimal fluctuations of MAP and no active
      interventions applied or required). Data are expressed in terms of standard deviation (SD)
      and of the difference (SDD) between the MAP and each of the tested methods.
