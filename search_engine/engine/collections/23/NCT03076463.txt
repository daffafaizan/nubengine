      recruited. The cardiometabolic risk factors used to select the subjects are described below.

      The whole intervention will be divided in 2 periods, control (CTR) and dried and milled grape
      pomace (GRAPOM). The two periods will have a duration of 6 weeks. During the CTR period,
      subjects will follow their normal dietary habits and samples will be collected at the
      beginning and at the end. No proper placebo could be found for the product, so this CTR
      period was chosen. During the GRAPOM period, the subjects will daily consume 8 g of the
      product solved in water and samples will be collected at the beginning and at the end.
