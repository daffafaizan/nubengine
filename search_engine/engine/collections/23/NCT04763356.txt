    
      This is a prospective single blinded (outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial of a CIPN
      care model that pairs a personalized suite of remote symptom monitoring technologies with
      triggered real time responses from a nurse practitioner (NP) equipped to enact algorithmic
      guideline based CIPN treatment in response to poorly controlled symptoms. The study will
      enroll adult cancer patients who recently completed a course of a taxane or platinum-based
      agent and have been diagnosed with CIPN. Participants will log neuropathy symptoms daily for
      a one week run-in period using a remote symptom monitoring technology described below.
      Participants who have at least 1 day with any symptom that is moderate or greater in severity
      on the NTSS6 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Usual Care (UC) or Symptom Care at Home
      with Nurse Practitioner follow up (SCH-NP). Those not meeting severity criteria will be
      excluded but can be rescreened 6 weeks later. Both groups will log symptoms daily and receive
      either UC or SCH-NP care for the 12 week study period.

      The UC group will report daily neuropathy symptoms via the web, app or automated phone system
      and will receive usual care for CIPN symptoms from their existing treatment team. The SCH-NP
      group will report symptoms similarly but moderate to severe symptoms will trigger a call back
      from a nurse practitioner who can provide treatment based on standardized algorithmic CIPN
      guidelines.

      In person study visits will take place at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after randomization.
      CIPN specific QoL and disability measures, validated CIPN sign scales and detailed
      information on opioids, neuropathic pain medications and other CIPN treatments will be
      collected at each visit.
