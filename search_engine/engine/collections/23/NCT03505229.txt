      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, including patients with extrapancreatic extension (Stage
      IIA), node positive (Stage IIB), borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer
      as defined by Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (AGITG) guidelines. ECOG
      performance status 0-1, suitable for chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      After a minimum of 2 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using either an oxaliplatin- based
      regimen (FOLFOX, FOLFIRINOX, mFOLFIRINOX)+/- immunotherapy/molecular agent or gemcitabine
      based chemotherapy (eg gemcitabine / gemcitabine/abraxane). Participants will receive SBRT
      (30-45Gray in 5 fractions over 2 weeks. Prior to SBRT, fiducial markers will be placed to aid
      with image guidance during radiation delivery. Four weeks after completion of SBRT
      participants will have re-staging using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed
      tomography (CT) scan. Participants will be discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting
      for consideration of surgery. Those considered to be resectable will proceed to have surgery
      6-10 weeks post SBRT.
