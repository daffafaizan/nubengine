      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of systemic sorafenib tosylate therapy when given
           prior to definitive nephrectomy in patients with stage II-IV renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Secondary

        -  Determine all levels of response in primary renal tumors of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Assess effects of this drug on gene expression, protein expression, and metabolic
           profile using tumor tissue samples from these patients.

        -  Identify biomarkers or biomarker patterns associated with RCC or this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 4-8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients
      undergo surgical resection of their kidney tumor.

      Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and after completion of
      treatment (i.e., at 4 and 8* weeks) for VEGF analysis. Samples are examined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay for measurement of serum and urinary VEGF levels.

      NOTE: *Blood sampling at 8 weeks is only for those patients undergoing 8 weeks of study
      therapy.

      Patients also undergo tissue sample collection at the time of nephrectomy. Tissue samples are
      examined by microarray analysis and IHC staining for expression of CD31/PECAM, HIF1α, and
      HIF2α. Immunohistochemical staining to identify biomarkers of microvessel density is also
      performed. Tissue samples are also examined for gene expression and metabolic profile by
      small molecule mass spectroscopy, as well as VHL gene mutation by VHL mutation analysis.

      Patients are followed at 4-8 weeks after nephrectomy.
