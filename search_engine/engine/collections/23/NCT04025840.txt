      estimated to become the second one in 2030. For patients with resectable pancreatic cancer,
      radical surgery is the first-line therapy. However, the clinical outcomes remain poor even
      after radical resection, as the incidence of postoperative morbidity is up to 50% and the
      5-year survival rate remains below 30%.

      For patients undergoing major intraabdominal surgery, epidural block may provide advantages
      by blocking the afferent nociceptive stimuli, providing better pain relief, decreasing opioid
      consumption, and alleviating stress response. These effects may be helpful in preserving
      immune function. Some retrospective studies showed that epidural block is associated with
      delayed cancer recurrence/metastasis and improved survival after cancer surgery.

      Low-dose dexamethasone is frequently used to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting.
      Recent evidences from retrospective studies suggest that perioperative dexamethasone may also
      affect long-term outcome after cancer surgery. For example, in patients undergoing lung
      cancer surgery, intraoperative dexamethasone is associated with improved recurrence-free and
      overall survival. Similar results are also reported in patients after pancreatic cancer
      surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that perioperative epidural block and dexamethasone may improve
      survival in patients after radical pancreatic surgery. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether perioperative epidural block and/or dexamethasone can improve 2-year
      survival in patients after pancreatic cancer surgery.
