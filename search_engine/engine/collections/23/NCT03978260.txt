      independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Due to the potential risk of additional
      blood loss, anaemia represents a serious disease condition within the surgical field.
      Especially patients undergoing major elective surgery are at risk of substantial blood loss.
      Anaemia is mostly the result of an inadequate erythropoiesis due to iron deficiency, lack of
      vitamin B12 or folate, and bone marrow diseases. Among the elderly, renal disease and chronic
      inflammation account for approximately one-third of all anaemia incidences. The aim of this
      study is to provide detailed data about the prevalence of preoperative deficiencies in iron,
      vitamin B12 and/or folate and the presence of underlying renal or chronic diseases in
      patients undergoing major surgery. Results will facilitate design of supplementation
      strategies to improve haemoglobin level before surgery.
