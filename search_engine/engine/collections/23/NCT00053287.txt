        -  Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk acute
           myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes
           treated with fludarabine, carboplatin, topotecan, and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the non-hematologic toxicity profile and time to hematopoietic recovery in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on changes in biologic parameters that may predict
           response in these patients.

        -  Correlate bone marrow microvascular density before and after treatment with response in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic value of pretreatment plasma and serum levels of vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or the modulation of serum levels of VEGF during
           treatment in predicting response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (previously untreated acute leukemia
      vs other).

      Patients receive fludarabine IV over 5-10 minutes and carboplatin IV over 24 hours on days
      1-5 followed by topotecan IV continuously over 72 hours. Patients receive oral thalidomide
      daily beginning within days 1-3 and continuing in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with residual disease on day 16-18 may receive a second course of chemotherapy as
      above. Patients who achieve remission may receive a third course of chemotherapy as above as
      consolidation beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of prior chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
