      centres. Acute ICH patients who can be treated within 6 hours of onset will undergo CT
      angiography using standard CT procedures. Those with a spot sign will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1 ratio to a single injection of rFVIIa 80 Âµg/kg or placebo; patients without a spot sign
      will not be treated. The primary endpoint is ICH expansion within 24 hours.
