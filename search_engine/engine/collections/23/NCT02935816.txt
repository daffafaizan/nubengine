      multi---parametric MRI for staging metastatic disease. The investigators hypothesize that a
      whole body multi---parametric MRI will be more sensitive and specific than conventional
      imaging staging for detection of metastatic disease in patients with biochemical failure
      following local therapies. Investigators therefore propose a comparative trial of
      conventional imaging verses whole---body multi---parametric MRI within this population of
      men. The investigators would further like to explore whether heterogeneity between metastases
      of multi---parametric MRI signals can predict men unlikely to respond to ADT. The
      investigators aim to enhance the main study by exploratory work on exosome, pathway and
      genomic analysis, the results of which could lead to complimentary imaging / non---imaging
      biomarker combinations of clinical utility for patient stratification. Finally the
      investigators will perform a health economic analysis to assess the cost---effectiveness of
      whole---body multi---parametric MRI for metastatic disease staging compared with conventional
      staging with computed tomography and bone---scans.
