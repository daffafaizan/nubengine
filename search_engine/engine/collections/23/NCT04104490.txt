      arterial hypertension. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from the feces and sequenced by whole
      genome sequencing (shotgun sequencing). The DNA sequences will be used to identify the
      bacteria present in the feces, and to model the functions of the gut microbial community in
      each of the three groups. This will test for gut dysbiosis in pulmonary arterial hypertensive
      patients compared to healthy subjects. Gut dysbiosis is a condition where the gut bacterial
      communities are unbalanced and has been implicated in disease processes.

      In subjects recruited in the USA, blood samples will be tested for markers of gut leakiness
      and inflammation as well as gut bacterial metabolites found in the circulation.
