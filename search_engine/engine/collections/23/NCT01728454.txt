      participants to receive 2 additional 16-week cycles of active treatment at their randomized
      dose [6 mg or 12 mg/day]. Placebo participants who elect additional treatment will receive
      treatment at 12 mg/day. The treatment dose will remain double-blind. The study will be
      conducted in 3 stages. The first stage is a no treatment baseline assessment period. This
      stage will last as long as it takes to record at least one full menstrual cycle (ovulation
      until ovulation).

      For stage 2, following the run-in stage, at Visit 3, 60 participants will be randomized into
      one of 3 arms in a 1-1-1 fashion. The start of dosing should commence as soon as possible
      after ovulation following the end of the previous menstrual event.

      For stage 3, participants who are eligible to receive additional cycles of treatment and who
      elect to continue treatment will be scheduled within a week before the second expected menses
      (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval. Participants will receive 2 cycles of
      treatment separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will be followed until
      menses has returned.
