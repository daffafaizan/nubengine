      golden standard for postoperative pain management after major abdominal surgery. However a
      number of patient have absolute or relative contraindication to the placement of an epidural
      catheter. It is therefore necessary to find a good alternative to epidural catheter.

      Transversus abdominis plane(TAP) block has been shown to provide analgesia of the abdominal
      wall and reduce opioid-requirements and pain after abdominal surgery.

      However the effect of a TAP block is limited to the time of efficacy of the local analgesic
      used. Placing a TAP-catheter in order to prolong the effect of the TAP-block by repeatedly
      bolus-injections in the TAP-catheters has only been sporadically described and so far never
      investigated in a systematic way.

      We will investigate the practical and technical possibility to place bilateral
      ultrasound-guided TAP-catheters pre-operatively on patients undergoing elective
      colon-resection. Further more we will evaluate the pain and opioid-requirement
      postoperatively.
