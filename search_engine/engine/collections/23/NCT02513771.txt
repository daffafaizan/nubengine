    
      ACTG A5346 is a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, trial of
      sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo for 16 weeks followed by a 4-week post-intervention follow-up.
      A5346 studied whether sitagliptin reduced plasma concentrations of sCD14 in HIV-infected men
      and women â‰¥18 years of age who were on suppressive ART with HIV-1 RNA below the limit of
      quantification at screening and for at least the prior 48 weeks. Participants were randomized
      1:1 to Sitagliptin arm vs. Placebo arm, and were stratified by screening CD4 count (100-350
      vs. >350 cells/mm^3) and statin use (on statins vs. not on statins).
