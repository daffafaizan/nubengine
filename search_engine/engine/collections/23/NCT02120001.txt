      VAP development and drug-resistance induction. Silver-coated ETT have proven effective in
      delaying but not in preventing ETT colonization and biofilm formation, due to a barrier
      effect of biofilm and accumulated debris. Advanced ETT cleaning devices are able to remove
      debris and biofilm and reduce the total ETT microbial load to a certain extent. The
      Investigators hypothesize that the routine use of endOclear in patients intubated with a
      silver-coated ETT will reduce ETT microbial colonization. The Investigators therefore want to
      assess the reduction of ETT microbial colonization in patients intubated with a silver-coated
      ETT and cleaned with endOclear compared to the current standard of care of silver-coated ETT
      (blind suctioning). They plan to achieve this result by analyzing the tubes of each enrolled
      patient after it has been removed, either because the patient does not need it anymore due to
      his/her better clinical conditions, or because there is a need of tracheostomy or because
      he/she dies. Specifically they will analyze how the endOclear cleaning maneuver affects
      microbial colonization in the inner layer of the ETT and how this can determine distal airway
      inoculation and, ultimately, VAP development.

      Specific AIM #1: Investigators will test the hypothesis that routine use of endOclear in
      patients intubated with a silver-coated ETT will reduce ETT microbial colonization.

      Specific AIM #2: Investigators will test the hypothesis that keeping ETTs free from microbial
      colonization will prevent septic inoculation of distal airways

      Specific AIM #3: Investigators will test the hypothesis that prevention of ETT biofilm
      development will reduce drug resistance rates found in ETT and distal airways isolates

      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial on 40 patients intubated with
      silver-coated ETT and randomized to receive standard ETT cleaning vs cleaning with the
      endOclear device.
