    
      This is a crossover trial involving a total of 20 patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome,
      considered a chronic neuropathic pain. In two consecutive treatment periods, both 8 week
      long, each patient receives externally indistinguishable capsules (placebo or melatonin). A 4
      weeks wash-out period is applied, between these two periods.

      The capsules contain either placebo or 3 mg-melatonin (4 time/day for a total of 12 mg/day of
      melatonin). The primary endpoint is the change in pain intensity at the end of each treatment
      period, measured using VAS, verbal intensity score and NRS, as well as number of oral sites
      affected by the burning sensation. Furthermore, data from quality of life, anxiety and sleep
      questionnaires are collected (sf-36, HAM-A, ESS, MOS).

      Adverse effects are carefully recorded as well as blood samples, in order to measure serum
      melatonin levels during the trial.
