      recovering AECOPD patients were placed on different mode of noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation(NPPV, such as the PAV or PSV mode) randomly. For each mode, three levels (PA-,
      PA, PA+or PS-, PS, PS+), ) of support were applied.PS and PA are set for the patient's
      comfort . On the basis of these two levels, 25% increase and reduction assisted level of
      pressure were set both for PS and PA (PA-, PA+or PS-, PS+). At each level, the patients were
      ventilated at least 20 minutes until the breathing was stable. The respiratory frequency
      (RR), tidal volume (VT), transdiaphragmatic pressure (pdi) the pressure-time product (PTP)
      and root-mean-square(RMS) of EMGdi were calculated. Esophageal and gastric balloon-catheters
      were used to detect the intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure. Airway pressure was also
      measured simultaneously. EMGdi was recorded from a multipair esophageal electrode .During
      ventilation Airflow and ventilation were measured with pneumotachograph.
