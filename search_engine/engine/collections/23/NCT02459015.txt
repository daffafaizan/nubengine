      evaluation of the repair of digital nerve lesions.

      Medovent will perform this clinical investigation as a post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF)
      study in accordance with the MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev2 guidelines to confirm the medium- and
      long-term safety and performance of its chitosan-based nerve guide (Reaxon® Nerve Guide). The
      results of this investigation will be used by Medovent to update the clinical evaluation
      throughout the life-cycle of Reaxon® Nerve Guide and to ensure its long term safety and
      performance in the market. Additionally, Medovent will include the application of Reaxon®
      Nerve Guide in digital nerves to confirm the safety of applying Reaxon® Nerve Guide over
      joints.

      The study will be performed in specialized German centers. A total number of 76 subjects with
      traumatic digital nerve injuries in whom surgical repair may not allow end-to-end direct
      suture of the nerve ends, and in whom the nerve tissue gap would indicate the use of an
      autograft of equal or less than 26 mm, are eligible for inclusion.

      The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate that the static 2-point
      discrimination (2-PD) 12 months after surgery will be not inferior in the Reaxon® Nerve Guide
      test group compared to the control group receiving an autologous nerve graft.

      The secondary objective is to document the long-term effects (up to 18 months after surgery)
      in nerve repair. The non-inferiority test is to demonstrate that it can be excluded that the
      treatment difference is larger than 20% in favor for the control group.
