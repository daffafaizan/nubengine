      and social isolation, but hearing impairment often goes undiagnosed and untreated,
      particularly among minority and low-income older adults. Novel interventions that translate
      research on social engagement, minority health, and hearing technology are needed to expand
      delivery of hearing health care to underserved older adults. The Baltimore Hearing Equality
      through Accessible Research and Solutions (HEARS) project will develop and pilot a
      first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible, and effective
      hearing health care to minority and low-income older adults and their communication partners.
      The study will follow a mixed-methods approach that will incorporate quantitative and
      qualitative components throughout the formative and evaluative processes. Participants and
      their communication partners will be randomized to an immediate treatment group or a 3-month
      delayed treatment group. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention is associated
      with increased social engagement and communication, improved quality of life, and decreased
      loneliness and third-party disability in the immediate treatment compared to the delayed
      treatment group.
