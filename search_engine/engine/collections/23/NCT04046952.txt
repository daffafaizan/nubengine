      be performed at experienced 'Radial First' centers. A minimum of 800 patients having
      undergone successful radial catheterization will be enrolled in the study, 400 in each arm.
      Enrollment with continue at each site on discretion of the investigators until at least 800
      patients are enrolled, with each center contributing a minimum of 50 patients. Clinicians
      will perform the catheterization in accordance with local standard practice, with no minimum
      amount of anticoagulation required.

      Unlike the pilot trial of this device, the present study will have an identical time to first
      deflation of 60 minutes between the two groups, and have a larger sample size to detect any
      excess risk of hematoma or radial artery occlusion. The study may also help demonstrate a
      relatively low rate of radial artery occlusion with a rapid deflation protocol, even at lower
      doses of unfractionated heparin than currently recommended.
