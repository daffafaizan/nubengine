      protocol. Patients with COPD will receive either resveratrol (500 mg) or placebo for 12
      weeks. A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health will be performed. Results will
      provide novel insights into the mechanistic role that Sirt1 mediates in COPD related vascular
      dysfunction and systemic inflammation.
