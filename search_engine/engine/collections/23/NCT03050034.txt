      more and more an heterogeneous group of patients with serious diseases both acute and chronic
      and elderly, frail, poly-pathological patients, requiring intensive care. Hospitalization of
      medical patients in large wards without prior stratification of severity, complexity, level
      of dependence, comorbidities and without a proper assessment of the risk of rapid clinical
      deterioration, can lead to suboptimal treatment, resulting in prolonged hospital stay and
      increased care costs. Continuous monitoring of vital parameters may allow early detection of
      deterioration in acute patients not admitted in intensive care such as those hospitalized in
      Internal Medicine Unit, allowing the staff to immediately address the patient's needs
      achieving promptly the most appropriate care. As there are no studies comparing the use of
      wireless monitoring systems and traditional vital signs monitoring in critical acute
      patients, the study was designed to highlight the benefits of continuous monitoring of vital
      signs in the first 72 hours hospitalization to reduce the major complications and improving
      outcome. The study also aims to assess the reduction in hospitalization costs using as proxy
      the decrease in average length of stay.
