      a cementless anatomical femoral stem in THA between 1998 and 2008. After exclusion criteria
      applied, 127 stems had an varus axis deviated by more than 3 degrees (varus group) and 156
      had an alignment between 0 and 2.9Â° from the femoral axis (neutral group). Survivorship
      rates, complications, clinical scores, thigh pain, radiological score, cortical hypertrophy
      and filling rate were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 10 years.
