      in patients with breast cancer who are receiving taxane chemotherapies. However, no study to
      date looks at the effect of l-glutamine given after this numbness and tingling (called
      'perihperhal neuropathy') has already occurred. We hypothesize that administration of this
      amino acid in l-glutamine na√Øve patients will result in a measureable reduction of their
      taxane-induced neuropathy.
