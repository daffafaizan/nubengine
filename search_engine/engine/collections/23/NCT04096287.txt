    
      This Phase 1 clinical trial is a multicenter, double-blind, single ascending dose trial
      evaluating safety in up to a total of 48 participants across up to 6 dose cohorts, 5 planned
      and 1 to be determined if an additional dose group is required. Each cohort will include 8
      participants (6 active, 2 placebo) who will receive a single dose of either PNT001 or
      placebo. Within each cohort a sentinel group of 2 participants (1 active, 1 placebo) will be
      enrolled to evaluate safety and tolerability before enrolling the full cohort. If there are
      no safety concerns (as determined by the data and safety monitoring board [DSMB]), the
      remaining 6 participants (randomized as 5 active, 1 placebo) will be enrolled. This process
      will be followed for all additional cohorts.

      After screening, and laboratory assessments at Day -1, eligible participants will be admitted
      to the research unit on Day 1 (or Day -1 at Investigator's discretion), where they will
      remain for three (or four) nights with standardized meals provided during their inpatient
      stay. On Day 1, participants will be randomized to receive either active drug or placebo.
      Study medication will be administered as a single i.v. infusion over 30 minutes (up to 60
      minutes for doses greater than 2,700 mg), followed by collection of safety, tolerability, and
      PK data over 16 weeks. Participants will be discharged on Day 4 and will return for an
      outpatient study visit on Day 5 (may be phone or clinic visit), and to the study site on Days
      7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 112.
