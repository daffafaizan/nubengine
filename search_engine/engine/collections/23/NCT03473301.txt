    
      This study is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized, open-label trial designed to determine
      the effect size of change in GMFM-66 score in subjects treated with hCT-MSC or allogeneic CB
      and assess the safety of repeated doses of hCT-MSC in children with cerebral palsy. Children
      ages 2-5 years with cerebral palsy due to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, or
      periventricular leukomalacia may be eligible to participate. All participants will ultimately
      be treated with an allogeneic cell product at some point during the study. Participants will
      be randomized to one of three arms: (1) the "AlloCB" arm will receive one allogeneic CB
      infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the "MSC" arm will receive three hCT-MSC infusions, one
      each at baseline, three months, and six months; (3) the "natural history" arm will not
      receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an allogeneic CB infusion at 12 months.
      Motor outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, six-months, and one-year time points.
      Safety will be evaluated at each infusion visit and remotely for an additional 12 months
      after the final visit. Duration of study participation will be 24 months from the time of
      baseline visit. Randomization to treatment arms will be stratified by GMFCS level at study
      entry and etiology of CP (Stroke vs. Other).
