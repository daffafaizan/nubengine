      investigate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients after autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT). 94 patients were randomly divided into two groups according to the
      ratio of 1:1. The whole trial included screening period (day-28 to day-1), treatment period
      (Tislelizumab, 200mg every 8 weeks, 12 times) and follow-up period (2 years after the
      enrollment).
