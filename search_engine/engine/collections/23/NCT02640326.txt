      standard practice is being questioned in an era where unnecessary interventions are being
      re-considered, particularly since urinary catheterization is not without a risk of adverse
      events. The study is being done to establish an evidence base to support widespread
      discontinuation or continuation of this standard practice. Consenting patients will be
      randomized to either the catheterized or non-catheterized arms. Patient urinary management
      will be managed as per an a priori-defined protocol that follows St. Joseph's Healthcare
      Hamilton (SJHH) institutional standards.
