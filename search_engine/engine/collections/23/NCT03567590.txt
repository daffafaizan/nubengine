      radiofrequency treatment is better than traditional sphenopalatine ganglion nerve block
      technology and provides medical evidence for the clinical application and promotion of
      sphenopalatine ganglion pulsed radiofrequency treatment to provide a minimally invasive,
      safe, and effective treatment for patients with cluster headache who do not respond to drug
      treatment.
