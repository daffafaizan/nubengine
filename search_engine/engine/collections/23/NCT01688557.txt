      randomly assigned to innovative or conventional examination. Randomization will be based on
      computer-generated randomization lists. All patients will be blinded so they will not know
      which techniques will be used to assess lesions found in colon. In innovative colonoscopy
      group narrow band imaging (NBI) and Dual Focus (DF) function will be used to identify and
      classify all lesions acc. to Sano and Kudo classification. Endoscopic biopsy will be taken
      from all lesion and endoscopic diagnosis will be compared with final histological diagnosis.
      Thus sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, likelihood ratio and
      Youden index will be calculated. As secondary endpoints total examination time, coecal
      intubation rate and pain intensity (VAS scale) will be established. This study will help to
      establish whether new technologies used during colonoscopy may improve diagnostic
      possibilities and whether they prolong examination time or lead to increase of pain intensity
      afterwards.
