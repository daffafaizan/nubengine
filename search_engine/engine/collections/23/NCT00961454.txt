    
      We wish to study whether photobiomodulation (PBM) with near infrared (NIR) light emitting
      diodes (LED), a non-ionizing phototherapy, in patients with major depression, can acutely
      alter frontal brain blood flow measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

      Secondarily, we will examine whether PBM can improve emotional state immediately and over the
      following month.

      We see this as a pilot study to gather preliminary data that will guide future studies.
