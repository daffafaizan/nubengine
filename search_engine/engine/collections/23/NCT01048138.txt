      avoid the epileptogenic process. The treatment will be repeated every 6 hours for 10
      consecutive days. The efficacy of biperiden as an antiepileptogenic drug will be established
      by analyzing the development of PTE between the biperiden and placebo groups. Several
      patients' aspects (clinical, electroencephalography, brain imaging, genetic and behavioral
      data) will be monitored for two year follow-up to unravel the mechanisms by which biperiden
      exerts its actions on epileptogenesis. The investigators are already at the early stages of
      patient's recruitment using the available resources.
