      functional recovery following colorectal cancer surgery, some of which deal with the
      psychological domain. Distress and depression can negatively affect the perceptions of
      functional ability, while resilience and effective coping styles promote a better
      psychological adaptation to challenging situations. Furthermore, psychosocial prehabilitation
      and interventions have been proposed as a feasible and cost-effective way to positively
      influence the recovery after surgery in association with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery
      (ERAS) protocol.

      In particular, mindfulness is proved to be associated with higher quality of life in
      different medical conditions, including oncological patients and has been also associated
      with improved clinical outcomes.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the association of mindfulness and other psychological
      predictors with functional and quality of life outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal
      surgery for oncological condition.
