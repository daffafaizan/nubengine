      patients and quantize the influence of these factors", based on early research, this study
      will integrate Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacometrics, to explore an effective concentration of
      MTXPGn for JIA pediatric patients, and set up a Population Pharmacokinetics model to provide
      reference for individual administration on JIA pediatric patients.
