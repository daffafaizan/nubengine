      of elective coronary revascularization and/or valve replacement requiring CPB, to infusion of
      the highly-selective and potent ET-ARA, sitaxsentan at 1 or 2 mg/kg (IV bolus) or vehicle
      (saline). Infusion of the ET-ARA/vehicle was performed immediately prior to separation from
      CPB and again at 12 hrs post-CPB. ET and hemodynamic measurements were performed at baseline,
      at separation from CPB (Time 0) and at 0.5, 6, 12, 24 hrs post-CPB.
