      hour after beginning the infusion ≥ 60 mg/L. This target is rarely achieved in the ICU
      despite a 30 mg/kg recommended dosage. Using data collected prospectively in critically ill
      patients of Nîmes (France) (1) and Nantes (France), we will elaborate a population
      pharmacokinetic model on the non-parametric software Pmetrics and on the parametric software
      Monolix. We will calculate probability of target attainment of Monte-Carlo simulations, using
      the non-parametric model. Nomograms to determine optimal first dose of amikacin in critically
      ill patients, according to a few variables previously identified, will be produced.
