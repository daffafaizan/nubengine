    
      Objective: to cross-validate our near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging system with
      existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data,
      and b) to investigate any significant technical issues associated with optode placement and
      motion artifacts, and to explore techniques that will potentially improve the feasibility and
      reliability of the system according to the needs of the population whom existing imaging
      systems are unsuitable.

      Study population: 250 healthy volunteers

      Design: The study will look for correlations between NIRS signal changes in healthy subjects
      when performing functional tasks, and existing fMRI data.

      Outcome Measures: graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS, in response to
      different functional tasks.
