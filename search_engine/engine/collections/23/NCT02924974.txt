    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial. It will randomize 160 patients who are scheduled
      for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy. The intervention group will receive a single spinal
      injection of a bupivacaine (12,5 mg)/morphine(300 mcg) mixture. Controlgroup will receive a
      subcutaneous injection of lidoca√Øne for placebo purposes and an intravenous loading dose of
      morphine at the end of surgery.

      Both groups will receive general anesthesia during surgery in a standardized fashion.

      After the surgery, both groups will receive a Patient-Controlled Analgesia pump for
      post-operative pain control.

      Primary outcome is patient satisfaction as measured by the Quality-of-Recovery-15
      questionnaire. This questionnaire will be taken at baseline, day 2 and 1 week after surgery.

      Secundary outcomes are morphine use per PCA, duration of hospital stay, side-effects and ease
      of surgery.
