    
      By using a 2-step Fleming plan (Fleming, 1982) with a unilateral alpha risk of 5% and 90%
      potency, it is necessary to include 86 assessable patients.

      On the 1st step: 43 patients will be included (+/- 2 patients, if non-assessable patient(s)

        -  If 10 patients or less present an objective response, the trial will be discontinued on
           grounds of futility (H1 rejected)

        -  If 18 patients or less present an objective response, the trial will be discontinued on
           grounds of efficacy (H0 rejected)

      If not, we proceed with the 2nd step including 43 additional patients. If 29 patients or more
      present an objective response, the treatment will be considered as effective (H0 rejected)

      Considering a 5% ratio of visual loss or non-assessable patients, 91 patients will be
      included.
