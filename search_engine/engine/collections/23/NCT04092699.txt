      of structures with regular border but fairly assessed the structures with irregular border
      like paranasal sinuses. The semi-automatic software is efficient and accurate as manual
      tracing with significant reduction in inter-observer variability and time . On the other
      hand, all neighboring contacting voxels located within a defined range (threshold) of similar
      HU values of different adjacent tissues may be measured so over calculation or under
      calculation could be suspected
