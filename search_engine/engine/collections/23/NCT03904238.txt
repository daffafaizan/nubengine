      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and includes narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).
      Currently, pharmacotherapy is the only empirically-validated treatment for reducing EDS in
      this patient population but the burden of long-term management and adverse effects of the
      medication lead to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and elevations in depressive
      symptoms

      Evidence-based psychosocial interventions have been developed in other areas to improve HRQoL
      related to chronic illnesses, such as cancer and chronic pain. These interventions typically
      involve a package of cognitive and behavioral techniques teaching coping skills (e.g.,
      emotion-focused and problem-focused coping), behavioral management of the chronic illness
      symptoms (e.g., relaxation for pain management), and other strategies to improve psychosocial
      functioning (e.g., mindfulness). However, no such interventions have been developed or used
      for people with CH. Therefore, a major research gap exists for an empirically-validated
      psychosocial intervention which is aimed directly at improving emotional functioning and
      HRQoL for people with CH.

      The purpose of this project is to develop a cognitive-behavioral treatment for hypersomnia
      (CBT-H) and conducting a feasibility trial of CBT-H. The specific aims for this project are
      to: 1) develop and refine a treatment protocol for CBT-H; 2) identify the optimal delivery
      format of CBT-H; and 3) gather feasibility data on recruitment, retention, and selection
      criteria for a future clinical trial. The overall significance of this project is to improve
      the quality of care for people with CH by using a psychosocial intervention with medical
      management of hypersomnia.
