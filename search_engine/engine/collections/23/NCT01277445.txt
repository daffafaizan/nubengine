      substrates. While these claims appear to be widely accepted among nutritionists, the
      gut-microbiology community considers this an archaic view on these complex communities which
      contain in excess of 400 species of which the majority have yet to be cultivated or
      characterized. The bifidogenic effect associated with fructans also forms the basis of
      current prebiotic health claims in Canada, claims which up until now have not stood up to
      regulatory scrutiny The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of frucans on
      the human microbiome, as well as the physiological, immunological health of the host.
      Information generated from this study will address both aspects of the current FOA definition
      of what constitutes a "prebiotic". New data generated from this study will be applicable for
      a new health claim for prebiotics and will provide a guide for industry demonstrating the
      requirements for a scientifically valid study for other submissions involving prebiotics.
