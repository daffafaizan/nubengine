      gastroenterologists, either in private or public healthcare settings.

      All patients will undergo an endoscopy with gastric sampling in order to biopsy:

        -  1 sample each in anterior and posterior surfaces of antrum

        -  1 sample in lesser curvature

        -  1 sample each in anterior and posterior surfaces of body of stomach

      Patients will be contacted every 12 months and followed up for 3 years by their
      gastroenterologist. The follow-up will be performed according to the 2012 European Guideline
      on Management of Precancerous Conditions and Lesions in the stomach (Endoscopy 2012, Jan;
      44(1): 74-94). Patients will also receive a 6-monthly phone call from their
      gastroenterologist in order to know if any gastric symptom has appeared. At any time,
      patients should contact their gastroenterologist to inform them about new gastric symptoms.

      During follow-up, the frequency of gastroscopy with biopsy depends on the stage of lesions:

        -  patients with intestinal metaplasia: gastroscopy at 36 months.

        -  patients with dysplasia: an annual gastroscopy will be performed.

      In case of low grade dysplasia confirmed by pathologist at inclusion, patients will undergo 1
      year later another endoscopy with gastric sampling in order to biopsy:

        -  4 circumferential samplings of antrum

        -  1 sampling of curvature

        -  4 circumferential samplings of body of stomach
