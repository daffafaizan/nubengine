      there are no validated patient reported outcome (PRO) tools to assess health related quality
      of life (HRQOL) specifically in patients receiving ICMs. HRQOL is a multidimensional concept
      of a patient's perceived well-being that can be affected by disease and treatment. There is
      an urgent need to assess the impact of ICMs on HRQOL, to better understand the balance
      between efficacy and toxicity with these agents.

      This study aims to develop a health related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome
      (PRO) for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICM) therapy (FACT-ICM). The core
      domains of the FACT-ICM will include physical, emotional, family and social, and functional
      well being. In addition, the proposed study will develop a toxicity sub-scale related to
      resultant toxicities from ICM therapy.

      The HRQOL will be developed through focus groups and interviews with patients treated with
      ICMs, and clinicians treating patients with ICMs, to understand how treatment with ICMs
      impacts HRQOL, as well as explore general experiences, insights and concerns of those
      receiving ICM therapies.
