      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
           treated with cetuximab and FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin, irinotecan
           hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to response and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive
      FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 30-90 minutes, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 15 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
