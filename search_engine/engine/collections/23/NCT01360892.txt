    
      The aim of this study is to validate the predictive value of Real-time Tissue Elastography®
      by comparison with serum marker or FibroScan® in chronic hepatitis B or C patients.

      Every year and for three years, we performed Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling,
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. If in the hospital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also
      be performed.

      Subjects were also performed ultrasonography (US), computed sonography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) evry four or six months.

      The time between the Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling, gastrointestinal
      endoscopy and FiroScan® must not exceed four weeks.
