      neflamapimod in a population of AD patients at an early stage.

      To track the impact of this drug in patients, the investigators will use an innovative
      radiotracer, [18F]DPA-714, as a promising ligand of microglial activation targeting the
      translocator protein (TSPO), specific of microglial activation. The use of [18F]DPA-714 will
      allow to monitor the evolution of neuroinflammation in patients as a function of treatment.
      The main objective will be to compare the level of inflammation using the [18F]DPA-714 in
      neflamapimod and placebo groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) samples and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be collected to assess
      inflammation markers and brain structure respectively in these patients.
