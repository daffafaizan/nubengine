      the concept associated with a "positional joint failure," which occurs due to injury and may
      lead to a change in the joint alignment and hence its biomechanical resulting in symptoms
      such as pain, joint stiffness or weakness. To perform the MWM technique it is required to
      implement many criteria. During execution is applied an maintained accessory glide in order
      to correct the positional fault, while a physiological movement or action that usually caused
      the pain is performed actively or passively. A key component for the MWM is that pain should
      always be reduced and / or eliminated during application.

      All study participants will be submitted to an initial assessment protocol to determine the
      intensity of pain, the range of motion (ROM) in flexion and internal rotation of the hip and
      the collection of physical function parameters. After that, the intervention will be
      performed for each group, and then the re-evaluation will be carried out (final evaluation),
      pain intensity, ROM and physical function tests..
