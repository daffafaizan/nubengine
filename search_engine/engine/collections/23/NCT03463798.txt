      performed simultaneously using SLP and Sonar devices.

      Subjects will be asked to sit down on a chair with their neck in a neutral position and their
      back as straight as possible. The SLP and the Sonar will be lined up to project the grid of
      light and the ultrasonic wave sonar over the participant's chest and abdomen. Data will be
      collected during 5 minutes of tidal breathing. The same procedure will be repeated while
      having the patient lying down in supine position on the same chair for 5 additional minutes.
      During both sessions (sitting and supine), patients will be asked to perform a gentle
      inspiratory capacity (IC) maneuver to better appreciate the thoraco-abdominal asymmetry and
      distortion.
