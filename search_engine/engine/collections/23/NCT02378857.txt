      including echocardiography at rest and during exercise, heart catheterization with advanced
      hemodynamic studies, cardiac and abdominal MRI, abdominal ultrasound and transient
      elastography, quality of life assessment and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. A selection of
      tests will be performed in a healthy control group as well.
