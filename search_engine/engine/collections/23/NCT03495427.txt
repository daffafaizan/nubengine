      (spread) of their disease. These imaging tests often give good information, but not in all
      patients and not every time. This study deals with a new imaging test known as
      F-DCFPyL-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), or
      F-DCFPyL-PSMA PET. The objective of this study is to evaluate safety and usefulness of using
      F-DCFPyL in detecting recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer. The F-DCFPyL PET imaging
      technique is used in some parts of the world but is not currently standard imaging care.
      Better understanding how this new imaging test performs in identifying recurrent/metastatic
      prostate cancer may lead to better management of prostate cancer patients in the future.
