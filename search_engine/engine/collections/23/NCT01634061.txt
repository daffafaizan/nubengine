    
      A dose-escalation part will first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recomended dose for expansion (RDE) of abiraterone acetate in combination with BEZ235 and
      abiraterone acetate in combination with BKM120 in CRPC patients with abiraterone acetate
      failure.

      Subsequently, the MTD and/or RDE of each combination will be investigated in two expansion
      treatment groups of CRPC patients who have failed abiraterone acetate therapy.
