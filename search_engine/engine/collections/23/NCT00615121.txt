      plaque from the carotid artery or arterial tissue from the amputated limbs. The surgeon will
      perform the amputation, then the harvest team will collect arterial tissue from amputated
      limbs. These samples will be immersed in RNALater solution to preserve the integrity of the
      RNA. Tissues will stored at -80oC in the RNALater until the RNA is later extracted using a
      standardized protocol. The RNA will be examined for quality using an Agilent bioanalyzer, and
      will then be processed on Affymetrix U133A chips for gene expression data. The data will be
      analyzed with the MATLAB software package.
