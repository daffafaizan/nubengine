      parallel, Investigator/Sponsor masked study at approximately 35 investigative sites in the
      US.

      At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, approximately one-half of the participants will be
      randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb investigational samfilcon A soft contact lenses (Test)
      and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb
      PureVision soft contact lenses (Control). Both groups will wear the assigned lenses
      bilaterally on a 7-day extended wear basis throughout the 12 month study. The lenses are to
      be worn overnight for up to six consecutive nights per week. The lenses are to be removed,
      cleaned and disinfected on the seventh night and re-inserted the following morning. The
      lenses will be replaced with new lenses at the beginning of each month. Lenses will be
      provided at the Screening/Dispensing, 3-Month, 6-Month and 9-Month Follow-Up visits to
      maintain a monthly replacement schedule. Participants will also be required to complete a
      paper diary.
