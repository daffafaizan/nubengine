      best available current treatments. Homocysteine, normally found in the body, can interfere
      with NMDA-glutamate receptor function, and this might be responsible for some of the symptoms
      of schizophrenia. This double-blind protocol will have study participants who suffer from
      schizophrenia take either a high-dose combination of folate, B12 and pyridoxine (a
      combination that can lower homocysteine in the body) or placebo for three months. Clinical
      measures (e.g., PANSS, CGI) will be taken to determine whether those taking the vitamin
      combination experience clinical benefit.
