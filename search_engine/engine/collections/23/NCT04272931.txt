      survival compared to chemotherapy alone and may lead to cure in up to 40% of patients.
      Surgical resectability is limited by location of metastases and by FLR size and function.
      Commonly, the volume of the future liver remnant (FLR) should be at least 30% of the
      functional FLR volume. If this volume criterion is not met, the induction of liver
      regeneration between a two-stage hepatectomy is performed at many centers, with the aim to
      render patients resectable and reduce the risk of post hepatectomy liver failure. Gold
      standard to induce regeneration is the embolization of the portal vein branches to the tumor
      carrying liver (PVE) to induce regeneration of the FLR. Recently, combined embolization of
      both portal and hepatic veins (PVE/HVE) has been described as an alternative to portal vein
      embolization because it accelerates and increases growth of the FLR. PVE/HVE combines
      simultaneous embolization of the portal main branches into the tumor bearing liver and the
      hepatic vein draining them. The tissue in the part of the liver treated with PVE/HVE stays
      viable because the hepatic artery continues to supplies the liver deprived of portal and
      hepatic veins. Preclinical studies in pigs have demonstrated feasibility of this method and
      human case series show accelerated and increased liver growth. No multi-center evaluation has
      been performed so far. DRAGON 1 is an international, prospective, multi-center trial to test
      enrolment capacity of participants and safety of portal and hepatic vein embolization
      (PVE/HVE). DRAGON 1 will form the basis of the RCT DRAGON 2 to compare PVE with PVE/HV.
      DRAGON 2 is expected to start in 2021.
