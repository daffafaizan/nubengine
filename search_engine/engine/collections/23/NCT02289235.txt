      for at least two millennia. It contains several hundred valuable compounds and new
      constituents are still being found. Ginger's high antioxidant value has proved highly
      effective with its ability to scavenge a number of free radicals and protect cell membrane
      lipids from oxidation in a dose-dependent manner.

      In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the investigators want to
      investigate the effects of ginger in treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
