    
      The study is designed to enroll patients with Diabetes Mellitus over 18 years of age with
      diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, who were determined by their
      treating physician to require at least 3 serial injections with an anti-VEGF agent.

      After signing an informed consent, conjunctival cultures will be performed from the
      participants' both eyes at baseline and at each subsequent injection. Prior to each injection
      and the use of povidone-iodine drops, a conjunctival culture will be taken by swabbing the
      inferior fornix. Another culture will be taken twenty minutes after the injection. We will
      culture the swab samples on blood and chocolate agar plates.

      All patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their signs and symptoms
      after the injection (like burning sensation, itching, discharge, tearing etc). The following
      routine procedure will be used in all intravitreal injections: local anesthesia using
      Oxybuprocaine hydrochloride, ocular surface and eyelids sterilization with topical
      povidone-iodine 4%. Intravitreal injection of 3.5 mm will be performed posterior to the
      limbus in pseudophakic patients and 4 mm injection will be performed posterior to the limbus
      in phakic patients using a 30 gauge needle.

      The exclusion criteria will consist patients who had received a prior intraocular injection
      in either eye, current use of contact lenses, chronic use of any ophthalmic medication,
      ocular surgery within the past 6 months, use of systemic antibiotics within the past 6 months
      and known allergy or contraindication to povidone-iodine or proparacaine.

      The study is planned to enroll 50 patients.
