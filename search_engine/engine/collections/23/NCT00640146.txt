    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- controlled Phase 2 study to
      evaluate the safety and activity of subcutaneous (SC) MNTX versus SC placebo in participants
      who have undergone orthopedic procedures and who are expected to require opioids for 1 week
      after randomization. Participants will sign an informed consent form and be screened between
      Days 4-10 after their orthopedic procedure. Those participants who meet all eligibility
      requirements will be enrolled in the study. Treatment with study medication will be continued
      until either the participant no longer requires opioid medication for pain relief or the
      maximum number of doses is reached. Originally, participants were receiving treatment for up
      to 7 days. Then after Protocol Amendment 1 (12 March 2008), the duration of treatment changed
      from "up to 7 days" to "up to 4 days".
