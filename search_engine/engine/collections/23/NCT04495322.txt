      escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics profiles of
      TG-1000 in healthy volunteers, and to evaluate the food effect on pharmacokinetics of single
      oral dose of TG-1000 in healthy volunteers. The study will be divided into two parts.

      Part A is designed as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, single
      ascending oral dose to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profiles of TG-1000 in
      healthy volunteers.

      Part B is designed as randomized, open-label, two treatment (fasted vs. fed), two-period,
      two-sequence crossover to compare the effects of food on the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of single
      oral dose of TG-1000 in healthy subjects.
