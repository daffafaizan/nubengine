    
      The advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) described herein is a personalized tissue-
      engineered vein (P-TEV), a human vein segment graft for use in transplantation to replace a
      defective or missing part of a patient's vein.

      In this specific application a P-TEV segment with a functioning venous bicuspid valve is
      implanted to replace a nonfunctioning venous valve in the femoral vein of a patient suffering
      from severe CVI. The P-TEV is a hybrid tissue consisting of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
      scaffold of an allogeneic vein segment derived from a cadaveric donor as well as autologous
      components from a sample of peripheral blood of the recipient. As the allogeneic immunogenic
      material from the donor has been removed and been replaced by autologous components, no
      immunosuppression is required.

      Successful implantation and treatment should prevent the reverse flow of blood, decrease
      blood pooling in the lower leg, and thereby alleviate symptoms such as swelling, pain, and
      ulcers.
