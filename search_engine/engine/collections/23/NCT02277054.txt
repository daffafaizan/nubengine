      severe pathology (corneal ulcer, corneal leukoma after burn, trauma or infection) using
      anterior lamellar keratoplasty technique, i.e. when patient's diseased cornea is removed it
      will be substituted with proposed transparent implant. Usually these patients are grafted
      with human donor cornea, but the latter frequently fails due to graft-versus-host problems.
      We will test the safety (incidence of adverse events, biocompatability) and the effectiveness
      (ability to promote healing and increase vision) of developed biosynthetic corneas in 10
      patients with corneal pathology, where human donor cornea carries a high risk of rejection.
      The patients will be follow-uped for 12 months.
