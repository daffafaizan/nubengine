    
      Background: According to the last reviews Progesterone (P) and (17P) are able to reduce
      preterm delivery (PTD), either as prophylactic administration in the presence of previous PTD
      or as a treatment of the actual pregnancy, becoming at risk because of cervical
      shortening/preterm labour. At present is difficult to distinguish the clinical effects of P
      from the one of 17P as well as it is impossible to choice among the diverse doses and
      formulations utilized in the RCTs published so far, as well as in those under recruitment.

      Protocol: Women will be treated with P, 17P or just clinically observed according to on-line
      randomization assignment provided by the Methodological Unit. Treatments end at the
      completion of 36th week. Randomization will be stratified for early (22-27+6th) and late
      (28-31+6th wks) PTD risk. Interim analysis will be done at 50% enrollment.

      Sixty women will be allocated to each Clinical Centre to reach 480 enrollments, in the 3
      arms.

      Drugs will be provided by manufacturers.
