      immunosuppression limits quality of life and long-term survival.

      Investigators plan to examine the utility and safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) to allow withdrawal of immunosuppression in 10 liver transplant
      recipients who are at a high risk of developing recurrent liver damage from repeated bouts of
      rejection, or recurrent disease or who have a high likelihood of developing serious medical
      complications from complications of immune suppression.

      Hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized, purified and cryopreserved. Following a
      chemotherapy and Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) based-regimen for immune ablation, the
      purified stem cells will be thawed and infused back into participants (autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant - HSCT). Participants will be converted to everolimus, a
      mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi), which will be continued for 6 months and
      then withdrawn based on histologic evidence of graft acceptance.

      Participants will be followed closely for a total of 24 months for any biochemical and
      histologic evidence of tolerance or rejection. Re-vaccination to common viral and bacterial
      antigens will be undertaken as required using a standard protocol for recipients of a
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
