      of local bleeding risk, even in the most hemorragiparic situations, decreased downtime and
      time reduction of hospitalization, improved patient ulterior comfort. However, this approach
      is subject to an immediate major complication that is the radial artery spasm (RAS) which,
      according to the criteria used, has an average incidence of 30%. The administration of a
      vasodilator just before coronary angiography procedure enables an increase of the radial
      artery diameter and thus a decrease of friction probes. Theoretically this prevents the
      occurrence of the RAS.

      The literature re-counts several vasodilator product tests (DN calcic blocker, magnesium
      sulfate, alpha-adrenergic antagonist ...) and various routes of administration (direct
      intravenous route (IV), subcutaneous injected route, direct intra-arterial route (IA)).
      Overall intra-arterial DN appears to be more efficient. The downside is a brief, painful
      thermal sensation but intense and notably unpleasant. IV injection is better tolerated but it
      was a direct injection and without proof of its superiority over IA. The para-radial
      subcutaneous injection has only been studied to facilitate access to the radial artery. The
      investigators randomized study compares, for the first time, the effectiveness of the
      transdermal administration of trinitrine (D) and continuous intravenous of dinitrate
      isosorbide (V) to dinitrate isosorbide intraarterial (A) standard.
