        1. There are almost no data regarding the relative prevalence of viral pathogens associated
           with myocarditis and the demographic and clinical features related to these infections
           in Egypt. Therefore, our main interest is to determine the prevalence of the most common
           viruses in clinically relevant (i.e., hospitalization- requiring) patients with acute or
           chronic myocarditis, using highly sensitive molecular techniques as the diagnostic tool.

        2. Our second aim is to determine the distribution of mono- and coinfections between these
           viral agents.

        3. Finally, to correlate between the microbiological findings in this study and patient
           characteristics including age, sex, clinical features, regional distribution, and degree
           of urbanization (determined on the basis of the size of the city and the density of the
           population) of the patients.
