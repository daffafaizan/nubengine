      barrier may underestimate the volume to be irradiated. The natural course of these gliomas
      after first irradiation is a second relapse within 12 months with, in 40% of cases, relapses
      outside the initial radiation field.

      Amino acid PET-CT (Positon Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography) could be an
      interesting alternative to tumor delineation because its results, do not depend on the
      rupture of the blood-brain barrier. Several studies have used amino acid PET in the planning
      of radiotherapy treatment for high-grade gliomas, but without a well-conducted prospective
      study. In the recurrent high-grade glioma population, no studies have been performed with
      18F-DOPA.( 6-fluoro-[18F]-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) The question therefore relates to the
      interest of cerebral 18F-DOPA PET-CT to improve the delineation of the volumes to be
      re-irradiated, during the recurrence of high-grade gliomas, and on the optimal methodology
      for determining GTV- PET.

      To compare GTV-TEP and GTV-MRI volumes with each other, and the r-GTV, volume corresponding
      to the relapse objectified on the follow-up MRI, the analysis will be based on 3 parameters:

        -  DICE index, similarity index between 2 volumes,

        -  Contoured Common Volume (VCC), intersection of 2 volumes between them,

        -  Additional Contoured Volume (VSC), total volume delineated with imaging minus the common
           volume between 2 imageries.

      Thus, within the rGTV relapse volume, it's important to know whether VSC of 18F-DOPA PET-CT
      is significant compared to that of MRI and would thus allow better definition of the volumes
      to be irradiated.
