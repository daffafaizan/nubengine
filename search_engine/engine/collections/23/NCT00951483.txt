      cardiovascular disease (CVD) development is clear and compelling. A cadre of inflammation,
      platelet activation and other biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction strongly suggest multiple
      and possibly interrelated mechanisms underlying this co-morbidity. Early detection of the
      vulnerability to develop CVD has become an urgent health issue. However, detection alone of
      vulnerability without proper therapeutic intervention aimed at reversing it, is merely of
      scientific interest. The evidence to date that antidepressant drugs, while highly efficacious
      in restoring euthymia, may not normalize the biomarkers of CVD vulnerability. Hence, there is
      a need to identify other pharmacologic interventions for depression. Quetiapine, due to its
      unique molecular structure and unique pharmacological profile, belongs to none of the known
      classes of antidepressants. However, quetiapine clearly has antidepressant and anti-anxiety
      efficacies. Now, we propose to explore whether quetiapine can reverse those
      pathophysiological changes occurring in mixed depression/anxiety that have been linked
      causally to the development of CVD. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study is to
      compare C-Reactive Protein between the treatment and healthy control groups at 12 weeks post
      treatment.
