      capacity for early diagnosis of disease, have prolonged life expectancy after pancreatic
      resection. For these patients, the endocrine function of the pancreas is a critical factor
      that influences quality of life. In this study, the investigators recruit patients who
      underwent distal pancreatectomy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital within the last 10
      years. Demographic characteristics, operative parameters and short-term postoperative
      outcomes were collected in a prospective database maintained by the Pancreatic Surgical
      Centre, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. These patients are followed up regularly by
      outpatient visiting or telephone for long-term outcomes. The primary outcome of this study is
      new-onset diabetes mellitus; second outcomes include impaired fasting glucose, impaired
      glucose tolerance, exocrine insufficiency and disease recurrence. This study aim to determine
      the cumulative rates of endocrine insufficiency, and identify risk factors for DM development
      in a large cohort of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy.
