      during quiet spontaneous breathing. Child's position will be changed 5 times every 10 minutes
      in a random order. Positions observed will be: left lateral, right lateral, supine, prone
      face to left, prone face to right and supine with the bed tilted 30 degrees. Total duration
      for the recording will be 1 hour.
