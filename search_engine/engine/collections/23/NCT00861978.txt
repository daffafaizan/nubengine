      which is also the form that was characterized extensively in clinical trials. Atypical
      depression with reversed vegetative signs, such as hyperphagia or hypersomnia, is
      traditionalla neglected, demonstrated by the fact that in the most widely used depression
      scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale, melancholic symptoms have a specific weight,
      while, by contrast, reversed vegetative signs are not included. This etablishes a tendency to
      underestimate the severity of atypical depression.
