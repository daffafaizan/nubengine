    
      The study will be conducted as an open-label randomized two-arm multicenter Phase II study.
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms within each
      stratum: AEZS-108 (267 mg/m2 every 21 calendar days) (Arm A) OR SSCC (Arm B) at discretion of
      treating oncologist cycled every 21 calendar days.

      Stratified randomization will be used with number of prior lines of therapies (1-2 versus
      >2). Tumor assessment will be repeated every 2 cycles. At the time of disease progression,
      Arm B patients may be crossed over to AEZS-108 as long as none of the exclusion criteria for
      study entry apply. Particularly, LVEF â‰¥50% is required, and patients failing on liposomal
      doxorubicin cannot be crossed over to AEZS-108.

      Analysis of the main study endpoint, PFS, will follow a group sequential design with one
      interim and one final analysis utilizing the O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries procedure.
      The study will be terminated for futility if the lower bound is crossed and for superiority
      if the upper bound is crossed. The sponsor may also terminate the study for futility based on
      other considerations such as safety.
