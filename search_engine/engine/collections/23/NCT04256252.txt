    
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a group of autoimmune inflammatory
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system primarily characterized with recurrent
      optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, leading to blindness and
      paralysis. Incremental disability due to clinical attacks make it essential to prevent
      relapses with immunosuppressive therapy. Since the serological pathogenic marker
      anti-aquaporin 4 immunoglobulin G (anti-AQP4 IgG) has been identified, NMOSD has unveiled its
      autoimmune features with close connections to B cell-mediated humoral immunity. Rituximab, a
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directly against human CD20 molecular on the surface of B cells,
      has been reported to deplete peripheral CD20+ B cells and to be highly effective for treating
      NMOSD, and therefore been recommended as first-line therapy for this disorder. Unfortunately,
      there are still no consensus statements on dosing and follow-up regimens, which needs
      investigations to explore the efficacy and safety of different rituximab strategies. Previous
      studies have provided pilot evidence supporting the use of low-dose rituximab in preventing
      relapses in Chinese patients with NMO/NMOSD, however, prospective multicenter studies are
      still needed to determine the effectiveness of the modified strategy in treating NMOSD.
