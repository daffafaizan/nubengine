      without subsequent wearing of compression garments (long tights) for 5 days at baseline and
      after a washout period of 4 weeks. Healthy young to middle aged athletes used compression
      garments immediately postexercise for 24 hours and further 12 h during the day. Blood
      samples, questionnaires, resting metabolic rate and performance test were applied prior and
      24, 48,72 and 96 h post-exercise consistently without wearing compression garments.
