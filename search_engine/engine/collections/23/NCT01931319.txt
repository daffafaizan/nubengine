      clinical research facility. Three single doses were evaluated using three cohorts (N=12 per
      cohort). Study doses were as follows: cohort 1 - 7.5mg IV and 10mg PO, cohort 2 - 11.5mg IV
      and 15mg PO, and cohort 3 - 15mg IV and 20mg PO. The IV baclofen doses for this trial were
      based on a 75% bioavailability observed in a previous low dose study.16 The oral formulation
      of the study drug used in this trial was 10mg baclofen tablet (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
      Ltd.) and is commercially available. The intravenous formulation was 2mg/mL solution
      manufactured by Aptuit LLC. for this study. IV infusions were administered over 10 minutes.
      In addition, cohort 3 received 15mg over a 60-minute infusion. There was a minimum 48-hour
      washout period between doses. Initially, 3 subjects received study drug at a given dose,
      after assessing the safety and tolerance of baclofen the additional 9 subjects received study
      drug.
