      (TDV). TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever. This study looked at
      safety and the titers of antibodies to dengue fever induced in people who were administered a
      high-dose of TDV (HD-TDV) compared to TDV.

      The study enrolled 351 patients. Before being assigned to a treatment group participants were
      screened for previous exposure to the dengue virus using a Dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Participants were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio
      (by chance) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the participant
      and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  HD-TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

      All participants received a single injection on Day 1. Participants were asked to record any
      symptoms that may or may not be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card
      for 28 days after vaccination.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Singapore. The overall time of participation in this
      study was 12 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit
      1 year after receiving their dose of TDV.
