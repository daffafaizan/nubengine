      naltrexone or naloxone is an antidote for opioids. A medication that has the potential to
      block alcohol actions in the Central Nervous System could act as a unique medication in the
      treatment of alcohol intoxication and alcoholism. This project is evaluating the
      benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, iomazenil, as an agent that could reverse alcohol's
      effects on subjective intoxication, alcohol's effects on driving using a driving simulator
      and on measures of electrophysiology in the laboratory in healthy subjects.
