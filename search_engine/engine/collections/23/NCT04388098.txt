      divided into two groups: Group I (asthmatic children) and Group II (healthy control). All the
      children were clinically examined to assess their dental caries experience and periodontal
      health condition. A trained and calibrated examiner (kappa = 0.95) performed the dental
      caries examination according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Dental caries
      status was recorded using the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (dmft/DMFT) and
      decayed, missing or filled surface (dmfs/DMFS) indices. Periodontal health was assessed by
      gingival index [GI] and plaque index(PI). An interview was conducted with parents/guardians
      and a structured questionnaire was employed to parents in addition to medical records.
      Stimulated salivary samples were collected and assessed for salivary flow rate, salivary pH
      and buffering capacity.
