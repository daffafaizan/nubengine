      pelvic floor disorders while minimizing complications and unnecessary procedures. Efficacy
      and risk always compete for equilibrium. Level I evidence has demonstrated a positive
      efficacy benefit of a concomitant synthetic mid-urethral sling in women with, and without,
      pre-operative symptoms of SUI who are undergoing POP repair. Concomitant sling placement has
      been shown to reduce the risk of de novo or persistent SUI from 50% to 23%. The combination
      of surgical treatment of POP and SUI at the same time, however, increases the risk of
      incomplete bladder emptying. While retropubic (RP) slings are considered to be the
      "gold-standard" referent for other slings with long-term outcomes data, they are associated
      with the highest risks of intra- and post-operative complications including bladder injury,
      bleeding, and post-operative voiding dysfunction. Single-incision slings (SIS) are the latest
      iteration in sling development that build upon the benefits of slings but avoid passage
      through the muscles of the inner thigh. As the combination of POP and sling surgery increases
      the risk of voiding dysfunction, and rates of incomplete bladder emptying appear
      significantly lower for SIS than RP slings, the study team hypothesizes that the use of the
      Altis â„¢ SIS will be non-inferior to RP slings in efficacy and superior in irritative voiding
      symptoms/voiding dysfunction at one year after combined surgery.
