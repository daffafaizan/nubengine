      world. Despite all efforts to control this disease, rates of CKD progression are still high
      and a significant number of patients will ultimately need renal replacement therapy.
      Pharmacological blockade of renin-angiotensin system is one of the key elements of CKD
      secondary prevention, and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor 1 blocker (ARB)can be
      used for this purpose. However, it is still not clear if dual blockade (ACEi and ARBs
      simultaneously)is superior to monotherapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. A recent trial has
      suggested that dual blockade is superior to monotherapy in non-diabetic chronic kidney
      disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy compared
      to ACE inhibitors alone in type 2 diabetic patients with macroalbuminuric diabetic
      nephropathy.
