    
      Phase IIa intervention study, pilot, prospective, multicenter, randomized in 2 parallel arms,
      Li+ versus placebo, double-blind. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect
      of Li+ at 12 weeks, compared to placebo, on the social communication deficit in patients with
      Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (SHANK3 haploinsufficiency).

      The Secondary Objectives are :

        -  To evaluate the effect of Li+ at 12 weeks on all cardinal and main symptoms in patients
           suffering from Phelan-McDemid Syndrome (PMS).

        -  Evaluate the tolerance of Li + for 12 weeks in children suffering from PMS.

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of a phase III, randomized controlled trial. The treatment
           of the study is lithium carbonate: Li+ carbonate capsules are prepared from the raw
           material for pharmaceutical use .

      Inclusion will be ensured by the clinical genetics centers. Psychiatric evaluation will be
      carried out by the investigative child psychiatry service.

      Patients will be followed up by 2 referring physicians:

        -  a child psychiatrist, blind of the treatment arm, who will carry out the evaluations of
           the judgement criteria;

        -  a physician from the clinical investigation center, the only one informed of the
           attribution arm, who will ensure the adaptation of the LI dosage; an adaptation of the
           dummy dosage will be proposed to the patients on placebo to maintain the blind in this
           group as well.

      As the evaluation is based on hetero-evaluation (by the parents), a placebo treatment remains
      necessary in the control arm.

      Pharmaceutical preparations will be carried out for this pilot study: unit blister packaging
      of the active ingredient and the placebo.
