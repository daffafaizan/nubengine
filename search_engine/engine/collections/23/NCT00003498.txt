    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and bone
           marrow transplantation.

        -  Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous
      Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
      Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Non-Hodgkin's
           Lymphoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial
           response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
