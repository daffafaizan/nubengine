      defined from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP), which routinely
      aggregates data from specialist IDT pain management clinics across Sweden. SQRP contains
      information on the exposure/intervention: whether a patient that visited a SQRP-affiliated
      clinic was allocated to an IDT program (test) or not (control); t0 defined as the day of the
      IDT assessment. Microdata from SQRP is linked to other Swedish registers via the unique
      personal identification number held by all Swedish residents. Outcome data is obtained from
      the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. Registers managed by the National Board of Health and
      Welfare include data on dispensed prescription pharmaceuticals and specialist health care.

      Markov multistate survival-based methods will be used to compare the sickness absence between
      groups. Specifically, length of stay per sickness absence state (no sickness absence, sick
      leave, and disability pension) will be compared over five years from t0. Both crude and
      adjusted estimates will be presented. Adjustment will be made based on our hypothesis about
      causal relationships and include: history of sickness absence, sociodemographics (age, sex,
      sociodemographic status), patient disability (emotional distress, everyday interference, and
      confidence in future improvement), and governmental policy (IDT assessment year and
      geographical region of IDT clinic).
