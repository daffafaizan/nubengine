    
      The general aim of this protocol is to demonstrate the applicability of a personalised and
      precision medicine approach in beta-thalassaemia; the clinical trial setting repurposes a
      drug, namely sirolimus. The presence of high Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) levels is considered a
      condition predictive of a favourable outcome in thalassaemia. Its increase induced by
      pharmacological agents is considered a potential way to improve the clinical status of the
      patients. In terms of efficacy analysis, the investigators will focus their attention on HbF
      levels.

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ The suitability evaluation of sirolimus for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients
      within the frame of a comprehensive project aimed at the reduction of their transfusions
      need, with consequent amelioration of their quality of life. The purpose can be achieved
      through increasing of HbF levels pharmacologically mediated, with verification of a
      prerequisite, namely the correlation between the induction of HbF in vitro and in vivo in
      single patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of sirolimus and correlation between administered dose and blood
           levels in beta-thalassemia patients

        -  To assess the influence of sirolimus on transfusion regimen

        -  To assess the effect of sirolimus on the hematopoietic and immune system of thalassemia
           patients.
