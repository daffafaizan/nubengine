    
      Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Two groups, the study
      group and the control group, took part in the study.

      Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for five days (9 mg between 36-50 kg, 12 mg between 51-65 kg, 15 mg
      between 66-79 kg and 200 microgram/kg in > 80 kg) in the form of a solution prepared for
      enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine (2x400mg loading
      dose followed by 2x200mg, po, 5 days) + favipiravir (2x1600mg loading dose followed by
      2x600mg maintenance dose, po, total 5 days) + azithromycin (first day 500mg followed by 4
      days 250mg/day, po, total 5 days)- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the
      control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin.

      The mutations in 29 pairs of primers in mdr1/abcab1 gene by sequencing analysis using Sanger
      method, and the haplotypes and mutations of the CYP3A4 gene that cause the function losing
      were investigated among the patients who meet criteria and who were included in the study
      group according to randomization. Mutation screening was done when the first dose of the
      research drug ivermectin was given, ivermectin treatment was not continued in patients with
      mutations detected as a result of genetic examination and these patients were excluded from
      the study.

      Patients were followed for 5 additional days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and
      follow-up period (At the end of 10th day), clinical response and changes in oxygenation and
      laboratory parameters were evaluated.
