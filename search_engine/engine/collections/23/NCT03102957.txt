      associated with language and memory in adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (ELT). By
      using functional MRI, patients will be examined before and after surgery. Cerebral
      plasticity, defined in terms of intrinsic variables such as the topography of the activated
      regions, will be explored according to some extrinsic factors such as the age at onset of
      crises (before or after 5-6 years), whether or not Hippocampal sclerosis, hemispheric
      predominance of language (left or right).
