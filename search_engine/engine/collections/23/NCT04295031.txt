      (Association of Medical Endocrinologists - AME) and approved by the Ethical Committee of
      Cuneo Hospital. The research was open to all specialists taking care of patients with
      diabetes in Italy.

      The primary endpoint was the evaluation of metformin dosage. Secondary endpoints were the
      relationship between the metformin dosage and the renal filtration rate and the relationship
      between the metformin dosage and the concomitant medication.

      An ad hoc form was developed and used to record all medical findings. The form was emailed to
      all participating centers who then emailed or faxed it back to the investigator's data
      manager. Data were checked for accuracy.

      The following data were required: age, gender, body weight and height, diabetes duration,
      type of metformin (classical/slow), daily dosage of metformin, reported side
      effects,concomitant medications.

      Serum creatinine and HbA1c levels obtained within the previous two months were also required.

      Each participating center recruited about 50 diabetic outpatients. Inclusion criteria were as
      follows: adult outpatients â‰¥ 65 years with T2 diabetes mellitus, using metformin for at least
      six months, usually assuming three daily meals, and capable of informed consent.
