      with saliva and gingival fluid is almost inevitable. The use of an intermediate bonding layer
      between humidity contaminated enamel and sealant can improve bond strength, reduces
      microleakage, and enhances resin flow into fissures. The benefit of primer and adhesive layer
      beneath the sealant seems to be based on a combination of moisture-chasing effects of the
      hydrophilic primer, increased flow dispersion imparted by the less viscous primer and
      adhesive and increased flexibility of the combined and polymerized primer/adhesive/resin
      complex once reaction is complete.
