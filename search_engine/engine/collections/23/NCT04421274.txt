      stem cells (BM-MSCs) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and its
      effect on cardiac function and viable myocardium. We plan to include approximately 40
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction as a research object, and conduct a
      randomized, single-blind, parallel-controlled multi-center clinical trial. The patients were
      randomly divided into a BM-MSCs group and a control group, and were given the best drug
      treatment and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary study endpoint was the
      change in myocardial metabolic activity 6 months after autologous BM-MSCs transplantation and
      the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 12 months; The incidence of
      adverse events. The above indexes were evaluated by cardiac color echocardiography and single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
