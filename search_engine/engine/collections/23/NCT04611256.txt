      treatments that have shown to be beneficial for patients in a critical state in other
      countries is an urgent need. Adipose tissue derived-mesenchymal stem cells for could favor
      the regulation of patient immune system to reduce the proinflammatory state and promoting the
      regeneration of damaged tissues.

      Patients diagnosed COVID-19 and confirmed positive with the virus by PCR, will be treated
      with two intravenous infusions MSCs on the day 1 (D1) and the day 3 (D3) of the treatment
      consisting of 1X106/kg each.

      We will assess the pulmonary lesion area by chest x-ray or computed axial tomography at
      baseline and days 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25.

      Days to clinical improvement (to be evaluated on days 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25), considering
      temperature and other vital signs measurement, arterial oxygen saturation, blood chemistry
      (including liver function tests), creatine phosphokinase, C reactive protein, immune cells
      (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+, and CD56+ lymphocytes), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
      IL- 2, TNF-α, ITN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgE), HLA
      profile expression, and weaning from mechanical ventilation.
