      eligible patients via text messaging. This pragmatic randomized controlled trial has the
      following aims:

      Aim 1: To conduct systematic large scale text message outreach for vaccine delivery among a
      defined group of Penn Medicine in a way that advances equity.

      Aim 2: To offer different scheduling workflows through text messaging that might increase
      uptake and reduce disparities.

      Aim 3: To compare the equity and efficiency of different messages informed by behavioral
      science, including PCP endorsement, opt-out framing, and scarcity.
