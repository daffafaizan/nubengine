      underlying mechanisms are unknown. In a human disease model comprising LPS-induced
      inflammation, 36 hour fast and bed rest the investigators want to investigate mechanisms
      accounting for the nausea and decreased food intake often observed in hospitalized patients.

      Aim: This study aims to investigate total transit time and motility of the GI-tract together
      with the regulation of gut- and appetite hormones following catabolic conditions compared
      with healthy controlled conditions

      Hypothesis:

      Catabolic stress (endotoxemia/inflammation + 36 h fast and bed rest) induces GI-tract and
      hormonal changes compared with healthy conditions (overnight fast)

      Interventions:

      In a randomized crossover design, eight healthy, lean, young men will undergo either:

      i) Healthy conditions (overnight fast) + whey protein

      ii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + whey protein

      iii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + 3-ketone/whey
      protein

      Beverages will be isonitrogenous with 45 g whey protein + 20 g maltodextrin +/- 50 g of
      3-OHB. Bolus/sip administration will be applied (1/3 bolus, 2/3 sip).Beverages will be
      isocaloric (fat will be added to interventions without 3-OHB)

      *LPS will be administered (1 ng/kg) the day prior to the study together with fast and bed
      rest. On the study day LPS (0.5 ng/kg) will be injected.
