    
      Pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a (PHP1a) is a disorder that is associated with many endocrine
      problems. People with PHP1a are at risk for the development of obesity. The objective of the
      study will help determine if obesity is related to abnormalities energy expenditure, meaning
      that people with PHP1a may not burn as many calories while at rest as those without the
      disorder.

      In order to further evaluate obesity in PHP1a, investigators are planning to measure resting
      energy expenditure (REE), which is the amount of calories burned while completely at rest.
      Investigators will also evaluate body composition by looking at measures of growth and
      development and determining the amount of body fat using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) as well as blood and urine biologic markers of obesity. The investigators plan to
      evaluate people with PHP1a at all weights.
