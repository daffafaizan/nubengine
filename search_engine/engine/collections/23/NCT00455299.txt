      double crown mesh fixation with titanium spiral tacks with hernia approximation and the same
      fixations without hernia approximation.

      Primary endpoint is recurrence. Secondary endpoints are operating time, adhesion score, mode
      of entering abdominal cavity, time to recovery, pain durance, seroma formation, aesthetic
      result (protrusion), organ traumatization infection. Endpoints are correlated to hernia size,
      body mass index, previous recurrence, age, concurrent illness. Patients are followed 3 years
      after operation with clinical examination.

      300 patients are planned included in primary study. A subgroup of organ transplanted patients
      is evaluated in a separate study with identical criteria for inclusion.
