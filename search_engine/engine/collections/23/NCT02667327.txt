      less than 30% will be eligible for randomization providing all other criteria are met.
      Participants enrolled in the study will receive treatment based on randomization into 1 of 3
      treatment arms for up to 12 weeks. The participants will have an additional 12 week follow-up
      period beyond the treatment period to assess durability of wound closure.
