      adolescents from 1 to 19 years old. Neuroblastomas correspond to nearly 10% of all cancer
      diagnoses among children younger than 15 years of age, with an incidence of 1 case per
      100,000 children of this age group. About 500 new cases of neuroblastoma (NB) are diagnosed
      annually in Brazil. The complexity and intensity of treatment result in several
      treatment-related toxicities (TRT) that make it challenging to maintain nutritional status in
      these nutritionally at-risk patients. In Brazil, up to 26% of undernutrition at diagnosis has
      been found in patients with solid tumors. In neuroblastoma, high prevalence rates of
      malnutrition have been reported elsewhere with up to 80% of children at diagnosis and 20-50%
      during treatment classified as undernourished. It's important to underscore that nutritional
      status is a modifiable risk factor, therefore it needs more attention and close monitoring.
      It is important to better comprehend the effect of treatment for neuroblastoma on nutritional
      status and body composition, for which prospective longitudinal studies are required.
      Therefore, in this prospective cohort study, the investigators will evaluate the fluctuations
      in nutritional status over the course of treatment in children with neuroblastoma at the
      study center in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The results of this study will drive the development of
      evidence-based guidelines for the nutritional care of children with neuroblastoma and set
      research priorities for subsequent investigations.
