      the control group). In the WBC group, 10 sessions of WBC were performed (in addition to usual
      care) in a standard cryotherapy room over a duration of 8 days. Patients in the control group
      did not change anything in their everyday activities. Several self-reported variables
      relating to perceived health were measured repeatedly (pain intensity, functional mobility,
      and quality of life).
