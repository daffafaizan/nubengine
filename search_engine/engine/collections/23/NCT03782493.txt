      communication support strategies are effective for improving language outcomes in children
      with emergent developmental language disorder.

      At study entry, 108 children with emergent developmental language disorder (DLD) at 30 months
      of age will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either the EMT-SF treatment condition or a Business
      as Usual (BAU) control group. The control group is necessary to determine the efficacy of the
      EMT-SF intervention. The EMT-SF group is necessary to evaluate the effects of systematically
      teaching caregivers to use these strategies. Because all children in the study have language
      delays that will make them eligible to receive the early intervention services through the
      state early intervention program, children in both experimental conditions will receive
      state-provided community-based intervention according to their Individualized Family Service
      Plan - the current standard of care or from private speech language therapy providers.
      Children in the EMT-SF condition will receive an additional 18 months of interventionist plus
      caregiver-implemented intervention sessions. Children in both groups will be assessed at the
      start of the study and every 3 months until the child is 49 months old. The goal is to enroll
      all children at 30 months of age and provide a minimum of 60 of the planned 66 sessions of
      intervention to each child in the treatment condition; however, variability in age at study
      entry (e.g., 30 months), intervention dosage, and number of assessment data points will be
      addressed in the statistical analysis.
