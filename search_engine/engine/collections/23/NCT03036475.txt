      sentinel lymph node localization in the management of breast cancer. The latest evidence from
      a number of European trials has proven that a new tracer agent, superparamagnetic iron oxide
      particles (SPIOs, Sienna+®), is non-inferior to the standard method of lymphatic mapping. Its
      application and feasibility has yet been tried in most Asian countries.

      This is a prospective paired comparison trial involving both the new magnetic technique and
      the standard method. Patients with preoperative diagnosis of invasive carcinoma or ductal
      carcinoma in-situ of the breast undergoing SNOLL (Sentinel node and occult lesion
      localization) will be recruited from the Breast Centre of Kwong Wah Hospital. Informed
      consent will be obtained. All patients recruited will receive subcutaneous injection of 2 ml
      of Sienna+® diluted with saline to 5 ml at Breast Centre in the morning of operation,
      followed by five minutes of massage to the injection site. Before incision, on-table
      transcutaneous detection with the handheld magnetometer are carried out after at least 20
      minutes from injection. Intraoperative counts of sentinel lymph nodes identified as well as
      the ex-vivo counts of excised nodes are also measured. All procedures are supplemented with
      localization by radioisotope. All lymph nodes excised will be sent for histopathological
      examination.
