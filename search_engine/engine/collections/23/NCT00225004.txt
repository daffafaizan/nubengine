    
      Colles Fracture is known to be connected to decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Thus, it
      can be an early sign of osteoporosis and therefore an increased risk of new fractures.

      The results of earlier studies have not been unambiguous in the respect of what extent
      decreased BMD in the wrist of women with Colles Fracture is synonymous of osteoporosis in the
      spine and the hip.

      An earlier enquiry to the Danish Orthopedic Departments in 1995 showed that only 18 % of the
      departments diagnosed or referred patients with possible osteoporosis.

      The two study designs enhance the possibilities of evaluating the relevance of Low Energy
      Fractures in the wrist to avoid new fractures and their relation to bone mineral density.

      The results could also be a useful tool in quality assurance of the osteoporosis diagnostics.
