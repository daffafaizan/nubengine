    
      In this single-arm study, subjects who receive transcervical intrauterine-ultrasound guided
      RF ablation of symptomatic uterine fibroids with the VizAblateÂ® System will be assessed with
      3D pelvic sonography with contrast, hysteroscopy, and quality of life questionnaires.

      Overall study duration (first patient enrolled through last patient exit) will be comprised
      of approximately 12 months of patient enrollment up to 1 month for scheduling of treatment,
      and 12 months of follow-up, for a total duration of up to 25 months. Study duration for an
      individual patient, once enrolled, will be approximately 1 month for baseline observations
      and treatment scheduling, and 12 months for follow up after treatment for a total duration of
      approximately 13 months.
