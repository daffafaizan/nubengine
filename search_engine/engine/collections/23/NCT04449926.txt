      that changes in the brain that result in late-onset AD dementia start years or even decades
      prior to clinical dementia. Biomarkers aid in diagnosing AD however, currently approved
      biomarkers have drawbacks as they are invasive and expensive. The two most commonly used
      biomarkers are amyloid PET scan and spinal tap for amyloid and tau. A new plasma amyloid test
      has received "Breakthrough Device Designation" from the US-FDA. As an investigational tool,
      this blood test for amyloid peptides 42/40 levels accurately predicts brain amyloidosis in
      cognitively normal individuals. In the past 100 years, four billion doses of BCG vaccination
      have been given for tuberculosis prevention. A favorable effect with BCG for non-tuberculous
      mycobacteria is also recognized in cervical lymphadeniits, leprosy and Buruli's ulcer.
      Recently, BCG has found favorable use in autoimmune diseases type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
      multiple sclerosis (MS); moreover, a protective role by BCG for Alzheimer's disease has been
      described. Adult exposure to BCG lessened the risk of AD by four-fold. This is an
      interventional pilot study to test 50 non-demented adults measuring their plasma amyloid
      42/40 level prior to BCG prime/boost followed with the same plasma amyloid testing 9 months
      after vaccination. Sub-clinical CMV infection is felt to drive immune senescence and increase
      the risk of AD; we will test for CMV antibodies and we will measure lymphocyte phenotype
      prior to BCG and at study end to look for an immune-modulating effect on this indicator of
      immunosenescence.
