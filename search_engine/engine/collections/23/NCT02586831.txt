      the combined use of short courses of depleting agents, more chronic use of drugs that promote
      immunoregulation and critically control the rebounding effector populations, together with
      interventions that quell inflammation and support beta cell function and glucose metabolism.
      Such combined regimens would rely on lower doses of many of these agents, for increased
      safety and tolerability. Here, we propose a combinatorial regimen based on the administration
      of drugs that are already FDA approved and marketed, all of which have been used in clinical
      trials in patients with T1D, alone or in some combination. This trial will test if the
      regimen proposed, for the first time combining all of these agents, will be successful in
      preserving insulin secretion in recent onset type 1 diabetes.
