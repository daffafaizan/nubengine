      about to be removed were tested. All patients were given 5 mL 2% lidocaine to test the
      catheter before its removal. After priming with 5 mL saline, the catheter was connected to
      CompuFlo to record the occurrence of pulsatile waveforms and/or their disappearance during
      its removal. The epidural catheter was marked at the skin level to record the distance
      between the skin at the time of measurements. The power analysis required a sample of 30
      observations to set 80% test power and 95% significance level.
