      coordinative capabilities children were randomized into two groups. One starts with exercised
      training for three months. After midterm assessment of the capabilities they will pause for
      another 3 months and reassessed. The second group will start without training for the first
      three months. After midterm assessment they will train for three months and have their final
      assessment.
