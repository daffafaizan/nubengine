      Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (ANRS) evaluating the safety of several HIV-1
      vaccine candidates and their capacity to induce immune responses. The ANRS program has
      evaluated a recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein Rgp-160, canarypox ALVAC vectors, and mixtures
      of lipopeptides whose sequences represent CTL-epitopes of HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef proteins.
      Most of them have been administered intramuscularly but recently, mucosal immunization and
      intradermal route were used. Previously compiled in a published meta-analysis, safety studies
      were restricted to the duration of the trials.

      ANRS establishes a cohort study in order to describe the long-term safety of preventive
      HIV-vaccines administered in phase I and II clinical trials to healthy volunteers of the
      "ANRS volunteer-network" in France and to gather clinical and biological data in a database
      and blood specimen collection which could be analysed in case of a long-term safety issue in
      ANRS vaccine trials or if pertinent, in other HIV vaccine trials ANRS COV1-COHVAC is a
      prospective, multicentric cohort study composed of participants in preventive HIV-vaccines
      phase I and II trials. All ANRS volunteers who ever received one dose of a candidate vaccine
      are eligible and those who are going to complete their participation to a clinical trial
      during the cohort study time.

      The ANRS COV1-COHVAC project relies on a long-term follow-up of the cohort (at least 7 years
      after the end of the vaccine trial), that includes the retrospective and prospective
      collection of medical and biological data [severe health events (grade 3-4), as well as
      neurological, ophtalmological, and immunological events (any grade), starting from the first
      injection of a candidate vaccine, are recorded], blood specimen collections and
      psycho-behavioral evaluations (self-questionnaires and interviews) in order to collect data
      about consequences of participation and experience of possible HIV vaccine-induced
      seropositivity in such trials.

      Of the ANRS "volunteer-network", 206 participants have been involved in the early trials and
      are actually eligible to participate in this cohort. Altogether with the more recent studies
      completed or in progress, the cohort will comprise at least 400 individuals in 2009.
