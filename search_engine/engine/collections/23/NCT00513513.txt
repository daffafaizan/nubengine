    
      This is an open label (no placebo), uncontrolled (all patients will receive TMC114 with
      ritonavir at the same dose, trial to investigate the sustained anti-viral activity of
      TMC114/rtv monotherapy in 24 treatment naïve, HIV 1 infected patients over a period of 48
      weeks.TMC114, 800 mg daily (2 tablets of 400 mg [F021]) will be given together with 1 capsule
      (100 mg) of ritonavir.Initially 11 subjects (Panel A, screening viral load between 10000 and
      100000 copies/mL) will be included and followed for 8 weeks. If after 8 weeks of dosing at
      least 7 subjects virologically respond (viral load <400 copies/mL), 13 additional patients
      (Panel B) will be included. If no virologic failure is observed in at least 18 out of 24
      patients who complete 8 weeks of dosing, the trial will continue as planned. In case more
      than 6 patients in Panel A and Panel B develop a virologic failure after 8 weeks of
      treatment, the trial will be stopped to conclude the treatment is not effective.The 13
      additional patients enrolled in Panel B should have a screening viral load between 20000 and
      500000 copies/mL. The CD4+ cell count in all 24 patients should be > 100 cells/µL at
      screening. The patient's medical condition, adverse events (side effects), study medication
      compliance, and laboratory evaluations for effectiveness and safety will be assessed at
      regular intervals. At the end of the 48 weeks treatment period patients will be followed for
      an additional 4 weeks to evaluate any side effects or laboratory abnormalities. Treatment
      with TMC114/rtv will be extended for all patients who continue to benefit after 48 weeks. 2
      oral tablets of TMC114 400 mg will be administered once daily with 1 capsule (100mg) of
      ritonavir for 48 weeks.
