    
      Approximately 100 students at a public New York City High School will be randomized at the
      level of class into either the experimental (yoga-informed health and wellness program) or
      control arm (physical education class). Students will receive two classes per week of
      approximately 45 minutes throughout the academic year. Data will be collected in September
      2014 and February and May of 2015.
