      comprising 5 visits (TV1-TV5). The treatment period visits will each be separated by a
      washout period lasting 2-7 days. During each treatment period visit, the forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be determined at 30 minutes and again immediately prior to the
      commencement of study medication administration, and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300,
      and 360 minutes after completion of study medication administration.
