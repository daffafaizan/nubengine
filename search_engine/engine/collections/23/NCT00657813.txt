      detect ÃŸ-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and
      gender-matched healthy subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at the Institute for
      Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New Haven, CT.
      Approximately 10 patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and 6 healthy controls (within +/- 2
      years) will be recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to
      ensure that there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.
