      study to evaluate the effectivenessand safety of SYM-1219 in women with bacterial vaginosis.
      Patients determined to be eligible for the study were randomized to one of the following
      treatments: SYM-1219 1 gram orallyas a single dose;SYM-1219 2 grams orally as a single
      dose;or matching placebo. Patients determined to be eligible based on the clinical
      assessments at the Baseline visit (Day 1) were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio and received a
      singledose of the assigned study treatment on Day 1 under fasted conditions (i.e., no food 2
      hours prior to or 1 hour after dosing). The centralized randomization was stratified by the
      number of reported episodes of BV in the past 12 months (including the current episode): 3 or
      fewer episodes versus 4 or more episodes. Patients were asked to complete a daily telephone
      questionnaire on Days1to7 and at the Test of Cure (TOC)/End of Study (EOS)visit. Patients
      were also contacted by telephone once on Day 8 to 10 to inquire about possible adverse events
      (AEs). A TOC visit was conducted between Day 21 and 30; or at EOSif the final visit was
      notconducted between Day 21and30
