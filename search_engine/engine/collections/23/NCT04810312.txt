      paraspinal are also known to be associated with functional disorders and chronic back pain.
      We want to suggest classifying this phenomenon as "spinal sarcopenia." While feasible,
      inexpensive, and less radiation-exposed tools such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry have
      been used to measure appendicular skeletal muscle mass, paraspinal muscle assessment is still
      needed using spinal CT or MRI. In addition, spinal extensor strength measurement is necessary
      to confirm the function of lumbar paraspinal muscle, but isokinetic exercise equipment for
      accurate measurement is not as feasible as a dynamometer for hand grip strength to evaluate
      sarcopenia. Furthermore, many elderly people may experience pain during the measurement of
      spinal extension strength. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a simple, accessible, and
      clinically meaningful measurement index to confirm the myofunction of spinal extension. The
      main two axes of treatment and prevention of conventional sarcopenia are muscle strengthening
      exercises and high protein nutritional supplements. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the
      clinical effect by intervention for spinal extension exercise and nutritional
      supplementation.
