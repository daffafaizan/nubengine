      the upper margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG maximum, was >10 μ V, and the
      lower margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG minimum, was >5 μ V. The Time from
      ROSC to normal trace (TTNT, hours) is predictor of neurological outcome in these patients. We
      will evaluate the prognostic values of TTNTs in all aEEG channels.
