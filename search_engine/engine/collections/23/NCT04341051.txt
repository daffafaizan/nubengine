      suffering from Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (IIa to III Fontaine classification)
      undergoing popliteal sciatic nerve block as analgesic procedure before vascular surgery. We
      want to evaluate the increase in regional microcirculation after the popliteal nerve blocks
      due to vasoplegic response and vasodilatation after performing regional anaesthesia. We will
      place NIRS electrode on the instep of the foot to evaluate regional oxigen saturation in the
      interested leg before the performing of popliteal sciatic nerve block and then during the
      surgery (after 5 minuts, 15 minuts, 30 minuts), and after the end of the procedure.
