    
      During the Dose Optimization Stage, after each dose cohort is fully enrolled, and 21 days
      after the final participant in the cohort receives their first dose of study drug, the
      Sponsor will review the totality of available safety data in conjunction with all available
      PK/PD data. Based on this review, the Sponsor will recommend a revised dose and/or dosing
      interval. The Sponsor will abide by predefined constraints as to the maximum percentage
      change in dose and dose interval. A maximum of 5 cohorts will be enrolled into the study.

      Upon establishment of a dose with acceptable safety and pharmacodynamic activity, additional
      participants will be enrolled in a Dose Expansion Stage to allow for further characterization
      of the safety and pharmacodynamics of mRNA-3927.

      Participants in both phases of study will participate in a predosing observational period,
      followed by a treatment period, and then a followup period after withdrawal of treatment.
