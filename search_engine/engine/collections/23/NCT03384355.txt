      and morbidity depending on the effected vascular territory. It is often overlooked by
      healthcare professionals due to the underestimation of the prevalence and impact of the
      disease. It represents a spectrum of conditions varying from simple telangiectasia or
      reticular veins to skin fibrosis and venous ulceration. The main clinical characteristics are
      dilated veins, edema, leg pain, and cutaneous alterations in the legs. Varicose veins are
      dilating superficial veins, which become more tortuous and enlarged, continuously.

      Chronic venous disease affects the life quality of patients suffering from the disease, which
      can be measured with quality-of-life reports. Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and
      Economic Study-Quality of Life/Symptoms (VEINES-QoL/Sym) questionnaire is a patient based,
      designed for self-completion instrument to measure both the symptom severity and quality of
      life. VEINES-QOL measures life quality and VEINES-Sym provides an overall estimate of CVD
      symptom frequency. From the practitioners daily knowledge of patients with varicose veins,
      there is a significant proportion of varicose vein patients also suffering from symptoms such
      as coldness and ecchymosis. In this context, the investigators aim to investigate the
      symptoms of participants with varicose vein using the VEINES-Sym questionnaire.
