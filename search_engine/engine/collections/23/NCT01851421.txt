      Receptor (MC3R) polymorphisms (T6K+V81I) have greater fat mass compared to wild type
      children. These polymorphisms are about 10-fold more prevalent in Non-Hispanic Black than
      White Americans. In vitro, T6K+V81I causes MC3R hypofunction. Since mouse models and limited
      human data suggest the MC3R may be involved in regulating substrate oxidation, and therefore
      fatty acid disposal, we propose to study 30 Non-Hispanic Black BMI-matched subjects with
      homozygous T6K+V81I or wild-type MC3R to compare substrate turnover (fatty acids and glucose)
      during fasting and under conditions of hyperinsulinemia after adaptation from a normal-fat to
      a high-fat isocaloric diet. Using adipocytes obtained from biopsies, we will also study
      glucose and fatty acid uptake, storage and mobilization in vitro. We hypothesize that this
      study will shed light on the role of the MC3R in substrate metabolism and energy expenditure,
      and will yield information that may assist in the development of more effective approaches
      for the treatment of obesity in Non-Hispanic Black Americans.
