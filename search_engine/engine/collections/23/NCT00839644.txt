    
      Study Design: Randomized clinical trial with pulmonary function testing obtained every three
      months in each of the three treatment groups. Change in slope of FEV1 will be compared. Days
      of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics for respiratory tract infection, quality
      of life, subject satisfaction, and compliance will also be compared.

      Sample Size: Enrollment will be completed after 180 subjects have been recruited. Fifteen CF
      centers will participate.

      Subject Selection: Subjects must have the diagnosis of CF, be > 7 years of age and have an
      FEV1 > 45% of predicted.

      Prescribed Therapy: Each subject will receive airway secretion clearance twice a day.

      Outcomes: Change in slope of FEV1; days of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics
      for respiratory tract infection; quality of life; subject satisfaction; compliance.
