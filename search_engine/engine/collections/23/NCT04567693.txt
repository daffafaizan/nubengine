      living with HIV (PLWH), including Rwanda. Current Rwandan HIV guidelines classify
      newly-diagnosed PLWH as "unstable", requiring monthly visits to the health facility. Before
      they can advance to being "stable" patients, with spaced-out appointments that allow them to
      visit the health facility every three months, they must be on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      for 18 months and virally suppressed on two consecutive measurements. Patients face multiple
      barriers to attending frequent appointments including structural issues (such as distance to
      the health facility, transportation cost, long waiting times) and facing stigma while
      traveling to and while at the health facility. Reducing the time newly-diagnosed PLWH spend
      in the "unstable" category could potentially decrease the burden on patients and the health
      facility and potentially decrease the costs of frequent appointments. The investigators
      therefore propose a pilot study to examine the effect of reducing the time from ART
      initiation to advancement to the "stable" category from 18 to 6 months. The investigators
      will enroll 90 patients: 30 will be randomized to 6-month advancement to spaced out
      appointments after 1 viral load is measured (at 5 months after enrollment in ART care)
      ("Early 1"); 30 will be randomized to 6-month advancement to spaced-out appointments after 2
      viral loads are measured (at 3- and 5-months after enrollment in ART care) ("Early 2"); and
      30 will be randomized to continue in usual care with monthly visits ("Usual care"). The
      investigators will compare study arms with respect to viral suppression at 12 months (primary
      outcome) and appointment/pharmacy adherence (secondary outcome). The investigators
      hypothesize that reducing the time to the "stable" category with spaced out appointments will
      be feasible, acceptable, not inferior to 18 months with respect to viral suppression or
      adherence, and will be cost-effective.
