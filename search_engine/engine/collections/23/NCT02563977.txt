      abdominal wall after harvesting a DIEP flap in breast reconstruction.

      14 women undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction were recruited to the study
      and underwent a 2 year postoperative CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast).

      Structural changes were assessed by comparing the abdominal CT scans performed prior to
      surgery with the 2 year postoperative CT scans.

      The following structural changes were evaluated at four specific levels of the abdomen by two
      radiologists (among the authors): 1) rectus diastasis, 2) thickness and width of the rectus
      muscles, 3) thickness of the adipose tissue, 4) hernias (in the zone between the xiphoid
      process and the symphysis).

      The measurement levels chosen were: 1) 7 cm below the xiphoid process, 2) umbilicus level, 3)
      "central zone" (between level 2 and 4), 4) 5 cm above the symphysis

      Statistical analysis were performed to see if the structural measurements were significantly
      different comparing preoperative CT versus 2 year postoperative CT.
