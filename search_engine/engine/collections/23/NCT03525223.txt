      content the investigators intend to recruit 40 hemodialysis patients, who will be offered a
      therapeutic change of their dialysate Na+ concentration. After detection of tissue Na+
      content using 23Na-MRI technique, the applied dialysate [Na+] will be initially increased
      stepwise by 2 mmol/l per week from 138 to 142 mmol/l and maintained for a period of 5 weeks.
      After another 23Na-MRI measurement, dialysate [Na+] will then be lowered stepwise by 1-2
      mmol/l per week to a minimum of 135 mmol/l, which will be also maintained for a period of 5
      weeks followed by a final 23Na-MRI assessment.

      Hypothesis: Reduction of dialysate Na+ concentration will decrease tissue sodium storage.

      Additionally, the investigators will assess changes in body fluid distribution by
      bioimpedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, vascular compliance in response to the modulation of
      dialysate [Na+] and its correlation with tissue Na+ will be assessed. To investigate the
      immune response to tissue Na+ accumulation, the osmostress-induced as well as
      pro-inflammatory immune cell response of isolated monocytes will be quantified.
