      that will be applied temporarily to patients suffering of tremor.

      This will be evaluated by assessment of reduction of tremor using accelerometer measurements,
      patient tremor evaluation diary, tremor rating scale, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale (UPRDS) part III.In addition,tasks for patient with tremor will be conducted
      before during and after the treatment. The above measurements will provide data on the
      stimulation procedure effect as compared to baseline.
