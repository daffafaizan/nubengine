      emergency room towards obtaining a diagnosis. The goal of this observational study is to
      correlate physician level of experience and time spent on history and physical exam, to the
      correct diagnosis.

      The aim of this study is:

        1. To draw a connection between time and accuracy of the history and physical exam.

        2. To draw a connection between time and level of experience as a physician based on
           post-graduate level.

        3. To assess the number of laboratory and radiographic studies and the post-graduate level.

        4. To assess the relevance of the labs and radiographs ordered. (Relevance is defined as
           something that changes plan of care.)

      Time is a critical component of the ED physician. Our study will analyse if modern medicine
      has created a more laboratory/image based need to ascertain a diagnosis or if history and
      physical examination alone can predict the ultimate diagnosis.
