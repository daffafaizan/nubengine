    
      This study is a prospective, single-centre feasibility study to evaluate the use of
      intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine
      margin status.

      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of 370 Mega Becquerel (MBq) of 18F-choline
      prior to routine, elective radical prostatectomy. The surgery will be performed according to
      standard-of-care. The resected prostatectomy specimens will be imaged using the LightPathTM
      Imaging System, consisting of a light-tight box containing an ultra-sensitive lens and
      Electron Multiplying Charged-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera.

      This study will measure the agreement between margin status of the prostatectomy specimen as
      determined by CLI and by histopathology (reference method). This study will assess
      feasibility before proceeding to a pivotal study to evaluate the benefits of the LightPathTM
      Imaging System in clinical practice.
