      the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced stage lung cancer is 2-4%. These
      patients frequently suffer a range of different symptoms related to both their disease and
      it's treatment. As a result, there is a pressing need for research into treatments that may
      improve their symptoms as well as their quality of life (QOL).

      An increasing body of evidence suggests that complementary medicine, including carefully
      selected combinations of Chinese Herbs (CH), may exert beneficial effects for cancer patients
      in many ways. The literature suggests that CH combined with chemotherapy can improve survival
      rates, immediate tumor response, performance status and QOL for those with locally advanced
      and metastatic disease.

      The Shu Yu Wan (SYW) formula used in the feasibility study which demonstrated a significant
      improvement in symptoms and quality of life will also be employed in this interventional
      study. THe SYW formula consists of 23 natural Chinese herbs.

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial with a
      1:1 allocation ratio for investigating the efficacy and safety of SYW formula for the
      treatment of lung cancer symptoms. Patients in both groups will receive formula or placebo at
      a fixed dose for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study medication, the treatment will be unblinded and patients randomized
      to placebo will be offered to cross-over to SYW and will repeat visits Week 0 & Week 6.
      Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.
