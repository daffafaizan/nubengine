      studies have suggested the presence of intramuscular creatine deficiency in patients with
      muscle toxicity. This is a test of oral creatine supplementation in statin intolerant
      subjects as a method of preventing the onset of this side effect as well as resolving these
      symptoms when present during statin therapy.
