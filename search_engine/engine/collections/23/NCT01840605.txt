    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study to demonstrate the
      noninferiority of TAU-284 to ketotifen fumarate in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis,
      as assessed by the primary endpoint of the change from baseline in pruritus score after
      2-week treatment with TAU-284 (20 mg/day) or ketotifen fumarate dry syrup (2 g/day); and to
      investigate the safety, and plasma concentrations of TAU-284.
