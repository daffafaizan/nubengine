      testing with the new blood glucose meter system (BGMS) and for using meter features. Sections
      of the User Guide and Quick Reference Guide that gave instruction on performing a blood
      glucose test and operating system features were evaluated, including instructions on
      connectivity of the system with a computer, meter setup, glucose trends display, and other
      system features. The study also evaluated the performance of the blood glucose meter system
      (BGMS) in the hands of subjects and healthcare professionals using capillary blood. Subjects
      and healthcare professionals provided feedback about the BGMS and its features. Some subjects
      took the system home to evaluate the robustness of the BGMS.
