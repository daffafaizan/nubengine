      magnifying blue laser imaging (BLI) versus standard white light for the detection of serrated
      lesions in the proximal colon (the colon proximal to the splenic flexure). The proximal colon
      has large intestine and many folds which will lead missing flat lesions. Recent studies have
      indicated that colonoscopy is more effective in preventing cancer in the left side of the
      colon than the right side of the colon. The reasons for this difference may be partly
      biologic, in that a special group of polyps known as serrated polyps, particularly sessile
      serrated adenomas, are located primarily proximal to the splenic flexure. These lesions are
      endoscopically subtle in that they are often flat, have the same color as the surrounding
      mucosa, and are hard to differentiate from normal mucosa. LCI makes red areas appear redder
      and white areas appear whiter. Thus, it is easier to recognize a slight difference in color
      of the mucosa. This study will test whether LCI will increase the detection of serrated
      lesions in a randomized controlled trial.
