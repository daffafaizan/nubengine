      minimum 6 months.50 ml of bone marrow harvest will be performed under local anaesthesia 3
      weeks before the implantation. After three weeks of culture, preosteoblastic cells will be
      injected into the site of pseudarthrosis under radioscopic control, using percutaneously a 3
      mm trephine.

      An immobilization and non weight-bearing of the bone will be respected during the first month
      after the injection. If callus could be observed on radiographs, partial mobilization and
      weight-bearing will be allowed during the second month.
