      effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Ad26.COV2.S, a COVID-19 vaccine based on a
      human replication-incompetent Ad26 vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spike (S) protein, is being developed. The study
      will consist of: a screening phase (up to 28 days), study period (60-week), and a long-term
      follow-up period (1 additional year). The total study duration will be maximum 2 years and 3
      months for the participants. Assessments for efficacy (COVID-19 signs and symptoms, etc.),
      immunogenicity (such as humoral immune responses), and safety (such as adverse events [AEs]
      monitoring) will be performed throughout the study.
