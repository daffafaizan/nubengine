    
      Fragile X Syndrome is a genetically determined neurological disorder in which affected
      individuals are intellectually handicapped to varying degrees and display a variety of
      associated psychiatric symptoms. Clinically, Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by
      intellectual handicap, hyperactivity and attentional problems, autism spectrum symptoms,
      emotional lability and epilepsy. The epilepsy seen in Fragile X Syndrome is most commonly
      present in childhood, but then gradually remits towards adulthood. Physical features such as
      prominent ears and jaw, and hyper-extensibility of joints are frequently present but are not
      diagnostic. Intellectual handicap is the most common feature defining the phenotype.
      Treatment for the disorder is symptomatic - focusing on the management of symptoms - and
      supportive, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral administration
      of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescent or adult males with Fragile X Syndrome.
      The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment.
