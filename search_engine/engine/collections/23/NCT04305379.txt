      the years, various maneuvers to improve continence have been tried and studied including
      intussusception stitches and slings. Slings of various origins have been used by surgeons at
      the time of radical prostatectomy without consistent evidence demonstrating a benefit (vas
      deferens, biologic). However, use of the medial umbilical ligament to create a sling has not
      previously been studied in a randomized trial.

      The medial umbilical ligaments are normally cut during intraperitoneal robotic-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy to allow the surgeon access to the Retzius space between
      the bladder and pubic bone. To create a medial umbilical ligament autologous sling, the
      ligaments are dissected out and wrapped around the vesicourethral anastomosis.

      The investigators are conducting a prospective, randomized trial to investigate whether
      patients randomized to receive an augmented bladder neck reconstruction (aBNR) at the time of
      robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy experience improved urinary function
      post-operatively compared to patients who undergo prostatectomy with a standard BNR. An aBNR
      here consists of the autologous medial umbilical ligament sling as well as a bladder neck
      intussusception stitch. The standard BNR group will receive the intussusception stitch only.
