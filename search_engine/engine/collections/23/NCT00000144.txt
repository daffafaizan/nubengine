      surgery as the treatment of choice in cases of open-angle glaucoma that could not be
      controlled by drugs. ALT treatment consists of tiny laser burns evenly spaced around the
      trabecular meshwork. It sometimes has been found to be effective in controlling glaucoma,
      although many eyes still require some medical treatment.

      The Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), a randomized, controlled clinical trial, was conducted to
      determine whether ALT is effective in patients with newly diagnosed, primary, open-angle
      glaucoma. Each of the 271 patients in the trial received argon laser treatment in one eye and
      standard topical medication in the other eye. The eye to be started on medicine and the eye
      that would get the laser treatment were randomly selected. The Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup
      Study was a followup study of 203 of the 271 patients who enrolled in the Glaucoma Laser
      Trial. By the close of the Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study, median duration of followup
      since diagnosis of primary, open-angle glaucoma was 7 years (maximum, 9 years).

      The argon laser treatment was done in two sessions 1 month apart, with one-half of the
      trabecular meshwork treated with 45 to 55 laser burns in each session. Patients were seen for
      a followup visit 3 months after the first laser treatment and every 3 months thereafter for a
      period of at least 2 years. At each visit, examination of the eyes included a check of
      intraocular pressure and visual acuity. Visual field examinations were performed 3, 6, and 12
      months after randomization and annually thereafter. Disc stereo photographs were taken 6 and
      12 months after randomization and annually thereafter.

      The results of these examinations determined whether treatment should be changed. If the
      pressure in either eye had not been reduced to the desired level, the physician changed the
      medication in the eye treated with drops or started the use of drops in the laser-treated eye
      according to a standardized procedure being used in the trial. If intraocular pressure was
      still not successfully reduced, surgery or further laser treatment may have been required.
