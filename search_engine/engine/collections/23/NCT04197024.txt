      desktop virtual reality (i.e., low-cost homebrew virtual reality), projection virtual
      reality, and simulation virtual reality. The sense of presence or immersion is a critical
      feature distinguishing virtual reality from other types of computer applications. It seems
      interesting whether immersion in virtual reality can influence the assessment of exercise
      capacity. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of the application of immersive
      virtual reality during an exercise capacity test on a bicycle ergometer. It is assumed that
      an exercise capacity test on a cycloergometer will be performed in a traditional form and in
      a virtual reality.
