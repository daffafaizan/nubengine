      practices in North Carolina providing care to an estimated 240,000 Medicaid-eligible children
      aged 0-3 years. Interventions: Group A practices (n=39) received didactic training and course
      materials in oral health screening, referral, counseling and application of fluoride varnish.
      Group B practices (n=41) received the same as Group A and were offered weekly conference
      calls providing advice and support. Group C practices (n=41) received the same as Group B and
      were offered in-office visit providing hands-on advice and support. Outcome measures were
      computed from reimbursement claims submitted to NC Division of Medical Assistance. Primary
      outcome measure: rate of preventive dental services provision per 100 well-child visits.
      Secondary outcome measure: % of practices providing 20 or more preventive dental visits.
