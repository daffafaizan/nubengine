      parenchyma with symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, chills, rigors, chest pain, and/or
      dyspnea. The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, including the
      macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective
      antibiotics that have activity against CABP pathogens. Solithromycin is a fourth generation
      macrolide antibiotic with excellent activity against resistant S. pneumoniae and other key
      typical and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens. A completed Phase 2 study showed
      comparable efficacy to levofloxacin in adults with CABP.
