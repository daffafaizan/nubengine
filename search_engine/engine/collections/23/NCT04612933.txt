      travelling costs and saved working days, as well as increased patient satisfaction due to the
      reduction in transportation time.

      Several studies have evaluated telemedicine for use in Diabetes Mellitus patients with an
      insulin pump. In all of these studies, the telemedicine group scheduled more contacts with
      the health care professionals than in the standard care group. To the investigator's
      knowledge, no one has investigated telemedicine, compared to standard care with the same
      number of scheduled contacts. The investigators believe telemedicine should increase the
      level of service and not increase the workload for health care professionals. A telemedical
      solution can provide patients with a more flexible alternative for visiting their health care
      provider rather having the burden of extra telemedicine appointments plus regular treatment.

      Patients in rural Denmark may have a travelling time of 70 km (1 hour by car or several hours
      by public transport) to a specialised Diabetes Mellitus specialist centre. This may result in
      some patients choosing not to start or not being offered insulin pump treatment despite
      indications that an insulin pump is an optimal treatment choice. The challenge of distance
      also poses problems for patients in relation to technical problems or medical issues with the
      insulin pump. Telemedicine should be a solution for both patients and their Health Care
      Providers.

      In this randomised controlled study, the effects of conducting clinical visits remotely, for
      patients living with insulin pumps will be investigated. Participants will be allocated to
      either Intervention (Standard care provide by video consultations) or standard care.
