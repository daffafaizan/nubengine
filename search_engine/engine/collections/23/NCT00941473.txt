      This effect has been shown to be dose-dependent. Doses as low as 10mg of Prednisone, has been
      shown to lower bone density over periods as short as 20 weeks, an effect which may be
      prevented with use of Calcium and Vitamin D. Inhaled Tramcinilone has also been shown to lead
      to dose-related loss of bone at the hip in premenopausal women. Clinic visits will be
      arranged for recruited patients at baseline and then at 3 and 6 months after the ESI and at
      any time for new-onset or severe back pain. During the initial visit, consent will be
      obtained, patient will be given details on the study design and rationale, severity and
      characteristics of back pain. Epidural corticosteroid injection (ESI) has been shown to
      decrease pain, speed return of function, and improve neurological signs in patients
      presenting with low back pain.
