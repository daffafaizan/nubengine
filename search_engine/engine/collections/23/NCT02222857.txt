      and a complete ophthalmic examination at National Taiwan University Hospital were reviewed.
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of National
      Taiwan University Hospital.

      The clinical data recorded included patient demographics, refractive error, lens status, best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), all treatments and retinal anatomical status. Visual acuities
      and examination findings were recorded at presentation and subsequent follow-up periods for
      at least 6 months. The area of retina involved was determined by review of retinal drawings
      and fundus photos by single reader.

      All the patients were admitted for intravenous injection of Acyclovir (30mg/kg/day, in 3
      divided doses) for 10-14 days and then shifted to oral Acyclovir (30mg/kg/day) at least for
      further 10-14 days. Systemic corticosteroid and Aspirin were also given. Prophylactic laser
      photocoagulation was arranged on normal retina to surround the posterior edge of the active
      lesions if the media was clear enough to approach. If vitritis persisted without improvement
      under systemic antiviral agent or retinal detachment was noted, vitrectomy would be
      performed. Visual acuities and retinal anatomical results were recorded during follow-up
      after procedures. The visual acuity was converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of
      resolution (logMAR) values for statistical analysis.

      Statistical analysis The continuous values are expressed as means Â± standard deviation (SD).
      The differences among the continuous variables were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
      Non-continuous variables were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The level of statistical
      significance was set at p < 0.05.
