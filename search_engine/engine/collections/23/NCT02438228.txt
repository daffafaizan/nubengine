      catheter (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) are introduced in the right internal
      jugular vein and in the femoral artery, respectively. The thermodilution catheter is
      connected to a PiCCO2 monitor (Software version 1.3.0.8). Thereafter, placement of an
      esophageal doppler probe is performed and the probe is connected to a unique Monitoring
      System (Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK) with nine different pulse contour algorithms. Cardiac
      Output by esophageal doppler is used to calibrate the nine different pulse contour
      algorithms.

      After induction of anesthesia and establishment of all monitoring devices, a passive leg
      raising maneouvre (PLR) is performed and hemodynamic variables including CO by transpulmonary
      thermodilution (COTPTD) and CO by nine different pulse contour algorithms (COX1-9) are
      recorded before, during and after PLR. Subsequently, measurements of COTPTD and COX1-9 are
      carried out every 10 minutes until the beginning of CPB. Fifteen minutes after weaning from
      cardiopulmonary bypass calibration of nine different pulse contour algorithms by esophageal
      doppler are performed again and measurements of CITPTD and CIPFX are restarted up to the end
      of the surgical Intervention.
