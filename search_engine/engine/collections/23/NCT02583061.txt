      tolerance in pregnancy (from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) to lesser degrees of
      gestational glucose intolerance to those with completely normal glucose tolerance) are being
      recruited in late 2nd trimester. This cohort of women thus carries a broad range of risk for
      the future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. At regular
      intervals in the years after the index pregnancy, this cohort of women is undergoing serial
      cardiometabolic characterization, including assessment of glucose tolerance, beta-cell
      function and insulin sensitivity. The longitudinal changes over time in this cohort should
      provide insight into the early pathophysiology and natural history of T2DM and cardiovascular
      disease.
