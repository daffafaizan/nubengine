      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of delivering cardiac-sparing IMRT in a multi-institutional
      setting with central quality control for children and young adults with metastatic tumors in
      the lungs.

      II. To prospectively determine the dosimetric advantages of whole lung IMRT treatment over
      standard whole lung irradiation by comparing treatment plans and different organ dose-volume
      histograms such as lungs, heart, thyroid gland, liver etc. in all patients enrolled in this
      study.

      III. To determine the short-term efficacy (lung-metastases free survival) and acute tolerance
      of whole lung IMRT at a minimum period of six months after IMRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cardiac-sparing whole lung IMRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-5 years.
