      Following the Sentinel Safety Cohort, the main efficacy cohort will be conducted during the
      2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (Season 1), the 2021-2022 Southern Hemisphere
      influenza season (Season 2), and the 2021-2022-2023 Northern Hemisphere influenza season
      (Season 3).

      Participants will receive either 1 or 2 doses of the study vaccine depending on whether they
      were previously influenza vaccinated or previously influenza unvaccinated, respectively.

      Study duration per participant is approximately 6 to 7 months.
