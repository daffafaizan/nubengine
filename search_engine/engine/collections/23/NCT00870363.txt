      T-cell counts in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), immune
      reconstitution remains incomplete as measured by a number of additional surrogate markers.
      Perhaps critically important among areas of apparent incomplete immune recovery is the
      gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where CD4+ T-cells repopulate very slowly
      if at all. Several new classes of antiretrovirals (ART) have recently been approved by the
      FDA that offer potential advantages in terms of immune reconstitution and/or the kinetics
      viral suppression over traditionally available treatment regimens. Maraviroc is a new ART
      agent from a novel class of HIV inhibitors, entry inhibitors, that results in rapid
      suppression of HIV and recovery of peripheral CD4+ T-cells. This project proposes to examine
      whether volunteers receiving maraviroc recover GALT immune cells more completely that those
      taking comparator ART. Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor that blocks incorporation of the
      proviral HIV DNA into the host chromosomes leading to more rapid declines in plasma HIV load
      than has previously been observed. This project proposes to examine whether volunteers
      receiving maraviroc or maraviroc plus raltegravir recover GALT immune cells more completely
      that those taking comparator ART. An additional attraction of the use of maraviroc and
      raltegravir together is that they may provide a potent combination that is also lipid neutral
      and thereby constitute a 'Heart friendly HAART' (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).
