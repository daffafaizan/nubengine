    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of a stepped smoking cessation intervention based on a
           transtheoretical model of change that uses the pharmacological and no-pharmacological
           methods proposed by evidence based Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation
           from primary care centers.

        -  To assess the health status change in relationship with the smoking cessation process.

      DESIGN: Cluster randomized clinical trial

      Unit of Randomization: Care basic unit (family physician or nurse that cares for the same
      group of patients). Intention to treat analysis.

      PARTICIPANTS: 2911 smokers (ages 14-75 years) consulting for any reason to primary care
      centers

      INTERVENTION: 6-month implementation of recommendations of a Clinical Practice Guideline that
      includes motivational consulting for smokers at the precontemplation - contemplation stage;
      brief intervention for smokers in preparation-action who do not want help; intensive
      intervention with pharmacotherapies for smokers in preparation-action who want help; and
      reinforcing intervention in the maintenance stage.

      CONTROL: Usual care

      MEASUREMENT: Self reported abstinence confirmed by an expired air carbon monoxide
      concentration of 10 parts per millions or less; Point prevalence at the end of intervention,
      1 and 2 years after the beginning of intervention; Continuous abstinence rate for 1 year;
      Change of stage in the smoking cessation process; Health status measured by SF-36.
