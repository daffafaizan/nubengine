    
      Patients will be identified as eligible by the attending Gastroenterologist during the course
      of a usual consultation. Patients will be referred to the research nurse in the doctor's
      office for further information regarding the study and informed consent will be obtained by
      the research nurse.

      Upon enrollment, the physician or the research nurse will complete an online requisition form
      with a unique code which will provide the baseline data. The patient will be provided with
      the Easy Samplerâ„¢ collection kit and instructions on the use of this kit and location on
      where to send the specimen.

      The nurse will then send an email to the research nurse in the originating physician's office
      with the result of the calprotectin assay. The research nurse will review the result with the
      physician. After physician review, either the physician or the research nurse will then
      complete a follow up survey online.

      After completion of the assays and surveys, the data will be tabulated electronically from
      the online website and analyzed by the PI and/or co-investigators.
