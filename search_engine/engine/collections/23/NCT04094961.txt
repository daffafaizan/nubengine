      investigational drug and tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to
      use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA has approved both pomalidomide and ixazomib individually for the treatment of
      multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually
      combined with other chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and
      leukemias.

        -  Ixazomib targets a part of cells called proteasomes. It works by slowing down or
           blocking proteasomes from doing their job of digesting proteins. In myeloma cells, there
           is a greater need for proteasomes to digest proteins; the buildup of excess proteins
           causes cell death.

        -  Pomalidomide has also been shown to cause tumor cell deaths. Dexamethasone can stop
           white blood cells from traveling to areas myeloma cells are causing damage. When
           combined with myeloma drugs, it sometimes makes those drugs work better.

      In this research study, the investigators are:

        -  Testing the safety of ixazomib when given with pomalidomide and dexamethasone

        -  Pomalidomide and ixazomib are given individually for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
           Dexamethasone is also given for multiple myeloma

        -  Ixazomib when combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone may help control the disease

        -  Ixazomib is FDA approved to treat multiple myeloma

        -  The investigators are looking for the highest dose of ixazomib that can be given safely
           in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone
