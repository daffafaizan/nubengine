      the course of AIDS. The mortality (death) rate is estimated to be greater than 50 percent.
      Pyrimethamine is a drug that appears promising for the primary prevention of cerebral
      toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients.

      AMENDED: 04-04-91 On the first day of therapy, a loading dose is given. After the first day,
      patients take pyrimethamine or placebo 3 times a week. Patients also take leucovorin calcium
      orally three times weekly. Enrollment occurs over approximately 12 months. All patients are
      followed on study until a common study close-out date and final analysis of the study. It is
      anticipated that this common close-out will occur when the mean duration of time on study
      therapy will be 3 years (approximately in January, 1994).

      ORIGINAL design: On the first day of treatment, patients receive a loading dose of
      pyrimethamine or placebo, plus of leucovorin calcium. After the first day, patients take
      pyrimethamine or placebo three times a week. Patients also take folinic acid orally three
      times weekly. The mean duration of study participation is 3 years.
