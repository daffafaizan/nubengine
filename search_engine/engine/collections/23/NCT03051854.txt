      southwestern Uganda. The sample will include 12 government-aided secondary schools from which
      60 students and 15-25 teachers will be recruited. The final sample will have 720 students and
      180-300 teachers. Investigators will assess data in the baseline (i.e., prior to
      intervention) and three months after the intervention.

      Study measures will cover the following topics: socio-demographic data, common disciplinary
      measure used at home and at school, students' mental health problems, students' and teachers'
      attitudes towards violent discipline measures, and students' exposure to peer and sexual
      violence. Questionnaire for teachers will have additional items that measure attitudes
      towards teaching and teacher stress. Additionally, the investigators will also assess the
      demand, acceptance and feasibility of the training.
