      number of patients fail to improve significantly even after years of conventional and
      experimental interventions. Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the region of the
      anterior capsule/ventral striatum is an adjustable and reversible procedure that may be a
      more effective treatment for patients with major depression. This study will determine the
      effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of DBS in patients with treatment-refractory major
      depression.
