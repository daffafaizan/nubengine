      there are few papers with small series of patients regarding echocardiographic parameters and
      strain imaging in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (MR) and MitraClip. As the
      investigator's goal is to assess the potential impact of the MitraClip on myocardial
      deformation indexes, at the end of the study a direct comparison of changes of
      echocardiography markers -at one year follow up- between the control and device group will be
      performed. The changes in myocardial deformation markers will be associated with the
      respective changes in Brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) class status, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and left ventricle (LV) volumes at
      follow -up. The investigators also aim to identify baseline prognostic echocardiography
      markers for the prediction of clinical improvement and LV reverse remodeling after successful
      edge-to-edge repair in functional MR patients during one year follow up. In specific, in this
      study the investigators will measure the 2-Dimension (2D) strain values of the left ventricle
      and left atrium (global longitudinal strain-GLS of the LV and Peak Atrial longitudinal strain
      - PALS of the left atrium) at baseline and at one year follow up, they will appreciate the LV
      myocardial work and all its components (Global Work Index-GWI, Global Constructed
      Work-GCW,Global wasted work-GWW and Global Work Efficiency-GWE) of the left ventricle and
      finally they will evaluate the baseline variables as predictors of reverse LV remodeling
      defined by reduction of left ventricle end-diastolic and end-systolic volume at one-year
      follow up.
