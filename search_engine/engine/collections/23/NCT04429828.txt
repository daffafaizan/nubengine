        -  gather insight into the emotional highs and lows of being a healthcare student during
           the pandemic

        -  identify any facilitators, obstacles or barriers to accessing the e-package.

        -  identify perceptions of healthcare students towards the value of the e-package during
           and after the COVID19 pandemic.

        -  establish recommendations for longer-term support for psychological wellbeing in
           healthcare students.

      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 45 purposively sampled healthcare
      students who have accessed the e-learning resource. The interview will be semi-structured and
      include a measure of mental wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale, 14-item - license
      received), and single items measures of job stressfulness, job satisfaction, presenteeism,
      turnover intentions and work engagement.

      Findings will inform future supportive interventions for healthcare students.
