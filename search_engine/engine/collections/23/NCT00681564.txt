      loss. Accumulation of subgingival dental biofilm in susceptible individuals is associated
      with an inflammatory host response characterized by the production of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases, reduction in collagen synthesis, increase in cytokine gene expression,
      and apoptosis of gingival fibroblasts. Finally, inflammation leads to destruction of
      periodontal ligament, alveolar bone resorption, and chronic periodontitis.

      Periodontitis is associated with increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute
      phase reactants. Multiple case-control and cohort studies have suggested that periodontitis
      is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, diabetic end-organ damage, pregnancy
      complications and respiratory diseases. Recent interventional studies have found that
      periodontal therapy could increase endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilation.

      The purpose of this controlled clinical trial is to determine the effect of periodontal
      therapy on endothelial function in subjects with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.
      Furthermore, the relationship between putative periodontal pathogens and endothelial function
      will be also evaluated.
