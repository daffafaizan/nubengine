      intervention for WIC clients that has potential for sustainability. The investigators will
      compare outcomes among participants in a group-based weight loss intervention condition
      (Fresh Start) to outcomes among participants in a self-directed, print materials only,
      comparison group. The Fresh Start intervention, informed by formative research studies,
      consists of an 8-session group-based weight loss intervention delivered by WIC nutritionists
      and peer leaders. The intervention integrates key educational and skill building strategies
      from the lifestyle arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program with delivery strategies and
      messages specific for the WIC program and postpartum women. The intervention will be
      evaluated in a randomized clinical trial that will contribute to generalizable knowledge.
