      are without well matched donors. This type of therapy has been associated with poor outcomes
      in the past due to complications such as infection. The Jefferson 2 Step approach was
      designed to allow the infusion of an exact dose of tolerized lymphocytes in haploidentical
      transplant in order to allow for immune reconstitution post transplant to avoid infectious
      complications while still having acceptable rates of GVHD. In this approach, older patients
      or patients who were transplanted previously with high-risk hematological malignancies
      undergo chemotherapy with fludarabine and cytarabine or thiotepa. The patients then receive
      an exact dose of their donors' lymphocytes. The phase I portion of the study determined the
      optimal dose of lymphocytes. Two days after receiving the donor lymphocytes, the patients
      receive 2 daily doses of cyclophosphamide. The purpose of the cyclophosphamide is for in-vivo
      tolerization of the lymphocytes. One day after receiving cyclophosphamide, the patients
      receive stem cell from their donor. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are used as GVHD
      prophylaxis.
