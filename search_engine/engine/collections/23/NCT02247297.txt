      women present with an increased susceptibility to some infectious and non-infectious
      inflammatory diseases. Specifically regulated mechanisms have been described occurring in
      normal whereas lacking in pathological pregnancies in both the native and adaptive immune
      system in animal models and humans. However, clinically relevant biomarker associated with
      preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), amniotic infection syndrome (AIS) as well as
      pregnancy associated complications such as preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver
      enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome have their limitations.

      Pancreatic stone protein (PSP), originally obtained from human pancreatic stones from
      patients operated for chronic calcifying pancreatitis, has been studied in several
      gastrointestinal pathologies.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the physiological course of the potentially novel
      biomarker PSP in pregnant women as well as to assess its predictive role in the development
      of inflammatory complications during pregnancy.
