      compliance of UC patients with 5-Amino Salicylic Acid (5-ASA) treatment appears mediocre,
      particularly in maintenance therapy. Poor or non-existent compliance affects not only
      treatment response but also disease progression.

      An inverse relationship has been found between the number of daily doses prescribed and
      treatment compliance. Thus, reduction to a single daily dose of mesalazine is a major factor
      likely to significantly increase treatment compliance.

      Reducing the dosing rate to a single daily dose for 8 weeks constitutes a simple method of
      improving treatment compliance but it is necessary to demonstrate at least equivalent
      efficacy compared to the twice daily dosing which is the reference regimen. This study was
      designed to show that mesalazine 4g once daily is at least as effective as mesalazine 4g in
      two divided doses per day in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis after 8 weeks
      of treatment with a better compliance. To improve remission, both groups received an enema
      during the first 4 weeks, as usually done in current practice.
