      importance of screening for the early detection of colorectal cancer is evident. Fecal occult
      blood screening is proving to be an effective tool for detecting premalignant adenomas and
      colon cancer since the guaiac-based test was introduced in the late 1960s. However, several
      immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (IFOBTs) have become commercially available and the
      majority of these have demonstrated equal or superior sensitivities and specificities than
      the guaiac-based tests. Therefore, IFOBTs are replacing guaiac based tests despite their
      higher costs.In this study we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new IFOBT and compare
      with the findings on colonoscopy.
