    
      This is a multi-center, uncontrolled observational study of patients who at the time of entry
      had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RÎ‘) and who were subsequently prescribed Humira
      (adalimumab) following normal clinical practice, with or without other anti-rheumatic
      treatments, prior to enrollment in this study.

      Once the physician has determined that the patient meets the inclusion criteria, and the
      patient has agreed to be included in the observational study by signing the informed consent,
      the patient's Day 1 demographic data, and disease status will be reported in the Day 1 Data
      Report Forms. The physician will then follow-up with the patient via regular office visits at
      intervals as determined by routine clinical practice. Patient's safety and efficacy data, if
      they are part of clinical routine, will be recorded in the Data Report Forms at Day 1, and
      regular visits which are closest to Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24,
      Month 30, and Month 36.
