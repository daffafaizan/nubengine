    
      20 OsseoSpeed ™ Profile EV and 20 OsseoSpeed ™ EV groups will be randomly implanted into the
      oblique edentulous ridges of subjects, and the treatment response will be monitored for 3
      years. The implantation area will be randomly divided into two groups, One group was treated
      with OsseoSpeed ™ Profile EV (sloped group) and the other group was treated with OsseoSpeed ™
      EV (control group). The same patient had the same implant as the same quadrant.

      The patient will be followed up regularly for follow-up, followed by clinical attachment
      level, probing depth, bleeding on probing, keratinized gingival width (Keratinized gingiva),
      mobility (mobility) and other clinical indicators of the measurement, regular dental
      radiography, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) collection and bone integration measurement.

      After six months of implantation, prosthesis will delivered and loaded functionally, and
      regular follow-up will be arranged. In each time of follow-up, examination will be carried
      out with regards to periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment height, periodontal
      bleeding index, keratinized gingival width, and other clinical indicators of the measurement,
      at the end of the experiment, that is, after three years, and then a dental root film
      irradiation, GCF collection and osseointegration measurement.
