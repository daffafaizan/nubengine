      Primary

        -  To evaluate the value of TCR V beta repertoire analysis for the determination of
           autoimmunity in refractory cytopenia (RC).

        -  To evaluate which immunophenotypic hematopoietic subclones are associated with
           oligoclonal T-cell expansion in RC.

        -  To evaluate the presence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clones in RC.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the molecular response with the hematologic response in patients with RC
           after treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (IST).

        -  To compare the molecular response with human leukocyte histocompatability antigen (HLA)
           expression in patients with RC after treatment with IST.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective study.

      Patients undergo biopsy, bone marrow, and blood sample collection periodically for
      immunological studies. Samples are analyzed for TCR V beta repertoire and paroxysmal
      nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone analysis via PCR heteroduplex analysis and
      immunophenotyping of CD14, CD16 , CD55, CD59, and CD24 expression via flow cytometry.
