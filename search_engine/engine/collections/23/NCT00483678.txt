        -  Determine the feasibility of Intimacy-Enhancing Couples Therapy (IECT) for patients with
           advanced or recurrent prostate cancer and their partners.

        -  Compare the effect of IECT vs usual care on patients' and their partners' level of
           global psychological distress.

        -  Compare the effect of IECT vs usual care on relationship intimacy in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to marital distress based on partners' scores on the Abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment
      Scale (high [< 21] vs low [â‰¥ 21]). Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients and their partners receive Intimacy-Enhancing Couples Therapy over 6
           weeks comprising the following four 90-minute sessions: the Story of Cancer;
           Understanding the Couple, Ways of Relating and Key Influences; Intimacy; and Coping,
           Support, and Adaptation. Patients and their partners complete treatment satisfaction
           questionnaires after completion of study intervention.

        -  Arm II: Patients and their partners receive standard psychosocial care. All participants
           complete questionnaires assessing psychological distress, intimacy, communication
           patterns, and overall relationship adjustment/satisfaction at baseline and at 1 month
           after completion of study intervention.
