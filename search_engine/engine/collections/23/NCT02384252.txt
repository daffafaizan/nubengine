      disease or other comorbidities.

      Right atrial samples obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery and presenting no sign
      of clinical cardiomyopathy will be grouped according to patient's body mass index. Atrial
      trabeculae will be explored to dissect out the respective contribution of (i) sarcoplasmic
      reticulum dysfunction (isometric twitch force contraction analysis), (ii) abnormal sarcomere
      sensitivity to calcium assessed in permeabilized fibers and (iii) mitochondrial dysfunction
      to intrinsec contractile dysfunction of myocardium in obese patients.
