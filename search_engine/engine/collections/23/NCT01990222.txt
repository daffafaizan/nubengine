      receive reminders for clinic visits and ADHD medication and enter daily ratings of their
      child's ADHD symptoms and medication side effects into a smart phone. It will also examine
      whether it is feasible and acceptable for doctors to use this information summarized on a
      tablet (iPad) screen during a medication follow-up visit. If the parent consents, the study
      will also examine whether it is feasible and acceptable for the child's teacher to enter
      their ratings of ADHD symptoms twice a week using a link on their email. This information
      will also be included in the doctor's iPad screen. If this technology is found to be
      promising, then a larger study will be done to examine if medication treatment is safer, more
      consistent, and more effective using this technology compared to usual care. This is
      important because the technology may remove the burden on parents and teachers to report ADHD
      symptoms and medication side effects using paper forms, and for doctors to record this
      information in the medical record. In total, there will be 12 parent/ child dyads, 6
      clinicians and up to 12 teachers enrolled. Each parent/child dyad will be videotaped for up
      to 3 visits with the clinician (n=36 videotaped sessions). The study time period is from the
      first visit that ADHD medication is prescribed to the time of the third follow-up medication
      visit. We anticipate that the follow-up visits will be every 1-2 weeks during this early
      phase of stimulant medication treatment. Thus, the study time period for each parent/child
      dyad will be between 4-8 weeks. We anticipate that data collection will occur between August
      19, 2013 and June 31, 2014.
