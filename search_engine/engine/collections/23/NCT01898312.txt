      mifepristone, a progesterone receptor modulator, on epithelial cell proliferation in human
      breast tissue in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations prior to protective mastectomy.

      Project description

      • Hypothesis/ Theory Mifepristone treatment exerts an antiproliferative, protective effect on
      breast tissue in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations

      Study Design Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Women will be recruited
      among patients with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations scheduled for prophylactic mastectomy. Included
      women will be randomized to a 3-month treatment with mifepristone, 50 mg (Mifegyne, Exelgyn,
      Paris, France) or placebo taken orally every second day. Breast biopsies will be obtained in
      the luteal phase prior to start of treatment and again during surgery.
