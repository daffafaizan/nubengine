      evaluation of the luteal phase of women presenting for infertility evaluation. The study will
      establish whether the mid-luteal or late-luteal phase is the most appropriate time to perform
      an endometrial biopsy. The study will be conducted through the multi-center Reproductive
      Medicine Network.

      Women with a history of infertility will be age matched to fertile women (controls). Women
      will be randomized either to the mid-luteal phase (7 to 8 days post-ovulation) endometrial
      biopsy group or to the late-luteal phase (12 to 13 days post-ovulation) endometrial biopsy
      group. Endometrial specimens will be evaluated histologically by a "blinded" pathologist.
