    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Sixty spinal cord injured
      subjects with neuropathic pain will be randomized into two groups. The subject in the
      Treatment Group will receive lithium carbonate tablet, while the Control Group will receive
      placebo tablet. Neither the subjects nor the physicians know which group the subjects are
      allocated.

      Each subject will receive 6 weeks of oral lithium carbonate or placebo. In the Treatment
      Group, the dose will be adjusted according to the serum lithium level. While in the Control
      Group, the dose will be adjusted based on the dummy serum level report.

      The outcome will be assessed during visits at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and a
      phone call follow-up at 24 weeks from the start of the medication. The primary outcome
      measure is the severity level of pain. The efficacy and safety will be analyzed by comparing
      the results of the Treatment Group with those of the Control Group
