    
      Periprosthetic bone resorption after Total Knee Arthroplasty occurs as a consequence of
      prosthetic implant on the bone. Some of this patients (up to 13%) develop an aseptic failure
      of the prosthesis needing revision surgery.

      2 groups of patients are treated with Placebo and Denosumab in a double blind prospective
      trial. Densitometry, Knee society score (KSS), Western Ontario McMaster University
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) were done
      in both groups at 0,3,6 and 12 months after surgery.
