      sensitivity is uncertain but proposed to be (75-95%), however flat adenomas which are easily
      missed, are often not recognised. Fluorescence imaging may increase the sensitivity of
      standard white light colonoscopy by identifying more polyps and flat adenomas which will make
      the resection of adenomas more complete.

      In this study hexaminolevulinate (HAL) will be administered locally as a photosensitiser,
      using different doses to find the optimal imaging conditions as well as making patient safety
      assessments.

      Both standard white light and blue light (fluorescence) inspection will be performed.
