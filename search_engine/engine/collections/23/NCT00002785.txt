      followed by intensified re-induction/re-intensification in infants less than 1 year of age
      with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). II. Evaluate the feasibility and
      outcome of bone marrow transplantation using family or unrelated donors in infants with the
      11q23 abnormality. III. Evaluate neuropsychologic outcome upon completion of protocol therapy
      in patients who have reached the ages of 3 and 7 years, with special attention to the outcome
      in infants who received total-body irradiation. IV. Study the biology of infant ALL in
      samples of leukemic blood and bone marrow. V. Study the possible associations among patient-
      and disease-specific factors and family sociodemographic characteristics that mediate
      treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE: Upon completion of Induction/Intensification and Re-Induction therapy, patients with
      the 11q23 abnormality and with a matched or one-antigen mismatched related or unrelated donor
      proceed immediately to Transplantation; all others proceed to Re-Intensification,
      Consolidation, Intensified Maintenance, and Routine Maintenance. The following acronyms are
