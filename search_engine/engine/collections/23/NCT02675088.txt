      respond to chemotherapy after four to six cycles of standard chemotherapy (platinum
      etoposide), 45Gy/15F of thoracic radiotherapy will be used in experimental arm, while
      30Gy/10F of thoracic radiotherapy will be used in the control arm. Both survival and toxicity
      of the two arms will be observed and compared.
