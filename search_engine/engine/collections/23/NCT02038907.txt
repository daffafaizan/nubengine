      particle (VLP) vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and with or without monophosphoryl
      lipid A (MPL). The norovirus vaccine is being tested to assess different formulations of the
      vaccine that will then be further developed.

      This study will look at the number of antibodies to norovirus formed in people who take
      different formulations of the norovirus vaccine. The study will enroll approximately 420
      patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance) to one of fourteen treatment
      groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless
      there is an urgent medical need).

      All participants will receive a vaccination on Day 1 and Day 28 of the study. Some treatment
      arms will receive one dose of the norovirus vaccine and some arms will receive two. In order
      to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the patient and the doctor, those randomized to the
      one dose groups will receive a dose of Hepatitis A vaccine on Day 1 followed by the norovirus
      vaccine 28 days later. Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related
      to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card for 7 days after each vaccination.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Belgium. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 393 days. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted
      by telephone twice for follow-up assessments.
