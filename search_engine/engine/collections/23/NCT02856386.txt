      supplement of polyphenols from green tea and pomegranate extracts provides micronutrients
      often missing from conventional American diets. The objective of this study is to monitor
      changes in GI symptoms when the supplement is provided alongside the standard of care for
      children with symptoms that have been present for more than two weeks.
