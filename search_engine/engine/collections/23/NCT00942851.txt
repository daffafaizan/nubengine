    
      OBJECTIVE:

      To study the efficacy of cutaneous application of Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (AH8) in the therapy
      of blepharospasm.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      22 patients with blepharospasm.

      DESIGN:

      This will be a double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients receiving treatment of
      blepharospasm with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) will be recruited. They will receive either
      the study substance or a placebo cream containing the emulsion but no active substance, in
      twice daily applications to the eyelids beginning the day following a BoNT injection
      treatment. They will continue to apply the cream and we will record the time until their
      condition worsens back to baseline following benefit from the injections, hypothesizing that
      the cream application will prolong the time until the need for the next injection by at least
      3 months.

      OUTCOME MEASURES::

      Primary: time until the Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale (JBRS) reverts back to baseline.

      Secondary: Change in the JBRS at 6 months; Change in the JBRS at 7 months if not receiving
      BoNT; Change in the JBRS at 3 months; Change in the Blepharospasm Disability Scale at 6
      months
