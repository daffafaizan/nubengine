    
      This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups :

        -  Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with High Flow Nasal Cannula (60l/min FiO2 (fraction of
           inspired oxygen) = 1) before orotracheal intubation after crash induction. The device
           will be maintained in place throughout the intubation procedure in order to achieve
           apnoeic oxygenation.

        -  Or Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) with
           Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) + 5 cm H2O and Inspiratory Airway Positive
           Airway Pressure (IPAP) + 15, meaning a 10cm H2O pressure support. The facial mask with
           be removed after before crash induction enabling laryngoscopic vision.
