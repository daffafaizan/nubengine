      block (experimental group) achieve clinically and statistically significant reductions in
      self-reported pain during NovaSure EA, as compared to those receiving paracervical block
      (control group). All women will obtain concurrent procedural sedation. Women's perception of
      pain will be recorded on a scale from 0 to 10 using the visual analogue scale (VAS).

      The researchers hypothesize that the participants receiving combined paracervical and fundal
      block will experience less pain during the active procedure, as compared to those receiving
      paracervical block alone.
