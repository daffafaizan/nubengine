      consequences; however, little is known about effective interventions for young adults
      attending community colleges (CCs). Thus, it is critical to develop an intervention that
      meets the various needs and demanding lifestyles of CC students. The investigators proposed
      to develop a user-friendly and convenient intervention that addresses relevant social norms,
      the impact of high-risk alcohol use on health and well-being in relevant life domains beyond
      student life and academic achievement, and provides ongoing exposure to behavior change
      strategies. To address the notable differences between CC students and traditional 4-year
      students, the investigators adapted BASICS to a web-conferencing format that allows the
      facilitator and participant to see and discuss live web-based personalized feedback (FB).
      This intervention for CC students, BASICCS, will focus on relevant normative feedback and
      alcohol's impact on multiple roles and personal goals of the CC student. Providing tips and
      protective behavioral strategies (PBS) after BASICS interventions via handouts or mailed
      postcards is standard practice and with preliminary evidence supporting the use of mobile
      phone text messaging (TM) or short message service (SMS) to reduce heavy-episodic drinking;
      thus, in this study SMS text messages were used to deliver ongoing protective behavioral
      strategies (PBS) the month after participating in the BASICCS session. The objective of this
      research was to establish feasibility and acceptability as well as to determine preliminary
      or likely effect sizes. CC student drinkers were recruited to participate and if eligible,
      they were randomized to one of two conditions (BASICCS or assessment-only control) and
      completed 1- and 3-month follow-ups.
