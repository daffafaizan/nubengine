    
      This is a multi-center prospective cohort study to monitor the effect of bilateral phrenic
      nerve stimulation for treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) in patients with heart failure.
      There will be 2 groups of study patients, both with CSA and heart failure. One group will
      receive the phrenic nerve pacer, and one will not. Both groups will have the same medical
      oversight, management, and assessment of heart health whether they receive the pacer or not.

      Subjects will have a physical exam, review of medications, New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      functional classification assessment for heart failure, Minnesota Living With Heart Failure
      (MLWHF) Questionnaire for quality of live assessment and blood test for Pro-BNP. In-lab sleep
      study will be required if subject haven't had one within 3 months, and Echocardiogram, if
      subjects haven't had one within 30 days. If subjects are willing to have stimulator placement
      procedure, they'll have an ENT consult. Subjects in the procedure arm will have Phrenic Nerve
      Stimulator placement procedure, and 3 weeks after procedure follow up visit with ENT doctor
      to activate the device and have sleep study to confirm proper settings.
