      (either CT or ultrasound) core needle biopsy of a liver mass suspicious for primary liver
      cancer as a part their clinical care. A written informed consent will be obtained for the
      clinical biopsy per standard protocol. Additional core biopsy of the liver mass will be
      performed for research purposes at the time of the clinical care biopsy. The additional
      research biopsy is not mandatory and is subject to a separate written informed consent, which
      will be obtained prior to the clinical biopsy.
