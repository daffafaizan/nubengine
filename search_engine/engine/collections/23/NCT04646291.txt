      has been used for decades to increase likelihood of pregnancy. This method works by
      depositing semen close to or at the cervix. While there are several devices such as over the
      counter syringes and silicone caps, the creator of the Mosie Baby syringe believes it is
      designed to be more ergonomic and compatible with a woman's body, easy and safe to use, and
      results in depositing the semen at or near the cervix opening. The Mosie Kit provides people
      with an at-home intracervical insemination option which could be used before resorting to
      more invasive and expensive options such as Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or in vitro
      fertilization. There is vast evidence of Mosie's success in the form of happy users who have
      conceived. There is a desire to learn more about the safety, useability and experience of
      using the Mosie kit.

      This retrospective study will examine the experience of people who have voluntarily chosen to
      purchase and use the Mosie Kit. The Mosie Kit consists of 2 syringes and a semen collection
      cup Understanding the safety, useability and experience of using the Mosie Kit will provide
      additional information about the nature of using intracervical insemination as a viable
      method for getting pregnant. The information gained will increase understanding of how viable
      the Mosie Kit is as a first step in trying to conceive and how it is perceived by the people
      who have chosen to use it.
