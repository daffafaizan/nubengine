      to carry out a preventive therapy against the onset of CIPN. The nature of the studies that
      try to prevent is very diverse, but one of the wide tools is therapeutic exercise. In this
      case we intend to combine therapeutic exercise with BFR to obtain a pre-conditioning effect
      that protects intraepidermal fibers from exposure to the chemotherapy.
