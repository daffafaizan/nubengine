      growing Latino populations in the country. In South Carolina, asthma is the leading cause of
      children's hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits, with significant direct and
      indirect costs. Although rates of childhood asthma are lower in Latinos (with the exception
      of children of Puerto Rican origin) than in whites, Latinos are more likely to have a higher
      incidence of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, ED visits, repeat hospitalizations, and poorer
      health in general. Current interventions addressing asthma control include outpatient clinic
      based and home visitation programs. Rural Latino families have difficulty participating with
      these types of programs due to work, family, and transportation constraints.

      The adaptability of mobile apps holds the potential to target the unique challenges to
      management experienced by rural Latino children with asthma experience. The goal of this
      study is to develop and evaluate a patient-centered collaborative intervention between rural
      Latino children with asthma and their families, school-based nursing, and primary care
      providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based bilingual mobile app. The specific
      aims are to:

        1. Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and
           evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; and

        2. Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary
           protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1.
