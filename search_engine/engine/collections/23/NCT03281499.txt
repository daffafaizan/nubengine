      represent a challenging problem for clinicians both from a diagnostic and therapeutic
      perspective. Traditional techniques for identification of primary tumors involved a Positron
      Emission Tomography scan (PET)/ computerized tomography scan(CT) followed by examination
      under anesthesia with biopsies of the nasopharynx, tongue base, piriform sinuses in
      conjunction with a tonsillectomy may identify as many as 44% of primary tumors, the remaining
      unidentified tumors are treated with mucosal irradiation to all high risk mucosal sites. The
      addition of a lingual tonsillectomy with Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) may identify almost
      70% of primary tumours that have otherwise escaped initial identification at this timepoint,.
      Historically, for those whose primary would not be discovered at the PET/CT, the discovery
      would have been made later during follow up visits.

      The investigators propose to integrate Transoral Robotic Surgery into the diagnostic
      evaluation of participants presenting with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the neck of
      unknown primary origin. The investigators will localize small hidden oropharyngeal
      carcinomas, determine their laterality, and based on the laterality of the tumour, laterality
      of neck nodes, and completeness of resection, will offer reduced radiotherapy to the primary
      site and/or to the neck (de-intensification)to the participant. The investigators hypothesize
      that this approach to unknown primary carcinomas will be both safe and effective.
