      food and propel it through out digestive tract. Although known to be involved in a range of
      conditions like chronic constipation, Parkinson's and Crohn's disease, investigator have
      never had effective tests with which to study the process. Advances in medical imaging
      technologies now make it possible to both see and quantify this process non-invasively using
      MRI. In this study the investigator first of all validate that our MRI based analysis is
      robust and valid, producing predictable results against range of known stimuli. The
      investigator then apply the technique to a cohort of participants with Chronic Intestinal
      Pseudo-Obstruction. These participants are known to have hypo-motile small bowels and
      demonstration with our MRI technique would serve as further validation. The investigator also
      investigate two cohorts of people with and without gastrointestinal diseases to better
      understand how the technique may work in the clinical setting.

      By the end of this project The investigator will have generated robust initial evidence to
      validate our MRI technique and clinical data to inform use further research.
