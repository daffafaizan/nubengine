      information on the Atlantic diet and how to follow it; the nutritionists' messages were
      adapted to the clinical condition of each subject, his/her preferences, needs, beliefs and
      culture. Special care was taken with patients who were obese, had diabetes or who had high
      blood cholesterol; conflicts with recommendations made by subjects' own doctors or
      nutritionists were avoided. All questionnaires (see below) were filled out in the presence of
      the nutritionists, except for 3-day food records which the subjects handed in completed. The
      latter were reviewed in the presence of the subjects in order to correct any errors or add
      missing information. At the 3 and 6 month visits, the nutritionists reminded the subjects
      about the Atlantic diet and the helped them complete their questionnaires.

      Foods were provided to the families of the AD group. Wine was provided only to non-tee-total
      adults. Food packages were delivered every three weeks to the family home. The food included
      in the package was calculated for the total number of family members, even if not all were
      taking part in the study. At delivery, a form was filled in to verify that the previous lot
      of food had been consumed, and to note any problems.
