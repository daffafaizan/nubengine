      multiple infusions of MGD014 (Part 2). Part 1 is a single ascending dose study with a 1+3
      design for the first 2 dose cohorts, and a 3+3 design with staggered accrual for the 6 higher
      dose cohorts, with an aim of determining the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of ascending doses up to either the Optimal Biologic Dose (OBD) or the
      maximum administered dose (MAD).

      Part 2 is a multi-dose expansion cohort with MGD014 administered at the OBD, as determined in
      Part 1. In Part 2, additional assessments on the effects of MGD014 on HIV latent infection
      parameters will be evaluated.
