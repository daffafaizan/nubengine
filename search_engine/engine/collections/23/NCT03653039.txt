      the investigators compare the ease of tracheal intubation between a new ultra-thin
      endotracheal tube, "Tritube", and a standard endotracheal tube in patients with predictors of
      difficult laryngoscopy. The intubation is performed with an angulated video laryngoscope.

      Furthermore the investigators compare the acceptance of leaving the Tritube in trachea after
      end of anaesthesia, with the use of a tube exchange catheter. The latter continues into the
      post-operative recovery-ward.
