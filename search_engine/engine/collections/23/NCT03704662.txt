      body radiation therapy (SBRT) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma to conventional fractionation.
      Much of the existing literature indicates this technique is safe and convenient for patients,
      as compared with conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. However,
      there has been no direct comparison of these two treatment modalities when given in the
      preoperative setting. It also remains uncertain if SBRT results in similar nodal downstaging
      to preoperative, conventionally fractionated chemo-RT.

      STUDY DESIGN: This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, two-arm, phase
      II clinical trial. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized after a
      minimum of two months of induction chemotherapy. These patients will be required to have no
      biopsy-proven distant disease on repeat staging studies before randomization. Patients who
      have radiologically equivocal evidence of distant metastatic disease (small lung nodules, or
      liver lesions that cannot be definitively characterized, etc.) are also eligible for
      enrollment. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic disease are not eligible. The total number
      of patients planned for accrual is approximately 102 patients (51 patients per arm).
