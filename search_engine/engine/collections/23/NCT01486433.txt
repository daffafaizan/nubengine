      concomitant administration of simvastatin and aspirin. No drug interaction will be claimed
      if, following concomitant administration of simvastatin, aspirin and Epanova or only
      simvastatin and aspirin, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios
      (GMRs) of the back-transformed PK parameters, area under the plasma concentration versus time
      curve (AUC0-tau) and concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Cmax,ss), for simvastatin
      and beta- hydroxysimvastatin acid,fall within 80%-125%.
