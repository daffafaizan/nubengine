      route after the cessation of menstrual period. In the second menstrual period following the
      PRP injection, the endometrial thickness will be assessed under ultrasound and hormone
      replacement will be started. As the endometrial thickness reaches adequate thickness during
      ultrasound follow-up, embryo transfer will be performed. Pregnancy test results will be
      recorded and followed.
