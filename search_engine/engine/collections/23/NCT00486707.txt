    
      All eligible patients being seen in the Gynecology Center at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
      and at Gynecologic Oncology of Houston for follow-up or a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer
      will be asked to participate in this study by completing a questionnaire.

      This study will end when 400 completed questionnaires have been collected. We estimate that
      40-60 ovarian cancer patients are seen in the Gynecology Center at the M.D. Anderson Cancer
      Center each week and that 20- 40 ovarian cancer patients are seen at Gynecologic Oncology of
      Houston each week. The completion of 400 questionnaires will provide adequate data to address
      our question in an expeditious time frame. The initial phase of this study is exploratory and
      does not involve a comparison group.
