      therapy, underscoring the need for additional intervention. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is incorporated into membrane phospholipids and
      atherosclerotic plaques and exerts beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic cascade from
      onset of plaque formation through rupture. EPA also improves atherogenic dyslipidemia
      characterized by reduction of triglycerides without raising low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol. All of this data supports the biologic plausibility of EPA as an
      anti-atherosclerotic agent. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with
      Vascepa (4 grams) results in a greater change from baseline in low attenuation plaque than
      placebo in subjects with elevated triglycerides (200-499 mg/dl).
