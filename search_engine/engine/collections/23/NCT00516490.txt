      outcome of ICSI-ET cycles. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effect of a single
      dose GnRH agonist administered in the luteal phase on the outcome of ICSI - ET cycles
      stimulated with the long GnRH agonist protocol. Women undergoing embryo transfer following
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with a long GnRH agonist protocol were included. In
      addition to routine luteal phase support with progesterone women were randomized to receive a
      single dose of GnRH agonist or placebo on the sixth day after ICSI.Ongoing pregnancy rate was
      the primary outcome measure.
