      over time in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, irrespective of lifestyle and existing
      pharmacological interventions. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes is one of the major
      challenges in the treatment of affected patients, and agents that could alter the natural
      history of this condition would add greatly to current treatment approaches. Short-term
      intensive insulin therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes will improve beta-cell function
      and usually leading to a temporary remission time. The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on
      beta-cells is stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release, followed by enhancement of
      insulin biosynthesis. It is stimulating beta-cell proliferation, induction of islet
      neogenesis, and inhibition of ß-cell apoptosis. Exenatide is synthetic exendin-4, GLP-1
      receptor agonist. Exenatide exerts direct effects on β-cell, which indicates that may
      contribute to delay disease progression. However, no study has evaluated effect of short-term
      intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model on β-cell function and glycemic
      remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. This current study is thus
      designed to evaluate effect of short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy
      model on β-cell function , glycemic control and glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed
      type 2 diabetic patients.
