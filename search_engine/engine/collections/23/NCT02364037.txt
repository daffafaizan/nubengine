      usual care plus the CHOICE structured contraceptive counseling, and the 'complete CHOICE'
      group which includes the structured contraceptive counseling as well as provider training and
      cost support for IUDs and implants. Participants will be enrolled at three partner community
      clinics by a staff member (site coordinator) dedicated to the research study. All
      participants will undergo contraceptive counseling as well as a baseline survey with the
      coordinator. Participants will complete telephone surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-enrollment and will be asked about contraceptive method chosen, satisfaction and
      continuation of the method, and any pregnancies experienced since enrollment.
