      cancers. The most common side effect of anthracycline is cardiotoxicity and this may limits
      its use and increases the rate of mortality and morbidity. Cardiotoxicity is cumulative, dose
      dependent, and irreversible. Improvements in protective mechanisms against the cardiotoxicity
      of anthracycline are important to prevent the discontinuance of these chemotherapeutics.

      Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist which blocks the last step of the rennin
      angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). The RAAS is one of the most effective systems in
      remodeling of the myocardium in post-myocardial damage. According to the RALES study, in
      patients with severe heart failure, 25 mg spironolactone per day in addition to the standard
      therapy has positive effects, particularly on cardiac fibrosis and on remodeling, and
      substantially reduces the risk of both morbidity and death. In the EPHESUS study, it has been
      shown that, after the myocardial damage due to infarction, the administration of aldosterone
      antagonists had positive effects on the remodeling process, left ventricular ejection
      fraction and primer end-points. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that RAAS
      blockage with spironolactone may reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthracycline group
      chemotherapeutics.
