      severe plaque psoriasis.While there is an abundance of clinical data in the literature
      supporting the clinical efficacy of this therapy, there is limited data on early disease
      clearance and other histologic findings elucidating a drug mechanism of action.
      Hyper-proliferation of the epidermis and inflammation of dermis seen in psoriasis are thought
      to be due to persistent T-cell activation and production of several pro-inflammatory
      cytokines by dermal immune reaction. Therefore, with treatments with immunomodulatory
      effects, such as Secukinumab, monitoring markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, and collagen
      synthesis would be useful in establishing mechanism of action. While a skin biopsy can show
      these findings at one moment in time, it does not allow for repetitive monitoring overtime.
      The investigators propose the use of non-invasive imaging with Optical Coherence Tomography
      (OCT) to demonstrate histologic features of plaque psoriasis not clinically evident. Upon
      completion of the study, the investigators will assess when OCT improvements of psoriasis
      treatment are detectable and how these findings correlate to observed clinical improvements.
