    
      This study is a pre-test, post-test single group design with post test measures at one week
      after completion of intervention and follow-up at three months. Approximately 300 adolescents
      will participate in this study. The study will be conducted in ten cohorts of 12. Each cohort
      will have 6 participants and 6 adolescent volunteers (peers). Cohorts will be run in a time
      sequential manner with up to four cohorts running at a time. Participants and their parents
      will complete pre-test measures including both paper and pencil, online, or phone measures
      and a video-recording to assess the participant's social interaction skills and fluency.
      These adolescents will participate in both group therapy and peer generalization sessions
      once a week over the course of twelve weeks. Upon completion of the intervention,
      participants and parents will complete paper and pencil, online, or phone measures and video
      post-test measures. Participants will be encouraged to participate in a follow-up session
      where the paper and pencil and video measures will be completed again.
