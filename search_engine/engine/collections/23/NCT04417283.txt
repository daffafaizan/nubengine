      life (known as the "first 1000 days") than during any other period of development.
      Consequently, both intrinsic biology/physiology and extrinsic factors such as environmental
      exposures can have profound impacts on long-term health and disease outcomes. The purpose of
      this project is to develop a cohort of mother-infant dyads that can provide a collection of
      birth samples and be studied long-term - from pregnancy through early childhood - to help
      identify early life factors that influence lifelong health and disease. The study will
      include collection of biospecimens from pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy, at
      delivery, and within the first few months after giving birth, as well as collection of
      biospecimens from the infants at birth and during their first two years of life. In addition
      to biospecimens, health information will be collected from the participants' electronic
      health records, and via questionnaires to assess health behaviors, social determinants, and
      environmental exposures. Participants may also consent for yearly review of state
      administrative data, including educational data, social services, and vital records. The
      biospecimens and data collected in this study will allow for assessment of the impact of
      different factors during pregnancy and early childhood on long-term health and well-being.
