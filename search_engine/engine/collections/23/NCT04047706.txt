    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination with IDO1 inhibitor
      BMS-986205 (BMS986205) and radiation in newly diagnosed MGMT promoter unmethylated
      glioblastoma and MGMT promoter methylated glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Descriptive survival analyses (overall survival [OS] and OS at 12 months [OS12]) in
      patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS6) in patients with MGMT
      unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.

      III. Radiographic response rates (RR) as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
      (RANO) and immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria in patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT
      methylated promoter.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with nivolumab in
      combination with BMS-986205 and radiation.

      II. Correlate T-cell changes and IDO1 expression with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205. Patients are assigned
      to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT methylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO)
      once daily (QD), IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Within 4 weeks of radiation therapy completion, patients also receive temozolomide PO
      QD on days 1-5 of cycles 2-6. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT unmethylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205
      PO QD and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent
      cycles. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
