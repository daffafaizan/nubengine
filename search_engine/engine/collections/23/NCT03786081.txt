      after standard of care therapy and who are intolerant or ineligible to receive standard of
      care treatments. Arm A will be conducted by escalating doses of both tisotumab vedotin and
      bevacizumab. Dose escalations of the tisotumab vedotin + pembrolizumab and tisotumab vedotin
      + carboplatin combinations (Arms B and C, respectively) will be conducted by combining fixed
      doses of either pembrolizumab or carboplatin with increasing doses of tisotumab vedotin.

      The dose expansion part will consist of subjects with recurrent or stage IVB cervical cancer,
      who have not received prior systemic therapy for their recurrent or stage IVB disease, Arms D
      and E being treated with tisotumab vedotin + carboplatin or tisotumab vedotin +
      pembrolizumab, respectively, or subjects, who have progressed on or after standard of care
      treatments, Arm F treated with tisotumab vedotin + pembrolizumab and Arm G treated with
      tisotumab vedotin alone. Subjects enrolled to Arms D, E, and F will receive the RP2D of
      tisotumab vedotin established in the dose escalation part. Subjects enrolled to Arm G will
      receive tisotumab vedotin weekly for three weeks and 1 week off (28 day treatment cycle).
