      Recently we completed the study "Mucosal impedance in eosinophilic esophagitis and the effect
      of treatment" using a new technology allowing for direct assessment of mucosal impedance at
      the time of routine upper endoscopy to assess esophageal integrity and disease activity and
      alevate the need for biopsies.

      For this study, Sandhill Scientific has customized a Mucosal Impedance balloon (MI) assembly
      to provide precise measurements over a broad area of esophageal epithelium, while eliminating
      the fluids and spanning across a 10 mm luminal area using the same direct assessment as the
      mucosal impedance at the time of routine upper endoscopy.
