      are in a uniquely difficult situation in their disease, comorbidities, and treatment that may
      lead to worsened symptoms and many negative health consequences, including fatigue,
      irritability, and impaired daytime functioning.

      Physical activity (PA) is defined as 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that
      results in energy expenditure'. Several health benefits of increased PA have been reported
      for people with cancer. PA plays a critical role across the cancer trajectory, from
      prevention through to post-diagnosis and has been proposed as an alternative for improving
      physical and psychosocial health outcomes, reducing cancer recurrence, and cancer-specific
      and all-cause mortality. However, most of the findings were predominantly in breast and
      colorectal cancers. The PA dosage required to attain health benefits across these cancer
      groups is not uniform, nor is it clear whether the results can be applied to other groups of
      people with cancer.

      The current study includes a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and an in-depth interview.
      It aims to understand the current physical activity practice and preference of patients with
      lung cancer, which could help to develop a lifestyle modification program based on our
      patients' needs and preferences.
