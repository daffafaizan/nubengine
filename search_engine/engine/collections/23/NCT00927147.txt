    
      This is a single-center, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I/II trial to
      determine safety and efficacy of BNCT in the treatment of nonoperable, irradiated, locally
      advanced cancers of the head and neck region. Patients will be treated with a single-fraction
      boronophenylalanine (BPA)-based BNCT. All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Neutron irradiation will first be planned based on the available tumor imaging examinations,
      following which the head and body position will be determined for irradiation, and head
      fixation will be prepared and tested. On the irradiation day 400 mg/m2 L-BPA-F will be
      infused intravenously over 2 hours. Cetuximab doses will be administered following completion
      of BNCT. The cetuximab doses will be escalated in cohorts of 3 patients.
