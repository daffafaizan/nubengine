      at 3 to 6 months (this is standard of care) to confirm LAA (left atrial appendage) occlusion.
      The TEE is not mandatory (this is not a clinical trial), but will be strongly recommended to
      patients to confirm the efficacy of treatment. This will help confirm whether patients may
      safely remain off anticoagulation. The risks of TEE are a less than 1 in 1000 risk of death,
      and a 1% or less risk of a major complication, such as esophageal perforation.
