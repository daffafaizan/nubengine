      superior to conventional open cholecystectomy. However, it was rapidly overshadowed by
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy when the latter method was introduced. Today, some 25% of all
      gallbladder surgery is done with the conventional open cholecystectomy, often on elderly and
      frail patients. Previous trials comparing minilaparotomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      have been hampered by surgeonsÂ´ different expertise with the two methods. These studies
      indicate that operation time is shorter and that health care cost is lower for minilaparotomy
      compared to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but hard data are scarce. The objective of the
      present trial is to randomize eligible patients to two groups of surgeons, well trained in
      either minilaparotomy cholecystectomy or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgeons in the
      minilaparotomy group will consider extension of the incision when necessary, and surgeons in
      the laparoscopic group will aim for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with conversion to open
      cholecystectomy if this is indicated. The design of the study allows wide inclusion criteria
      for participants, a cost-utility approach in the analysis, and a high external validity of
      the conclusions reached.

      Comparison: Minilaparotomy cholecystectomy compared to laparoscopic cholecystectomy for
      gallbladder disease.
