      (TTR) have a higher risk of both bleeding complications and thromboembolic events. A good TTR
      is generally considered to be over 60% and "excellent TTR" is above 72% of time in range. The
      investigators will recruit patients with a TTR below 50%.

      The Fearon algorithm provides a more thorough understanding of the individual responses to
      changes in warfarin dose and with a personalized nomogram for dose adjustments and timing of
      laboratory tests the investigators have an opportunity to improve the TTR and on a larger
      scale to reduce clinically important adverse events. Before embarking on a large randomized
      trial with this revised Fearon algorithm-derived nomogram this pilot study with a randomized,
      open-label design will be performed to demonstrate proof of principle.
