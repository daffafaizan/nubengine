      controlled trial to examine the effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on the
      post operative recovery of persons undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three cohorts: one with only
      conventiobnal treatment, one with a daily standardized protocol of OMT and a third with a
      daily time matched placebo OMT protocol.All patients received standard state of the art care
      consistent with national standards of post CABG care. The study showed favorable trends in
      terms of hospital length of stay , return of bowel function, and mobility.
