      perform exercises of resistance and flexibility for 13 minutes before teaching, during six
      weeks) and Respiratory Muscle Training (to perform exercises to strengthen the respiratory
      muscles through the use of incentive respiratory equipment. Five repetitions of exhales with
      an interval of thirty seconds between each one were performed. It was requested rest for two
      minutes, repeating the procedure four times with the total of five series. These exercises
      were performed for 13 minutes before teaching, during six weeks).

      Outcomes analyzed: demographics and teaching activity characteristics; symptoms, habits and
      factors associated with voice disorders; self-reported voice handicap (Voice Handicap
      Index-VHI-10); vocal severity rating (Vocal Severity Scale); and acoustic parameters through
      the computerized acoustic voice analysis program VoxMetria (CTS Informatics).
