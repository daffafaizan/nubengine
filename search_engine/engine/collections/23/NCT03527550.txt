      "urgency," is strongly related to many different mental health symptoms and risky behaviors.
      Urgency refers to impulsivity specifically in the context of strong emotions.

      Research shows that higher levels of urgency are related to specific deficits in cognition.
      Problems with response inhibition--the ability to cancel or withhold a planned action--are
      associated with urgency. Also, research shows that difficulties in another aspect of
      cognition--working memory--may moderate the relationship between inhibition deficits and
      urgency. One previous study found that people who practiced computerized response inhibition
      and working memory tasks for two weeks reported significant decreases in urgency.

      It is unknown if these computerized tasks would be helpful for reducing urgency in adults
      with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it is unknown if changes in urgency are related to
      changes in the brain mechanisms that help to support response inhibition. This study will
      collect data on brain activity while people are completing response inhibition tasks.
