      The study will open with Dosing Schedule 1 (S1) (OSI-906 Once Daily (QD) Days 1-3 every 14
      days). Dosing Schedule 2 (S2) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-5 every 14 days) will be initiated following
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S1 or after a review of
      preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from ≥ 6 dose levels in S1 indicate that toxicity
      is acceptable and potential improvement in exposure may be achieved by an increased number of
      dosing days. Dosing Schedule 3 (S3) (OSI-906 QD Days 1-7 every 14 days) will occur upon
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 in S2 or after ≥ 1 dose
      level in S2 has been examined.

      A 3-patient bridging dose cohort will be opened in S1 to qualitatively compare the 25 mg
      capsule with 100 mg capsule dosage strengths in order to confirm that no gross differences in
      safety or exposure exist between the formulations. In order to characterize the tablet, a
      6-patient dose cohort will be opened to qualitatively examine the pharmacokinetics of this
      dosage form.

      Once the MTD has been determined for S1 and once the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the
      tablet cohort have been reviewed, a Fed-Fasted Expansion Cohort will be opened.
