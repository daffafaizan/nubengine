    
      The application of CPAP has been described as an alternative respiratory support for
      premature newborns with respiratory distress.Many studies support that the early use of CPAP
      results in a better respiratory evolution and less need for mechanical ventilation.

      Hypothesis:

      - The hypothesis is that EBCPAP will decrease the need for this more invasive therapy.

      The primary endpoint in this multicenter controlled study is to establish if an strategy of
      EBCPAP application in a subgroup of VLBWI, 800 to 1500g birthweight, decreases the need for
      mechanical ventilation in this group, without affecting mortality. .

      As secondary outcome, the investigators will analyse: days of oxygen therapy, days of
      mechanical ventilation, need for surfactant , pulmonary airleak, intraventricular hemorrhage,
      persistent ductus arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
      at 28 days and 36 weeks corrected gestational age.

      Comparison(s):

      Early Bubble CPAP (EBCPAP)with Standard Therapy which is oxygen.
