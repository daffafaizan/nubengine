    
      The Onduo Virtual Diabetes Clinic (VDC) is the suite of diabetes management services accessed
      via a software application (Onduo App).

      Eligible subjects are asked to use the Onduo App and commercially available FDA-regulated
      medical devices and non-medical devices, for up to 4 months.

      Subjects receive a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and are asked to use the device for up to
      6 wear cycles of 10 days each.

      Subjects are scheduled for a medical review via a face-to-face telemedicine consultation with
      a VDC Physician.

      Subjects may have their diabetes medications changed by a VDC Physician following their
      telemedicine visit.

      Information provided to a subject in the course of the study is not intended as a substitute
      for the subject's primary care provider's guidance.

      At the completion of the subject's study participation, the Onduo App will be deactivated and
      there will be no further data collection through the app.

      A1c levels and surveys are collected at 1 year follow-up.
