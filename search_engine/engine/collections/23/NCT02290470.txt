      delayed nausea and vomiting in women receiving the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel
      for a gynaecologic cancer. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Please see
      the "Arms and Intervention" sections for more detailed information. The primary objective is
      to determine in each treatment group the proportion of patients achieving Complete Protection
      (CP; no vomiting, no rescue anti-emetics, and no more than mild nausea) during the delayed
      phase (days 2-5 post-chemotherapy) in the first chemotherapy cycle. The secondary objectives
      are:

        1. To determine the proportion of patients achieving Complete Response (CR; no vomiting,
           and no rescue anti-emetics) during the acute (day 1 post-chemotherapy), delayed, and
           overall (days 1-5 post-chemotherapy) periods.

        2. To determine the incidences of potential toxicities ascribed to olanzapine.

        3. To assess the impact of nausea and vomiting on daily life activities in each treatment
           group.

      Protocol treatment is to begin â‰¤14 days of registration. Patients will receive treatment on
      Days 1-3. Patients will be permitted to take rescue therapy of the treating investigator's
      choice based on the clinical circumstances. After completing treatment, patients will be
      monitored for side effects.
