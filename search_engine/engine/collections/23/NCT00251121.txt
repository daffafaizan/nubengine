      information of the min invasive electrophysiological examination, and an offer of volunteer
      participation. Patients given their informed consent are then according to waiting list

      The protocol of the EP stimulation consists of: determination of pacing threshold, pacing
      with 8 asynchronous beats 600ms and an extrasystole with decremental intervals from 550 ms to
      200 ms. The seri is repeated with pacing on 400ms and with two extrasystoles as well as with
