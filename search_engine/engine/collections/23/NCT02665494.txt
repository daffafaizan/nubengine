      function, tumor markers, inflammatory and metabolic state, along with a screening (and, if
      needed, a more in-depth laboratory analysis) for viral hepatitis infections. Information will
      be collected about radiological, clinical and pathological features of the neoplasm at time
      of diagnosis, as well, at a later time, about its natural history. A two-step data analysis
      will be performed: Task-1 analysis will define the risk factors landscape, Task-2 analysis
      will examine the influence of etiology on clinical outcomes. Anonymized data will be stored
      in a central database, kept at the Leading Centre.
