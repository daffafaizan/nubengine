      energy intake. Recent findings from animal and human studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in
      regulating water and salt homeostasis. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce fluid intake after an
      oral salt load or during a meal - pointing to a hypodipsic effect. The aim of this study is
      to elucidate whether these putative hypodipsic properties of GLP-1 analogues reduce fluid
      intake in healthy volunteers compared to placebo assessed during an evaluation visit of 8
      hours.
