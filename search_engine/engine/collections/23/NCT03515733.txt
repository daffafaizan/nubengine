    
      This study uses a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised between-groups design to test
      if adjunctive administration of a serotonin receptor subtype 4 (5HT4) agonist called
      PF-04995274 has positive effects on emotional processing and neural activity in medicated
      treatment-resistant depressed patients. Participants are patients who fulfill criteria for
      current episode of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and have shown lack of response to
      antidepressant treatment, and they will be randomised to receive 7 days treatment with either
      PF-04995274 (15 mg daily) or a matched placebo. Participants will come for a Screening Visit,
      a First Dose Visit, and a Research Visit (including measures of emotional processing and
      non-emotion cognition).
