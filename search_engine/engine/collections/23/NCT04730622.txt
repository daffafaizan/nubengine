      adverse outcomes and mortality is higher in patients affected by osteosarcopenia, a geriatric
      syndrome in which the low bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture deterioration
      (osteopenia/osteoporosis) are combined with a decline in mass, strength, and functional
      capacity of skeletal muscle (sarcopenia).

      The diagnostic workup currently recommended to establish the severity of osteosarcopenia is
      hard to implement in individuals who arrive at the orthopedic emergency department with a
      fragility fracture. On the one hand, the evaluation of motility and physical performance is
      impracticable in bedridden patients; on the other hand, the surgical treatment priority does
      not allow performing all the instrumental investigations required for a proper diagnosis. In
      this context, reliable osteosarcopenia biomarkers could help identify most frail patients and
      plan for them personalized therapeutic interventions to promote postoperative recovery and
      reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.

      Based on the new knowledge on the pathophysiology of osteosarcopenia, the investigators
      designed a small-scale study that aims to preliminarily verify the adequacy of a set of
      clinical and laboratory parameters that could be easily applied in hospitalized patients
      undergoing hip replacement for a fragility fracture. In particular, the investigators planned
      to assess the following:

        -  muscle performance by SARC-F questionnaire (acronym deriving from five domains
           considered in the questionnaire, i.e., strength, assistance with walking, rising from a
           chair, climbing stairs, and falls);

        -  dietary habits through a questionnaire on the intake frequency of food categories;

        -  histological features of osteoporosis and sarcopenia in tissue samples taken from the
           surgical site;

        -  the serum levels of markers associated with muscle-bone cross-talk (Myostatin,
           Insulin-like growth factor 1);

        -  the composition of the gut microbiota.

      The study includes two groups of patients undergoing hip replacement, the first for a
      fragility fracture of the femoral neck (n = 10, cases) and the second for hip osteoarthritis
      (n = 10, controls). As the decrease in muscle function and bone quality is more severe in
      fragility fractures than in osteoarthritis, the investigators expect to find differences in
      laboratory and clinical parameters between the groups.
