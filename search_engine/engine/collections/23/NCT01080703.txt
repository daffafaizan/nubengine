        1. To determine if a lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary
           rehabilitation is effective at increasing quadriceps strength when measured with a hand
           held dynamometer.

        2. To determine the effectiveness of a lower extremity strengthening program as part of
           pulmonary rehabilitation for improving endurance and functional capacity as measured by
           the six minute walk test.

        3. To determine if the lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary
           rehabilitation improves overall quality of life as measured by the St. George's
           Respiratory Questionnaire.

        4. To provide a basic framework for a larger randomized control study evaluating if a lower
           extremity strengthening program as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program is more
           effective than a pulmonary rehabilitation program alone at improving quadriceps
           strength, endurance, and functional level.
