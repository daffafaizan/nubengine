      quality (particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduction) will improve
      respiratory symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and reduce risk of exacerbations in
      former smokers with COPD.

      The investigators will place air pollution monitors in the home to measure the air quality
      over five 1-week periods (at 3 month and 1 week pre-intervention, and 1 week, 3 months and 6
      months post-intervention). During each week of monitoring, the investigators will ask that a
      diary be kept of breathing and how the participants are feeling every day.

      Participant will have 5 home visits and 5 clinic visits and monthly telephone calls during
      this time to see how the participant is feeling. One week after each home visit, the
      monitoring equipment will be picked up. After the 2nd monitoring period, active or sham air
      cleaners will be placed in home.
