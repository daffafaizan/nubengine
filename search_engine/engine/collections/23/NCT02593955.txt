      divided by the number of minutes in bed), as measured by polysomnography. In addition,
      because patients with Parkinson's disease have excessive sleepiness/impaired vigilance
      (alertness) and impaired motor function, and because these might be expected to improve with
      the exercise intervention, this study will also assess vigilance and motor outcomes.
