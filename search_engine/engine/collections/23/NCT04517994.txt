      comprising investigators with expertise in treatment development, efficacy and effectiveness
      research, and implementation science, to simultaneously investigate the effectiveness of
      SAH-C in a military population while identifying any barriers to implementation that would
      need to be addressed before SAH-C could be successfully implemented on a larger scale.

      SAH-C derives from a unique fusion of interventions for trauma and IPA, integrating elements
      of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD,39 couples therapy for PTSD,40 and a cognitive
      behavioral intervention for IPA.41 SAH-C consists of 10 two-hour weekly sessions, co-led by
      two therapists. This was the minimum length deemed necessary to incorporate components
      addressing the proposed IPA mechanisms and is consistent with the briefest IPA
      interventions.42 During each session, couples are provided assignments to practice skills
      together and to assist with the consolidation of material. A group couples format is used
      because group cohesion among clients appears to be associated with IPA prevention.43 Group
      interventions also use less time and resources than individual-based interventions.
