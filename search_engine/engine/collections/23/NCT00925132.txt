      with extended cell cycles unaffected. The investigators propose that this combination of
      decitabine, temozolomide, and panobinostat will target both melanoma stem cells and rapidly
      proliferating melanoma cells. The use of two drugs that regulate gene expression
      epigenetically (panobinostat and decitabine) in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent
      (temozolomide) is hypothesized to:

        -  induce expression genes (e.g., Apaf-1) that increase chemosensitivity of tumor cells and
           enhance apoptosis

        -  potentiate the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide by epigenetic modulation, and

        -  induce proliferation and differentiation of tumor stem cells, thus enabling senescence
           and apoptosis.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To measure overall survival

        -  To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this combination in
           comparison to patients treated historically with DTIC (the current standard of care).

        -  To evaluate treatment response with FDG PET and compare FDG PET with conventional
           imaging for treatment response assessment.
