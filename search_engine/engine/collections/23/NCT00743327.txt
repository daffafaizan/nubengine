    
      Lowering of testosterone levels, by medications or surgery (Androgen Deprivation Therapy or
      ADT), is commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. The adverse effects of low
      testosterone include decreased sex drive, impotence, decreased lean body mass and muscle
      strength, increased fat mass, decreased quality of life and osteoporosis.

      An increase in body fat and decrease in lean body mass may contribute to a decrease in the
      body's ability to use insulin effectively, leading to insulin resistance and diabetes. Low
      testosterone levels are also associated with elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and
      triglycerides.

      Two groups of non-diabetic men will be studied:

        1. Men with known history of prostate cancer who were treated with surgery and/or radiation
           therapy and are now in remission and not receiving androgen deprivation therapy (non-ADT
           group).

        2. Men with newly diagnosed or known history of prostate cancer who are being advised by
           their physicians to begin androgen deprivation therapy (ADT group).

      The non-ADT group and half of the ADT group will be observed for the development of insulin
      resistance/diabetes. The other half of the ADT group will receive a diabetes medication
      called Pioglitazone (Actos) to evaluate any beneficial effects of this medication in the
      prevention of metabolic dysfunction.

      The study will consist of a screening visit and 6 additional study visits throughout one
      year. Procedures during this study include blood draws, MRI, CT, DEXA scan, insulin clamp
      procedures, oral glucose tolerance tests, carotid IMT, pulse wave velocity,
      neuropsychological testing, physical exams and an optional muscle biopsy.
