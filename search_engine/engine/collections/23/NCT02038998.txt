      rocking movement to the patient that ultimately will induce the release of beneficial
      chemicals from the vascular endothelium (the cells lining the inside of the blood vessels).
      Application of pGz in an animal model of stroke resulted in a dramatic reduction of
      associated brain damage.

      This trial will investigate whether stroke patients exposed to pGz experiment significantly
      higher recovery than patients that remained static during their treatment.
