      bandaging is used for treatment of cancer treatment induced lymphedema. Alternatively,
      lifestyle interventions are used as treatment, with focus on physical exercise. However, the
      effects of such interventions are scarcely documented. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
      assess the effect of physical therapy treatment and physical exercise on lymphedema and
      measures of physical performance.

      The study will be performed in a randomized cross-over design, encompassing 26 participants
      with secondary lymphedema related to cancer treatment. Firstly, half of the participants in
      the intervention group will be randomized to a two week rehabilitation programme focusing on
      physical activity while the other half to a rehabilitation programme focusing on physical
      therapy treatment, and the other way around three months later. In addition. there will be a
      control group with cancer related lymphedema not participating in any rehabilitation
      programme. Pre and post of each of the two week rehabilitation periods the following
      measurements will be performed: The magnitude of lymphedema by volume measurements of the
      limbs (by DXA); measurements of maximal strength, range of movement, flexibility, balance,
      physical functionality and questionnaires about perceived health and level of physical
      activity.
