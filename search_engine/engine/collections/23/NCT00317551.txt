      treatment that prevents progression. This study is a double masked placebo controlled block
      randomized clinical trial of two interventions, to treat accommodative factors we have
      identified as being significantly correlated to myopia progression (rather than to the
      presence of myopia). We have shown that the interventions normalise the accommodative
      factors, and this trial examines the effect of these interventions on myopia progression.
