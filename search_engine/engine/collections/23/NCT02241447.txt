      symptoms) will be collected. There will be three phases at each site observation A,
      intervention, observation B. Observation A: In this phase, the nurse identifies cases with
      severe AS and collects their data. Baseline data for each patient will be collected and a
      follow-up will be done after three months for each patient to determine his/her outcome and
      the treatment that was decided on. There will also be an optional telephone follow-up to find
      out the patient's outcome.

      Intervention: In this phase, the physician referring a patient for echocardiography will be
      notified of a finding of severe aortic stenosis: the nurse brings cases with severe AS to the
      attention of the referring physician within a week (via phone, e-mail or letter) to make them
      aware of the diagnosis.

      Baseline and follow-up data will be collected for each patient as before. Moreover, more
      detailed data with regard to the patient's health status will be documented.

      Observation B: Same as Observation Phase A
