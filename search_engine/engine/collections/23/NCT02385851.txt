    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 2-period crossover study in healthy subjects
      to assess PK, PD, and safety (including immunogenicity) of a single 6 mg subcutaneous (SC)
      injection of CHS-1701 compared with a single 6 mg SC dose of Neulasta®.

      After screening, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences;
      CHS-1701 followed by Neulasta® (Sequence A) or Neulasta® followed by CHS-1701, Sequence B).
      Treatments will be spaced by a minimum of 6 weeks apart (but no more than 8 weeks). Subjects
      will be admitted to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit (CPU) on Day -1 (Period 1) and will be
      confined through Hour 96 postdose (a total of approximately 4.5 days and 5 nights). Blood
      samples will be collected at specified time points postdose for plasma PK and PD measurements
      and the subjects will be closely monitored for safety. Following discharge on the morning of
      Day 5 (Period 1) subjects will return to the clinic for additional PK, PD and safety follow
      up--daily through Day 9 and at stated interval time points thereafter.

      The single dose of the alternate blinded study drug will be given after 6 (but no more than
      8) weeks of observation and washout and the above procedures will be repeated (Period 2). A
      Follow up Visit will take place 41 (±1) days after the second dose.
