    
      A Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling
      subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      LD-aminopterin (AMT) (3 mg (six 0.5 mg tablets). Forty-six subjects will be randomized to one
      of two parallel treatment arms: LD-AMT (3 mg) or placebo, in a 1:1 ratio. The endpoint
      analysis will include efficacy and safety. Randomized subjects will initially enter a 14-week
      treatment phase, followed by a 6-week post-treatment phase.
