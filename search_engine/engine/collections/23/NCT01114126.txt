      in a double- blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Following a screening visit, the
      recruited subjects will undergo an inclusion/habituation full night PSG screening recording
      in the sleep clinic to exclude subjects with sleep disorders. Eligible subjects will be
      divided into 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each. Following screening, each cohort will be
      randomised to receive Neu-P11 or placebo for a first period of 5 days and will be crossed
      over following at least 21 days to receive placebo or a higher dose of Neu-P11 for a second
      period of 5 days. Each cohort will receive a different dose of Neu-P11, chosen from 2, 5, 20
      and 50 mg. The starting dose is 5 mg but a smaller dose (2 mg) is also included for the
      purpose of pharmacodynamic evaluation. Before proceeding from 5mg to the next higher dose
      safety will be evaluated based on adverse events, clinical and biological data. Subjects of
      Cohort A will be randomised to dose levels 2 and 3 (doses 5 and 20 mg). Subjects of Cohort B
      will be randomised to dose levels 1 and 4 (doses 2 and 50 mg).
