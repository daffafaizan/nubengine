      healthy individuals who were referred to receive amputee rehabilitation at Hacettepe
      University, Faculty of Health Sciences, department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation,
      Prosthetics and Biomechanics unit, and healthy individuals will be the subjects of this
      study.

      Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age,
      gender, height, body mass will be recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step
      length, time on each foot, ambulation index, gait speed) will evaluate with Gait Trainer
      Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect, participants
      practiced at treadmill to determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants implied the
      preferred speed, they asked to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes. Data was
      recorded between the 4nd and 6th minutes at walk.
