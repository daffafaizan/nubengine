      (sensitivity and specificity) of one or more laboratory developed test (LDT) using
      circulating cell-free fetal nucleic acids from maternal plasma to identify Down syndrome.
      Multiple test modalities are being pursued, including massively parallel sequencing and those
      utilizing differential methylation. The population being studied is women already having a
      diagnostic test (e.g., amniocentesis, CVS) between 10 weeks and 21 weeks 6 days gestation,
      and whose pregnancy is at high risk for having Down syndrome. The women provide informed
      consent. The karyotype will provide the gold standard against which the LDT test is judged.
      Samples and karyotypes will be collected from up to 25 prenatal diagnostic centers around the
      world and tested in several laboratories in the United States. The secondary aim is to
      develop a nucleic acid sample bank to allow documentation of subsequent improvements or new
      methodologies to identify fetal aneuploidy using circulating cell-free fetal nucleic acids.
