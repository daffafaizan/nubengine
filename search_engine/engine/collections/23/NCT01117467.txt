    
      Medical students attending a simulation day will either perform their simulation paired with
      another student from the group or solo. Video data from the scenario and audio data from the
      feedback session will be retained. One week later students will perform a second scenario and
      the feedback following this will be retained. Students will also have a semi-structured
      interview and complete anxiety and empathy questionnaires.
