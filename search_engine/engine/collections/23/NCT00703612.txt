      fast rate that new novel drugs and other therapeutic approaches are required. The purpose of
      this Phase 1/Phase 2 study is to determine whether the intavenous administration of activated
      adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction as a single procedure is safe to and can benefit
      the disease pathology of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (insulin resistance).
      Patients will be observed over 12 months following the procedure, with a 2 week, 1 month and
      then tri monthly diagnostics and life style questionaires.
