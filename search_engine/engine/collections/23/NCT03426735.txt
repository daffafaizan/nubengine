      incidence, although the increase in requests for computed tomography scans where it can
      manage contrasts with a large volume, high osmolality, high-speed injection pumps and even
      with an added electrical load, has caused an increase in this risk and its complications.

      When there is an extravasation of iodinated contrast medium, in most published
      recommendations and guidelines advise local conservative measures, but there is no consensus
      on whether cold or heat should be applied as the first intervention to minimize the
      consequences and favour a rapid resolution.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of heat in the
      extravasations of iodinated contrast, providing the necessary evidence to determine the best
      cure that can be applied in the current circumstances of administration, by injection pumps
      at high speeds and large volumes.
