      a need for bone augmentation in the posterior upper jaw. The bone grafting materials will be
      placed into the sinus cavity,(a routine procedure), one material randomly at each side and a
      micro-implant will be inserted simultaneously. 9 months later the micro-implant is removed
      and a regular Straumann SLActive implant is inserted. The micro-implant is evaluated
      histologically. The site is evaluated every 12 months for 3 years in regards to clinical
      measurements. The study hypothesis is that the SBC is not worse than BioOss.

      Study design: Prospective, randomized, open, controlled, single center, split mouth

      Study population: 11 male and female patients at an age of between 18 and 80 years, affected
      by edentulism of both lateral-posterior maxilla and presenting two pneumatized maxillary
      sinuses and necessitating rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses will be recruited
      in the study and treated by means of maxillary sinus floor augmentation and delayed implant
      placement.
