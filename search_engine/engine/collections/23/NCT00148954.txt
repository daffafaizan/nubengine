      delivered for Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) episodes using VITALITY 2 devices with
      Rhythm IDâ„¢ to that of ICDs employing other rhythm discrimination algorithms. Appropriateness
      of therapies will be assessed after independent adjudication of all VT/VF events leading to
      therapy. Comparisons will be made between device manufacturers across patient populations
      receiving either a dual- or single-chamber device.
