    
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of canagliflozin and metformin IR when
      administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of
      canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) tablets (ie, canagliflozin and metformin IR contained in the same tablet) (Treatment
      B). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to
      receive Treatment A followed by Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a
      washout period of approximately 15 days between treatments.
