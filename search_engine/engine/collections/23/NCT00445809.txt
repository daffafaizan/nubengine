    
      Approximately 350 adults scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery involving the use of
      cardiopulmonary bypass will be enrolled. Blood samples will be obtained from all patients in
      the study for future measurement of both plasma NGAL and plasma creatinine levels in the same
      sample at each of nine time points.

      Blood samples for later assessment using the Triage NGAL Test will be processed to plasma at
      the clinical site, frozen and shipped to Biosite for storage. Testing with the Triage NGAL
      Test will be conducted at Biosite by trained laboratory personnel. The results of these
      assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study and will not impact the
      medical management of the patient.

      The medical team caring for each study patient should obtain clinical laboratory tests per
      their usual post-operative routine and manage the patient accordingly. Any serum creatinine
      measurements obtained by the site as part of this routine care both pre-operatively and
      through Day 10 post-operatively will be recorded as well as any additional post-operative
      renal insults, the development of oliguria, the need for a nephrology consultation,
      initiation of dialysis and mortality will also be recorded through Day 10.
