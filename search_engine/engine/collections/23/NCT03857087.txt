      I. To determine the feasibility and utility of 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging patients with ovarian
      cancer.

      II. Determine detection sensitivity for nodal metastases for PSMA PET stratified by node
      size.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between targeted molecular uptake of 68Ga-PSMA PET and PSMA
      expression in surgical resection specimens.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore heterogeneity of 68Ga-PSMA PET uptake in cases of metastatic ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine the relationship between 68Ga-PSMA PET uptake, diffusion weighted imaging,
      and MRI-derived tumor perfusion.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes. After
      about 60 minutes, patients undergo PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for approximately
      over 50-60 minutes. Patients may undergo an optional repeat gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 PET
      between 8 and 12 weeks after completion of the first PET/MRI.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 28 days.
