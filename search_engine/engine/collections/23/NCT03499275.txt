      'active' or 'sham/placebo' NMES for six weeks. Patients will also complete a home exercise
      programme and receive advice on how to manage breathlessness. Clinical outcomes and trial
      flow after this six week programme and six weeks after patients have stopped using NMES will
      be assessed. After this point, healthcare resource use during the study period will be
      evaluated and interviews involving participants, their carers, and staff about their
      experiences of the study and using or delivering NMES will be conducted.
