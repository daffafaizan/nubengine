    
      This is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, multicenter, dose escalation, double-masked, placebo
      controlled study consisting of two stages. In Stage I, 3 cohorts are planned to evaluate
      escalating doses of RU 101 ophthalmic solution, instilled 6 times daily into each eye for 4
      weeks (28 days). Each cohort will comprise 4 patients randomized 3:1 to RU-101 or placebo. A
      masked safety data review will be performed prior to each dose escalation to determine if any
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred and to define the MTD or highest dose to be used in
      Stage II. In Stage II, an expanded cohort will receive the dose defined in Stage I (MTD or
      highest dose if MTD is not reached), instilled 6 times daily into each eye for 12 weeks (84
      days). The expanded cohort will comprise approximately 96 patients randomized 1:1 to RU-101
      or placebo, provided in a double-masked manner.
