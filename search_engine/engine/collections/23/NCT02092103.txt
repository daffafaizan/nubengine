      subject of controversy and debate for many years. It has been until recently the standard
      practice in ob/gyn to clamp the umbilical cord immediately post delivery to allow for
      immediate transition resuscitation of the neonate, especially in preterm infants. Due to the
      fact that optimal timing for cord clamping has yet to be definitively established in the
      preterm population, more information is needed. Immediate cord clamping, however, could
      preclude the infant from an extra boost in blood volume that may prove beneficial later in
      the newborn life. Directly comparing the recently recommended practice of delayed umbilical
      cord clamping to milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping has the potential to prove
      beneficial for the neonates in question, as well as change daily obstetrical practices. In
      this study all infants below 34 weeks will be randomized into one of two groups: delayed cord
      clamping and milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping. The decision was made not to
      include immediate cord clamping due to a recent American Congress of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation that all preterm infants have their cord clamping be
      delayed. Their outcomes will be measured by serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels while in
      the NICU, the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, incidence of intraventricular
      hemorrhage, and the need for neonatal blood transfusions.
