      of services sought by both men and women each year. Among these procedures, rhinoplasty
      remains one of the most popular surgeries, ranking in the top three most performed cosmetic
      surgical procedures according to the 2017 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report. A key factor in
      determining the success of rhinoplasty is overall patient satisfaction. Although many
      patient-reported outcomes tools have been developed in this space, there is a paucity of
      research aimed at understanding how physicians can improve patient satisfaction in this
      patient population. Moreover, strategies to address the psychologic and coping ability for
      patients undergoing facial plastic surgery have not been investigated. To better provide
      patient-centered care, physicians should seek to understand the psychosocial impact of
      perceived nasal deformity and identify patients who may benefit from additional support
      interventions to complement current rhinoplasty treatment plans.

      This is a prospective repeated measures study examining psychosocial status as measured by
      validated psychometric instruments. The intervention group will participate in mindfulness
      meditation using a phone application. Assessment of social functioning and quality of life
      will be conducted using survey instruments.
