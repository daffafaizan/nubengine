    
      New onset type 1 DM patients who present at William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak or to the
      Pediatric Endocrine Clinic will be approached about the study at their presentation and time
      will be given for the patient and family to discuss and ask questions regarding the study.
      Patients will then be enrolled following informed consent. Glucose levels and insulin
      requirements will be monitored continuously from the faxed weekly logbooks from the point of
      diagnosis for 3 months (as standard practice for all newly diagnosed diabetic patients in our
      clinic). At the baseline visit a Vitamin D level will be drawn and frozen for 3 months prior
      to processing. .After 3 months vitamin D, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus and other
      standard of care lab draws will be done. Approximately an additional 3 tsp of blood will be
      taken. All female subjects of child bearing potential will have a pregnancy test done. EMLA
      cream to anesthetize the area will be used prior to blood draw. A vitamin D level of <30
      ng/ml is considered insufficient and the patient will then be given vitamin D supplement. The
      vitamin D level, calcium, alkaline phosphatase and phosphorus will be rechecked at 6 months
      (additional 3 tsp of blood) . Glucose levels and insulin requirements will be monitored
      continuously from the faxed weekly logbooks again for another 3 months.
