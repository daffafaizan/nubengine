      circulation are readily collected by apheresis, and may be used for several purposes. They
      are used for allogeneic and autologous transplantation and are often manipulated in various
      ways depending on the goal of the transplant. Gene therapy for immunodeficiencies relies on
      the collection of these cells.

      Traditionally, mobilization has been done using granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF). However not all patients or normal donors respond to GCSF alone. Plerixafor, a
      recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, has a unique mode of action
      distinct from that of GCSF, but also results in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitors
      into the circulation, allowing their collection by standard apheresis. The quality of these
      cells for transduction using viral vectors in anticipation of gene therapy uses has not been
      thoroughly assessed, and there are theoretical considerations why vectors that use various
      envelopes for cell binding may be affected by the use of this CXCR4 antagonist. In order to
      be able to assess the transduction and engraftment of these cells in murine models, we will
      perform collection and mobilization on 5 healthy volunteers at the NIH Clinical Center using
      the FDA approved medications G-CSF and plerixafor.
