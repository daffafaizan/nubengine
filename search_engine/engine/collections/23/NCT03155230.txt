      activity-related chronic postoperative inguinal pain following bilateral TAPP in an all-male
      Danish setting. Impaired sexual activity and sleep disturbance due to pain was also recorded.
      Data based on nationwide consecutive patients undergoing bilateral TAPP. Data collected for
      the Danish Inguinal Hernia Database, hospital files and the National Patient Registry
      (Denmark).
