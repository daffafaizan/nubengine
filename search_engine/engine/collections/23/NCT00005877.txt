      progression after maximal response in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer
      treated with oral nitrocamptothecin. II. Determine the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics
      of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after completion of course
      8 may receive additional courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-45 patients will be accrued for this study over less than
      1 year.
