      to determine the vividness of visual imagery. The purpose of this study is to translate and
      cross-culturally adapt the VMIQ-2 instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric
      properties. One hundred fifty healthy participants will be included. For cross-cultural
      adaptation, two bi-lingual translators will use the back-translation procedure. Within a
      5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants will complete the Turkish
      version of VMIQ (VMIQ-2-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (Î±) will use
      to assess internal consistency. The correlation with the Turkish version of Kinesthetic and
      Visual Imagery Questionnaire-20 will be determined to check the validity.
