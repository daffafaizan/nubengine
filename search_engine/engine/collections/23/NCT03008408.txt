    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the addition of ribociclib (LEE011) to everolimus and letrozole improves
      progression free survival in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine clinical benefit and the median duration of progression-free survival (PFS)
      and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma
      treated with ribociclib (LEE011), everolimus and letrozole versus everolimus and letrozole
      alone.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with ribociclib
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole in this cohort of patients.

      III. To determine the presence of a CTNNB1 mutation is associated with response to ribociclib
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole.

      IV. To determine if liquid biopsies at baseline and 8 weeks correlate with presence of a
      tissue mutation or response to therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ribociclib in patients with
      advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD), everolimus PO QD, and
      letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus PO QD and letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.
