      workers who rotate night shift work, and to examine the influences of different frequencies
      and timings of supplementation on the health effects. Night shift work affects melatonin and
      cortisol variation, insomnia, mood issues, and metabolic syndrome. Short-term tryptophan
      supplementation was shown to improve melatonin, sleep quality, and cortisol response to acute
      stress. Little is known whether a longer term of longer-term tryptophan supplementation would
      alleviate the health impacts of night shift work. Nevertheless, melatonin and cortisol have
      their normal circadian patterns. Nothing is known about what temporal structure of tryptophan
      supplement would maximize its health effects on night shift workers melatonin and cortisol
      levels. We will conduct a double-blind cross-over randomized controlled trial to examine the
      benefits of oral tryptophan administration (3g/day, t.i.d.) on night shift workers' health
      outcomes: melatonin and cortisol levels, sleep quality, moods and work performance. We expect
      to reveal the health effect of tryptophan supplementation in night shift workers by using
      sophisticated study design.
