      and small bowels). Some patients with CD may get swelling of the intestinal tract
      (inflammation) or scarring of the intestinal tract (fibrosis). Fibrosis develops because of
      chronic injury. Both inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) can cause the bowel to
      narrow, which can lead to the bowel becoming blocked. The long-term goal of this project is
      to develop new noninvasive radiology imaging tests that can show the difference between bowel
      wall inflammation and fibrosis. Currently there are no imaging tests that can do this
      reliably.

      Current imaging methods (CT and MRI) that are ordered to help diagnose and follow-up CD are
      excellent at showing inflammation, but are not accurate for finding fibrosis. CT also exposes
      patients to small amounts of radiation, and both CT and MRI are costly. We are therefore
      studying ultrasound imaging, as it is more cost-effective and does not expose patients to
      radiation. CEUS uses microbubbles in a solution that are injected into a vein in one of the
      arms. This allows doctors to see the blood flow to parts of the body. This microbubble
      contrast agent (dye) is called Optison. Another imaging method, called shear wave
      elastography, uses sound waves to noninvasively measure the stiffness of structures in the
      body.

      It is important to be able to tell the difference between inflammation and fibrosis in
      Crohn's disease, because narrowing of the bowel due to inflammation generally responds well
      to medications, whereas narrowing caused by fibrosis does not respond well to medications and
      may require surgery.
