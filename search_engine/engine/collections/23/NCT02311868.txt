      responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms and generation of p-cresol, a uremic toxin, that
      has been associated to cardiovascular mortality.

      This double blind randomized placebo controlled pilot study evaluates whether
      Probinul-neutro®, a synbiotic preparation that normalizes intestinal microflora, may lower
      plasma p-cresol concentrations and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in hemodialysis patients.

      Thirty patients on hemodialysis were randomized to receive either Probinul neutro® or placebo
      for four weeks. Total plasma p-cresol concentrations was assessed at baseline, and 15 and 30
      days after treatment start. At the same study times, ease and frequency of defecation, upper
      and lower abdominal pain, stool shape, borborygmi and flatus were quantified by subjective
      assessment questionnaires.
