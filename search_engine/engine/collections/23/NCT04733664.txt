    
      This is a pilot, single site, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and performance of the FAST plasma volume (PV) Technology in dialysis patients.

      Administration of VFI will occur within 28 days of screening.

      Patients will receive 1 dose of VFI and 1 dose of iohexol approximately 4 hours prior to
      undergoing dialysis followed by a second dose of visible fluorescent injectate (VFI) and
      iohexol approximately 1 hour after completing dialysis. Patients will be discharged following
      completion of Day 1 activities. Patients will be seen and evaluated on their next 2 dialysis
      sessions for any adverse reaction by answering questions about their health, approximately on
      Day 3 and Day 8. A follow-up phone call will be performed on Day 31 (Â± 1 day).
