      To iteratively test VME to teach correct use of metered dose inhaler (MDIs) and dry-powder
      DiskusÂ® devices to hospitalized patients with Asthma or COPD. We partnered with software
      development companies to develop VME modules that (self)-assess and teach respiratory inhaler
      technique to hospitalized participants. We have tested the VME in focus groups. Now that the
      VME is developed we will iteratively pilot test (n=30-40) the VME strategy (up to 3 rounds
      (90-120 total)) to obtain important patient feedback,preferences and preliminary efficacy
      estimates for the module.

      We hypothesize that participants' post-VME inhaler technique will be significantly better
      than their pre-VME inhaler technique.
