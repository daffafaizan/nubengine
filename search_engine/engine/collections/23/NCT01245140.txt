    
      Palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP) is an inflammatory skin disease affecting palms and soles. The
      disease is considered as a sub-form of psoriasis and presents with sterile pustules of the
      palms and the soles. This study investigates the efficacy of alitretinoin in patients who
      have not responded to topical drugs (e.g., steroid creams), who are suffering for at least 6
      month from the condition and whose disease severity is confirmed by a score.
