      randomized to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture (needle insertion 1 cm away from
      acupuncture site). Patients will be blinded to whether they are receiving acupuncture or sham
      acupuncture. The acupuncturist is blinded as to the patient response. The patients will
      undergo venupuncture to draw blood to determine sertotonin and beta-endorphin levels. They
      will receive treatment in 12 sessions over 4 weeks. They will maintain a diary during this
      time period to document level of pain and frequency of bowel movements. Blood will be drawn
      at week 2 and 4 and, 6 weeks after cessation of treatment, subjects will again record
      abdominal symptoms and frequency of bowel movements for 2 weeks. Blood will be drawn for
      hormone levels at 8 weeks after completion of study.
