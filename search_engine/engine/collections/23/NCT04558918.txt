      trial is to determine whether LNP023 is efficacious and safe for the treatment in PNH through
      demonstration of superiority of LNP023 compared to anti-C5 antibody treatment in adult PNH
      patients presenting with residual anemia despite treatment with anti-C5 therapy.

      The study is planned to randomize approx. 91 patients in various countries.
