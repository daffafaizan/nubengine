    
      We will prospectively assess the utilization of Desmopressin in improving nocturnal enuresis
      in patients after radical cystectomy with orthotopic bladder reconstruction.

      Patients after radical cystectomy with neobladder reconstruction will be given Desmopressin
      0.1 mg once a day for a duration of one month.

      Before beginning treatment patients will be given the NNES-Q questionnaire to assess severity
      of nocturnal enuresis.

      At the end of treatment, the same questionnaire will be given to all patients to assess if
      nocturnal enuresis improved.

      Sodium levels will be tested before treatment, 2 weeks after beginning treatment and at the
      end of treatment.
