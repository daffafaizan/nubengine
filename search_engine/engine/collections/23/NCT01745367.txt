      for subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either tivozanib hydrochloride and weekly paclitaxel or
      placebo and weekly paclitaxel.

      Subjects will be stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
      score (0 vs 1) and line of treatment (first vs second).

      All subjects will be evaluated for progression free survival and overall survival as well as
      safety and tolerability. Biomarker and pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis are also included in
      study. This study will determine whether tivozanib hydrocholoride combined with weekly
      paclitaxel improves clinical outcomes in patients with triple negative breast cancer.
