    
      Subjects are selected at an outpatient clinic specialised in the diagnosis of tolerance to
      altitude, where the chemoreflex is analyzed during a bicycle exercise performed with a oxygen
      deprived air simulating a 8000 meters altitude.

      All subjects will go later to high altitude for trekking usually. The patients are those
      subjects with an altered chemoreflex who exhibited cerebral edema or pulmonary edema during
      the trekking.

      The controls are the subjects with a normal chemoreflex who did not exhibit any trouble
      during their journey.

      Fourty subjects of each group are included. A blood sample is withdrawn and studied for
      succinate dehydrogenase genes in a blind fashion.

      After completing the inclusion the allelic mutations will be compared in the two groups.
