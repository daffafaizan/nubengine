      disease prevention and treatment, more than one thousand years ago (652 AD). Many of the
      acupoints adopted in Chinese pediatric Tuina are located on children's fingers, hands and
      arms, which are unique if it is compared with those for adult tuina. The manipulation is
      found to be easily accepted by children, as the strength of tuina is gentle and soft. No
      severe adverse reaction in regards of Chinese pediatric Tuina was reported, the mild adverse
      reaction such as skin abrasion can be completely avoided with correct operating instructions.
      However, it is still lack of high quality RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) to evaluate its
      efficacy. The main obstacle is the difficulty to conduct a valid sham Tuina comparison group.
      In order to solve this problem, the investigators designed a device for sham Tuina, with a
      Cloak Shaped cover which is opaque and big enough to cover the whole body and arms of a child
      who is under 6 years old. Two narrow holes are required on the cover, so that the therapist's
      hands can touch the child through these holes. The whole manipulation process will be
      invisible under the cover.The investigators aim to detect whether it is effective as a sham
      device for pediatric Tuina researches.
