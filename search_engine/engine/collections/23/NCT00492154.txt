    
      We will evaluate the x-ray films of children that at the time of the injury were between the
      ages 1 day and 12 years. The selection of the x-ray films will be done based on the specific
      codes of the wrist x-rays (Ulna or Radius).

      The evaluation will be merely to children that were treated in our hospital from 1996 to
      2000.We are aiming to find cases when the fractures were healed with 1cm or more of
      shortening of one of the forearm's bones (Radius or Ulna).

      We are going to compare these cases with another 20 patients with the same characteristics as
      the latter groups on the exception that their fractures were healed without shortening. The
      two groups will be matched by age, gender and the same diagnosis.

      These patients will be summoned to the clinic when they are adult in respect to the skeletal
      maturity. The patients will be evaluated, including clinical examination of the hand wrists
      (left and right), motion rang, motor muscle function, description of abnormalities if there
      are and x-ray of both wrists.
