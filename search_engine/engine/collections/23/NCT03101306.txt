      radiotherapy (25 fractions) followed by a MR guided brachytherapy boost or external beam
      boost (further 10 fractions.) They will be treated with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 if
      clinically appropriate.

      As part of standard treatment patients have a staging MR scan at diagnosis, a radiotherapy
      planning CT and an MR scan in the 4th week of treatment. Cone beam imaging will also be
      performed. Response will be assessed as standard with a MR scan at 3 months.

      As part of the study patients will undergo 3 additional MR scans. These will take place in
      the 1st, 2nd and 5th weeks of treatment. Extra sequences will be added to the clinical
      mid-point scan in the 4th week of treatment. These MR scans will include anatomical images -
      with full and empty bladder as well as cine data (with a scan every minute for 10 minutes) to
      assess intra fraction motion. They will also include a DWI sequence, which will be used to
      assess if early prediction of response is possible. The frequency of cone beam imaging will
      be increased from approximately 10 scans as standard of care to 25 scans to allow for daily
      imaging.

      The 1st MR scan will be contoured to outline clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs. A
      variety of planning strategies will be developed including standard planning target volume
      (PTV) margins, a plan of the day (POTD) approach, a POTD+ as well as an online adaptation
      model. These models will be used to assess coverage of CTV and PTV as well as dose to OARs
      using the scans obtained during the radiotherapy treatment. The practicality of each approach
      will also be assessed. Inter and intra fraction organ motion will also be analysed in order
      to develop patient specific models.
