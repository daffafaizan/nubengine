    
      ABI-007-PST-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study to assess the
      safety , tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding brain tumors). The Phase 1
      portion of the study, with a dose escalation design, ended and the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) was determined as 240 mg/m^2 intravenously (IV) in patients weighing > 10 kg and 11.5
      mg/kg in patients weighing â‰¤ 10 kg, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The Phase 2
      portion of the study will enroll additional patients at the RP2D into 1 of 3 solid tumor
      groups [neuroblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing's sarcomas]. Both phases of the study are
      open-label and conducted at multiple centers.

      The Phase 2 is using a Simon 2-stage design to monitor patient enrollment for each group
      separately. The rhabdomyosarcoma group, neuroblastoma or Ewing's sarcoma groups did not reach
      the expected number of 2 responders out of 14 efficacy eligible patients. Consequently, the
      groups were stopped.
