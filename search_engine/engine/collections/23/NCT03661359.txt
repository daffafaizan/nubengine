      improvement study that will look at patients 18 years of age and older who are admitted under
      the trauma and general surgery specialties. Patients will be identified through admission to
      the trauma or general surgery service or referred to surgery services.

      Eligible patients will be identified and approached by the study team. Once the informed
      consent is completed, patients will be given a Social Determinants of Health Screening Tool,
      an Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Feedback Tool, and an
      short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Questionnaire. Feedback from the Hospital
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems results will be given immediately to
      the relevant teams (nurses, doctors, etc.) to address the patient's concerns. Prior to
      discharge, the patients will also be given referrals to designated community resources. On
      day 15 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the patients will receive a follow up phone call where
      they will be asked if they have utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals.
      Participants will also be given a second Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers
      and Systems Feedback Survey at this time. On day 30 (+/- 7 days) after discharge, the
      patients will receive a follow up phone call where the participants will be asked if they
      utilized the Social Determinants of Health Referrals. Participants will also be given a
      second short form health survey (SF-12) Quality of Life Survey at this time.
