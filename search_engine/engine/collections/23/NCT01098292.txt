      baseline data and biospecimens. Potential participants will be scheduled for an eligibility
      screening session. Following screening, potentially eligible participants will complete a
      baseline phenotyping session, and biospecimen collections, which together are expected to
      take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed
      during the clinic visit.
