      IC-8 IOL following the removal of the KAMRA inlay. The refractive target of the IC-8 eye will
      be -0.75 D MRSE.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and consented before enrolled. Following
      enrollment, the inlay will be removed, and the eye will be monitored for corneal and
      refractive stability before the implantation of the IC-8 IOL. Corneal stability is defined as
      keratometry readings in each meridian within ± 0.50 D, and/or the stability of the corneal
      topography as determined by the principal investigator, over two consecutive visits at least
      two weeks apart. Refractive stability is defined as manifest refractive sphere and cylinder
      measurements that are each within ± 0.50 D over two consecutive visits at least two weeks
      apart, or based on investigator judgment. When corneal and refractive stability are achieved,
      the IC-8 IOL will be implanted following cataract extraction by phacoemulsification.
