      accepted that distraction can be effective in pain reduction. This randomised controlled
      trial will explore the effect of intra operative hand reflexology on pain perception and
      anxiety during office-based surgery under local anaesthetic. Participants will be randomly
      allocated to either the experimental condition, in which they will receive a hand reflexology
      during treatment, or control condition in which they will receive usual standard care.
      Immediate and longer term outcomes will be explored.

      Eight weeks after surgery, participants will return to the clinic for a follow up
      appointment. While they are in the waiting area they will be asked to complete a short
      questionnaire to assess time taken to return to pre surgical levels of functioning, pain
      experienced in the first four weeks after surgery, severity of venous symptoms and
      satisfaction with treatment.
