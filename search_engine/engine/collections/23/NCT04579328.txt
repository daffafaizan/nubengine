      Catholic Relief Services. The program aims to improve child nutrition, in part, through
      behavior change messaging. Parents have difficulty understanding that stunting is a problem
      because the high prevalence (57%) means the entire population curve has shifted to the left -
      a stunted child appears normal when compared to others in the community.

      Through previous work, we have designed a wall-hanging like a life-size, color coded growth
      chart. Using 2 stage sampling, with parents clustered in neighbor groups, neighbor groups
      have been randomly assigned to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard
      lessons on stunting while only the intervention group will have the growth mats incorporated
      into the lessons. After 3 months of exposure to the lessons, parents will be tested on their
      understanding of the key lesson points. Scores between groups will be tested for statistical
      differences. Qualitative focus groups throughout the intervention period will collect
      information on perception of the message delivery and the utility of the growth mats.
