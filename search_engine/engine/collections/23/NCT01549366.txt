    
      This is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical
      outcome of subjects with degenerative disc disease (DDD) (defined as back pain of discogenic
      origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies) and/or
      spondylolisthesis utilizing either Aspen Spinous Process Fixation System or Pedicle Screws
      for supplemental posterior instrumentation as an adjunct to an anterior or lateral approach
      to lumbar interbody fusion.

      The primary hypothesis is that change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of subjects in the
      study group (Aspen) will be non-inferior to the control group (pedicle screw
      instrumentation). The non-inferiority margin is pre-specified to be 10 ODI score points. If
      the non-inferiority is established, superiority of Aspen to the control will be tested.

      The study will involve up to 25 investigational sites. Enrollment is expected to take
      approximately 24 months. Subjects will be followed for 2 years, with the anticipated duration
      of the study being approximately 4 years from start to finish.
