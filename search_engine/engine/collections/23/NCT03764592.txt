      patients (N=25) age between 16-70 years old to determine values and limitations of
      non-invasive mapping using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) in identifying VF substrates
      as target sites for catheter ablations in patients with Brugada (BrS) and Early
      repolarization syndromes (ERS) and also determine the mechanisms of VF in BrS and ERs
      syndromes.
