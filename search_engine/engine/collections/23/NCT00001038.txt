      patients with advanced HIV disease, although there is evidence that high doses of the drug
      may extend survival. Valacyclovir, a prodrug that is rapidly converted to acyclovir after
      oral administration, has a higher absorption rate and may therefore provide inhibitory
      activity against CMV.

      Patients are randomized to receive BW 256U87 alone or acyclovir alone as control at either
      high-dose or low-dose. The acyclovir controls will provide suppressive therapy for herpes
      simplex infections and may affect survival.
