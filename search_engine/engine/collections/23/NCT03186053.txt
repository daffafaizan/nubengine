      protection in patients undergoing valve surgery Methods: 250 patients undergoing valve
      surgery were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. 5g creatine
      phosphate was dissolved in 50ml saline solution. After induction of anesthesia, the patients
      were first given a load dose of 1g, 20min (30ml / h) , And then pumped at a rate of 1 g / h
      (10 ml / h). The control group was treated with saline in the same manner. The cTnI level was
      measured at the corresponding time points. Hemodynamic indexes and postoperative
      complications were recorded.
