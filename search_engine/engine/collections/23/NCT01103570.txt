      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group (1) was
      evaluated by cholecyst-cholangiography by puncture through the gall bladder fundus. Group (2)
      was evaluated for the standard cystic duct cholangiography.Cholangiography was considered
      successful if it could be performed with complete delineation of the biliary tree with flow
      of the dye through the duodenum occurred. It is to be noted that inability to cannulate the
      cystic duct for example, is considered a failure.
