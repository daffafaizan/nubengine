      from the lumbar facet joints will be recruited in clinic. The clinicians will rate the
      likelihood clinically of facet joint origin of pain and will assign a theoretical treatment
      plan based on initial clinical impression. They will indicate which facet joints, if any,
      they would refer for percutaneous treatment. The patients will undergo and FDG PET/MRI of the
      lumbar spine with IV gadolinium. The MRI signal change and enhancement of the lumbar facet
      joints will be graded by 2 radiologists blinded to the clinical data. The FDG PET scan
      activity of the facet joints will be graded by two nuclear medicine radiologists blinded to
      the clinical information. The clinicians will then be segmentally unblended to the imaging
      data as follows: 1. facet joints with high grade MRI signal change, 2. facet joints with any
      MRI signal change, 3. facet joints with high grade PET activity, and 4. facet joints with any
      PET activity. At each of these 4 steps, the clinician will indicate if this information would
      have the potential to alter clinical care (assuming that the imaging biomarker in question
      would be a surrogate for inflammation and pain) and if the information is concordant to the
      clinical impression. The clinical course of each patients will be followed for 1 year after
      undergoing the PET/MRI examination.
