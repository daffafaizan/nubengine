      transplantation (LT). Detection of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease can be critical
      to improve patient survival. Liquid biopsy is a revolutionary technique that is opening
      previously unexpected perspectives. It consists of circulating extracellular vesicles,
      nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and circulating tumor cells. The detection and isolation of
      circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes, as a source of genomic and
      proteomic information in patients with cancer. Regarding these promising and potential
      transformative tools, as well as the issues still needed to be addressed for adopting various
      liquid biopsy approaches into clinical practice. This study aims to develop a novel,
      reliable, liquid biopsy-based biomarker system for relapse of HCC associated with hepatitis B
      after liver transplantation.
