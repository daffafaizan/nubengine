      oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) diffuse and how rebreathing of CO2 in addition to mild
      hypoxia influence standardized physiological parameters in two scenarios: Fresh air and no
      fresh air delivered into the air pocket. The project is a field study designed to measure and
      document gas diffusion through snow. The outcome measures are: (1) Concentration of O2 and
      CO2 in the air pocket and 50 cm from the pocket. (2) Time interval for development of
      threshold values for concentration of O2 and CO2. The investigators will also monitor
      physiologic measures such as: Electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous invasive blood pressure,
      cerebral oximetry, continuous pulse oximetry, transthoracic impedance, and gas content in
      expired air. Subjective evaluation of comfort will also be scored. Twenty healthy young
      volunteers with written consent to participate will be used as test subjects.

      The study may have a clinical consequence for better outcome, for victims of avalanches by
      providing additional air or oxygen close to the patient. We will also measure specific body
      measures and spirometry.
