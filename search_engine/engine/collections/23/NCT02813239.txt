      mature oocytes retrieved in patients with more than 50% immature oocytes in a previous IVF
      cycle triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) compared to the rate of mature
      oocytes retrieved in subsequent cycles, triggered with both gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHa) and (hCG). The main outcome measure was the number and percentage of mature
      oocytes retrieved.
