    
      This will be a randomized, cross-over, unblinded study with subjects randomized upon entry
      into the study to either begin using the Klue software for 6 weeks or to continue with their
      usual care for 6 weeks. Subjects are eligible for enrollment if they are using a continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pumps or an insulin pen with memory and CGM, are missing or
      late in giving at least 4 food boluses in the previous two weeks, and they have an iPhone.
      Missing or late meal boluses will be assessed through their pump/pen and sensor downloads.
      This is a pilot study. The investigators do not have preliminary data to do a true power
      calculation. The primary outcome will be the change in the number of missed meal boluses in
      the two weeks prior to each visit. Secondary outcome measures will be the number of missed
      meal boluses in each month of the study, change in HbA1c levels (measured every 6 weeks),
      accuracy of the Klue software in detecting meals (true positive and false positive rates),
      and a user satisfaction survey.
