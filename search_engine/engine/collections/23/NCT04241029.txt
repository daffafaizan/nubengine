      However, one third of patients receiving such treatment will not reach remission. Studies
      have demonstrated that the gut microbiome influences the cytokine response and in particular
      the TNF production. In this study we aim to manipulate the gut microbiome in patients with
      ulcerative colitis not responding to anti-TNF therapy to evaluate potential beneficial
      effects.

      20 UC patients with insufficient response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy
      upon routine evaluation colonoscopy 6-12 months after start of treatment will receive
      intervention with the probiotic formula IDOFORM TravelÂ®, 4 capsules daily for 8 weeks. A
      colonoscopy will be performed at baseline (week 0) and after intervention (week8). Gut
      biopsies, fecal samples and serological markers will, in addition to clinical examination and
      endoscopic results, be used to evaluate the safety and possible beneficial effects of the
      intervention.

      In a subsidiary cross-sectional study, 20 UC patients on anti-TNF therapy in remission upon
      evaluation colonoscopy will serve as controls. 20 individuals with no history of inflammatory
      bowel disease will be recruited as healthy controls.
