      non-consecutive weeks per years or symptoms of chronic urticaria for at least 6 weeks will be
      asked to complete the case report forms asking for details of symptom characteristics, risk
      factors, personal habits, underlying diseases, and quality of life at the first visit.
      Investigation results, final diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions will also be recorded
      by the responsible allergist. On every follow-up appointment, patient symptoms, aggravating
      factors, medication use and side effects will be completed by patients. New findings,
      associated diseases, and prescriptions will be completed by allergist. The unfilled variables
      by patients will be asked in the following visit. Any "non-reported" variables those are
      unable to retrieve will be treated as missing data for data analysis. The estimated sample
      size is about 200 new cases per year.

      Patient demographic data, clinical presentations, and associated diseases will be reported.
      The association between clinical characteristics and quality of life will be analyzed. The
      relationship between clinical manifestations and therapeutic outcomes will be determined.
