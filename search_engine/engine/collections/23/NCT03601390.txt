    
      Newly-diagnosed patients with stage III or IV non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (AJCC
      7th) will be recruited. All subjects receiving chemoradiotherapy will undergo a baseline
      integrated [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scan or traditional follow-up examination and plasma EBV DNA test before
      the start of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients receiving IMRT treatment will receive a dedicated FDG PET/CT protocol 12 weeks after
      the end of chemoradiotherapy (primary endpoint).Plasma EBV DNA test will be performed 4, 12,
      24 weeks after the end of IMRT treatment. In patients with negative PET/CT results, 2
      follow-up visits are required to complement nasopharyngoscope examination and plasma EBV DNA
      test in the frist year. All patients will undergo annual PET/CT or traditional follow-up
      examination and plasma EBV DNA test 1 year after completing chemoradiation unless
      recurrent/residual disease is histopathologically-confirmed.

      Patients with a PET/CT result suspecting for residual/recurrent/metastatic tumor must have
      pathological and/or clinical evidence of tumor existence before salvage therapy is started.
