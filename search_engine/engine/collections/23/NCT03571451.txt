      world. Patients on PD have a similar long-term survival rate as patients on hemodialysis,
      with a much lower cost of medical resources. Therefore, increasing the percentage of patients
      on PD may relieve the increasing financial burden for the whole society.

      Of note, technique survival and patient survival in PD still need to be improved. Based on
      results from multi-center cohort studies, some prognostic factors have been explored and
      intervened in recent years. However, robust data from large samples on potential predictors
      pertaining to patients' clinical characteristics, and PD practice on clinical outcomes in the
      real world is still limited. This phenomenon calls an action on exploring novel risk factors
      of patient outcome, especially through national-level prospective cohort study.

      The investigators are developing a national-level PD database by registering all patients
      receiving PD on PD TAP. The study is underway in 27 hospitals from 14 provinces located at 7
      geographical regions (northwest, northeast, north, central, southwest, southeast and south)
      in China. National samples of PD units are recruited based on the availability of
      professional PD team who is willing participant and could regularly follow participants. Our
      study aims to enroll adult 7,000 patients with end stage renal disease receiving PD.
      Patients-, treatment- and telemedicine-level variables are collected at baseline and thus at
      3-month intervals. PD practice surveys are collected at baseline. All-cause mortality and
      transfer to hemodialysis will be recorded as primary outcomes. Other clinical outcomes
      including infectious and non-infectious complications would be recorded. The follow-up will
      be continued until the end of the study.
