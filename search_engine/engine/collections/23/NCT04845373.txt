      fat, inflammation and oxidative stress in obese adolescents with nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD). The study, which was designed as a single blind randomized control, was
      completed with 44 obese adolescents diagnosed with NAFLD between the ages of 11-18.
      Adolescents were randomized to either a Mediterranean diet (n = 22) or a low-fat diet
      (control diet) (n = 22) for 12 weeks. At the beginning of the study and at the 12th week,
      adolescents' blood samples, physical activity and food consumption records were taken,
      anthropometric measurements and body composition analyzes were made, and antioxidant food
      consumption frequency and Mediterranean diet quality index questionnaire were applied to
      adolescents. In the controls performed at the 2th, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th weeks, the
      physical activity and food consumption records of the adolescents were repeated and
      anthropometric measurements and body composition analyzes were made again.
