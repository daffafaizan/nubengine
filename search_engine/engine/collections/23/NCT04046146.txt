      arthritis) remains a major health concern. Efforts to develop effective treatments for this
      condition have been limited by the absence of quantitative outcome measures for lymphatic
      function. Published articles have supported the fact that human lymphatic contractions can be
      readily visualized after intradermal administration of micrograms of Indocyanine Green using
      laser-induced fluorescence. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of NIR imaging to
      quantify lymphatic drainage in the hands, wrists and forearms of healthy volunteers following
      intradermal web space ICG injection into the hand . To establish this emerging technology as
      a valid clinical outcome measure, however, we must address two major questions that confound
      interpretation of the imaging results: 1) are the ICG filled vessels lymphatic vessels and/or
      small veins?; and 2) does NIR-ICG imaging following web space injection fully capture
      lymphatic flow from the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints that are most commonly involved in
      RA? To answer these questions, healthy patients will be recruited to have intradermal and
      intra-articular injections of ICG and gadolinium followed by an imaging sessions (NIR or
      magnetic resonance imaging) to measure lymphatic contraction rates and flow.
