    
      The study is a two-center, Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, one-period, four-parallel-group,
      PK study in subjects with various severities of renal dysfunction and healthy volunteers.

      Subjects will be categorized in 4 groups:

      Group 1: subjects with mild renal impairment Group 2: subjects with moderate renal impairment
      Group 3: subjects with severe renal impairment Group 4 (control group): subjects with normal
      renal function

      The mild (group 1) and moderate (group 2) patients with renal disease will be dosed first, in
      a parallel fashion. At this point, interim PK analyses will be performed and a safety
      committee composed of Sponsor and Contract Research Organization (CRO) members will jointly
      review the PK data before dosing the patients with severe renal disease (group 3). Control
      subjects (group 4) will be recruited after the recruitment of groups 1 to 3.
