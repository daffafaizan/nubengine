    
      The purpose of this program is to provide early access to voxelotor for patients with sickle
      cell disease who have exhausted alternative treatment options and are ineligible for
      actively-recruiting clinical trials of voxelotor.

      This EAP may continue until such time that voxelotor is commercially available or the Sponsor
      discontinues the voxelotor EAP. Discontinuation may occur earlier if an individual
      participant or physician or Sponsor Medical Monitor decides to discontinue treatment.
