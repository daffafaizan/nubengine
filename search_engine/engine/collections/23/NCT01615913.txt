    
      This study is to explore the optimization of anti-onychomycosis patch with various
      formulation contents (three patch groups: 3%, 6% and 8% of terbinafine (contains 3-mg, 6-mg
      and 8-mg/patch terbinafine, respectively) combined with fixed 2% ketoconazole (contains 2-mg
      ketoconazole/patch) and its safety profile. At least 18 patients (age: 20 to 75 years old)
      with one or two feet toenails infected simultaneously need to complete the whole study.
      Patients will be assigned to one of patch groups. The patients with only one infected toenail
      will also apply one patch on other foot with uninfected toenail. The patch will be applied on
      the foot on the dorsal site and leave it there for two consecutive days. Totally six patches
      will be used for each week. The duration of therapy will be 24 weeks. The patients' blood
      sample and toenail clippings will be collected every 8 weeks and will be analyzed as well as
      the safety profiles. The most appropriate patch formulation will be selected on the drug
      content residues in toenail. The safety profile will be also presented and discussed with
      various anti-onychomycosis patch formulations.
