      employers and estimating the value of a telehealth visit to these stakeholders. An interview
      instrument was developed to administer before experience with telehealth and again after a
      family has had experience with the program. In addition program attendance (childcare or
      school) records will be collected to document changes in absenteeism pre and post telehealth
      service implementation.

      This study involves a before and after research design including both historical and
      concurrent controls comparing a detailed utilization of health services including telehealth
      visits, emergency department services and illness related office visits. Analyses will
      include center-level analyses of service utilization on a weekly basis pre and post as well
      as a child-level analyses including utilization before enrollment in a participating
      childcare center or school through program participation and, eventually, telehealth
      participation.

      This is a descriptive observational study of the feasibility and acceptability of integrating
      telehealth service into 10 primary care pediatric practices. This study will document the
      integration process by maintaining a log of key communications relating to decision making
      (meeting minutes, memos, written agreements, protocols) and by interviewing key staff such as
      residents, nurse practitioners, attending physicians, staff nurses, and administrative
      leaders following the study period.
