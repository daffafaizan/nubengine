      jeopardizing future treatment options. The reasons to consider regimen switching in the viral
      suppressed population are to simplify the regimen by reducing the pill burden and dosing
      frequency, to increase the tolerability, reduce the adverse effects as well as long-term
      toxicities, to prevent drug-to-drug interactions and to avoid the dietary requirements.

      Generic TAF/E/D (tenofovir alafenamide 25mg/emtricitabine 200mg/dolutegravir 50 mg), a
      single-tablet once daily regimen, will be an affordable regimen with the potential
      characteristics such as reduced pill burden, less drug to drug interaction and toxicities.
      The generic form (Mylan) is recently received the tentative approval from the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) under the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
      Whether DTG-containing regimen is a better option than protease inhibitors among
      resource-limited settings during the decisions for second-line treatment options, is needed
      to be evaluated.

      All participants will be switched from their pre-study ART regimen to a single tablet regimen
      (STR) of TAF/FTC/DTG 25/200/50mg once daily.
