      long-standing, significant disorders that impair all life domains. Early signs of disorder
      left untreated is an acute problem for Canadian youth as 15-25 yrs is the most likely
      age-strata for diagnosable psychiatric disorders, substance dependencies and suicide.
      Progress in youth treatments that engage the tendencies of youth to respond to online
      internet contact are likely to be especially strategic.

      In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) diagnosed depressed youth are treated with online
      mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy (MB-CBT) and standard psychiatric care or
      just standard psychiatric care (as wait-list controls). Eligible subjects will be recruited
      from the wait-lists of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), and from
      community-based practices and clinics proximal to CAMH. The consented 168 subjects will be
      from First Nations background (18-30 yrs) and from all other ethnic backgrounds, stratified
      into two intervention groups and two wait-list control groups.

      Primary outcome is self reported depression using the Beck Depression Inventory II while
      secondary outcomes include self reported anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Quick
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HRSD-24)), pain (Brief Pain Inventory) mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire)
      and intervention costs.

      If hypotheses are confirmed that youth can be effectively treated with online MB-CBT at
      reduced costs, effective treatment can be delivered to greater numbers with less geographic
      restriction.
