      arterial puncture or cutting down. This may lead to the serious bleeding complications
      especially under the situation of dual antiplatelet therapy and/or potent anti-coagulation
      therapies. TRI is now widely accepted as the most promising alternative for TFI around the
      world. It is supposed to reduce the incidence of the serious bleeding complication during and
      after PCI, as well as the total medical cost. There have been several prospective randomized
      trials comparing the safety and efficacy between TRI and TFI, but none of them had enough
      power to show the statistically valid equivalence in the efficacy between TRI and TFI. In
      this study, investigators randomize approximately 1,700 patients into TRI or TFI.
      Investigators adopt the rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACCE) at 1 year as the primary
      efficacy endpoint for the study. Based on these rates at 1 year, the sample size for the
      non-inferiority analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint is calculated. Through this
      randomization trial, investigators can achieve the scientific evidence for the improved
      safety and equal efficacy of TRI compared to TFI. This trial has enough statistical power to
      draw the final conclusion in the debate between TRI and TFI.
