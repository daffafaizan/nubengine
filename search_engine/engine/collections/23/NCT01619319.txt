      commercial computer games (CG). Participants were not blind to group allocation but all
      cognitive and symptom raters were. The 40 hours of BFP or computer game activity was expected
      to occur 4 days a week, for an hour each day, over a period of 10-12 weeks. The primary
      outcome was cognitive function assessed using the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery MCCB)
      (Nuechterlein and others 2008). The secondary outcome was social and role functioning
      assessed with Global Functioning: Social and Role scales. All clinical and cognitive
      assessments using symptom, functioning and cognitive measures were performed at baseline,
      post-treatment (at 3 months) and at 9-month follow-up (i.e. 9 months post baseline or 6
      months after post-treatment assessment).
