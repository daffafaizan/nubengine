      beneficial in the management of chronic pain syndromes. Chronic pain affects a large number
      of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Effective treatments are lacking for this patient
      group, so new treatment strategies are warranted.

      The study is designed as randomized controlled trial where participants are allocated on a
      1:1 ratio to either a 15 week intervention program of yoga-mindfulness or 15 weeks of patient
      education and mild physiotherapy.

      Study outcomes include pain levels and other pain-related features such as fatigue, sleep
      problems, mood disturbances and functional disability as well as measurements of
      health-related quality of life.
