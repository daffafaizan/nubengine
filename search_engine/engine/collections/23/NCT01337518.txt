        -  Phase 1a will involve dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The
           MTD will be determined on the basis of the results from the safety evaluation.

        -  Phase 1b will involve cohort expansion at one or more dose levels to determine the
           recommended Phase 2 dose. The recommended Phase 2 dose, which may differ from the MTD,
           will be determined on the basis of results from safety, activity, and pharmacologic and
           correlative studies.
