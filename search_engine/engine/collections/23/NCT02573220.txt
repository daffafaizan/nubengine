    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the phase
      II recommended dosage of irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) administered in the FOLFIRI
      regimen plus cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28
      uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) genotype treated as first line
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To estimate the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and metastasectomy (with
      curative intent) rate in the overall patient population (both genotype cohorts).

      OTHER OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the variability of irinotecan pharmacokinetics, in combination with cetuximab,
      in patients with *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotype and the effect of the pharmacokinetic profile on
      toxicity and response rate.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of irinotecan and its major metabolites in the
      absence and the presence of cetuximab administration, in order to define the effect of the
      chimeric monoclonal antibody on irinotecan pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with UGT1A1.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours, fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive
      cetuximab IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 15 of course 1 and days 1 and 15 of all subsequent
      courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
