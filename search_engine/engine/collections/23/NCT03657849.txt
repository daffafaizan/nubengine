      used to take samples of body tissue inside the chest without having to undergo an operation.

      During this procedure, a special telescope (called a bronchoscope) is inserted through the
      mouth into the airways. Ultrasound technology allows the doctor to see the structures just
      outside the airway. By being able to see the structures outside the airway, the doctor is
      able to safely pass a fine needle through the airway to take samples of abnormal tissue.

      EBUS-TBNA is used to take samples of tissue from the mediastinum. The mediastinum is the part
      of the chest between the lungs, and contains the heart, gullet, windpipe and lymph nodes.
      This area of the body is usually difficult to access without open surgery, hence the use of
      EBUS-TBNA. EBUS-TBNA may be used to investigate enlarged lymph nodes. This may be due to
      tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or cancer.

      Currently, smaller 21-gauge and larger 19-gauge needles are used during the EBUS-TBNA
      procedure at Regions Hospital. The purpose of this study is to find out which needle is
      better in finding the explanation for the enlarged lymph nodes, and any follow up procedures
      that may be necessary if the investigators are unable to get enough tissue during the
      EBUS-TBNA procedure (surgical sampling, radiological sampling, and/or follow-up imaging).
