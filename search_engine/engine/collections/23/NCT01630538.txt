      rejection. Optimizing baseline immunosuppression (calcineurin inhibitor (CNI),
      anti-proliferative agent, and anti-inflammatory) is considered foundational but is
      insufficient. Pulse steroids are routinely used. A number of immunosuppressive approaches
      have been tried in uncontrolled trials. The strongest evidence, at least for early
      antibody-mediated rejection (< 6 months from transplant), exists for plasmapheresis, with or
      without low dose IVIg, or high dose IVIg alone. However, as noted in a recent FDA workshop,
      "while the literature suggests that [these agents] have evidence of efficacy for the
      management of acute antibody-mediated rejection, and could be considered as standard of care,
      treatment regimes have not been standardized or optimized." Moreover the evidence supporting
      efficacy of this approach in late, as opposed to early antibody-mediated rejection is
      distinctly lacking.
