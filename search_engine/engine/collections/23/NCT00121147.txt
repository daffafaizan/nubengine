      when Brinzolamide Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and
      Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15% (Alphagan-P), an alpha 2 agonist, are added
      to Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan), a prostaglandin, in patients with
      primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Brinzolamide
      Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15%
      (Alphagan-P), and Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan) are all currently
      approved by the FDA and on the market, being used by patients. Even though all three
      medications are currently approved for the purpose of the study they will be considered study
      medicines.

      Glaucoma, Ocular Hypertension and Pseudoexfoliation syndrome have been treated with
      IOP-lowering medications or surgery to lower the pressure inside the eye to reduce the risk
      of visual field loss. Today, common treatments for a patient often begins with the
      prescription of a prostaglandin (Travoprost). If the prostaglandin does not lower the
      pressure inside the eye enough, a second drug is usually added. Topical carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors (Brinzolamide) and alpha 2 agonists (Brimonidine) are common choices as additive
      medicines.
