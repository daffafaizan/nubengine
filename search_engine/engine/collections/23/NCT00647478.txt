      due to a number of genetic and environmental factors facilitates the onset of AD. MCI
      includes prodromal AD.

      The identification of the risk factors for AD must be a priority in order to define the best
      therapeutic approach.

      Recent data support the notion that IGF-I pathway accounts for neuronal protection, with a
      dual effect, on both brain AÎ² peptide and tau protein.

      This large, multicenter, prospective, observational, cross-sectional population-based study
      in 3 parallel groups (200 participants per group) is aimed to assess differences between
      IGF-I and IGFBP3 circulating levels and polymorphisms in AD patients and control elderly
      subjects, and in MCI patients.
