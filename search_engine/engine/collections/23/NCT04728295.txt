      the safety and effectiveness of bilateral PTTractotomy for the treatment of motor
      complications in patients with bilateral idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. A maximum of 50
      subjects will be treated at up to 8 sites.

      Subjects will undergo an Exablate index procedure targeting the PTT and will be seen at
      1-week,1-, 3-, and 6- months post treatment. At the 6-month visit, subjects will be evaluated
      for an Exablate procedure on the other side.
