      siderophores to liberate iron from their surroundings. In several studies, a misbalanced
      microbiota has been demonstrated in allergics suggesting that also their siderophore profile
      is severely attenuated.

      There are currently no data and very limited knowledge present on the composition of
      bacterial surviving factors in humans, or on their impact on the human immune system.

      As such, 1) the iron status, 2) the microbial biota composition and the 3)
      siderophore-profile in allergics and non-allergics will be assessed.
