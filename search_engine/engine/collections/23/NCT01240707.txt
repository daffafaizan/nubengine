      impaired gas exchange. The scope of injury in fire smoke victims ranges from cough and minor
      airway irritation to severe respiratory failure and long term mechanical ventilation in the
      Intensive Care Unit. Some patients with high HbCO-levels are also treated with hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy.

      In this study the investigators will examine if the scope of inhalation injury can be
      assessed soon after admission based on clinical markers, biochemical markers, Peak Expiratory
      Flow (PEF), spirometry and bronchoscopy. The clinical effect of fiberoptic bronchoscopy after
      severe smoke inhalation will also be examined. At 6 months a lung function test and
      metacholine test will be performed to examine whether they have developed asthma/increased
      bronchial hyperreactivity or not after the initial fire smoke exposure. Lab staff
      (flowcytometer and cytokine analysis) are unaware of patient identity and whether the patient
      is a smoke-exposed patient or a healthy volunteer in the control group of non-exposed
      persons.
