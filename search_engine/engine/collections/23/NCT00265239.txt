      intravenously just before reperfusion. We compared infarct size, using serial determination
      of serum biomarkers and Q wave formations, and the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmia
      between the groups. Cardiovascular event-free curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.
      In addition, we determined serum thioredoxin levels, an oxidative stress marker, to assess
      the antioxidant effect of edaravone.
