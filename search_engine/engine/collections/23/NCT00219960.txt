      observational evidence linking its intake to hypertension. This should be addressed
      considering the potential overlap between the prevalence of ginseng use and hypertension.

      We undertook a single centre, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial to
      determine the effect of North American ginseng (NAG) on 24-hour BP and renal function. After
      a 4-week placebo run-in, we randomly assigned participants to NAG or placebo treatment for
      12-weeks at a dose of 3g/day. This was followed by an 8-week washout, and a subsequent
      12-week period in which the opposite treatment was consumed. At run-in, and at weeks 0 and 12
      of each treatment period, participants were fitted with an ambulatory BP monitor to assess
      24-hour BP and serum cystatin C was measured.
