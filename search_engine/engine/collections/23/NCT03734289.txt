      education and coaching in nonpharmacologic approaches to reduce care resistant behaviors as a
      trigger of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and neuropsychiatric
      symptoms after Traumatic Brain Injury (NPTBI) will improve caregiver burden, quality of life
      (QOL), and related outcomes of patients with these conditions and their family members. The
      intervention of interest is the Neurobehavioral Non-Pharmacologic Supportive Strategies for
      Family Caregivers of Persons with Dementia or TBI (NeuroNS-Care). Behavioral symptoms in
      dementia and following TBI vary considerably over time, with a tendency toward spontaneous
      regression to the mean. Additionally, caregivers often develop idiosyncratic strategies in
      response to adverse behaviors that might be either adaptive or maladaptive. In order to
      separate the effects of time alone from the effects of the coaching intervention, one group
      will be randomized to delayed intervention following a 6 week wait time. This will allow the
      investigative team the opportunity to compare the natural history of the outcome variables in
      an "untrained" portion of the sample to the effects of training over a similar time period.
