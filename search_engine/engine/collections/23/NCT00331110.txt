      compartment is involved most frequently. If conservative mechanical therapies could reduce
      knee OA symptoms, risks to patients might be minimized through reduction in use of
      pharmacotherapy or surgery. A lateral heel wedge with strapping of the ankle joint has been
      reported to induce a similar therapeutic effect to that of proximal tibial osteotomy. It is
      presumed that the mechanism for this involves correction of genu varum. However, the effects
      on the static lower limb mechanical axis and the dynamic knee adduction moment, a risk factor
      for knee OA symptoms and progression, have not been assessed, so the mechanism of effect is
      currently unknown. The proposed protocol would compare lower limb mechanical alignment
      (measured by radiographic hip-knee-ankle angle) and dynamic knee varus moment (measured by
      3-dimensional gait analysis) with and without the strapped insole to further understanding of
      the mechanism of effect on subjects with knee OA. Additionally, this protocol would assess
      analgesia and whether use of the insole reduces known knee joint unloading compensatory
      mechanisms during gait. Through measurement of radiographic lower limb alignment, dynamic
      knee varus moment, and ankle/foot static and dynamic angles, a model would be developed
      relating radiographs with dynamic moments, potentially allowing greater risk stratification
      for knee OA development and progression through use of radiographs. In addition to
      elucidating the mechanism of effect of this insole and developing a model for radiographic
      interpretation, this protocol would be the fist study of this insole involving non-Japanese
      subjects.
