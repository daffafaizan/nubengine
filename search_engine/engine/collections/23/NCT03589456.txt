    
      The purpose of this patient registry is to collect information about a patient's cancer
      treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), used alone or in combination with surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients will be registered either before or after PDT is
      performed, regardless of the indication. Analysis of this information may help to refine the
      treatment care. Data collected in the registry includes patient characteristics/demographics,
      disease characteristics, treatment details (photodynamic therapy, radiation, chemotherapy,
      surgery, etc.), side effects, and survival outcomes. By participating in this registry,
      patients will not be asked to do anything that would not ordinarily be done as a matter of
      routine care including clinical assessments, laboratory tests, radiology procedures, and
      treatments. Information on disease, condition, and treatment will be recorded in the registry
      during routine visits.
