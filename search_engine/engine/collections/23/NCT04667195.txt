      quite frequently is seen in the emergency department (ED). In our study, we define APN as a
      urinary tract infection with extension above the bladder, implicated by systemic affection in
      a suspected urinary tract infection (ie, fever, chills, malaise and/or lethargy beyond
      normal, signs of sepsis). Most often, an infection of the bladder ascends to the kidneys,
      causing APN. Symptoms and clinical affection range from mild to severe, but it is always
      important to recognize and treat APN fast in order to prevent progression to sepsis, renal
      failure and ultimately death.

      The diagnosis APN is primarily made clinically based on symptoms and supported by elevated
      biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and leucocytes, and positive urinary test strips.
      The diagnostic process can be challenging as there is often weak and atypical symptoms.

      The classic symptoms indicating APN is flank tenderness, fever and nausea/vomiting. Typical
      symptoms of cystitis (dysuria, pollakisuria, suprapubic pain, hematuria) are possible but
      often absent. Especially elderly can present with more generalized signs of infection with
      nothing clearly indicating localization to the urinary tract. A positive urine culture
      verifies the diagnosis, but it is only available after a minimum of 24 hours.

      In this study, we seek to identify and quantify the patient characteristics available within
      4 hours of hospital stay in patients with APN. The objectives are:

        -  To identify clinical and paraclinical relevant information available within 4 hours of
           admission that are associated with APN patients

        -  To investigate the association between adverse events and clinical and paraclinical
           relevant information in patients with APN.
