      treatment outcome.This algorithm will serve as a tool for physicians when making treatment
      decisions, specifically for stage IV NSCLC and malignant melanoma patients receiving
      anti-cancer treatments. The investigators also aim to identify the metabolic pathways that
      could lead to better therapeutic options. The patients will be given their treatment
      according to the institute's standard of care. The patients will provide two blood samples
      and clinical data will be collected from their medical records.

      In the first part of the trial, the data obtained from the blood samples and the medical
      records of the patients will be used to develop the prediction algorithm, and in the second
      part of the trial, the algorithm will be validated by comparing the objective response rate
      of the patients to the theoretical response prediction of the algorithm.
