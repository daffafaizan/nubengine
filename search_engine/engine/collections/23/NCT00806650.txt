      I. To develop a blood test by monitoring the titer of IMP3 autoantibody and/or microRNA
      (miRNA)/small non-coding RNA (snRNA) expression in patients' serum for the early detection of
      RCC and its recurrence/metastasis.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples are collected prior to treatment and analyzed for anti-IMP3
      autoantibody titer via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and total RNA via
      sequencing, microarray, and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Previously
      collected tissue samples are analyzed for IMP3 via immunohistochemistry (IHC).
