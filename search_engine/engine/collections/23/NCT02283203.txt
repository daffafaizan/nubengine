      Greece by the industry Uni-Pharma (ΑPOTEL Μax®). According to this new formulation, 1g of
      paracetamol is provided as a flask diluted into 100ml volume with the possibility of
      immediate connection with the infusion device of the patient. This formulation provides the
      advantage of a dilution ready-to-use which equals considerable financial benefit; nursing
      staff is not pre-occupied with the preparation of dilutions and the amount of consumables
      required for the preparation of this dilution is significantly decreased. Taking into
      consideration that the antipyretic effect of intravenous paracetamol has never been studied
      compared with other agents in patients and available data come from studies in volunteers
      with experimental endotoxemia, the present study compares the efficacy of the new ΑPOTEL Μax®
      formulation versus placebo for the management of fever of infectious origin (fever due to
      infection of the upper respiratory tract, of the lower respiratory tract, acute
      pyelonephritis or of the skin and soft tissues).
