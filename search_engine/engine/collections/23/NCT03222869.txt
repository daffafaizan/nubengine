      endoscopic laryngeal surgery, commonly have difficulties with airflow secondary to their
      stenosis. Easier and quicker quantification will tailor diagnosis and treatment. In order to
      obtain an objective measure of airflow in these participants, we will place a 20-gauge
      angiocatheter needle into the airway. The catheter will be in situ for a short duration
      during several spontaneous and non-spontaneous breaths. This will be achieved via the
      existing tracheostomy stoma or percutaneously via the cricothyroid membrane. This technique
      is commonly used to access the muscles of the larynx, however, the primary purpose will be to
      measure airflow in this setting.
