    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor
      the patient knows the name of the assigned drug) study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of JNJ-42160443 compared with placebo in the treatment of men and women 18
      years of age or older who are terminally ill (ie, patients who are in or who are candidates
      for hospice or palliative [other medical care] care for end-of-life management) with moderate
      to severe, chronic, cancer-related pain that is not controlled by standard pain medications
      and who have a diagnosis of active cancer. The duration of the study will be approximately 62
      weeks (includes screening, the 4-week double-blind phase followed by the 48-week open-label
      [study doctor and patient knows the name of the assigned treatment] extension phase and a
      posttreatment phase). A single dose of JNJ-42160443 or matching placebo given as an
      (subcutaneous [SC]) injection under the skin during the double-blind treatment period. During
      the open-label period, JNJ-42160443 will be given once every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks.
