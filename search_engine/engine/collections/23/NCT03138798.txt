      prolonged second stage of labor to accomplish vaginal delivery. However, this practice is not
      without risks and may lead to either operative delivery (vacuum or forceps assisted delivery)
      or cesarean section with significant maternal/neonatal morbidity. Limited evidence suggests
      that dental support devices (DSD) may improve maternal valsalva and lead to a shortened
      second stage of labor by allowing them to push more effectively. Previous studies have been
      underpowered to find statistically significant results.

      The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has a unique and heterogeneous inner-city
      population of laboring mothers with marked rates of maternal obesity. The objective is to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial in which nulliparous patients are asked to use the
      LaboraideTM, a DSD designed for laboring women, while pushing with contractions in the second
      stage of labor.
