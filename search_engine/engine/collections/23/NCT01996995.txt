      Inclusion criteria: Patients with clinical suspicion and microbiologic confirmation of
      onychomycosis , diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM, 18 years or older, at risk for diabetic foot
      ulcers defined by a modified Simm's classification score 1 or 2 with either neuropathy or
      PAD, nail involvement of at least 25% of the target nail.

      Exclusion criteria: no microbiologic confirmation, Simms' classification score 3, the
      presence or history of diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic pain, ankle brachial index < 0.9,
      patients receiving dialysis, severe renal insufficiently (eGFR below 30 ml/min), a documented
      toe pressure below 50 mmHg, use of systemic or topical antifungal agents 3 months prior to
      inclusion, use of immunosuppressive drugs, presence of psoriasis, lichen planus, or other
      abnormalities that could result in clinically abnormal toenails, a history of epilepsy and
      insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language. Patients with a dark skin color (Fitzpatrick 4
      and 5) are excluded since dark skin color is associated with dark nails, which theoretically
      leads to increased temperatures during laser application
