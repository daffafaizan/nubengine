    
      The intervention components are: a protocol for interdisciplinary family meetings that is
      tailored to the individual ICU unit and steps in the SET-to-Meet process: 1.) Screening of
      patients on admission to determine if patient meets criteria for a family meeting; 2.)
      proactively Engaging family members to inform them about the unit's protocol for family
      meetings and to find out who from the family might attend the meeting; and Tracking the
      progress of setting up the meeting (identifying the patient during ICU team rounds as a
      patient meeting criteria for a family meeting; discussing setting up the meeting with the ICU
      team; scheduling the meeting and communicating details to attendees.)

      Implementation of the intervention includes: 1.) Working with the site ICU physician and
      nursing leadership to tailor the SET-to-meet protocol and tracking tool for family meetings,
      ensuring they are customized for the unit workflow and staffing model, and 2.) Providing
      on-line training and 2 weeks of on-site coaching to ICU nursing staff, care management/social
      work staff, and intensivists (MD and APP) in the use of the tailored protocol and tracking
      tool.

      Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by percentage of staff completing training,
      adherence to elements of the intervention, and number of patients meeting enrollment
      criteria. Acceptability will be assessed via focus groups and a survey testing satisfaction
      with the intervention.
