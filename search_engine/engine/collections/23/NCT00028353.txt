      puts men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This study will take one year of
      participation with clinic visits every three months. There will be two prostate biopsies
      during the study, at six and twelve months. If qualified to participate, you will be randomly
      assigned to one of four treatment groups. Three out of four groups are varying doses of the
      study medication and the other is the placebo group (like a sugar pill).
