      either iobitridol or contrast agents with higher iodine concentrations (iopromide or
      iomeprol). Independent off-site readers evaluated image quality regarding the ability to
      identify coronary artery stenosis (score 0- non evaluable to 4- excellent quality). The study
      was aimed at showing the non-inferiority of iobitridol in its ability to provide evaluable CT
      scans for the identification of coronary stenosis.
