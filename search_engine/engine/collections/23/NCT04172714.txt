      patients eligible for curative surgery at the time of diagnosis. Yttrium-90 (Y90)
      radioembolization is palliative treatment with promising result. However, one of the most
      important factors in the success of Y90 treatment is to ensure adequate dose of radioactive
      material is delivered to the tumor. The technetium-99 macroaggregated albumin (MAA) which is
      currently used for Y90 treatment planning and shunt study does not predict distribution of
      Y90 in the lungs, tumors, and liver. Therefore, accurate and personalized treatment planning
      cannot be performed using MAA. In this study, we are proposing using low-dose Y90
      microspheres for the planning stage of the therapy to obtain an accurate estimation of
      distribution of Y90 therapy dose. This will in turn allow us to ensure adequate dose of Y90
      is delivered to the tumor(s) while minimizing dose delivered to non-tumor liver and lungs in
      order to decrease the chance of treatment related toxicity to the liver and lungs.
