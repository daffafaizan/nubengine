      reason for using complementary or alternative medical (CAM) therapies. Despite the common use
      of CAM therapies for back pain, little is known about how they compare with conventional
      treatments. This study will lay the groundwork for a full-scale trial that compares yoga with
      conventional exercise and usual care for chronic low back pain.

      This study will randomize 30 people with chronic low back pain to each of the following
      groups: yoga, a conventional therapeutic exercise program, and usual care. There will be 12
      weeks of weekly treatment and follow-up assessments via phone at 6, 12, and 26 weeks to
      measure each treatment's impact on symptoms, function, quality of life, and utilization and
      costs of back pain related care.
