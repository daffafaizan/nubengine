      wound closure efficiency of STRATAFIX Symmetric PDS Plus compared to conventional sutures in
      patients undergoing TKA. For the purpose of this study, wound closure efficiency is defined
      as the total time required to close the surgical incisions in patients undergoing TKA
      procedures using STRATAFIX Symmetric PDS Plus compared to those using traditional sutures.
      Secondary objectives will include the evaluation of differences in overall surgical procedure
      time, operating room (OR) time, length of stay, procedure costs, quality of life measures
      including pain, and range of motion (ROM). In addition, the difference in the safety profiles
      for both wound closure procedures will be evaluated through the analysis of the incidence of
      wound complications including dehiscence, wound infections, and other adverse events.
