      birth weight children. Although, the timing of eruption of primary teeth and their sequence
      of eruption shown to be under the genetic control , pre-natal maternal conditions, early
      childhood metabolic and nutritional factors along with socioeconomic states have been
      associated with the timing of eruption of primary teeth.

      race and physical growth may influence emergence of tooth in child mouth but there is scarce
      information on Egyptian children .
