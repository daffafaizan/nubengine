      fixation of the hip prosthesis in primary hip alloplasty. A hemispheric joint cup of the type
      Exceed cup (Biomet) characterized by a porous surface of titanium plasma spray is used. The
      surface is coated with hydroxyapatite deposited electrochemically (BoneMaster) and will be
      compared with an identical cup without hydroxyapatite. A 5-year radiologic analysis of
      migration will be carried out with the object of detecting prognostic evidence of prosthesis
      loosening. Migration is determined by Roentgen Stereo-photogrammetric Analysis (RSA) on
      stereoroentgenography. Simultaneously, the patients will be monitored by using the clinical
      outcome measure HOOS (Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score), OHS (Oxford Hip
      Score), EQ-5D (EuroQol), HHS (Harris Hip Score) on range of motion, VAS (Visual Analog
      Scale), postoperative complications and reoperation.

      Hypothesis: We expect that the Exceed cup with hydroxyapatite deposited electrochemically
      (BoneMaster) is superior or equal compared to a similar cup without hydroxyapatite regarding

        -  mechanical stability (RSA)

        -  (clinical outcome)
