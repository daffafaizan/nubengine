      cochlear implant users. There are both financial and non-financial barriers to AR service
      delivery including accessibility (mobility, distance and transportation problems),
      accommodation (time off work impossible, caring for family) and availability (limited
      providers in rural areas, financial constraints, and lack of transportation. In this study
      the investigators will measure the impact of telerehab delivery on optimizing speech
      recognition, communication function, goals, social participation and hearing handicap.

      Twenty-four participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: aural
      rehabilitation (AR) and cognitive training (CT). Participants will complete six 90-minute
      treatment sessions in their home or office via a telerehab platform. Participants will come
      to a center for three 90-minute assessment sessions: pre-treatment, 1 week, and 2 months
      post-treatment.
