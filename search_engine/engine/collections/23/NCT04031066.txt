    
      A Screening visit (V1) will take place 7Â±3 days prior to randomization in order to give the
      subject enough time to consider their participation in the study, to plan the next visits
      including the long-stay visits at V2, V5 and V8 (long-stay visits as PK and certain tests are
      performed over more than one day), and to allow the clinic center to complete the evaluation
      of the eligibility criteria.

      Upon confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be randomized to receive weekly i.v.
      administration of either velmanase alfa 1 mg/kg or placebo.

      Thereafter, subjects will undergo weekly visits for administration of study treatment and
      safety data collection. Clinical, laboratory and functional assessments will be performed at
      the 4-weekly assessment visits with each subject undergoing a minimum of 8 assessment visits
      (V1 to V8).
