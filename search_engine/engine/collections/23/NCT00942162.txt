      four cycles over a period of four years. An active follow-phase (up to five years after
      registration into the study) was planned for all patients.

      As of Amendment 2, there will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after
      discontinuation or completion of the treatment. The study will end approximately 30 days
      after the last dose will be administered.

      In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For
      each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet,
      testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.

      Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.
