      recent studies.

      The Stewart's concept on acid-base balance predicts that high strong ion difference (SID)
      fluid thus will increase the pH level.

      High SID fluid are specially formulated by adding sodium bicarbonate into half saline
      solution, the resultant fluid contains sodium= 145mmol/L and chloride=70mmol/L (SID= 75) as
      compared to Hartmann's solution with the SID of 20.
