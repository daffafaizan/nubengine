      of all preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) infants. Recent evidence finds an increased
      risk of early post-discharge morbidity and re-hospitalization among LPT as compared to full
      term infants, which is linked to breastfeeding, specifically to early lactation failure and
      decreased breast milk intake. Accurate and inexpensive methods to collect data on rates of
      breastfeeding and early morbidity among LPT infants are critical to design, implementation
      and monitoring of effective interventions. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of
      weekly phone calling in a racially and socioeconomically diverse population of mothers of LPT
      infants.
