      adults with BDD recruited nationally. In a prior study (Clinical Trials Identifier #
      NCT03221738), the investigators developed and pilot-tested the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary efficacy of a CBT for BDD app in an open pilot trial. The investigators are
      now further testing these outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects (N=
      64) will be randomly assigned to 12-weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for BDD either
      immediately, or after a 12-week long waiting period (50/50 chance).
