      Participants will have a chance to ask questions about the study before agreeing to
      participate. If participants agree, they will be randomly chosen to receive one of two
      options for pain management that the investigators are already using in the care of patients
      (option 1: Tylenol (also known as acetaminophen) with tramadol if needed, or option 2:
      Tylenol #3 as needed) after surgery.

      Participants will be asked to complete a form about the level of pain and how much pain
      medication was needed after surgery in the hospital and while at home. Participants will come
      to the GME General Surgery Center approximately one week after surgery for a post-operative
      visit so that the investigators can see how much pain medication was used and how much pain
      the participant had in the first few days after surgery.

      Participants will not have to do any additional visits to participate in this study. The
      investigators will obtain the research materials at the same time as the usual care visits
      around the participants' surgery. It should take approximately 2 minutes each day to
      complete.
