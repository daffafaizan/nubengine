      (RV) function from right heart catheterization (RHC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      with PET-derived RV FDG uptake.

      Background Right ventricular (RV) function is a major determinant of survival in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Hemodynamic parameters like end-systolic
      elastance (Ees), arterial elastance (Ea), pulmonary arterial compliance (PAC) and Ees/Ea
      ratio have been shown to reflect RV function and prognosis in PAH. Increased RV
      18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) was recently
      associated with progressive RV dysfunction in these patients.

      Methods Twenty-five stable PAH patients (49.92±15.94 years) and twelve healthy subjects
      (control group, 44.75±13.51 years) had simultaneous PET and MRI scans performed. FDG was used
      as a tracer and its uptake was presented as a standardized uptake value (SUV) for both left
      (LV) and right ventricle.
