      have preventive and therapeutic effects that contribute to a better quality of life. In
      addition, laughter can optimize strategies to increase pain tolerance and combat stress,
      reducing the negative impact such as increased blood pressure, decreases simultaneously
      perfusion of organs not needed for the motor function, increased metabolism rates cell with
      increased serum cortisol and increased risk of infections. Nevertheless the upswing in
      research on these effects, there is still a necessity to have evidence-based medicine as most
      of the available studies are limited by various problems such as lack of objectivity in the
      assessment and measurement, distinction between laughter and mood, establishment dosing
      therapies (frequency and time).

      The aim of our study is to determine the efficacy of spontaneous laughter in children to
      improve postoperative pain, anxiety and length of hospital stay.

      Methods: A controlled, randomized, open label trial with an experimental group exposed to the
      conventional pain treatment with laughter therapy; 2 control group, a group with
      accompaniment without causing the laughter of children to control the effect of a companion
      instead of the clown and a conventional treatment group to contrast with experimental group.
