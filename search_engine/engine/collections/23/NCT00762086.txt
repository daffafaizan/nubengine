      claudication, limb and foot pain and tissue lesions, which are difficult to treat. In recent
      years, there have been reports demonstrating reduction of these symptoms by use of
      compressible sleeve devices.

      This clinical study aims at demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of this device in
      treating PAD symptoms.
