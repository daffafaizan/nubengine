      healthy control subjects will be recruited. At baseline, nasal secretions and mucosal
      biopsies will be collected. After 3 weeks, participants will be provoked with cold, dry air,
      and samples will be harvested again. A decrease in the peak nasal inspiratory flow of >20%
      will be used as a cutoff to define nasal hyperreactivity.

      Nasal secretions will be analysed for various mediators using a multiplex assay. The biopsies
      will be used for RT-q-PCR and immunohistochemistry of various transient receptor potential
      (TRP) channels.
