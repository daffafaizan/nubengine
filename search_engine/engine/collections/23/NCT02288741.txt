      anthracycline/dexamethasone-based regimens. Specified in the protocol were
      vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (VAD), idarubicin/dexamethasone (ID) and
      cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CAD). In arm A2, patients were planned to receive
      only dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1-4 and 8-11 for symptom control before stem cell
      mobilization. For the patients in arm B, a maximum of 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy was
      allowed. Following this, the treatment was identical for all patients. For stem cell
      mobilization, an age-adjusted IEV-regimen with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
      was recommended. The target dose for stem cell collection was 6 x 10E+6 CD34 (cluster of
      differentiation 34)-positive cells/kg (2 transplants and one back-up). The standard dose for
      each transplantation was 2 x 10E+6 CD34-positive cells/kg. High-dose melphalan at a total
      dose of 140 mg/m² (MEL140) was given in two doses of 70 mg/m² on days -3 and -2. Stem cell
      transplantation (SCT) was performed on day 0. A second MEL140 course was planned two months
      after the first. Regular bisphosphonate treatment was recommended.
