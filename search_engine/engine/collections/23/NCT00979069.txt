      between cognition and aerobic exercise in older adults. Specifically, the effects are thought
      to involve higher order cognitive processes, such as working memory, switching between tasks,
      and inhibiting irrelevant information, all of which are thought to be sub- served, in part,
      by the frontal lobes (Colcombe et al., 2006). Importantly, these areas also are most
      susceptible to age-related decline (Raz, 2000) and are essential resources for language
      production (Kemper & Sumner, 2001; Murray & Lenz, 2001). However, despite promising cognitive
      improvement, changes in frontally-mediated executive language functions have been widely
      ignored. This is unfortunate considering impaired word retrieval compromises communicative
      effectiveness, leading to frustration, depression, and withdrawal. Perhaps more importantly,
      communication ineffectiveness, particularly in the elderly, leads to difficulties interacting
      with health care professionals leading to further health care burdens. Since cognition, and
      specifically word retrieval difficulties, usually remain untreated, it is important to find
      treatment strategies for minimizing these deficits. Therefore, the short-term goal and the
      purpose of this proposal is to examine the potential of aerobic exercise to improve executive
      language function in older adults.
