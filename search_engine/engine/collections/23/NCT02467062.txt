      diameter and concomitant valvular dysfunction and the most recent ESC guideline proposes
      surgical intervention of ascending aortic aneurysm in patients who have a maximal aortic
      diameter â‰¥ 55mm, regardless of etiology. On the contrary, a recent publication by Rylski et
      al showed that most of the dissections occur at diameters smaller than 55 mm. Several
      publictions have shown that the flow profile and wall sheer stress derived from 4D flow MRI
      are significantly different between the valve morphology, the type of the aneurysm (tubular
      or diffuse enlargement) and pre and postoperative patients. Clinical implementation of 4D
      flow may enable us to stratify the patients with aortic and/or aortic valve diseases,
      especially in regard to the risk of ruptures. The patients with aortic/aortic valve disease
      will be referred to 4D flow MRI and contrast-enhanced angiografie from the aorta clinic.
      Phase 1: 6 healty adult volunteers will be scanned prior to the scan of the patients and
      settings would be optimised for 4D flow MRI and the contrast will not be given.

      Phase 2: 30 patients either scheduled for surgical treatment of their aortic disease,
      post-operative patients and patients under surveillance for known aortic root and/or aortic
      valve disease will be imaged. Only patients having a clinical indication for an MRI of the
      aorta/aortic valve will be included.
