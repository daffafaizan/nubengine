      Viz., IRS-1-dependent PI 3-Kinase, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and PKB/Akt is defective
      in diabetic muscle. These defects are best seen when insulin activation is conducted at both
      half-maximal and maximal stimulation. Moreover, whereas previous studies had shown that
      treatment with metformin (Met) alone improves aPKC activation, or that treatment with
      thiazolidinedione (TZD) alone produces increases in activation of IRS-1/PI3K and aPKC when
      evaluated at maximal insulin stimulation, we have recently found that combined treatment with
      Met plus TZD for 6 weeks provokes marked increases in insulin effects on all three signaling
      factors at both half-maximal and maximal insulin stimulation. This work is being prepared for
      submission for publication.

      We have also evaluated the improvement in insulin signaling in diabetic muscle 4 hours after
      acute endurance (one-legged) exercise and found that the responsiveness of aPKC to the lipid
      PI3K-derived activator, PIP3, was improved. Also increased was the activation by insulin of
      IRS-2-dependent PI3K, ERK1/2, and downstream protein synthesis machinery, viz., p70S6 kinase
      and eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2. These effects of exercise would be expected to enhance
      glucose transport and utilization by muscle, and promote protein synthesis, i.e., an anabolic
      response.
