      algorithm will be used to activate clinicians and Nephrologist to confirm if patient is at
      high risk. Once identified as high risk the clinician and/or nephrologist will intervene and
      change current management if needed. First phase of study will look at an alert system and
      algorithm was enough to lower incidence of acute kidney injury. Phase 2 will also use alert
      system and algorithm that will be further randomized those that are identified as high risk
      for acute kidney injury to remote ischemic preconditioning.
