      with ASD, which will be facilitated through a battery of assessments given over quarterly
      time points in a two year time period. Investigators seek to address whether increased
      frequency of behaviorally driven assessments will inform treatment. More specifically,
      investigators are interested in knowing if the assessment data influences treatment planning
      with providers or if it is guiding any decisions about treatment once data is returned to
      participants in a meaningful way which is easily understood. If data prompts treatment
      changes, the study will examine whether improvements are being shown months or even years
      later.

      An "elected reporter", a family member, is asked to take part in the research study with the
      participant. An elected reporter is asked to complete several questionnaires quarterly, both
      reporting on themself and the participant.
