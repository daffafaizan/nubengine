    
      Objective: To compare the percentage of pregnancies prevented by LNG co-administered with
      piroxicam or placebo for oral emergency contraception (EC) by a randomised controlled trial.

      Hypothesis to be tested: LNG plus piroxicam has higher percentage of pregnancies prevented
      compared with LNG plus placebo for oral emergency contraception.

      Design and subjects: This will be a prospective, randomised placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. Women attending the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong for oral EC within 72
      hours of unprotected sexual intercourse will be recruited.

      Study instruments: Prospective follow-up of subjects in the clinic for the primary and
      secondary outcomes.

      Interventions: Eligible subjects will be randomised to receive one of the two treatment
      regimens, i.e. Group A: a single dose of LNG 1.5 mg and piroxicam 40 mg, or Group B: a single
      dose of LNG 1.5mg and placebo under direct supervision.

      Main outcome measures: Percentage of pregnancies prevented (PPP) is the primary outcome
      measure. Secondary outcome measures include failure rate, rate of occurrence of side effects
      and pattern of the menstruation following EC.

      Data analysis:The percentage of pregnancies prevented, failure rate and rate of occurrence of
      side effects will be compared between groups using Fisher-Exact test. Continuous variables
      regarding menstrual pattern between the two groups will be compared by Mann-Whitney U test.

      Expected results: LNG plus piroxicam has a higher PPP compared to LNG plus placebo.
