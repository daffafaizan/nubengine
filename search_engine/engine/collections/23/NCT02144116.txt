      previously described that fibromyalgia may affect peripheral and/or central mechanisms of
      postural control. Balance or postural stability is a very complex task that involves the
      integration of multiple sensory inputs to execute appropriate neuromuscular activity needed
      to maintain balance.

      Patients with fibromyalgia have also muscle weakness. Muscle strength depends on both the
      cross-sectional area of the muscle and the neural activity. Range of movement and quality of
      life have also been reported to be affected.
