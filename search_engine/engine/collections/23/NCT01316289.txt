    
      A prospective case series to examine the influence of reduction quality on the primary
      functional outcome (as assessed using the FAAM) of patients with pilon fractures treated with
      plate fixation. Radiological parameters including single/combined alignment and various
      articular measurements will also be validated according to their reliability. The sensitivity
      of the effects of reduction quality on functional outcome, and an extended evaluation of
      patient-rated functional and social outcomes as well as their outcome expectations will also
      be assessed as part of the secondary study aims.
