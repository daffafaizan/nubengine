      program. Parents and children complete a comprehensive assessment, including questionnaire
      and observation data. The FCU4Health coordinator reviews the assessment results with the
      parents, using MI strategies to create a tailored plan to address family needs. This plan may
      include referrals to community resources or parenting modules that focus on family
      management.
