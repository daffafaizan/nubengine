      of two study groups: Group 1- ultrasound therapy group; Group 2 - the neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation group. Group allocation was randomized in two blocks of 30 sealed
      envelopes without external marks, which were mixed and numbered from 1 to 30, containing a
      piece of paper with the group allocation. The researchers responsible for outcome measures
      and ultrasonograhic measurements were blinded to the patients' diagnosis or intervention.
