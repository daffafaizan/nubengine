      both improve the quality of the corneal optics (i.e. improve corneal topography regularity)
      and to stabilize the cornea. Previous investigations have shown that Intacs surgery, indeed,
      does improve corneal topography and improve contact lens tolerance and spectacle corrected
      visual acuity, as well as uncorrected visual acuity in some patients. Investigations of CXL
      have shown the procedure not only to decrease keratoconus progression, but also to decrease
      the steepness of the cone and improve uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in some
      cases. Since the mechanism of improvement differs between the procedures, this suggests a
      potential additive effect of the two on the patient's ultimate visual outcome. Thus, the
      patient would be afforded two potential benefits: (1) the potential of a more robust visual
      outcome and (2) stabilization of the keratoconic cornea on the longer term.
