      microwave-based procedure) combined with corneal collagen cross-linking performed with VibeX
      (Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution)and the KXL System to corneal collagen cross-linking alone in
      reducing corneal curvature in patients with keratoconus. Patients will be randomized into one
      of two treatment groups: Vedera KXS combined with corneal collagen cross-linking or collagen
      cross-linking alone. The Vedera KXS procedure performs a controlled application of microwave
      energy in an annular configuration. The goal of this procedure is to reshape the cornea to
      flatten the cornea and improve corneal topography in patients with keratoconus. The primary
      goal of collagen crosslinking is to stabilize the corneal shape in keratoconus and prevent
      progression of the disease. Moreover, investigations of crosslinking have shown the procedure
      not only to decrease keratoconus progression, but also to decrease the steepness of the cone
      and improve uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in some cases. Since the mechanism
      of improvement differs between the procedures, this study will compare the combined
      microwave/crosslinking treatment to crosslinking alone.
