      enables transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients not eligible for femoral
      artery access. Currently the procedure is performed using devices, off-label, designed and
      marketed to close holes inside the heart and great vessels, manufactured by Abbott St Jude
      (Amplatzer Duct Occluder and Amplatzer Muscular VSD Occluder). Because these Amplatzer
      occluders are not designed to close transcaval access sites, they may not completely prevent
      bleeding.

      This is an early feasibility study (EFS) evaluation of a purpose-built closure device for
      transcaval access. The device, the Transcaval closure device (TCD) will be evaluated for
      safety and performance to close transcaval access sites in patients ineligible for femoral
      artery access for TAVR.
