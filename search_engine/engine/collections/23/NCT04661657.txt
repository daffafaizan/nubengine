      outpatients who recovered from COVID-19.

      CMR offers the unique ability to comprehensively characterize myocardial tissue and assess
      the heart's structure and function, through a variety of complementary imaging techniques
      using different pulse sequences. The investigators propose to provide a multi-sequence CMR
      evaluation of a spectrum of convalescent COVID-19 patients, compare COVID-19 survivors to
      controls, and study the relationships between myocardial characteristics by CMR and
      echocardiography and health outcomes, and how these are modulated through patient
      characteristics, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 illness. Broadly, this myocardial
      characterization will not just provide diagnosis but serve as a potentially powerful tool for
      risk stratification, therapeutic decision making, and monitoring response to therapies in
      COVID-19 survivors.

      Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most widely used imaging technique for the
      assessment of cardiac morphology and function. While its capability for myocardial tissue
      characterization is inferior to that of CMR, TTE provides several advantages that make it an
      ideal complement to CMR for the assessment of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients. TTE
      offers a rapid noninvasive evaluation of myocardial and valvular function, in addition to the
      assessment of other cardiac abnormalities of interest (such as presence and amount of
      pericardial effusion) and important hemodynamic variables (noninvasive estimation of
      pulmonary pressures is an example). TTE is easily performed and reproducible, and does not
      involve the use of radiations or contrast agents, which allows the performance of repeat
      evaluations to assess serial changes over time in the cardiac parameters of interest.
