      anticonvulsant drugs may be effective, but often partially only, and not always well
      tolerated. Valproate is a well-known anticonvulsant drug, with moderate possible adverse
      events and for which an intravenous form is available.

      Aim. The principal aim is to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium Valproate in peripheral
      neuropathic pain. Secondary aims are to asses the effect of IV and oral treatment on
      neurophysiologic measures.

      Design. Randomized, double-blind vs. placebo, parallel groups, monocentric clinical trial.

      Treatments. Experimental arm: Intravenous eight-hour sodium Valproate infusion, followed by a
      four-week oral route sodium Valproate treatment. Control arm: Intravenous eight-hour placebo
      infusion, followed by a four-week oral route placebo treatment. Rescue medications are
      allowed in both groups.

      Eligibility criteria. Peripheral neuropathic pain with pain intensity of at least 40 mm on a
      visual analog scale.

      Outcomes. Primary outcome is the intensity of pain on a visual analog scale after 4 weeks of
      treatment. Secondary outcomes: intensity of pain after IV treatment; neurophysiologic
      measures (thermal thresholds, RIII reflex); association of response to IV treatment with oral
      treatment efficacy.
