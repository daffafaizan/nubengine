           We experienced that severe FOG was markedly improved by IV amantadine in the patients
           who had Parkinson's disease. But IV drug may have placebo effect. Therefore, We designed
           double blind, placebo controlled study to know whether IV amantadine is effective in the
           patient with dopaminergic-drug-resistant freezing of gait(FOG).

        2. Cross over study design

             -  Compare the change of FOGQ(freezing of gait questionaire) score from the baseline
                to IV amantadine and placebo drug

             -  randomized assigned order of amantadine and placebo drug.

             -  investigator of FOG: blinded to the order of drugs

             -  each patient has IV drug for 2 days for each drug
