    
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments in the affected
      eyelid:

        -  SUN-131 1.5% TDS (n=30)

        -  Placebo TDS (n=30)

      At baseline prior to application of the TDS an assessment will be performed on both the
      subject's eyes including the chalazion site itself.

      All subjects will return to the site on Days 8±1, 15±2 and 23±2 for evaluations. During the
      the 23±2 visit, a clinical evaluation will be performed to determine if the chalazion is
      still present.

      There will also be follow up on Day 29±3, and on Day 50 visit (study days 47 to 60) to
      evaluate the safety and durability of the effect of the SUN-131 1.5% TDS.

      Data review and safety assessments will be conducted by the medical monitor periodically
      throughout the trial and at the conclusion of the study.
