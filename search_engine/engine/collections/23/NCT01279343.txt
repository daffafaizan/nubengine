      indications. Although there are several techniques and methods for induction of labor, the
      best agent and method still remains uncertain. To date, there has been no randomized trial
      comparing foley bulb plus vaginal misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol alone. The
      combination of a mechanical device (foley bulb) and synthetic prostaglandin may have an
      additive or synergistic effect, resulting in greater degree of cervical ripening and shorter
      induction to delivery time (IDT). The addition of a synthetic prostaglandin to the foley bulb
      may also overcome the frequent observation of cervical dilation to 4cm by the foley bulb
      without effacement.
