      persistent cough primarily affecting infants and young children. Repeated administration of
      the vaccine is often needed to reduce the disease burden and control its transmission. At
      this time, no data are available on the epidemiology of pertussis in adolescents and adults
      in Kazakhstan.

      The aim of the present study is to estimate the prevalence of pertussis infection in
      different age groups in Kazakh children and adolescents using the anti-pertussis toxin (PT)
      antibodies (IgA and IgG) as specific marker of pertussis infection or vaccination. The
      serosurvey will be conducted in 4 different regions: Aktobe, Karaganda, Taldykorgan, and
      Shymkent.

      Participants (â‰¥ 10 years & < 19 years) attending the study centers will be asked to
      participate in the study. The adolescent participants and the parents/guardian(s) of all
      participants will be informed about the procedures and data handling. Written informed
      consent from one parent/guardian needs to be obtained by the physician before any blood
      samples can be taken.

      Upon obtaining informed consent for participant parent/guardian, the study coordinator will
      complete an investigation form (IF) for each participant and collect serum samples. The
      specimens will be coded by a unique participant number and delivered to the laboratory in
      charge of the assay. The specimens will be used for serological analyses.
