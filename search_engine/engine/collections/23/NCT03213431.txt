    
      Pediatric participants will undergo a 30-45 minute cognitive interview including three
      sections:

        1. Introduction to the study and warm-up debriefing exercise.

        2. Determination of participant's level of understanding by arranging circles of different
           sizes.

        3. Completion of individual surveys including the Child Health & Illness Profile-Child
           Edition/Child Report Form (CHIP-CE/CRF), the Applied Cognition scale of the Neuro-QOL,
           and the Pediatric Perceived Cognitive Function (PedPCF - Child).

      For patient participants who have not had IQ testing within the prior 3 years, IQ testing may
      be repeated.

      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with parents/legal guardians of pediatric
      participants including:

        1. Open-ended questions to help researchers understand whether their child is able to
           complete the CHIP-CE/CRF, Applied Cognition scale of the Neuro-QOL, and the PedPCF -
           Child.

        2. Concerns they may have about cognitive functioning issues and its importance for their
           child. They will also be asked their thoughts on how to communicate and interact
           effectively with children and adolescents who have cognitive delays and their feedback
           about a user-friendly way to collect patient-reported health data.

        3. The pediatric participant responses will be compared with their parent/legal guardian
           responses to confirm the answers were accurate and to evaluate whether the child can
           recall appropriate information for a given time frame.

      Interviews will be conducted primarily on the St. Jude campus, or via Skype video meeting as
      a secondary option.
