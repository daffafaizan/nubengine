      comparative effectiveness study. Patients with acute stroke will be studied by both TTE and
      TEE. Patients with already defined stroke etiology and determined secondary prevention will
      be excluded from the trial. Treatment relevant diagnostic findings will be identified by a
      central endpoint adjudication committee. In order to demonstrate a hypothesized 2% absolute
      increase in the number of treatment relevant diagnostic findings by TEE as compared to TTE,
      880 stroke patients will be enrolled in six German stroke centers. CONTEST will allow
      answering the question whether and for which group of stroke patients TEE is indicated in
      addition to TTE. By this, the study will provide evidence to guide justified recommendations
      for echocardiography in acute stroke patients.
