      activation of the fear extinction network in women. Functional MRI data and
      psychophysiological indices were collected to test the influence of estrogen on women's
      ability to regulate conditioned fear responses. Women underwent a 3 day experimental paradigm
      using classical fear conditioning. The first day was conducted outside the scanner, while
      days 2 and 3 were done inside the fMRI scanner and tested fear extinction learning and recall
      in days 2 and 3, respectively. The estrogen (or placebo) pill was given just hours before
      extinction learning test on day 2. No followups were conducted after women completed the 3
      day study.
