      hepatic colorectal metastases (TRG1: complete pathological response; TRG2: major pathological
      response; TRG3: partial pathological response; versus TRG4-5 no pathological response) and
      outcome in terms of survival after neoadjuvant treatment. In particular, retrospective data
      showed an association between oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and improvement of grade and
      percentage of tumor regression; moreover, the addition of Bevacizumab seems to improve TRG
      over chemotherapy alone, conferring also a protection against liver damage due to
      chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

      This is the rationale that induced us to carry out an evaluation and feasibility assessment
      of a perioperative approach with COI-B regimen in patients affected by high risk or
      borderline resectable colorectal liver metastases, with or without previous resection of
      primary tumor.
