      metastatic cancer in the parietal pleural surface treated with CryoSpray at dye marked
      metastatic foci.

      Initial treatment dosimetry will be up to 3 cycles of 10-40 second sprays. If necessary,
      dosimetry changes may occur after 3 subjects are treated and observed. It is unknown if
      dosimetry will need to be increased to enhance effectiveness. The PI may increase dosimetry
      by 1 cycle after each subject is treated and observed as a conservative approach to efficacy
      determination. If disease exists bilaterally, only one side will be sprayed.
