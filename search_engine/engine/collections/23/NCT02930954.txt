      to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations.This is a phase II clinical trial to
      investigate the efficacy of combination treatment for patients harboring risk factors.

      Advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC Patients with Bim deletion or EGFR low mutation abundance were
      randomizely divided into three treatment groups:

      A:Gefitinib 250mg Qd B:Gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with doublet chemotherapy: Pemetrexed
      (500mg/m²day 1 intravenously) plus carboplatin (AUC=5,day 1,intravenously) every 21 days,
      Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² days 1, day8, intravenously) plus carboplatin (AUC=5,day
      1,intravenously) every 21 days C:Gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg
      intravenously per 21 days.
