      efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile.

      The aim of this phase 1b/2, two stage, open label study of MMC/Capecitabine ChRT combined
      with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy stuy is: to assess
      the feasibility and safety, the disease free survival (DFS) and disease free survival rate
      (DFS-rate) of the addition of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab to MMC/capecitabine chemoradiation
      of the bladder.
