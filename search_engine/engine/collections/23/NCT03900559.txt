      population that flies experiences intense distress during the flight; around 10% of the
      general population does not fly due to intense fear and 20% of people depend on alcohol or
      tranquilizers to overcome the fear of flying.

      In vivo exposure is the most effective psychological treatment for specific phobias. However,
      not all patients benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of them do not
      accept the intervention, drop out when they are informed about the intervention procedure, or
      they have problems to access these therapies.

      Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can improve treatment adherence and
      acceptance. Particularly, computerized programs offer remarkable advantages such as a
      reduction in direct therapeutic contact time, the possibility of standardizing treatment as
      much as possible with a steep exposure gradient, the low cost and, maybe most importantly,
      access to patients who would not be very willing to subject themselves to in vivo exposure.
      The application of cognitive-behavioural procedures such as exposure through interactive
      computer programs is especially recommended. Finally, with the replicability crisis in the
      psychological field, there is a need to carry out more replication studies and confirm those
      findings.

      On the other hand, it is important to explore the role of the degree of immersion and sense
      of presence in the psychological treatments with iCBTs due to the contradictory conclusions
      that had been found in the literature. Therefore, it is expected that the present work
      advances in the knowledge in this field exploring these factors in an Internet-based
      self-applied treatment program for FP.
