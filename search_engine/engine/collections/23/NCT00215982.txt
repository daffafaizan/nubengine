      with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine and Irinotecan.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the time to tumor progression and the toxicity and
      tolerability of Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine and Irinotecan when administered in combination.
      Study schema is as follows. Cycles are 42 days long. Patients will receive Oxaliplatin and
      Capecitabine on day 1. Capecitabine is an oral pill that will be taken for 14 days. Patients
      return again on day 21 when they receive Irinotecan and Capecitabine. Capecitabine again is
      taken for 14 days. CT scans are performed at the end of the 6 week cycle to determine
      response.
