      frequent cause of joint pain, functional loss, and disability. Osteoarthritis often becomes
      chronic, and conventional treatments seek to ameliorate pain or improve mobility. However,
      these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease.Recent studies cell-based have shown
      encouraging results in both animal studies and a few human case reports. We designed a study
      to assess the safety and efficacy of osteoarthritis treatment with intra-articular injection
      of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
