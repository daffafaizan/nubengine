      However, some patients will relapse after CAR-T cells therapy, and because of previous
      multicycles chemotherapy it's very difficult to abtain enough lymphocytes for preparation of
      antologous CAR-T cells. The exploration of alternative source of lymphocytes for CAR-T cells
      preparation has important clinical implications for such patients. We evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of cord blood-derived CAR-T cells in such patients, and to explore effective
      treatment options for such patients.
