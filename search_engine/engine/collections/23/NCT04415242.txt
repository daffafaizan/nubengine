    
      The position currently used in cases of pulmonary lobectomies by videothoracoscopy is an
      extension associated with an abduction of the shoulder on the side operated by suspension of
      the thoracic limb in a trampoline-type arm support with an angulation of more than 90 ° of
      the shoulder in the saggital and frontal planes.

      The investigators wish to prospectively and randomly compare this position currently used in
      the thoracic surgery service of the IUCPQ with a 2nd position which seems less restrictive
      for all the joints of the shoulder joint complex in which the patient's arm rests on a
      support placed in front of the patient's face. It follows from this position of the joint
      degrees less than or equal to 90 ° in all planes. This new position is not experimental, but
      not normally used in thoracic surgery at the IUCPQ.
