        -  Compare blue light fluorescent cystoscopy with reconstituted hexyl 5-aminolevulinate
           (Hexvix®) vs white light cystoscopy for the detection of carcinoma in situ (CIS) in
           patients with bladder cancer.

        -  Compare the positive and false detection rates of histologically confirmed non-CIS
           lesions and dysplasia by these modalities in these patients.

        -  Compare the false detection rate of histologically confirmed CIS lesions by these
           modalities in these patients.

        -  Compare the number of tumor lesions and dysplasia detected by these modalities in these
           patients.

        -  Compare management of patients after evaluation with these modalities.

        -  Determine the safety of reconstituted hexyl 5-aminolevulinate (Hexvix®) in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo bladder catheterization and instillation of reconstituted hexyl
      5-aminolevulinate (Hexvix®). After 60 minutes the bladder is evacuated, and the patient
      undergoes cystoscopic examination of the bladder by white light and then blue light
      fluorescence. Biopsies are taken of all suspicious areas seen under white and/or blue light
      modalities, and one normal-appearing area seen under both light modalities, and papillary
      lesions are resected.

      Patients are followed at 7 days after procedure.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
