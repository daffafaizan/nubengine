    
      1. To determine in a case control study clinical parameters associated with drug HSR to
           abacavir, nevirapine and efavirenz in HIV infected subjects.

        2. To measure functional and numerical differences in DC populations and responses to TLR
           ligands in patients with HSR and tolerant subjects sharing genetic markers for
           susceptibility to HSR.

        3. Identify the role of different DC populations in the development of abacavir reaction by
           mixing and depletion studies in sensitized subjects and in in vitro assays for abacavir
           hypersensitivity.

        4. To measure T cell parameters including T cell viability in culture, and expression of
           fas and fasL on blood mononuclear cells in HIV infected controls and HSR patients.

        5. To measure blood T cell populations including drug reactive T cells and T regulatory
           cells in tolerant and reactive subjects with genetic susceptibility to Abacavir and
           Nevirapine HSR.
