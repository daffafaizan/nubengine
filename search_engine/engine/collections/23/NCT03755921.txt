      intervention group with intensive brief therapy and 10 in the control group with traditional

      life will be applied before and after speech therapy. The control group will receive speech
      therapy with weekly frequency, and the intervention group will participate in a brief and
      intensive therapy program that will take place during five days a week for three weeks,
      totaling fifteen sessions. The sessions will be of 40 minutes and, in both groups, the
      patients will receive care of individualized form, according to their needs.
