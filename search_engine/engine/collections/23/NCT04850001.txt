      before and after 1-year standard medical treatment. Upon meeting the inclusion criteria and
      providing informed consent, each participant will complete a battery measure of
      neuropsychological tests and Magnetic Resonance imaging scan in multimodalities within 7 days
      after admission and after 1-year when patients received standard medical treatment at the
      First Affiliated Hospital of AnHui Medical University. participants were randomly allocated
      to patient group and the control group.There are about 20 patients and 20 healthy controls in
      this study.

      Firstly, a series of neuropsychological tests were obtained by a trained investigator to
      assess baseline. Each assessment will involve a set of assessment tools, the memory as the
      primary outcome measure and various other tasks and questionnaires to measure cognition
      (including MoCA,MMSE, DS, Stroop test, TMT, VFT), memory (CAVLT), emotion (HAMA-17,HAMD-14),
      behavioral and psychological symptoms(NPI). All the tests are conducted in two days. The
      patients had receiving a magnetic resonance imaging scan in multi-modalities.

      After 1-year standard medical treatment,the patients participants were interviewed to obtain
      the same assessment and magnetic resonance imaging scan in multi-modalities as before.
      Patients are instructed to focus their answers on the past 15 days. The clinical symptom of
      participants were followed 6 and 12 months after the admission. Afterwards, they were
      unblinded by the study coordinator.
