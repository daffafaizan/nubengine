    
      Patients detected positive for one of the three (Sexually Transmitted Infection)STIs
      (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Mycoplasma genitalium) on one site will be
      re-sampled twice at each of the three sites (pharynx, rectum, urine) before receiving
      antibiotics. Then, a real-time multiplex PCR will be performed on the pooled sample (merging
      pharyngeal, anorectal and urinary samples) versus on each of the three samples separately
      (i.e. standard of care) to compare both sensitivities.
