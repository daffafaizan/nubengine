      occurrence admitted into NICU of Xuanwu Hospital as well as 40 healthy volunteers will be
      recruited. The patients' baseline characteristics, treatment and changes of clinical
      conditions will be recorded, and ICP monitoring (D2-D7 post-stroke), chest X-ray (D2, D7, D14
      post-stroke), ECG (D2, D7, D14 post-stroke), cerebral vascular ultrasound, TCD and head MRI
      (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, DWI) on D2 and D14 post-stroke will be performed. Blood samples from both
      the LHI patients (D2, D4, D7, and D14 post-stroke) and the controls will be analyzed for NEU,
      TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MPO, NE, MMP-9,miRNA, free dsDNA, H3CIT
      and NETosis levels. All patients were treated for brain edema with osmotic medications-either
      intravenous 20% mannitol or 10% hypertonic saline. In addition, some patients were treated
      with decompressive surgery.The patients will be followed up to 6 months and their modified
      Rankin Scale (mRS) will be recorded. A mRS score of 0-4 is considered as a favorable outcome
      while a score of 5-6 as an unfavorable one. Statistical differences in the different
      parameters between different groups at different time points will be analyzed by SPSS 22.0
      software.
