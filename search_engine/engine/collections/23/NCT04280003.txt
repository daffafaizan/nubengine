      study, recruiting a total of 30 patients between them both. After confirming that patients
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, informed consent will be
      signed and randomization will take place (1:1). There are two different groups of treatment;
      the first group will be treated with intravenous alogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells
      (at a concentration of one million cells per kg) within the first four days from stroke
      onset, the second group will be treated will an intravenous placebo solution. Follow-up will
      last for 24 months during which safety issues such as adverse events and neurological and
      systemic complications will be assessed at 24 hours, 7 days and 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months
      after treatment. Neurological disability using the modified Rankin Scale and National
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale will also be registered in every scheduled visit.
      Biochemical markers of tissue repair (GM-CSF, BDNF, VEGF, TGF-1, GFAP, MBP, MMP-3) as well as
      extracellular vesicles will be extracted on baseline visit as well as 7 days and 3 months
      after treatment.
