      being used more commonly for many blood cancers which are not curable with more conventional
      methods of chemotherapy. Although allo-HSCT has great potential, there are still high risks
      due to infections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), where the donor's cells attack the
      recipient's tissues as foreign, and due to toxic effects of the chemotherapy drugs given to
      prepare (or condition) the recipient's bone marrow for transplant.

      As a reduced intensity conditioning, a combination of Fludarabine and a lower dose of
      Busulfan (Flu/BU2) is one of the most popular regimens. Among full-intensity regimens, a
      combination of Fludarabine and standard-dose Busulfan (Flu/BU4) has been investigated
      recently and shown to be very well tolerated.

      Clofarabine, similar to Fludarabine, is known to have a stronger anti-tumor effect than
      Fludarabine and has shown promise in treating aggressive acute leukemias. In addition,
      evidence is that it is well-tolerated with manageable side effects especially in older
      subjects. Thus replacing Fludarabine with Clofarabine in a full-intensity transplant regimen,
      Clo/BU4 may provide a regimen with increased anti-tumor activity without adding significant
      risks of toxicity.

      The goals of the study are (Phase I) to determine the appropriate dose for Clofarabine with
      Busulfan as a full-intensity regimen (Clo/BU4) and then (Phase II) to investigate the safety
      and effectiveness of this regimen as a conditioning for HSCT in the treatment for aggressive
      hematologic malignancies, in subjects where more conventional approaches are failing.
