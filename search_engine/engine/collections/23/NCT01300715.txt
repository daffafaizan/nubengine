      since the 20th century. According to the previous reports, degenerative changes of facet
      joint account for 10% - 15% of the cases with chronic low back pain. However, it is a major
      source of frustration that there is no definitive standard to document a clinical diagnosis
      and few validated treatment about lumbar facet joint pain.

      Although it has been a subject of debate how best to select patients, radiofrequency (RF)
      neurotomy is frequently performed procedure for patients with lumbar facet generated pain.
      Lumbar medial branch radiofrequency (MBRF) is assumed to be effective and safe treatment for
      lumbar facet joint pain with 1.0% rate of minor complications per lesion site. The rationale
      and efficacy of lumbar MBRF would depend on the use of meticulous radiofrequency (RF) needle
      placement with stringent patient selection.

      In spite that variable techniques for lumbar MBRF exists, the tunnel vision technique is
      widely recommended for exact RF needle placement. However, this method uses the concept of a
      steep caudocephalad axial tilt of the fluoroscopy beam, which result in unusual appearance of
      vertebral structures and a long distance from skin to the target site. In our institution,
      therefore, the investigators have used a modified method that is easy and safe to place RF
      needle parallel to the lumbar medial branch in oblique fluoroscopic view.

      Accordingly, our objectives were to evaluate our modified technique for lumbar MBRF,
      comparing with the tunnel vision technique, and additionally to assess complications with
      respect to these two techniques.
