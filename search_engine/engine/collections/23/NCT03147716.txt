      health disorders. Unfortunately, few parents participate in parenting programs when given the
      opportunity. Thus, developing effective strategies to increase engagement in effective
      preventive parenting interventions is essential for these programs to have a significant
      public health impact. The purpose of this study is to identify parent engagement strategies
      that increase participation in effective parenting programs and consequently improve
      parenting practices and children's well-being.
