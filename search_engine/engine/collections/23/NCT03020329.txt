      young patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil
      and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
