    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label Phase I trial in patients with previously treated,
      recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Patients may have either
      platinum -sensitive (relapse > 12 months from primary therapy) or platinum-resistant (relapse
      â‰¤ 12 months from primary therapy) disease.

      Up to 20 patients will be enrolled into each of the following arms:

        -  Arm 1 patients will receive intravenous docetaxel at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over 1
           hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal oxaliplatin on day #2 until maximum tolerated
           dose is achieved.

        -  Arm 2 patients will receive intravenous oxaliplatin at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over
           1 hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal docetaxel on day #2 until maximum tolerated
           dose is achieved.

      Treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity.
