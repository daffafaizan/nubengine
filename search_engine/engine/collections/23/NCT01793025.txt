    
      The ATAC cell therapy product contains unselected, non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells from related donors who are mismatched to the recipients at 3 or more (out of 6) HLA
      loci. Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated at each of four pre-specified dose levels (T
      cells per kg recipient weight). One ATAC infusion is administered 24-48 hours following
      re-induction chemotherapy (for relapsed or primary refractory AML patients not in remission).
      In situations where ATAC infusion is not available immediately following re-induction
      chemotherapy and patients nonetheless achieve complete remission, one ATAC infusion is given
      24-48 hours after consolidation chemotherapy.
