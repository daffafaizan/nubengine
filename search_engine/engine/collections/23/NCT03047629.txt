    
      Phase 1 will enroll 10 patients to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single escalating doses over a 30-60 day period. The dose-escalation period will be preceded
      by a 2-week run in period and followed by a 2-week wash-out period.

      Phase 2 follow the safe completion of Phase 1. It will enroll 40 patients and is composed of
      4 periods of study: 1) a 2-week run-in period, 2) a 3-5 week escalating dose period to
      identify a prokinetic dose in the initial set of 10 patients, 3) a 1-week period of
      randomized dosing (placebo versus the previously identified pro-kinetic dose), and 4) a
      2-week wash-out period. Pharmacodynamics will be assessed along with safety and tolerability.
      Relative outcomes will be compared within each patient and across groups for the randomized
      dosing period.

      Frequency of bowel movements and other non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease will be
      collected over the course of both phases.
