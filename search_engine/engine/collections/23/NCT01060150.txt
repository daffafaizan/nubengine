      prospective (study following participants forward in time), single arm, multicenter study
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) of OROS
      methylphenidate HCl. The study will consist of 6 visits at Screening, Baseline, Week 1, 3, 6
      and 12. The participants already on other ADHD medications in addition to methylphenidate
      will be required to undergo a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least
      1 week. The participants will be on once daily study medication starting at 18 milligram per
      day (mg/day) in participants with less than 30 kilogram (kg) of body weight or at 27 mg/day
      in participants with more than 30 kg. The dose will be increased by 9 mg or 18 mg every week
      for up to Week 6 based on the treatment efficacy and tolerability, followed by a maximum
      maintenance dose of 72 mg orally once daily up to Week 12, during which the dose can be
      decreased by 9 mg depending on tolerability. Efficacy will primarily be assessed using
      Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale, Clinical Global Impression
      of Improvement of Illness (CGI-I) scale, Korean version of ADHD-IV Rating Scale (K-ARS) and
      Learning Skill Test (LST) score. Participants' safety will be monitored.
