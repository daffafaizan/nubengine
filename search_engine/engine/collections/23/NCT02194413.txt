      I. To estimate the effects of healing touch (HT) vs usual care in the following clinical
      outcomes of stem cell transplant (SCT) patients; length of hospital stay, days to
      engraftment, and number of hospital readmissions during 100 days post-transplant.

      II. To estimate changes in quality of life (QoL) which occur during hospitalization of SCT
      patients who receive HT vs. usual care.

      III. To examine differences in effects of HT vs. usual care (UC) in patients receiving
      related allogeneic (Allo) transplant compared to those receiving autologous (Auto)
      transplant.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive daily HT sessions comprising pain drain, chakra connection, magnetic
      clearing, and mind clearing over 30 minutes from day 1 until 2 days before discharge from the
      hospital.

      ARM II: Patients receive routine nursing care from doctors and nurses from day 1 until 2 days
      before discharge from the hospital.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
