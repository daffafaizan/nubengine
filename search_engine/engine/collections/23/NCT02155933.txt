      hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenemia during adolescence can be a forerunner of adult PCOS.
      However, the progression of hormonal abnormalities leading to PCOS are unclear. We will
      examine hormonal profiles (e.g., LH, FSH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol) during
      pubertal maturation in adolescent girls with and without elevated plasma androgens. The
      working hypothesis is that, in pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia, overnight rises of
      progesterone are associated with a reduction of LH frequency during the waking morning hours.
      However, in pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, LH frequency will be higher than normal
      during both the day and night, despite similar or higher progesterone levels. The studies
      will involve frequent blood sampling over 18 hours. We will assess differences in hormone
      parameters between time blocks (1900-2300 h, 2300-0300 h, 0300-0700 h, 0700-1100 h) in
      individuals to evaluate day-night changes. We will compare such changes between those with
      hyperandrogenemia and those without hyperandrogenemia.
