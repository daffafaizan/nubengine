      in clinical practice enhance the ability to evaluate the heart from both an anatomical and
      functional perspective. It is hypothesized that an increased PET signal of 18F-Florbetaben
      (NeuraceqÂ®) will be detected in cardiac amyloid deposits within the heart tissue, while the
      MRI provides the anatomical information. The ability to reliably and non-invasively image
      amyloid deposition in the heart would be potentially advantageous in the following scenarios:

        1. Diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis

        2. Decreasing unnecessary invasive myocardial procedures.

      The investigators believe this trial will help expand the use of current PET amyloid tracers
      and help many patients who currently undergo myocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of cardiac
      amyloid.
