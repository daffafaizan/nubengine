      shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health
      outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the
      absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the
      main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with
      advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other
      residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence
      suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of
      care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up
      and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when
      hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection
      management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and
      reduce the public health threat of MDROs.

      This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data
      analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an
      intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with
      advanced dementia (N=410; N=205/arm) living in NHs (N=28; N=14/arm). The NH is the unit of
      randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid
      contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will
      be at the patient level.
