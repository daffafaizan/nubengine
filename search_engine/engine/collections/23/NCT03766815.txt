      major limitations are the lack of enough data on the amount and duration of branched-chain
      amino acid supplementation, and the level of muscle damage for branched-chain amino acid to
      be effective. Based on a recent meta-analysis, it has been suggested that to be effective,
      branched-chain amino acid should be supplemented more than 200mg/kg/day before a
      low-to-moderate intensity exercise bout. Therefore, this study is designed based on the above
      suggestions and to compare the effect of different doses of branched-chain amino acid on
      muscle damage markers in healthy recreational active individuals.

      Three treatment groups (n=26) will be randomly assigned to be supplemented with either 200mg
      BCAA/kg/day (BCAA200), 400mg BCAA/kg/day (BCAA400) or placebo (fiber supplement; PL).
      Supplements will be provided in jelly in a single blind fashion to be ingested 1hour after
      each of the three main daily meals for 18days. Anthropometric measurements (body weight, lean
      mass, height), body temperature, ultrasound (US), strength assessment (maximal voluntary
      contraction, MVC), resting metabolic rate (RMR), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), delayed
      onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) and blood samples (duplicates; myoglobin; BCAA) will be
      collected before, during and after the supplementation period at different time points (see
      appendix for the above tables). Repeated-bout effect (RBE) on both arms will be measured 7
      days after the damage inducing session.
