      hernia repair with the 3D prosthesis named ProFlor. Scope of the study was to determine the
      presence, quantity and quality of the vascular elements ingrowth within the implant fabric.
      Histology revealed the presence of multiple angiogenetic clusters that, starting from the
      early stage post-implantation, increased in number and degree of maturation. In the long
      term, the detected vascular components assumed the typical aspect of mature veins and
      arteries complete in all components. The development of fully developed vascular structures,
      ingrowing together with other components of the abdominal wall already described in
      literature, seems to finalize a regenerative response. This kind of behavior, being the
      expected result from a device intended for the cure of inguinal hernia and its degenerative
      source, seems to be coherent with the pathogenesis of the disease.
