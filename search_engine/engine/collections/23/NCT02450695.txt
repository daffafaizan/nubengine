      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: active rTMS or
      sham rTMS. The "sham" rTMS is the inactive form of the treatment where the experience during
      the sessions will be similar to an active rTMS session, but it will have no medical value.
      During these 3 weeks, they will attend a session each day for 5 days per week at Mood
      Disorders Clinic located at St. Joseph's Healthcare. Each of these sessions will be an hour
      long totalling 15 visits in the first 3 weeks. After every 5 sessions they will be asked to
      complete the following self-report questionnaires: Baratt Impulsiveness Scale, Hamilton
      Anxiety Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The clinician-rated: Clinical
      Global Impression Scale and Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales will also be completed.

      The two treatment phases will be separated by a flexible wash-out of a minimum of one week
      where participants will not attend any visits.

      After this, they will begin the second treatment phase (three weeks) which will be the
      treatment condition they were not previously assigned to. In other words, individuals
      previously on the active rTMS treatment will now begin sham rTMS treatment and vice versa.
      These sessions will be identical to those involved in the first treatment phase, except the
      treatment condition will be different. Before and after each treatment session they will also
      be asked a series of questions to rate potential rTMS side effects and complete a cognitive
      task known as the "Go/no-go task."
