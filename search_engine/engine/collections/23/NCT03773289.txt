    
      The aim of this study is to investigate current and recent patterns of drug utilisation in
      neonatal units in the UK.

      We will conduct a retrospective pharmacoepidemiological study of a large prospectively
      collected database (The National Neonatal Research Database -REC Number 16/LO/1093). The
      study will use de-identified historical data recorded in this database. There is no patient
      recruitment and the project involves no changes to patient care. The data to be used for this
      project are stored in de-identified form.

      Data items will include descriptive, background data to allow for age and gestation at the
      time of drug use and subgroup analysis (such as birth weight, gestational age, clinical
      condition, day of drug use) and data on drug use (name of drug and age at use).
