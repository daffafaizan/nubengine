    
      If eligible and choose to participate, this study includes:

      A baseline assessment which will include asking a series of questions about parent, child and
      family, as well as parent-child observations.

      If eligible for treatment, sessions occur once per week for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.
      Sessions include new information and lots of practice and discussion about how to make the
      skills work best for specific families.

      After finishing treatment a post-assessment (similar to BL) conducted.

      All of the assessments (i.e., video-and audio-recorded), as well as the sessions with a
      therapist will be recorded (i.e., video recorded).
