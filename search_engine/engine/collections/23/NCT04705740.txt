      endoscopist has been shown to influence the outcomes of the procedure, especially on the
      papillary cannulation rate and the adverse effects rate. The number of ERCPs performed
      annually by each endoscopist is directly related to the number of endoscopists who perform
      this procedure, since the total number of ERCPs performed annually at each center is usually
      constant.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the number of endoscopists who perform ERCP in a
      hospital influences the results of the procedure, so that the fewer the number of
      endoscopists the better the results.

      To evaluate this hypothesis, the investigators have designed a retrospective study analyzing
      data from a prospectively filled database, which includes all ERCPs performed in our center
      from September 2013 to June 2020. For organizative reasons unrelated to the endoscopy unit,
      in the center it has beed progressively reduced the number of endoscopists who perform ERCP,
      starting from 5 endoscopists at the beginning of the study to 3 endoscopists at the end of
      the study inclusion period. In fact, three different periods of similar duration can be
      distinguished: September 2013 to August 2015 (5 endoscopists), September 2015 to December
      2017 (4 endoscopists) and January 2018 to June 2020 (3 endoscopists).

      The outcomes obtained with ERCP in these three periods will be analyzed and compared,
      assessing the cannulation rate and the adverse effects rate as the main comparison
      parameters.
