      As a person-focused, proactive approach, Health TAPESTRY incorporates trained community
      volunteers into the primary care team in a way that is seamless and complementary to the
      essential work that clinicians are undertaking each day. In the program, volunteers conduct
      home visits with older adult clients, complete questionnaires, and connect their clients to
      primary care and community resources. This study offers the opportunity to fill a major gap
      in the literature by investigating the experiences of volunteers within Health TAPESTRY and
      the effect on them of participation as an intervention in its own right.

      Specifically, the study seeks to understand volunteers' experiences in the program and
      evaluate any effects that volunteering with the program has on the volunteers including with
      the volunteers health and wellness (specifically physical activity and quality of life),
      empathy, and attitudes toward older adults. The investigators will also look at how the
      volunteers patterns of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction might change throughout
      involvement in the program, and how that connects to volunteer demographic characteristics
      like age and gender, as well as other characteristics like empathy, how many home visits are
      conducted, and the initial motivation to volunteer with the program.

      This program evaluation study will employ qualitative and quantitative data collection
      strategies including surveys, narratives written by volunteers, and volunteer focus groups.
