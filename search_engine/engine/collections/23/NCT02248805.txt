    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation study to define a MTD, describe
      preliminarily safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of
      MGD007 in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

      In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation,
      once weekly and once every three weeks administration of single agent MGD007. Following the
      establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in four separate dose expansion
      cohorts to further optimize the dose and schedule of MGD007 administration.

      In all segments of the study, patients who benefit from MGD007 treatment and continue to meet
      eligibility may continue treatment in Cycles 2 and beyond.
