      comfort in non-presbyopic contact lens wearers. Current soft contact lens wearers who have
      symptoms of discomfort in their contact lenses will be recruited. Each subject (n = 84) will
      wear a single vision soft contact lens (Ultra single vision spherical lens) for two weeks and
      a low add power multifocal (Ultra for Presbyopia) for two weeks. Half of the subjects will
      wear the single vision lens first, and half of the subjects will wear the multifocal lens
      first. Initial lens group will be chosen randomly. Subjects will complete surveys that assess
      their vision and comfort which each lens, and ocular surface and accommodative/binocular
      vision status will be evaluated at the initial dispense and after wearing each lens for two
      weeks.
