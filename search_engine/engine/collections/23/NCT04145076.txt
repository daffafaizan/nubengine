      spectrum disorder (ASD), with the standard treatment for depression and anxiety in both the
      general population and ASD includes targeting the 5-HT system with selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram. Some individuals with ASD have a good treatment
      response but others do not. Tianeptine, which has a different mechanism of action to SSRIs,
      is also an effective antidepressant. As it is unlikely that all individuals with ASD will
      respond to the same treatment, the investigators aim to conduct a pharmacological magnetic
      resonance imaging (phMRI) investigation to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the
      response to citalopram and tianeptine in ASD. The investigators are inviting 50 male adults
      with ASD and 50 male adults without ASD. Each participant receives each drug once (20 mg
      citalopram, 12.5 mg tianeptine, or placebo) and MRI is used to obtain measures of brain
      biochemistry, activity, and connectivity. The investigators also acquire data from
      questionnaires, electroencephalography, neurocognitive tests and blood samples.
