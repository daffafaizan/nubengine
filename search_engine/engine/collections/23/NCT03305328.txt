      disorders characterized by aberrations in the neural oscillations that orchestrate various
      mental activities. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) provides an effective
      way to directly modulate these oscillations in a non-invasive and frequency-specific manner,
      offering groundbreaking insights into the workings of the brain and, importantly, the
      development of novel treatments for these oscillopathies. However, evidence is lacking for
      the ability of tACS to induce long-term neural plasticity and lasting behavioral changes,
      which is critical for establishing the clinical utility of this novel intervention.

      Here, we are administering 30 minutes of alpha-frequency tACS over occipitoparietal sites for
      four consecutive days to evaluate both transient and long-term changes in alpha oscillatory
      power and long-range, directed oscillatory connectivity. As both anxious arousal and sensory
      sensitivity are highly related to alpha oscillations, as well as numerous neuropsychiatric
      disorders, changes in these behavioral outcomes were subsequently evaluated to assess
      clinically-relevant outcomes of the repeated tACS protocol.
