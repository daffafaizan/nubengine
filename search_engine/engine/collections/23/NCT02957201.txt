      implantation.

      All patients awaiting LAA or PFO/ASD occlusion will firstly be reviewed in a cardiology
      clinic and assessed. Suitable patients will then be placed on a waiting list for occlusion
      device implantation and therefore identified as potential participants in the study.
      Patient-participants will be informed of the trial and given a chance to participate, this
      may be by face to face and or via invitation letter. All patient-participants will be given a
      copy of the patient information sheet.

      Formal consent to participate in the trial will occur on the morning of the procedure. This
      will avoid repeated visits by patients that may have to travel some considerable distance.

      The study will recruit 20 patients divided intoÍ¾ 10 patients undergoing PFO/ASD occlusion and
      10 patients undergoing LAA occlusion. EPC will be measured on the day of the device
      implantation, day 0 and prior to discharge on day 1, then on subsequent follow up
      appointments on days (3-4) and (7-8). Blood samples of 3-5ml will be taken to allow flow
      cytometric analysis for EPCs.

      Standard follow up for participants may include transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) at 3
      months after implantation. This will give a direct assessment of device related thrombus.
      Currently TOE is not standard of care in PFO follow up. If a TOE result is available for
      either group the investigators will use the results in our study.
