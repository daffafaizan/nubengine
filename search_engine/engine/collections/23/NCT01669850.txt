      Achieving vascular access is an important step in receiving hemodialysis. Recent national
      goals have established that approximately 65% of all dialysis access points should be
      arteriovenous fistulas due to higher patency rates and decreased rates of further surgeries.
      Multiple studies have been done to assess optimal suture technique for arteriovenous
      anastomoses. The use of clips versus a handsewn technique has been evaluated in retrospective
      studies with some reports indicating a higher primary patency rate with a clip technique.
      Further study is needed to definitively determine the technique that results in the highest
      patency rates and lowest rate of re-operation. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether hand-sewn anastomosis versus a clipped technique is associated with more
      complications, failures, surgical cost and surgical time by randomizing patients to either a
      clipped anastomosis group or a handsewn anastomosis group.
