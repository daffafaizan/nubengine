      this 4 weeks study. A screening visit will be used to determine eligibility for the study.
      Patients found eligible will receive alpha agonist ointment or placebo ointment for 2 weeks.
      This will be followed by a second 2 weeks treatment cycle in which:

        -  patients previously treated with alpha agonist will be treated with placebo.

        -  patients previously treated with placebo will be treated with alpha agonist.
