      involved in the muscle atrophy. Moderate to severe COPD patients (FEV1 under 60% of
      predicted) and healthy controls will be recruited. All of the investigators patients will
      undergo a thorough baseline assessment in pulmonary capacity, muscle force and body
      composition. Blood sampling and biopsy of the quadriceps will be done. Key proteins of
      signaling intramuscular pathways involved in protein synthesis and degradation will be
      measured in the quadriceps.
