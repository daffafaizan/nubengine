      cuff size will be selected according to the recommendations of American Heart Association
      (cuff length and width will be 80% and 40% of arm circumference respectively) Upon arrival to
      the operating room, a non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) reading will be obtained in both
      upper limbs in supine position. Patients with difference of 10 mmHg or above between both
      limbs will be excluded from the study.

      Induction of general anesthesia will be achieved by administration of 2 mg/kg propofol, 2
      mcg/kg fentanyl and 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. A 20 G radial arterial catheter will be inserted in
      the upper limb which is planned to be dependent. The arterial catheter will be connected to a
      pressure transducer at the level of the heart. Supine IBP reading will be recorded 5-minutes
      after intubation of the trachea in the supine position with simultaneous NIBP in both upper
      limbs at 3-minutes intervals. Five-minutes after settling in the lateral position, NIBP will
      be obtained alternating between the dependent and non-dependent limbs at 5-minutes intervals
      till the end of the operation or till reaching a maximum of 10 readings from each side.

      The reading of the IBP will be obtained from the contralateral upper limb during inflation of
      the cuff of the NIBP. Whilst, the reading of the IBP will be obtained from the same upper
      limb just before the inflation of the cuff of the NIBP
