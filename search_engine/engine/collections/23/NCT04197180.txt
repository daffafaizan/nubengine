      treatment of gastric low grade intramucosal neoplasia. Successful ablation is defined as no
      evidence of local recurrence at 12 months after HybridAPC upon follow up endoscopy. This is
      defined as absence of LGIN, HGIN and cancer in biopsies obtained at all locations during
      followup endoscopy.
