      is caused by the hereditary deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme that
      breaks down glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide.

      To date a definitive diagnosis of Gaucher's disease can only be made applying biochemical
      testing measuring the reduced enzymatic activity of the beta-glucosidase together with
      genetic confirmation. Since numerous different mutations may be the cause of a particular
      lysosomal storage disease the sequencing of the entire beta-glucosidase gene is applied in
      Gaucher's disease in order to confirm the genetic diagnosis.

      The use of primary storage molecules as biomarker was assessed for glucosylceramide (Gb1) in
      plasma of Gaucher's disease patients and compared to the level of Gb1 in healthy individuals.

      In order to establish a sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, we compared mass spectra of
      the plasma of healthy controls and GD patients using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. Mass
      spectra that differed most between patients and controls were analysed in more detail. The
      resulting biomarker, which was patented in June 2011 (PCT/EP2012/002409), was lyso - Gb1. We
      identified this compound as a reliable, sensitive and specific biomarker for GD in a cohort
      of GD patients. Furthermore, in a pilot study we evaluated whether lyso-Gb1 is related to the
      specific genotypes and is reliable for long-term monitoring of the efficiency of therapy.

      The aim this study is therefore to investigate lyso-Gb1 as a long-term prognostic marker in
      na√Øve, non-ERT/SRT GD type 1 patients by monitoring over the course of 36 months.
