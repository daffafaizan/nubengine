      Western world. Due to the aging of the population, the impact of this disorder is expected to
      further increase in the next decades. The underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely
      defined and there are currently no effective medical treatments capable of altering its
      course, identifying a major unmet need in this growing population of patients.

      Based on the similarities between CAVD and atherosclerosis in pathophysiology and shared risk
      factors, it is now hypothesized that activation of the innate immune system contributes to
      the development of CAVD. Therefore, the investigators will perform an observational study to
      assess the role of activation of the innate immune system in CAVD.
