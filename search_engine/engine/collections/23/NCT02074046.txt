      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with Pancreatic
      Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      Pancreatic Cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the Pancreatic Cancer patient using a similar protocol
      as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-Pancreatic Cancer CSC immunity
      induced by Pancreatic Cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of Pancreatic Cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with Pancreatic Cancer CSC-DC.
