      compression syndrome (LPCS), and this diagnosis currently depends on clinicians' subjective
      judgment and several examination results. X-rays are primarily used to diagnose LPCS, but
      they have low detection rates of patellar tilt using the congruence angle (CA) and patellar
      tilting angle (PTA).

      Purpose: To investigate whether patellar axial radiography of the lateral patellar curvature
      angle (LPCA) of knee in 30° flexion can diagnose LPCS.

      Methods: We enrolled 87 patients between 2016 and 2019 and divided them as per diagnosis into
      three groups of 29 each: LPCS, patellar dislocation (PD, control), and meniscus tear (MT,
      negative control) groups. A senior radiologist and the chief physician of sports medicine
      examined their patellar axial radiographs of the knee in 30° flexion using a computer imaging
      system, measuring LPCA, PTA, and CA. Univariate analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis H
      test were used to compare measurement data with normal distribution and non-normal
      distribution, respectively. Bonferroni correction was used to analyze different indicators
      for different groups. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to verify the value of
      LPCA in initial diagnosis of LPCS.
