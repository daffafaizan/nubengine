      secreting inflammatory cytokines and autoreactive antibodies. However, a sub-type of B cells
      named regulatory B cells or Bregs has recently shown capacities to prevent or cure arthritis
      in mouse models. Bregs have also been identified in humans. Main objective: To study Bregs
      abnormalities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at different stages of the disease
      compared to subjects with mechanical pathologies.Secondary objectives:- To evaluate the
      specificity of any abnormalities identified in RA by studying Bregs in patients with other
      autoimmune or other inflammatory joint diseases.- To evaluate the effect of biological and
      synthetic treatments on Bregs in patients with RA. - To assess whether the rate of Bregs
      before treatment is predictive of response to biological and synthetic treatments.
