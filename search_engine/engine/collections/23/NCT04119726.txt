      inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended for patients with
      acute myocardial infarction(AMI). However, discontinuation of the drugs was associated with
      higher mortality. Few studies focused on the improvement of drug compliance through mHealth
      tools.

      Objective：To investigate whether internet-based counseling could improve drug(Antithrombotic
      drugs, β-blockers, statins an ACEI/ARB) compliance following percutaneous coronary
      intervention(PCI) among patients with AMI within 1year's follow-up.

      Study design：The study is a multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-blinded study. A
      total of 400 AMI patients following PCI will be randomized to intervention group or control
      group in addition to usual post-MI care. The intervention group will receive internet-based
      counseling, personalized reminders(drug information, healthy lifestyles advise) and
      educational message (cardiovascular knowledge and follow-up reminders) four times a week. It
      will be only usual messages (cardiovascular knowledge and follow-up reminders) supported four
      times a week in the control group. The primary endpoint is the discontinuation rate of
      coronary heart disease secondary prevention drugs (antiplatelet, ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, and
      statins). The second endpoints include drug adherence scores assessed by the proportion of
      days covered(PDC) and major adverse cardiovascular events. Both groups will be followed up
      within 1year after PCI.

      Summary：The multicentre randomized trial(RESCIND-3) will provide new evidence of the
      effectiveness of mHealth tools on improving 12-month drug compliance following PCI among
      patients with AMI.
