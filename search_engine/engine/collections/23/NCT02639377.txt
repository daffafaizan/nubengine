      plaque index (VPI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) were obtained for full mouth (IPV and
      ISG) and for each implant and teeth (VPI implant; VPI teeth; GBI implant; GBI teeth). For
      statistical purposes, percentages of faces with biofilm and marginal bleeding at teeth and
      implants were calculated. These parameters were evaluated at baseline and at one, three and
      six months post-therapy.

      Probing depth (PD implant; PD teeth) and bleeding on probing (BOP implant; BOP teeth) were
      collected for all implants and teeth with a North Carolina periodontal probe at six sites.
      After data collection, an arithmetic averages of the sites with bleeding on probing and
      probing depths were calculated at baseline, three and six months. The peri-implant and
      periodontal biotype for each implant and teeth was rated as thin or thick, according to probe
      transparency during probing depth.
