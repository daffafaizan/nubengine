        -  The relationship between THC blood levels and driving performance measured on a York
           Driving simulator

        -  The relationship between THC blood levels and reaction times as measured on the
           psychomotor vigilance test (PVT)

        -  the pharmacokinetics of THC in occasional and chronic cannabis consumers

        -  Determine the minimum blood concentration level of THC and 11-OH-THC, below which no
           effect of cannabis is observed

        -  Determine whether the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with the AUC, Cmax, and
           higher THC T1/2

        -  Determine if the polymorphism of CYP2C9 (* 3) is associated with different
           pharmacodynamic effects at a given THC level on performance measured by driving
           simulation
