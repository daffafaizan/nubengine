      lesions or osteochondral defects in the knee. BioMatrix CRDâ„¢ is a sterile, biphasic,
      bioresorbable scaffold designed to aid in the repair of cartilage and subchondral bone. The
      device serves as a scaffold for cellular and extracellular matrix ingrowth supporting the
      regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone.

      The purpose of this post-market study is to confirm the safety and performance of the
      BioMatrix CRD for its intended use. Fifty (50) patients will be enrolled at up to 10
      hospitals in Europe. Patients will be followed for 2 years post-operative to examine the rate
      of adverse events associated with the device, track improvement in knee pain and knee
      function over time, and assess the quality of repair tissue.
