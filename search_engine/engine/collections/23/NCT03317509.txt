      parkinson's patients with dysphagia. Thirty PD patients with dysphagia using UK bank criteria
      for PD will recruited from outpatient clinic in Assuit University. All patients were admitted
      at, Neuropsychiatric Department, Assiut University Hospital/ Assiut, Egypt. Each patient
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria as spontaneous swallows should be identified clearly when
      patients cannot perform voluntary swallows using clinical examination test. The patients will
      be allocated randomly into two groups using closed envelops one of which will receive real
      sessions of high frequency rTMS (25 HZ), with intensity of 80% of resting motor threshold
      detected from the hand motor area, with total 2000 pulses for each hemisphere for 10
      consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days with repeated booster session every month
      during the period of follow up among three months. the other will receive sham sessions. All
      subjects after receiving the rTMS will be followed up by selected clinical rating scales at
      different intervals Pre session, post 10 sessions, after one, two and three months.
