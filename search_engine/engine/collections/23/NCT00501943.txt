    
      To determine the effect of riluzole up to 50 mg bid on MRI parameters, including T1 lesions
      load, atrophy of gray and white matter, and 1H-MRSI; and to determine safety of riluzole when
      administered orally up to 50 mg bid for 2 years in double blinded clinical trial of patients
      with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) and at least 2 silent T2-bright areas in the deep
      white matter. These patients have a high risk of conversion to MS within 2 years and faster
      rate of atrophy (Dalton 2004).

      Specific aims:

        1. To determine the effect of treatment compared to placebo on annual change in measures of
           normalized brain gray and white matter volume changes.

        2. To determine the effect of riluzole compared to placebo on annual change in proton
           spectroscopic intensities of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate in normal appearing
           white matter (NAWM), in acute and chronic lesions.

        3. To determine the safety of riluzole up to 50 mg bid in patients with CIS in association
           to Avonex (Interferon beta 1a) 30 mcg IM once a week.

        4. To monitor changes on MS functional composite (MSFC) (Cutter 1999, Rudick 1998), optic
           coherence tomography (OCT), low contrast sensitivity and EDSS in these patients.

        5. To monitor recovery from exacerbations.
