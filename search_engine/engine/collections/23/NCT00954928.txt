      collected during clinical interaction that will be gathered for research purposes and will
      included patient height, weight, age, anticoagulant medication(s) used with dosage/duration
      of use, indication for anticoagulant medication, and current INR if on warfarin. Preoperative
      examination will include measures of 2 point discrimination in the digits, distance of the
      fingertips from the distal palmar crease upon flexion, and the patient-based outcome surveys
      that are to be collected after surgery (Quick DASH, SF-12, Visual Analog Scales
      pain/swelling). These patients will then undergo the appropriate surgical procedure without
      discontinuing their anticoagulant medication.

      To ensure that patients are not being placed at increased risk, this study's protocol will
      not alter the surgical practices of the attending surgeons involved. Specifically, all
      surgeons perform their hand and wrist surgery under tourniquet control but differ in whether
      the tourniquet is deflated prior to wound closure. Each surgeon will be free to manage the
      tourniquet as they feel appropriate. The placement of would drains will remain at the
      discretion of the attending surgeon on a case-by-case basis.

      Local anesthetics may be injected but none will be mixed with epinephrine.

      Procedures: (if applicable) Obtaining pre-operative INR values when appropriate, and
      performing surgery while continuing anticoagulants is already standard care for one faculty
      member. All post-operative care except the completion of the Quick DASH and Short Form 12,
      and visual analog ratings is part of standard clinical care. Research questionnaires should
      take no more than 20 minutes to complete per visit.
