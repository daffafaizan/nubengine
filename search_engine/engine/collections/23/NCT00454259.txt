    
      -  Principal Objective : "Evaluate fentanyl "ultra low doses" effects on human volunteer's
           nociceptive threshold depending on their prior pain and opioid experience."

        -  Secondary Objective : "Confirm the innocuousness of this test (the 3 "ultra low doses"
           used in this trial will be 10 to 1,000 fold lower than low doses use for anesthesia and
           analgesia) and to find the fentanyl ultra low dose that could be used to develop a pain
           sensitisation predictive test."

        -  Study design : Bicentric, prospective, randomized, double-blind study.

      Inclusion criteria :

      In both groups:

        -  18-40 years old male volunteer

        -  weight: 60 to 85 kg

        -  ASA score: 1

        -  Informed consent obtained from the patient

        -  Gender : Male

      In "operated" group:

      - At least one history of peripheral surgery under general anesthesia with opioid in the past
      five years

      Exclusion criteria :

      In both groups:

        -  The patient do not accept inclusion to the study

        -  Drug or alcohol abuse history

        -  Chronic use of analgesic drugs or history of chronic pain

        -  Analgesic or opioid consumption within the 12hs preceding the fentanyl or placebo
           injection

        -  Neurological and/or psychiatric disorder, inability to give informed consent

        -  Any contraindication to fentanyl use

        -  Use of any medication interacting with fentanyl

        -  Exclusion period from the national healthy volunteer register

        -  Gender : Female

      In "healthy" group:

      - Any history of general anesthesia or surgery

        -  Study plan: comparing two groups that only defer by their surgical and opioid prior
           experience and will receive three fentanyl ultra low doses (10 to 1,000 fold lower than
           low doses use for anesthesia and analgesia) and placebo (cross over administration, one
           week wash out period).
