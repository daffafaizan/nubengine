    
      This study is designed as a multi-center, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, unblinded, prospective
      clinical outcomes investigation to evaluate the short, mid and long term performance of the
      PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis humeral replacement. The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder
      prosthesis device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement. Patients
      will be selected for recruitment into the study based upon the normally accepted criteria for
      primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.

      The investigation will be conducted by up to 10 International surgeons experienced in HRA.
      387 subjects with PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and
      followed for 10 years.
