      treat hypertension, this condition is poorly managed in many patients and is a leading cause
      of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because a newly identified hypertension susceptibility
      gene, STK39 (Serine Threonine Kinase 39), plays a central role in kidney sodium transport,
      the investigators propose a pharmacogenetics study to examine the relationships between STK39
      genotypes and blood pressure responses to salt loading and to thiazide diuretics,
      hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, STK39 genotypes may also predict those hypertension
      patients more likely to develop thiazide-induced hyperglycemia. The investigators hypothesize
      that STK39 genotypes of those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with
      baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension
      status, will be associated with the outcome of both interventions. Therefore these SNPs can
      act as markers and contribute to personalized care for hypertension by identifying patients
      most likely to effectively control their blood pressure by adopting salt-reducing diet versus
      patients most likely to effectively and safely control their blood pressure by taking
      thiazide diuretics.
