      Calypso soft tissue transponders. This modification includes an anchoring mechanism to hold
      the transponder positionally stable within small airways of the lung. Transponders are placed
      locally to the tumor within the lung and during subsequent radiotherapy the Calypso system
      may be used to monitor the location of the transponders and, by extension, the tumor, in
      real-time. This allows for improved tumor-targeting as well as gating of the radiation beam
      when the tumor moves outside the target field during respiratory motion.

      The goals of this investigation are to show that patients with implanted anchored
      transponders can be localized with the Calypso System, that anchored transponder implantation
      and use are feasible and safe, and that anchored transponders are positionally stable in the
      small airways of patients with cancer of the lung.
