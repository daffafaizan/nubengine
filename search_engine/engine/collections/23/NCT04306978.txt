      indications for implantation of dual chamber cardiac pacemakers according to the current
      guidelines. All the patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. Patients in the RM
      group will undergo the implantation of Ensura DR MRI SureScan pacing system, whereas patients
      in the control group will receive ADAPTA DR pacing system without RM using. The impact of the
      Care Link Express service on prevention of thromboembolism will be evaluated. The rate of
      in-hospital visits for 1 patient per year and compliance with scheduled CareLink
      transmissions (ratio of the number of the performed transmissions to the planned ones) will
      be assessed in all patients in the remote monitoring group. Moreover, we are going to
      estimate the interaction between the follow-up center and other healthcare facilities
      equipped with the CareLink Express service, which will facilitate faster treatment decision.
