      mortality documented in previous 20th century pandemics among pregnant women, and the lack of
      any data for use of these vital antiviral drugs in pregnancy, study of the pharmacology of
      oseltamivir in pregnancy is imperative. If and when the next pandemic occurs, a better
      understanding of this drug's safety and pharmacologic profiles for use in pregnancy is
      critical given the fact that it will be used in this vulnerable patient population.

      This is a pilot study of the use of oseltamivir in pregnancy. This data will be combined with
      data from the parallel Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit (PPRU) studies to put together a
      portfolio for use in understudied populations. This will allow for a re-thinking of the
      current status and potentially allow for small trials to be performed with patients who are
      suffering from influenza in pregnancy, to assess efficacy. The relevance with the pandemic
      strain and its corresponding Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) may have direct
      implications for dosing in pregnancy if lower levels of drug are documented. In addition,
      depending on the findings from the esterase component of the investigation, future
      investigation into mechanistic bases for changes in enzyme activity are possible.
