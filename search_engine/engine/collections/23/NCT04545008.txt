      not require hospitalization. Exclusion criteria have been written to exclude patients who
      would be expected to have increased risk from either medication alone. Subjects will be
      assigned a dose combination of famotidine and n-acetyl cysteine. In addition to assessing the
      safety and toxicities profiles of the combination of drugs we will be measuring certain
      endpoints to assess possible efficacy. These endpoint include the following: rates of
      hospitalization; time to complete remission of symptoms, e.g, fever, respiratory symptoms,
      etc.; severity of symptoms with validated survey instruments; cytokine values in serum and
      urine; and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
