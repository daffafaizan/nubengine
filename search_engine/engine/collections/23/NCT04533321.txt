        1. To determine the efficacy of afatinib in patients with germline MET-N375S polymorphism.

        2. To determine the tolerability of afatinib in chemo-relapsed patients with germline
           MET-N375S polymorphism.

      Research objectives:

        1. To determine the prevalence of MET and TP53 mutations, as well as HER2 and MET
           amplification, in various cancers, particularly head and neck cancers and lung cancers.

        2. To establish tumour cell lines, spheroids of xenografts for drug screening.

      Endpoints of study:

        1. To determine the response rate of SCC HN/lung with Met-N375S to afatinib.

        2. The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and toxicity.

        3. Frequency of MET mutations and TP53 mutations in patients with cancer.
