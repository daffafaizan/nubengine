    
      Counterbalanced, cross-over, pre-post trial where each subject acts as his own control.

      Four sessions will be performed for each adolescent. Each session will be conducted over 5
      days (from Monday to Friday):

      Adolescents will take part randomly in four sessions. Physical activity program will be
      identical between sessions and groups. 60 minn of moderate to vigorous leisure activities and
      exercises will be proposed each day. Heart rate monitor will be used to control intensity of
      exercise during the physical activity program.

        -  Control session (CTL) outside academic stress period (represented by exams) and without
           the physical activity program.

        -  A session outside academic stress period, with the physical activity program (PAP).

        -  A session during an academic stress period without the physical activity program (AS).

        -  A session during an academic stress period with the physical activity program (ASPAP).

      At each session:

        -  Continuous sleep assessments (duration and quality) by accelerometry

        -  Continuous physical activity and sedentary behaviour assessments by accelerometry

        -  one evaluation of melatonin peak from salivary specimens

        -  one evaluation of cortisol peak from salivary specimens

        -  An evaluation of the ad libitum food intake of the 5th day will be carried out by the
           weighing method.

        -  one assessment of cognitive performance

        -  An evaluation of subjective appetite sensations (hunger, fullness, desire to eat) of the
           5th day

        -  An evaluation of subjective diurnal sleepiness (Karolinska) of the 5th day
