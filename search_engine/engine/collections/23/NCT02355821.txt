      independent Cl-/bicarbonate exchanger (anion exchanger, AE) which plays an essential role in
      viability of osteoclasts that are crucial for bone resorption. The suppression of AE proteins
      activity has been proven to inhibit osteoclast activity and reduce bone resorption whereas
      the moxonidine molecule is known to reduce the AE protein activity. Therefore, the results of
      experimental studies have shown the ability of moxonidine to inhibit bone resorption through
      its effect on the osteoclast activity.

      Published data contain information on positive effects of beta-blockers on the bone tissue
      condition. There are data which clearly demonstrate a positive effect of beta-blockers on
      bone mass.

      The proposed trial is a comprehensive study of moxonidine effects on processes of cellular
      and vascular aging as well as bone metabolism.
