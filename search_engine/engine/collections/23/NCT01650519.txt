      for moderate-severe pain, with improvement in the quality of pain relief and consistent
      evidence of opioid dose sparing. NSAIDs alone could provide effective analgesia post-surgery
      when mild-moderate pain is expected. There is also evidence that the use of NSAIDs, by
      avoiding or decreasing the need for opioids, can lead to a reduction in the incidence of
      adverse events which are commonly attributed to, or exacerbated by, opioids.

      The intent of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of IV ibuprofen when
      administered at induction of anesthesia. Results from this pilot study will be used to design
      and determine the appropriate statistical power for a larger, multi-center randomized study.
