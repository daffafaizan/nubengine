    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral AERT in MS patients with spasticity. Two doses of
      AERT, 40 mg and 80 mg, will be compared with placebo. The treatment groups will be randomized
      in a 1:1:1 ratio. Eligible patients will undergo a washout period for withdrawal of all
      medications used for anti-spasticity and/or muscle relaxation prior to randomization. A
      baseline clinical evaluation will be performed (Visit 2) to confirm eligibility for study
      randomization, and subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Subjects will
      remain on maintenance treatment for approximately 3 months.
