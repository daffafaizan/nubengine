      to remote ischemic preconditioning or control (no intervention). The remote ischemic
      preconditioning procedure is carried out immediately after the induction of regional or
      general anesthesia. The blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper limb. The cuff is inflated
      to 200 mmHg resulting in a total occlusion of the blood flow to the limb. After 5 minutes of
      ischemia the cuff is deflated and the limb is reperfused for 5 minutes. The procedure is
      carried out 4 times in a row. For patients with systolic blood pressures >185 mmHg, the cuff
      will be inflated to at least 15 mmHg above the patient's systolic blood pressure.

      The primary outcome is myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery within day 4 postoperatively.

      We expect 15% of the patients in the placebo group to suffer myocardial injury while the
      incidence of myocardial injury is expected to be reduced to 7% in the intervention group.
      Type I error is set at 5% and type II error is set at 20%. In total 2 x 264 patients need to
      be included based on this power calculation. We will include patients until we have a total
      of 2 x 270 patients for evaluation (per-protocol).
