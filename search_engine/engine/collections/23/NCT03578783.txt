      helped when treated with PSD502 by answering questionnaires such as the 'Premature
      Ejaculation Bothersome Evaluation Questionnaire' (PEBEQ) and 'Index of Premature EjaculationÂ©
      (IPE) and some additional questions about premature ejaculation.

      The study will also measure the effect of PSD502 on the Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time
      (IELT). This is the time between when the penis enters the vagina and when the subject starts
      to ejaculate in the vagina.

      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or
      placebo in a 1:1 ratio.
