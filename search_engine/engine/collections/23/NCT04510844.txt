      Administration (FDA)-approved biological drug that has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol
      (bad cholesterol) Early data show that the beneftis of evolocumab may be increased as kidney
      function declines. This trial is therefore designed to provide additional evidence regarding
      the safety and cholesterol-lowering effects of evolocumab compared with placebo, a pill that
      has no therapeutic effect, in advanced CKD patients.
