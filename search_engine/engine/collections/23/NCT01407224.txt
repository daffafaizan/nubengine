      poor infant health and nutrition. However, the modern health services are unable to help
      because approximately 85% of births take place at home. The Government has begun the huge
      process of training the informal community traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who, along
      with community volunteers (CVs), deliver the majority of babies, especially in the rural
      areas. The proposed operations research will take place in one of the poorest rural
      districts. It will compare the cost effectiveness of practical training of these relatively
      uneducated community members, with or without supportive supervision in improving early
      infant feeding practices, using a cluster-randomized study design. The practices to be
      measured before and after on probability samples include: 1) delayed cord clamping, 2) early
      skin to skin contact and 3) newborn-led initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth,
      4) avoidance of the traditional prelacteal feeds, and 5) exclusive breastfeeding, at least
      for the early months. Costs will be carefully monitored so as to compare the cost per
      behavior improved per infant.
