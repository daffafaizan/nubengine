      of, and prevent hexosaminidase deficiency diseases, yet all of them - Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff,
      and Late Onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS) - remain diseases without treatment. Much work remains to be
      done to understand and effectively treat these diseases. To date, no comprehensive assessment
      of the natural history of Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff has been undertaken. The information that is
      gathered through this study will characterize and describe the Tay-Sachs disease population
      as a whole, including the variability and progression of this disease. This information, in
      turn, will function as a point of reference against which to assess the efficacy of
      therapeutic interventions. Therapeutic interventions may include any treatments/therapies the
      subject may have undergone in the past, including hematopoietic cell transplantation, and/or
      the administration of miglustat, acetylcysteine, or other pharmaceutical agents; and possible
      future gene therapies.
