      hospitals/clinics in the Emilia Romagna region, Italy. Patients will be divided in two groups
      A (naive patients,) and B (patients already using the device at enrollment) and followed for
      12 months.

      Study design is observational prospective and includes 3-months follow up visits until the
      12-month final evaluation.

      At each visit, patient clinical data, adherence and side effects will be recorded and data
