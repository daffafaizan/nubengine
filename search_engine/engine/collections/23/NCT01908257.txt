      lesinurad. An earlier study demonstrated an effect on lesinurad PK in the presence of both
      calcium-containing and magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids. The current study will
      assess whether raising gastric pH, without the presence of these cations, affects lesinurad
      PK and PD under the fasted state. If an impact is seen, then the optional second cohort will
      be conducted under the fed state.
