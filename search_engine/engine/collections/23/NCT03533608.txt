      recruited to participate in a Group PE protocol. Participants will engage in 12, 90-minute
      sessions of Group PE over the course of 6 weeks. Treatment consists of psychoeducation,
      rationale for treatment, and in vivo exposure to reduce trauma-related avoidance and thereby
      improve PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms will be measured via the PCL-5. The goal of this pilot
      study will be to determine whether or not it will be feasible to conduct a full-scale trial
      of Group PE in the current setting by testing the process, resources, management, and
      scientific basis of the planned trial. As such, the proposed study will primarily assess
      feasibility outcomes and not efficacy outcomes. The investigators will assess number of
      participants screened, number meeting inclusion criteria, adherence of participants to the
      proposed treatment (measured via number of sessions attended), standard deviation of the
      outcome measure (PCL-5), response rates to questionnaires, and loss to follow-up. The
      investigators will also measure clinicians' adherence to protocol and acceptability of the
      treatment to patients.
