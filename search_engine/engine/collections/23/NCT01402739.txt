      several risk factors, e.g. the type of surgery, concomitant medication with anticoagulants,
      and postoperative chest tube output. Allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with
      transfusion reactions, infection transmission, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. The
      aim of this study is to investigate, whether cardiac surgery patients have a reduced
      postoperative chest tube output and transfusion need when using a point-of-care guided
      transfusion algorithm compared to standard of care transfusion protocols .
