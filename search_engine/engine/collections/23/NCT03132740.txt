      and the uncertainty of surgeons'experience, it is difficult for the surgeons to diagnosis and
      assess the operation strategy accurately based on traditional 2D imaging(CT/MRI).The aim of
      the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three-dimensional visualization
      on operation strategy and complications for complex hepatic carcinoma.
