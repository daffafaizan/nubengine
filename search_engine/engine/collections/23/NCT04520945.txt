      83%. Plain radiograph remained the main modality in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Chondrogen is
      a mesenchymal stem cell-derived from umbilical cord tissue product. The mesenchymal stem cell
      is used for the study because of its ability to proliferate and differentiate into various
      tissues such as chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteocytes. Various clinical studies have been
      conducted for arthritis, orthopedic, joint, and cartilage.

      This study will enroll 100 patients age 30-70 years old. They will be divided into 2 groups
      which are the group which will receive the investigational drug (ChondrogenTM and HA) and
      another group will receive a placebo (saline and HA). It will be a randomized double-blinded
      study where the participants and the investigator would not know what are the things being
      received. This study will be conducted for 24 months. The injection will be given on the
      baseline day after screening the volunteers. The patients will be assessed on VAS, WOMAC,
      IKDC, KOOS PROMIS29, the interleukins, and MRI.
