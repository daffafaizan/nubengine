      reduction of coronary flow. It has been shown that the reperfusion therapy significantly
      improves the clinical outcome. Currently the optimal strategy is the primary angioplasty with
      stent implantation. The treatment is recommended by AHA/ACC and ESC if can be performed
      within 90 minutes from the first medical contact. However there is still a certain percentage
      of procedure failure. To further improve the outcome new techniques and devices are tested .
      Aspiration thrombectomy may facilitate the reperfusion by reducing thrombus burden. The aim
      of the study is to assess if adjunctive thrombectomy may improve clinical outcome in patients
      with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
