      last year of life and benefit from palliative care, the prognostic capability of the Surprise
      Question has been shown to be variable. What is unclear, is the extent to which a doctor
      should be "surprised" before a patient is suitable for palliative care, how consistently
      doctors respond to this question, and how the subsequent treatment decision relates to the SQ
      response.

      The study will recruit 600 General Practitioners (GPs) from 6 participating countries (100
      per country; UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands). Each participant
      will asked to complete a series of 20 hypothetical patient summaries in an online task.
