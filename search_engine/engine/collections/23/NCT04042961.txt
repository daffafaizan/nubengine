    
      This is an assessor-blind randomized non-inferiority trial with an internal pilot study.
      Research activities will take place at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the
      University of Toronto. For the internal pilot study, we will initially recruit 20
      participants with chronic stroke and randomly assign them to one of two groups: 1) RBT, or 2)
      AST. Cardiorespiratory fitness, lower-extremity strength, balance control, and balance
      confidence will be measured pre- and post-intervention. We will calculate the final target
      sample size using the variability observed in this internal pilot. Additionally, a Trial
      Steering Committee will determine the criteria for the progression from the internal pilot to
      the main study, and will decide on the continuation of the internal pilot with or without
      modifications based on those pre-defined criteria (e.g., criteria based on feasibility or
      preliminary evidence of effect of the interventions from examination of effect sizes).
