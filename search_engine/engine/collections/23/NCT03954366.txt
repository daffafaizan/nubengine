    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, drug-drug-interaction (DDI) study in patients with advanced
      solid tumor. In Part I, the effects of rucaparib (600 mg twice daily [BID]) on the PK of oral
      rosuvastatin (Arm A) and the combined oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and
      levonorgestrel; Arm B) will be assessed.

      Part I: patients will receive single oral doses of rosuvastatin or oral contraceptives
      (according to assigned arm) on Day 1 and Day 19. Continuous treatment with rucaparib at 600
      mg BID will commence on Day 5 and continue until the end of Part I (Day 23).

      Part II (optional): treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles may continue (at the discretion
      of the Investigator) until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for
      discontinuation.
