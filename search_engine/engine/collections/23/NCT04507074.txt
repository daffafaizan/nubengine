      intervertebral discs, and as a result their degeneration, hernia and pressure on the nerve
      roots, which together cause inflammation and pain in the damaged area. This is a significant
      public health problem due to the 100% incidence of pain syndrome among people with obesity.
      The use of traction forces has beneficial effects on degenerated intervertebral discs, but
      there are no studies assessing the effectiveness of the traction method in relation to a
      group of obese people with back pain syndrome.

      Beneficial biochemical changes in the blood, alleviation of pain, improvement of functional
      parameters of the spine are expected after application of traction forces to the patients in
      the mechanism of decompression of the destroyed and being in chronic inflammation
      intervertebral discs. Identification of biomarkers enabling to monitor the effects of
      therapies in patients with chronic back pain can become a contribution to change standards in
      the diagnosis of back pain and reorientation in its treatment to real causes.
