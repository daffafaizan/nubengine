      conditions. Stepped collaborative care interventions have been widely employed in the primary
      care setting for the treatment of depression and more recently have been utilized to treat
      other symptoms (e.g., pain) in a variety of settings. A recent meta-analyses concluded that
      collaborative care interventions were superior to usual care and are more cost-effective than
      face to face and pharmacological treatment for depression. Collaborative care interventions
      have begun to be extended to other settings but have not been tested in patients who are
      being treated with dialysis. The aims of the present study were to pilot test the efficacy of
      a collaborative care intervention in patients awaiting kidney transplant to reduce symptoms
      of depression, pain, fatigue and improve quality of life.
