      neonatal morbidity and mortality. Because of constricted myometrial spiral arteries with
      exaggerated vasomotor responsiveness, though blood pressure in parturients with preeclampsia
      are apparently higher than healthy parturients, placental hypoperfusion is more common.
      Spinal anesthesia is still the preferred mode of anesthesia in parturients with preeclampsia
      for cesarean section. In preeclampsia parturients, spinal anesthesia improve intervillous
      blood flow (provided that hypotension is avoided) which contribute to increase placental
      perfusion. Even so, 17-26% parturients with preeclampsia experienced postspinal anesthesia
      hypotension due to the extensive sympathetic block that occurred with spinal anesthesia.
      Practical guidelines for obstetric anesthesia from the American Society of Anesthesiologists
      and an international consensus statement on the management of hypotension with vasopressors
      indicate either IV ephedrine or phenylephrine may be used to correct hypotension. But the
      suitable infusion dose of phenylephrine in parturients with preeclampsia is still unknown.
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the suitable infusion dose of phenylephrine for
      prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension in parturients with preeclampsia
      undergoing cesarean section.
