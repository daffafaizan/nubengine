      and those with HPV related lower genital tract dysplasia/malignancy have an even greater risk
      screening is currently not recommended. We therefore propose performing a prospective cohort
      study to determine the prevalence of anal dysplasia in women with high-grade lower genital
      tract dysplasia using high-resolution anoscopy HRA. This will then potentially lead to the
      development of a screening, diagnosis and treatment schema that can be implemented in all
      women with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia. This study can potentially have a high
      impact on health delivery in women at high risk for anal cancer as this can transform the
      current treatment of anal cancer to a preventive screening program. This can later be
      implemented throughout Ontario and in all centers that treat women with cervical dysplasia.

      The incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasm (AIN also known as anal cancer) has increased
      in Ontario over the last 20 years. Two-thirds of the cases are found in women. The average
      time between diagnosis of anal cancer and previous cervical dysplasia or cancer is
      approximately 20 years. This study is giving the opportunity to detect and treat pre-invasive
      lesions and potentially prevent the development of anal cancer. Currently, no screening,
      diagnosis or treatment recommendation for anal dysplasia found in women with high-grade lower
      genital tract dysplasia.
