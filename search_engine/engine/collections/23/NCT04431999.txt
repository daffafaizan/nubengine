      a massive influx of victims of war weapon injuries. This new fact makes the efficiency of
      transfusion therapy crucial: hemorrhage is the leading cause of death from weapons of war,
      and the high number of victims of each attack changes the logistical approach.

      The logistical problems with transfusion therapy, including red blood cell (PRBCs), plasma
      and platelet concentrates, are the speed of delivery and availability. Using whole blood is a
      pragmatic solution to overcome these problems. This solution has been used for many years by
      the French Army to ensure platelet transfusion in traumatic hemorrhages

      The hypothesis of the T-STORHM study is that the use of whole blood is a solution in a
      context of civil trauma not effective less than component therapy (PRBCs, plasma and platelet
      concentrates) in the management of coagulopathy in patients admitted to hospital for
      traumatic hemorrhage.
