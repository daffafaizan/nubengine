    
      This prospective longitudinal study planned to include 70 patients with NSCLC in stages I-III
      who will be its own control group for changes in lung function.

      It will be included patients destined to have stereotactic or concomitant chemoradiotherapy
      in curative intent.

      Follow-up will include a physical examination by a pulmonologist, spirometry, determination
      of the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), determination of the total lung
      capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV) and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) by body
      plethysmography, determination of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen
      (PaO2) by arterial blood gas analysis, the six-minute walking test, the Clinical COPD
      questionnaire, X-ray and CT scans and blood sample analysis at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks after
      treatment, and every 3 months thereafter until 12 months after SBRT.

      Part of the project is to take blood samples. Specific blood samples will be analyzed to
      identify biomarkers that could predict the development of radiation-induced lung changes.

      Unfortunately, fewer patients than planned were included.
