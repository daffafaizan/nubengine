      eating behaviour changes,for this reason, this relationship will be investigated in this
      study.

      Demographic data (sex, age, education level, occupation) of patients with fibromyalgia
      diagnosis will be questioned and height lengths will be measured. The group of medications
      (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or GABAergic drugs) that begins with the
      diagnosis of the disease fibromyalgia will be recorded.

      All patients will be assessed when diagnosed, followed by 2nd week and then 4nd week.

      In each follow-up, the patients' weights will be measured again (the body mass index will be
      calculated from the measured value).

      In each follow-up, the effect of fibromyalgia on the daily life of the patients will be
      questioned with Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The FIQ was developed from
      information gathered from patient reports, functional status instruments, and clinical
      observations. This instrument measures physical functioning, work status (missed days of work
      and job difficulty), depression, anxiety, morning tiredness, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and
      well-being over the past week.

      In each follow-up, patients' eating behaviour will be questioned with Three Factor Eating
      Questionnaire. The 18-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a scale that measures three
      domains of eating behavior: cognitive restraint , uncontrolled eating and emotional eating.

      In each follow-up, the right calf circumference of the patients will be measured in
      centimeters with a tape measure .
