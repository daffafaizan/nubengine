    
      This study is a non-randomized Phase II study of the Axillary Reverse Mapping (ARM) procedure
      for patients presenting with breast cancer requiring lymph node evaluation. The study will
      enroll 100 subjects, and will have two study arms: one for patients requiring only the SLNB
      procedure (roughly 67% of enrollees), and one for patients requiring a full ALND (roughly 33%
      of enrollees). For the analysis of study efficacy, each arm will be compared to its
      procedure-appropriate historical control for evidence of decrease in the 1-year lymphedema
      rate among patients undergoing SLNB or ALND.

      Additional data will be collected on the treatment population's (a) variability in location
      of arm lymphatics, and (b) incidence of SLN crossover with arm lymphatics, along with
      success-rate data for identifying SLNs and arm lymphatics during SLNB and/or ALND. This
      additional data will add to our level of knowledge and experience regarding lymph node
      surgery.
