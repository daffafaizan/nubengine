    
      This is a randomized controlled trial with parallel group design to explore the effects of
      warm water footbaths with added ginger powder (experimental) compared to footbaths with warm
      water alone (active comparator) on sleep quality in adults with self-perceived insomnia
      symptoms. Participants receive daily footbaths 1-3 hours before bedtime over a period of two
      weeks. The footbaths are prepared by the participants themselves and carried out at their
      homes. Outcome measures are assessed at baseline (pre intervention) and two weeks after
      baseline (post intervention). The main focus is on change in subjective quality of sleep as
      assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The statistical analysis comprises
      analyses of variance based on linear mixed effects models.
