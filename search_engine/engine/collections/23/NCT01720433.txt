      the control group. The overall post-surgery pain scores, as analysed by two-way ANOVA, were
      significantly lower in the intervention group (P=0.0019). On Bonferroni post-tests both 12
      hour (P<0.01) and 24-hour (P<0.01) pain scores were significantly lower in the intervention
      group.
