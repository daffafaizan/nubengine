    
      BACKGROUND:

        -  A number of important scientific advances can be made through the study of blood, bone
           marrow, tumor, or other tissue samples from patients with HIV infection, infection with
           Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), infection with other oncogenic viruses,
           or cancer.

        -  This protocol provides a mechanism to effect a variety of such studies.

      OBJECTIVES:

      -Acquisition of serum, circulating cells, bone marrow, and tumor or normal tissue samples
      from patients with HIV infection, KSHV infection, or with cancer.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      -Eligibility criteria include age 18 years or older and at least one of the following:
      Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV; HIV seropositive; KSHV seropositive; EBV seropositive;
      HTLV-1 seropositive; malignancy, Castleman s disease, or skin lesions with appearance of
      Kaposi s sarcoma; or cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion.

      DESIGN:

        -  Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow-up visits.

        -  Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or
           peritoneal fluid, by skin punch biopsy, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is
           accessible with minimal risk to the patients.

        -  Specific risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of the
           biopsy.

        -  Samples will be studied in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, CCR, NCI; laboratories in
           NCI-Frederick; or those of collaborating investigators.
