    
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the value of the Personal KinetiGraph®
      (PKG®) System and SOC vs. the SOC alone for treatment of PwP. The study aims to evaluate
      clinical outcomes, quality of life outcomes, health economic benefits, duration of controlled
      status, and need for additional PD treatment through 3 years follow-up of PwP specifically
      treated to a target range when using the PKG data in the clinical management of PD in routine
      clinical care compared to those managed with SOC alone. All subjects will be treated by
      Movement Disorder Specialists and General Neurologists with expertise in PD. Both groups will
      be recommended to undergo treatment changes until they reach a "controlled state" that is
      determined by either the clinician using SOC (PKG- Group) or using recommended target ranges
      for PKG scores and SOC assessments (PKG+ Group). Investigators will utilize standard
      available treatments to manage these PwP in both groups.
