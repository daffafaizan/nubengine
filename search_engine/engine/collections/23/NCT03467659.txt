      moderated glycemia and increased satiety compared to foods made from refined grains. However,
      the extent of whole grains' low glycemic property may be limited by certain factors. For
      example, physical properties such as viscosity or particle size and differing starch
      digestion rates of whole grain foods may strongly influence glycemic response and gastric
      emptying rate. In this study, whole and refined grain wheat porridges were prepared from
      materials originating from the same milling source, with matched pairs for viscosity, starch
      and dietary fiber contents, and particle size. Subjects consumed wheat porridges containing
      13C-labeled octanoic acid for assessment of gastric emptying rate, and they wore a continuous
      glucose monitor for measuring postprandial glucose levels. The purpose of this research was
      to test the hypothesis that the purported moderated glycemic response and slow gastric
      emptying rate are dependent on how these foods are processed. This work highlights the need
      to consider specific properties of whole grain foods for desired health outcomes in order to
      optimize the design of whole grain-based foods.
