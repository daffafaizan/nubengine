    
      The study is a Phase I, open label, single dose, single centre study performed in 12 healthy
      male subjects aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive. This study will assess the absolute
      bioavailability of AZD9291 and evaluate the PK parameters following a single oral dose of
      AZD9291 and a radiolabelled IV microdose of AZD9291 in healthy male subjects. Oral AZD9291and
      [14C] AZD9291 intravenous solution are referred to as the investigational products in this
      study.

      A screening visit (Visit 1) to assess the eligibility of the healthy male subjects will occur
      within 28 days of the administration of the investigational product. Screening assessments
      will include evaluation of opthalmological assessments, clinical chemistry, haematology,
      urinalysis, a physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), medical
      and surgical history, screening for drugs of abuse, alcohol, hepatitis B and C, and HIV, and
      recording of concomitant medications and Adverse Events. Study related procedures will only
      be performed after signing of the Informed Consent Form.

      The healthy male subjects will be admitted to the study centre the day before administration
      of the investigational product (Day 1; Visit 2). On Day 1 (Visit 2), subjects will be dosed
      with a single oral dose of 80 mg AZD9291 tablet followed by 100 Î¼g [14C] AZD9291 dosed as an
      IV microdose beginning 5 hours and 45 minutes after the oral dose has been administered. The
      IV microdose will be infused over 15 minutes and the end of the infusion will be co
      incidental with median oral tmax (ie, estimated tmax is 6 hours).

      The subjects will remain in the study centre until the 120 hour post dose PK blood sample is
      obtained. Ambulatory visits will occur on Days 8 (Visit 3), 10 (Visit 4), 15 (Visit 5) and 22
      (Visit 6) for PK and safety assessments. A follow up visit (Visit 7) will occur 21 to 28 days
      after discharge (Days 27 - 34) from the study centre and will include routine safety
      assessments.
