      I. To estimate the diagnostic performance as quantified by the area under the ROC curve to
      detect aggressive prostate cancer.

      II. To develop a risk prediction model by incorporating overall PI-RADS, PSA, Gleason score
      and clinical stage to predict the presence of aggressive prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the individual PI-RADS score of each MRI
      parameter (T2W, DWI and DCE), as determined by local imaging review.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. All clinical data including magnetic resonance (MR) images will be banked for future
      exploratory research aims.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo mpMRI within 3 months prior to schedule surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up until radical prostatectomy pathology is
      reported and finalized.
