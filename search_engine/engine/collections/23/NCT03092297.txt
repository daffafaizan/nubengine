      question arises whether an individualized red cell transfusion strategy may benefit
      critically ill patients. New studies have shown the potential of protoporphyrin IX-triple
      state lifetime technique to measure mitochondrial oxygenation tension (mitoPO2) in vivo,
      which possibly is an early indicator of oxygen disturbance in the cell and therefore a
      physiological trigger for red cell transfusion. The goals are: 1. Determining the feasibility
      of using mitoPO2 and the variability of mitoPO2 measurements in critically ill intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients before and after receiving a red cell transfusion 2. Describing the
      effects of red cell transfusion and the associated change in [Hb] on mitoPO2 and on other
      physiologic measures of tissue oxygenation and oxygen balance 3. Describing the association
      between mitoPO2 and vital organ functions. Included patients will undergo red cell
      transfusion as planned. However, red cell transfusion will be delayed by 2 hours. At multiple
      predefined moments data collection including blood samples and measurements of mitoPO2 will
      take place.

      The results of this study cannot be immediately translated to clinical practice. Using these
      results, the investigators will design a phase 2 diagnostic study, most probably a randomized
      clinical trial that will yield applied knowledge with respect to personalizing red cell
      transfusion. Application will be in ICU patients with anaemia who might or might not profit
      from red cell transfusions. It will lead to a reduction of both over- and under- transfusion.
