      benefit, therefore, new treatment options are needed. Paricalcitol is a man-made form of
      vitamin D. It is thought to work by blocking a signal in the cancer tumor cells that leads to
      growth and spreading of the tumor. Paricalcitol was approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the prevention and treatment of elevated calcium levels associated
      with chronic renal failure. The FDA has not approved paricalcitol as a treatment for
      pancreatic cancer. This research study is being performed to evaluate the benefit of
      paricalcitol in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for this disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved the combination of gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel as a treatment option for this disease.

      Treatment will consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Paricalcitol in the oral formulation will
      be taken daily, in the intravenous formulation will be administered three times a week.
      Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be administered on days 1,8, and 15.

      Subjects continue in the study until disease progression, adverse event/toxicity, death or
      either the subject or sponsor discontinues the study.

      In this research study, the main objectives include:

        -  Assess adverse side effects associated with the combination of paricalcitol with
           gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

        -  Evaluate overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine and
           nab-paclitaxel with or without paricalcitol.
