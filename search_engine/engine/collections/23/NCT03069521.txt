      subjects suffering from corneal edema

      Device: EndoArt® (Artificial Endothelial Layer)

      Intended Use: The EndoArt® device is intended for use as an endothelial kearatoprosthesis in
      patients with chronic cornel edema

      Study Design: Prospective open-label feasibility clinical study

      Study Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the EndoArt® implanted in subjects suffering from
      corneal edema.

      Study Hypothesis: Treatment with the EndoArt® is safe and may result in alleviating symptoms
      resulting from chronic corneal edema (corneal thickness).

      Study population: Men and women suffering from a decrease in vision due to chronic corneal
      edema that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written Informed Consent will
      enrolled in the study.

      Enrollment: A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled.

      Study Duration: Completion of active enrollment is anticipated to last approximately 18
      months. The primary end point will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 6
      month follow up. Subject will be followed up to 12 month.

      Primary Safety Endpoint: The frequency and severity of all treatment-related adverse events,
      during and after implantation of the EndoArt® and throughout the 6 month follow-up period.
      Adverse events will be assessed on a continuous basis from the procedure through the study
      completion at 6 months. Related adverse events include: corneal perforation, melting,
      uncontrolled inflammation, severe infection.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Corneal thickness, Subjective corneal clarity, Pain as assessed
      by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Measurement Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA)

      Study Treatment: Subjects will be implanted with the EndoArt®
