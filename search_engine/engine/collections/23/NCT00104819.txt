      Primary

        -  Provide treatment with autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine (FavId)™
           and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to patients with progressive grade 1, 2, or 3 follicular
           B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who did not receive FavId™ while enrolled on protocol
           FAV-ID-06.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate and response rate improvement after best response to prior
           salvage therapy in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to
      timing of disease progression while enrolled on protocol FAV-ID-06 (disease progression after
      prior rituximab AND never randomized vs disease progression after randomization to placebo
      arm).

      Patients receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.
      Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. Treatment repeats monthly for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      or responding disease may receive additional treatment as above every 2 months for 1 year (6
      treatments) and every 3 months until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days or until the start of
      subsequent treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 238 patients (67 in group I and 171 in group II) will be
      accrued for this study.
