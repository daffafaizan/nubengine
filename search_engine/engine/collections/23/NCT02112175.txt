      lenalidomide treatment arm; 117 in the placebo treatment arm) and the study will be conducted
      in European countries. However, due to the significant enrollment challenges and the changes
      in the NDMM treatment practices in subjects who are not eligible for transplant, such as the
      recent approval of Revlimid in NDMM setting, the DMC recommended to close study enrollment.
      Study enrollment was closed on 12 October 2015.
