      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy and toxicity of licorice root extract in combination with
           docetaxel in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the ability of licorice root extract to alter surrogate markers of estrogen
           activity and cytotoxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral licorice root extract 3
      times a day on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
