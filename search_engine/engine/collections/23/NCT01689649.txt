      trial to assess the tolerability and efficacy of topiramate as monotherapy in recently
      (within 5 years) diagnosed patients with epilepsy. Treatment naive patients (patients who
      have never received the treatment before) and patients who failed on their first AED in
      monotherapy are allowed. Failure is defined as a lack of efficacy and/or tolerability of that
      AED and the reason for failure is recorded by the physician. A lack of efficacy is
      characterized when the patient has been treated with AED at target dose but the patient still
      has seizure. Topiramate will first be titrated up to an initial target dose that will be
      reached after 4-6 weeks. Further dose titration is guided by the clinical response of the
      individual patient, but the dose may not exceed a maximum of 400mg/day [9mg/kg/day for
      children]. If the patient uses an AED at entry, the AED will be fully tapered off over a
      period of 3 weeks, starting at the beginning of week 2, in order to have all patients on
      topiramate monotherapy at visit 3. Tapering the AED off may, however, extend this 3-week
      period if clinically indicated. Visits will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 12,
      16 weeks. The total duration for each patient in the study will be 4 months.
