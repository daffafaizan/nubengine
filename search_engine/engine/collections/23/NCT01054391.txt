      who are afflicted die in the first 30 days as a result of the SAH, or remain severely
      disabled from the bleed. Existing treatment options include: medical management; endovascular
      therapy and surgical therapy. Endovascular techniques using detachable coils have now been
      refined to include stents which serve to prevent the coil mass from dislodging. Further
      improvement is believed to be possible with the NEC which creates a seal to exclude the
      aneurismal lumen from blood flow without the need for coils. This study involves the
      endovascular placement of the NEC across the aneurysm neck in order to treat a subset of
      aneurysms without coils.
