      prevalent in Primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS). In the studies conducted so far, the frequency
      of fatigue was seen at a frequency of over 30% in Primary Sjögren's syndrome. Although
      fatigue is so common in PSS, there is not enough data about the conditions in which fatigue
      develops in PSS. Other common conditions in PSS, apart from fatigue, are psychometric
      disorders such as common pain, depression and anxiety, and sleep disorders. In the studies
      conducted so far, each situation mentioned is common in PSS and seems to be related to each
      other. In the literature, there is no data on how many psychometric parameters, pain level,
      and insomnia affect fatigue and which are independent risk factors in PSS.
