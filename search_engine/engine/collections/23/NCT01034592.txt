      length. Subjects will receive lenalidomide 2.5 mg weekly during days 1 to 21 of cycle 1 (dose
      level 1). If patients do not experience any grade > 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 2.5 mg twice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 2 (dose
      level 2). If patients do not experience any grade > 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 5 mg twice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 3 (dose
      level 3). If patients do not experience any grade >3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity,
      the dose will be increased to 5 mg thrice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 4 (dose level 4).
      Patients who experience grade >3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity at dose level 1 will
      be discontinued from study. Patients who experience grade > 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity at dose level 2, 3, or 4 will have the lenalidomide held and dose reduced according
      to protocol dose interruption/modification algorithms (section 5.5.3). If at least a minor
      erythroid response is not achieved at the end of 8 cycles of treatment, patients will be
      discontinued from study. If a minor or major erythroid response is achieved after completion
      of 8 cycles of treatment, patients can continue study drug on a maintenance phase until loss
      of erythroid response (return to baseline hemoglobin or transfusion requirement) or
      unacceptable toxicity.
