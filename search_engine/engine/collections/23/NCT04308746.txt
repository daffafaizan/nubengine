      and power distance orientations, and answer questions on their demographics such as gender,
      race, employment etc.

      24 hours later, participants fill in a 2nd survey where they are instructed to complete 1 out
      of 2 possible priming tasks. The possible tasks consist of an Individualistic priming
      condition and a Collectivistic priming condition; both tasks require participants to answer 3
      statements each to 3 questions regarding the self or their social group. Participants then
      indicate their choice on whether to donate their organs (default or opt-out), rate their
      confidence regarding their choice and complete the same scales measuring their cultural and
      power distance orientations.
