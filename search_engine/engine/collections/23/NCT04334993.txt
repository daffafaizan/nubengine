    
      This is a national, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefit of
      a modified pediatric-based approach in young adults with Ph-neg ALL. Safety and efficacy of
      pre-transplant antibody-based consolidation in high-risk patients with Ph-neg ALL will be
      assessed.

      Young-adult patients eligible with Ph-neg ALL, LBL and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)
      will undergo risk stratification and started on the pediatric Italian Association of
      Pediatric Hematology Oncology-Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (AIEOP-BFM) 2009 protocol. Patients
      defined as having non-high-risk disease features (non-HR) as defined by MRD and/or
      cytogenetic criteria will complete the non-HR chemotherapy arm per protocol. Patients
      designated as having HR disease features after 2 induction blocks will be treated with CNS
      directed block followed by up to 2 cycles of blinatumomab (for B-cell ALL) followed by
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All patients will be centrally assessed for MRD and for
      Ph-like status.
