    
      This is a single institution, nonrandomized, open-label pilot study of dovitinib as
      maintenance and adjuvant therapy in patients with colorectal and pancreas cancers.

      Patient Populations:

      Cohort 1: Stage 4 Colon Cancer s/p metastasectomy (Adjuvant cohort)

      Cohort 2: Stage 4 Colon Cancer after initial chemotherapy (Maintenance cohort)

      Cohort 3: Pancreas Cancer s/p resection and adjuvant chemo (Adjuvant cohort)

      Cohort 4: Locally advanced pancreas cancer s/p chemo and radiation (Maintenance cohort)

      Each of the 4 cohorts will be accrued independently. 15 patients will be accrued to each
      cohort. Treatment will begin following the completion of the standard adjuvant or induction
      therapy. Patients will continue to take dovitinib until they demonstrate progression of
      disease using standard RECIST criteria, withdraw consent, or experience unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and urine Biomarker studies will be performed on all patients in all cohorts. Samples
      will be collected at baseline and every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and then every 3
      months thereafter, while patients are on study. Blood and urine will be collected and banked
      for protein, miRNA and metabolomic analysis. Tumor specimens will be taken from patients in
      maintenance cohorts before and 2 weeks after initiation of dovitinib. All of these samples
      will be analyzed to determine if biomarkers of benefit and progression can be determined.
