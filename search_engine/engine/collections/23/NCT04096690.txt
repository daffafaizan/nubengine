      heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 5%~10%.
      The frequency of ENKTL among NHL patients is significantly higher in Asia than in Western
      countries, with poor prognosis. L-asparaginase-based chemotherapy has improved the survival
      for these patients with advanced stage. However, there is no standard of care for those
      patients with advanced stage. Anti-PD-1 antibody has been proven its efficacy in relapsed or
      refractory NK/T cell lymphoma. This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of PD-1 antibody in combination with pegaspargase in treatment of newly diagnosed
      advanced stage NK/T-cell lymphoma.
