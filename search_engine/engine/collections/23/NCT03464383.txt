      measurement-based depression care into a specialty clinic setting and extend the concept to
      treat depression and/or anxiety. The investigators' neurologist/APP-administered medication
      intervention utilizes FDA-approved drugs with advantageous features for use in epilepsy
      (escitalopram and venlafaxine) and a telephone-based chronic care management plan for
      repeated symptom measurement and side effect surveillance. The proposed intervention may
      overcome barriers to implementing mental health treatment interventions in generalized
      clinical settings by using healthcare providers commonly present in specialty clinics
      (physicians and APPs) along with a billable, best practices chronic care management
      intervention package and EMR-based clinical tools.To test this idea, the investigators seek
      to pilot a randomized trial of neurologist/APP medication management of depression and
      anxiety versus usual care with psychiatry referral in the epilepsy clinic, using epilepsy as
      a paradigm for chronic medical illness with high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity. The
      optional survey arm is to help investigators understand the population that do not meet
      criteria or refuse intervention.
