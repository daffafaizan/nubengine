    
      25 healthy subjects from age 18-45 are recruited.

      Subjects will be examined on three examination days. Four days prior to the examination days
      the subjects will consume a standard diet based on the amount of sodium and calories.

      On the examination day subjects are randomised to an infusion with either isotonic saline 23
      ml/kg, hypertonic saline 7 ml/kg or glucose 23 ml/kg for a period of 50 minutes.

      Renal function is measured by renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA, urinary sodium, potassium and
      creatinine.

      Urinary NCC, NKCC and ENAC will be measured to evaluate the activity of sodium channels in
      the nephron.
