      our study. These patients will be divided into two groups - with and w/o fatty liver. The
      severity of fatty liver will be determined using the CT scan (as well as other parameters,
      such as the size of subcutaneous fat layer). Within 72 hours from the scan, a venous blood
      test will be taken from the enrolled patients (together with a BMI calculation and a blood
      pressure measurements). In the blood test we will examine liver functions, iron status etc.

      This is a preliminary study that will aid in planning future strategies to treat or even
      prevent fatty liver (one of the epidemics of our century).
