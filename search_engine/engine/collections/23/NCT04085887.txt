    
      Primary objective: is to assess safety of panitumumab-IRDye800 in pediatric patients
      undergoing brain surgery to remove suspected tumors.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To identify the optimal dose of panitumumab IRDye800 in pediatric patients

        -  To determine efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 to detect microscopic disease and residual
           tumor during surgical resection of pediatric malignant brain tumors

      Pediatric subjects will undergo standard of care, histopathologically-based, surgical
      resection of tumor 1 to 5 days after infusion of Panitumumab-IRDye800. Intraoperative imaging
      will be performed using an intraoperative optical imaging devices and wide-field imaging
      devices.

      Back table imaging of the resection tissue (ex vivo) will be also performed with the
      wide-field device. Ex vivo imaging of the specimens prior to and during pathological
      assessment will be performed using the non-invasive, close field imaging device that does not
      violate or destroy the tissue. Additional imaging devices used solely on the back table are
      not included in this record, as the data is collected is not used for medical decisions and
      such devices are therefore not interventions.

      Pediatric subjects will be followed for 30 days following their study infusion with scheduled
      follow up visits on the day of surgery (Day 1 5), Day 15, and Day 30.
