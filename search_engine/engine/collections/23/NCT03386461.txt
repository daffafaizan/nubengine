      with systemic pro-inflammatory state similarly to the alterations observed in obese
      individuals. Metabolic and immune dysfunction of adipose tissue has been suggested as an
      important contributing trigger to this condition. EXODYA project is a clinical study in
      elderly individuals that aims to establish benefits of lifestyle intervention and nutritional
      supplementation -either alone or in combination- for the amelioration of systemic and adipose
      tissue metabolic and immune disturbances. Effects of 4 monthsÂ´ intervention with combined
      aerobic plus resistive exercise training and supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids on systemic metabolic profile and molecular characteristics of adipose tissue
      will be investigated in elderly women. Thus, a proof-of-concept will be provided for novel
      recommendations and guidelines for lifestyle interventions in elderly population
