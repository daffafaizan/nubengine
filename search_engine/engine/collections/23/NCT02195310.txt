      surrounding intact skin for patients with an increased risk for developing post-operative
      complications such as infection.The purpose of this study is to compare the use of Prevena™
      Incision Management System (IMS) versus standard wound care for the incision in subjects
      undergoing a sternal midline incision (sternotomy). The subjects targetted for the study are
      at high risk for surgical complications (like infections) around the environment of the
      incision.

      The Prevena™ IMS is a small portable device, which consists of a mild vacuum unit that
      delivers negative pressure and a dressing that is intended for use over closed incisions
      after surgery. It is used for a minimum of 4 days up to a maximum of 7 days. This system is
      commercially available and has a CE mark, which means that it is approved for the use on the
      European market. It is intended to be applied immediately post sternotomy surgery on a closed
      clean incision.

      The results of this study could contribute to a better and faster healing of the incision.

      The study is conducted in The Netherlands, Germany and Austria.
