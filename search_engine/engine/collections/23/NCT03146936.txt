      elucidate epidemiology, natural history, response to treatment and outcome. In addition, a
      biobank allows addressing specific scientific issues on a variety of open questions. The
      cohort will provide a platform for carrying out scientific research projects on PSC. In
      addition, the cohort will allow collaborations with reference networks on PSC abroad
