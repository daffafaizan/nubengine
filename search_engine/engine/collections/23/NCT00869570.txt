        -  Determine the recommended dose of neoadjuvant capecitabine when given together with
           sorafenib tosylate and external-beam radiotherapy in patients with K-ras mutated,
           locally advanced rectal cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the efficacy and safety of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of capecitabine followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and oral sorafenib tosylate once daily on days
      1-33. Patients also undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19,
      22-26, and 29-33. Approximately 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients
      undergo surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then periodically for
      up to 3 years.
