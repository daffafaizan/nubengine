      pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages in diabetes and related cardiovascular
      complications.

      The study focuses on 5 adult patients' population with different diabetic status and level of
      cardiovascular risk:

        -  Patients with uncomplicated type 1 or type 2 diabetes and low cardiovascular risk

        -  Patients with uncomplicated type 1 or type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk

        -  Patients with complicated type 1 or type 2 diabetes

        -  Patients without diabetes and with a high cardiovascular risk

        -  Patients without diabetes and with a history of cardiovascular event

      Participants (n=1650) will be recruited at clinical sites, in the diabetes and cardiology
      departments (APHP, Bichat - Claude-Bernard Hospital and APHP, Lariboisi√®re Hospital), over a
      2-year period.

      The study will consist in a single visit. During a scheduled hospitalization or consultation
      as part of the follow-up of their diabetes or as part of the follow-up of their cardiological
      problems, clinical data will be collected as well as additional blood and urine samples for
      analyses and biobanking. There will be no other intervention specific to the study.
