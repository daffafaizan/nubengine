      phase to determine their eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, participants will
      undergo three, separate "endometrial preparatory cycles". These cycles will consist of
      estrogen supplementation to mimic normal, above normal, and highly elevated estradiol levels.
      Once supplementation is complete uterine procedures will be done to hopefully determine the
      effects of the estrogen levels on the uterine lining. Subcutaneous leuprolide injections,
      intramuscular estrogen, and progesterone injections will be used to mimic the levels needed.
      Blood draws will monitor the needed estradiol and progesterone levels during the injection
      phase of the cycle. Once the injection phase is complete, transvaginal ultrasound, uterine
      aspiration, and endometrial biopsy will be done.
