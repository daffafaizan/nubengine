      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for GWI (Gulf War Illness) and have high
      physiologic stress. This phase I single-site, open-label, two-arm study will focus on
      optimizing the dosage of a sequential etanercept-mifepristone intervention for GWI. Twenty
      participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 13, 16 and 24 weeks. The investigators will
      use systems biology methods to perform computational modelling of physiological responses to
      supervised maximal exercise challenge studies on a fitness bicycle at baseline, 16 weeks and
      24 weeks. These analyses will assess the impact of the treatment on homeostatic networks: the
      changes in levels of physiological parameters and the changes in inter-correlations among the
      measured parameters (e.g., cytokines), cross-sectionally and over time. Participants will
      also undergo subjective assessments of functional health, symptom severity, pain, fatigue,
      and cognition at baseline, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 24 weeks. Participants will be observed through
      the treatment period and for 3 months after completion to assess immediate effects and
      durability of the response. The results of this phase I study will be compared to those from
      an existing short-duration study to identify the optimal duration and dosage for use in a
      future phase II study.
