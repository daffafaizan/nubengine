      1990's, there still exist those patients who cannot control seizures, and thus the advent of
      newer antiepileptic drugs is being desired. This is a multicenter, open-label, extension
      study in patients who have completed the preceding study (333369-KJ-02) and scheduled to
      continue until the study drug is approved. This study consists of Period 1 (1 year) and
      Period 2 (only in Japan; planned to continue until the drug is approved Primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the long-term safety (Adverse event, Lab test, Electrocardiogram,
      Vital signs, Pregnancy test, Physician Withdrawal Checklist) of RWJ-333369 at doses between
      200-800 mg/day in patients who have completed the preceding study. Secondary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of RWJ-333369 at doses between 200-800
      mg/day in patients who have completed the preceding study. Period 1:RWJ-333369 will be
      started at 400 mg/day. RWJ-333369 100 mg tablets or 200 mg tablets will be orally
      administered with noncarbonated water twice daily. The dose will be adjusted between 200
      mg/day and 800 mg/day based on effectiveness and tolerance. Period 2: The dose will be
      adjusted between 200 mg/day and 800 mg/day based on effectiveness and tolerance.
