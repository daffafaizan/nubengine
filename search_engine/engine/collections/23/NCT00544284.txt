    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated doses of bortezomib and
           temozolomide in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, recurrent metastatic brain
           tumors, or other refractory solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib in patients taking hepatic
           enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (Group A) and in those who are not (Group B).

        -  To describe the proportion of study patients treated with bortezomib and temozolomide
           who obtain a confirmed complete response or partial response.

        -  To report the percentage of patients with 6-month progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to concurrent hepatic enzyme-inducing
      anticonvulsants (HEIAs) (Group A) versus concurrent anticonvulsant drugs that cause modest or
      no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes OR no anticonvulsant drugs (Group B).

        -  Group A: Patients receive oral temozolomide once a day on days 1-5 and bortezomib IV on
           days 2, 5, 9, and 12. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group B: Patients receive temozolomide and bortezomib as in group A. Cohorts of patients
           in both groups receive escalating doses of both study drugs until the maximum tolerated
           doses are determined.

      All patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.
      Samples are analyzed for bortezomib concentration (groups A and B) and trough levels of
      anticonvulsants (group A only).
