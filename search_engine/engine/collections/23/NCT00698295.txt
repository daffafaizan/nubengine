      treatment. However, studies on the meaning of these changes are rare. The results of
      traditional analyses based on linear methodologies were inconsistent and hard to interpret.
      Therefore, non-linear analyses of EEG may provide additional information in evaluating
      antipsychotic-induced changes in EEG.

      In this study, we hypothesized that linear and non-linear EEG changes in patients with
      schizophrenia may be valuable in predicting treatment outcome. We also hypothesized that the
      assessment of other psychotic symptoms and side effects of antipsychotics may provide
      additional information in interpreting the results of EEG analyses.
