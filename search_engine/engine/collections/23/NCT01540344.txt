      at the time of initial diagnosis and up to 25% of all patients develop peritoneal
      carcinomatosis during the natural course of their disease as a common sign of tumor
      progression or recurrence.

      The existing data suggests that CRS and HIPEC as an integral part of a multidisciplinary
      treatment concept may improve long-term survival of selected patients with peritoneal
      carcinomatosis of colonic origin. Moreover, hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with
      oxaliplatin in combination with synchronous application of 5-FU/leucovorin seems to improve
      the efficacy of HIPEC in comparison to a mitomycin C-based intraperitoneal treatment regimen
      and may lead to a better local tumor control. The improved systemic treatment strategy with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy may lead to increased rates of complete macroscopic cytoreduction
      and together with the adjuvant treatment to better control of distant metastasis and tumor
      recurrence. However, there is no prospective study available evaluating the clinical and
      oncological outcome after standard-of-care chemotherapy including targeted anticancer therapy
      in combination with CRS and HIPEC. The published morbidity and mortality rates after CRS and
      HIPEC are comparable to other major gastrointestinal surgery and seem to be acceptable
      considering the expected improvement of oncological outcome.
