    
      The main goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of two different treatments
      during 12 months:

        1. Lifestyle modification program + metformin 850 mg twice daily

        2. Lifestyle modification program empagliflozin (12.5 mg) + metformin (850 mg) once daily
           plus linagliptin (2.5 mg) + metformin (850 mg) once daily On the following parameters,
           after 12 months of treatment

      1) Glucose metabolism, evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test 2) Insulin resistance
      evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance 3) Insulin secretion, evaluated by the oral glucose
      tolerance 4) Pancreatic beta cell function, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance test 5)
      Cardiovascular function, evaluated by standard echocardiography by left ventricular ejection
      fraction

      All the patients will have a basal evaluation with an oral glucose tolerance test, lipid
      profile and body composition measurement by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). After
      the basal evaluation, if the patients results with impaired fasting glucose and impaired
      glucose tolerance, they will be invited to the intervention phase where they will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month to review the adherence to the lifestyle
      modification program and to the medication, and every 6 months an OGTT. After 12 months ,
      patients will repeat the same evaluation performed at basal.
