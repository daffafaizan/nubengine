      have been given, men will be randomly assigned into either the collagenase clostridium
      histolyticum + penile traction therapy (CCH + PTT) group or to the surgery + penile traction
      therapy (surgery + PTT) group. Those in the CCH + PTT group will receive the full 4 series of
      8 Xiaflex injections with 1-3 days between each set of 2 injections and 6 weeks prior to the
      next series. Patients would then use the RestoreX traction device throughout the series to 3
      months post-treatment. Those that were assigned the surgery + PTT treatment protocol would
      undergo surgery using either penile plication or incision and grafting, depending on the
      degree of curvature and erectile function. Traction using RestoreX will also be prescribed to
      these men 2-4 weeks post-operatively until 3 months post-treatment. Key clinical outcomes of
      both treatment protocols will be compared.
