      with sham in eyes with central-involved DME and good vision. Photobiomodulation is
      irradiation by light in the 630-900 nanometer region of the spectrum.

      Furthermore, this pilot study is being conducted to determine whether the conduct of a
      pivotal trial has merit based on an anatomic outcome and provide information on outcome
      measures needed to design a pivotal trial.
