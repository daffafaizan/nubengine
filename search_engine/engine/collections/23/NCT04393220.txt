      showed benefit only in a fraction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Specific
      blockade of vascular endothelial receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) using a murine antibody significantly
      delayed primary tumor growth but failed to prolong survival. Combining PD-1 blockade with
      antiangiogenesis has shown promise in substantially increasing the fraction of HCC patients
      who respond to treatment in vitro. Based on these clinical data, we are aimed to
      investigation the safety and efficacy of combination therapy for HCC patients.
