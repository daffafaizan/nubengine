      pain. Patients with MB often complain about chest discomfort more serious than the degree of
      vessel compression. The symptoms are also often inconsistence with the degree of coronary
      stenosis. Reports suggested that patients with MB may companioned with depression and
      anxiety. Moreover, patients with MB often have other systemic complaints including stomach
      pain, pain on the back, ear blockage, et al. Investigators assume that somatic symptom
      disorder (SSD) may play a part in aggregating the severity of symptoms. In order to screen
      SSD, investigators previously developed the Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-CN)
      questionnaire. It is a somatic and psychological symptom scale which was developed based on
      the DSM-5 to assess a combination of psychological, behavioral and somatic symptoms. It is
      designed to assess the presence and severity of the symptoms. Investigators have validated
      its reliability and validity in a previous study. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the prevalence of physical and mental disorder in the population of patients with
      MB and to describe the relationship between clinical features and the occurrence of somatic
      disorder.
