      responsible of a wide range of immune side effects such as antiphospholipid syndrome. Those
      are poorly described, due to the modificationof the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition
      of several of these adverseevents.

      This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by immune side effects
      imputed to drugs in particular antiphospholipid syndrome.

      A causality assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala
      Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.
