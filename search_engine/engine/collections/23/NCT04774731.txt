      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a whole-body vibration (WBV) group or controlled group. Patients
      in a WBV group will receive WBV training three times a week before initiation of dialysis
      sessions for 12 weeks. The primary outcome of the study will be the change in walking
      performance assessed by the timed up and go test.
