      from paroxysmal or persistent AF, indicated to undergo catheter ablation will be included.
      The study will consist of: i) patient enrolment, ii) treatment phase, and iii) 1-year
      follow-up phase. The duration of the study is expected to be 24 months, from first patient
      enrolment to last patient follow up.

      In a recent meta-analysis including 1188 patients, free from arrhythmic recurrences at 12
      months after a single ablative procedure with a laser balloon and without continuous
      monitoring with ILR was 74%1.

      Assuming that the approach without post-ablative verification of pulmonary vein isolation and
      continuous monitoring with ILR can lead to a 60% success rate at 12 months, 80 patients are
      required to have an 80% probability to observe a level of 2-code significance of 0.05 in an
      exponential model with the log rank test. With an estimated loss of data (patients lost to
      follow-up, protocol deviations and incomplete data) of 5%, the total number of patients to be
      enrolled is 82.

      Subject screening and enrolment will be carried out for approximately 12 months. The study
      will continue up to 12 months after last patient enrolment, dependent on the rate of
      enrolment and the regulatory timeline (as applicable).
