      can also cause serious adverse events. Individuals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
      are administered and therefore exposed to high doses of heparin. Studies have shown that up
      to 61% of cardiac bypass patients develop elevated levels of antibodies to heparin-PF4 after
      surgery. This immune response may activate blood platelets, possibly resulting in a blood
      clot. These clots most often develop in the legs and lungs, and may lead to a heart attack or
      stroke. The frequency of such a reaction has yet to be determined definitively. This study
      will evaluate the incidence of an immune response to heparin-PF4 that leads to the formation
      of blood clots in individuals who have had heart surgery.

      Participants in this study will be recruited prior to a scheduled cardiac bypass surgery.
      They will first complete a structured pre-operative interview to collect baseline measures on
      demographics, comorbidities, history of heparin exposures, and prior thromboembolic events.
      Immediately prior to surgery, a blood sample will be taken to assess the individual's
      platelet count and level of antibodies to heparin-PF4. Following the operation, participants
      will be followed daily to assess heparin exposure, platelet counts, and any blood clotting.
      Subsequent blood samples will be taken 5 days and 1 month following the surgery to again
      evaluate the individual's platelet count and level of heparin-PF4 antibodies. Additionally,
      participants will undergo a structured interview at 1 and 3 months post-surgery to evaluate
      the incidence of outcomes related to heparin-PF4 antibodies.
