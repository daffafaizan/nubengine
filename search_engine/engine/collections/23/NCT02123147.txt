      cells from blood samples will be separated. Tests will be done to see which substances these
      cells make. Using sequencing techniques, the investigators will determine the genetic code of
      the receptors expressed on these cells. The investigators plan to test how these cells change
      over the period of at least 3 years at different visits. In addition, the investigators will
      check how these changes relate to patients' general medical history relevant to autoimmune
      disease, lab results and physical examinations and exams pertinent to the diagnosis of
      autoimmune disease, and psychosocial data.
