      in the world. PAD is associated with a major decline in functional status and claudication is
      the most evident symptom. Current claudication therapies reveal significant limitations.
      Pharmacotherapy and exercise are recommended in 2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the management of
      lower extremity PAD patients with claudication. However, they may not achieve an ideal
      clinical therapeutic effect. Furthermore, endovascular procedure may not be feasible, durable
      or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.

      The aim of this trial is to verify the hypothesis that SDT can reduce the inflammation of
      PVAT and improve PWT among PAD patients with symptom of intermittent claudication.
