      will be randomized 1/1 to 780 pump or standard of care (continue with current treatment of
      insulin pump without closed-loop or multiple daily insulin injections). Participants will be
      stratified according to study center, baseline Hba1c, and method of insulin delivery (pump or
      injections). Participants will be followed-up till delivery. To account for differences in
      the type of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) used between the intervention group and the
      control group, the same CGM system as in the 780 insulin pump group (Guardianâ„¢ Sensor 3) will
      be used in a blinded manner in the control group to collect CGM data during at least four
      different time points in pregnancy: at 14-17 weeks, 20-23 weeks, 26-29 weeks and 33-36 weeks.
