      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy in patients with stage IIIB
           or IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with docetaxel and cisplatin with or without
           dimesna.

        -  Compare the feasibility of these regimens, in terms of febrile neutropenia and treatment
           delays, in these patients.

        -  Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the survival and failure-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I*: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1
           and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2.

        -  Arm II*: Patients receive docetaxel, cisplatin, and pegfilgrastim as in arm I and
           dimesna IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      NOTE: *In both arms, darbepoetin alfa is administered SC on day 1 of each course for
      hemoglobin â‰¤ 11 g/dL.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
