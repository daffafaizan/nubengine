      The role of the commensal flora in many disease states, including irritable bowel syndrome,
      inflammatory bowel disease, and even obesity, is now accepted and will undoubtedly lead to
      new therapeutic strategies. The recently NIH-initiated Human Microbiome Project will allow
      better understanding of the role of this complex intestinal community in human health and
      disease. On the clinical side, we are exploring the more common pathogenic bacterial strains
      in Irritable bowel syndrome patients and use of probiotics in this functional
      gastrointestinal disease. We are taking support from Genotypic institute, Bangalore for
      Illumina sequencing facility.

      Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, the parent institution, is a 200 bed tertiary care
      referral hospital providing services to patients with GI diseases, with a daily attendance of
      400 out-patients and 200 in-patients. The long term goals of the investigators, involving
      basic researchers and clinicians, include development of technological resources and
      applications of biotechnology for use in clinical trials to improve survival rates of
      patients with GI diseases. The major volume of the outpatient cases comprise of patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. Altered GI microbiota may contribute to IBS symptoms and studying
      dysbiosis in gut microbiota is an important to develop therapy for IBS.
