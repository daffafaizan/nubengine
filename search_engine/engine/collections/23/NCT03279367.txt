        1. Are speech-evoked objective brain responses sensitive to hearing aid amplification?

        2. Are speech-evoked brain responses sensitive to distortions in speech and can hearing aid
           amplification resolve issues with brain responses to distorted speech?

        3. Which tests are optimal for detection of objective brain responses to speech?

        4. Are realistic speech stimuli (words or running speech) able to robustly detect brain
           responses compared to current clinical standards (clicks and tones)? The study will be
           carried out on a group of mildly to moderately hearing impaired subjects between the age
           of 18 and 70. Subjects will be recruited from the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust,
           where the research will be conducted. Participants will have their hearing function and
           hearing aid fitting checked as described in the design and methodology section of this
           proposal. During the experiment, participants will be asked to listen to speech sounds
           presented from a loudspeaker at comfortable listening levels. The responses will be
           measured with the participant wearing and not wearing hearing aids. Additionally,
           participants will perform a behavioural task for perception of speech. Participants will
           be asked to attend 2 sessions of 2 hours. Data collection will run over 1 year.
