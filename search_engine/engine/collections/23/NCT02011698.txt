      drastically lowered with the introduction of the mesh , on the other hand the rate of chronic
      pain is reported to be high in many papers.

      The chronic pain influences the quality of life and what's more causes an increase in the
      social costs.

      the classical Lichtenstein inguinal anterior erniorrhaphy , wich is the technique suggested
      by the international guidelines, expected to fix the mesh with non absorbable sutures .

      The investigators would analyze the possible correlation between the method of mesh fixation
      and chronic pain keeping a lower rate of recurrence.

      That said the primary endpoint in this study is the rate of recurrence and the secondary
      endpoint is the rate of chronic pain after lichtenstein anterior inguinal erniorrhaphy in the
      three different methods of fixation of the mesh
