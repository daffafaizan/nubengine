      The investigators are examining feasibility for implementation alongside effectiveness, to
      shorten the timeline to implementation.

      Aim 1 (primary aim): To compare 6-month (primary endpoint) and 9-month (sustained effects)
      effects of peer-supported chronic pain self-management versus controls on overall pain
      (intensity and function).

      Hypothesis 1: Veterans in the peer support arm will experience reduced overall pain compared
      to controls.

      Aim 2 (secondary aim): To compare 6- and 9-month effects of peer-supported chronic pain
      self-management versus controls on self-efficacy, social support, pain coping, patient
      activation, health-related quality of life, and health service utilization.

      Hypothesis 2: Veterans in the peer support arm will experience greater self-efficacy, social
      support, pain coping, patient activation, and health-related quality of life, and lower
      health service utilization, compared to controls.

      Aim 3 (pre-implementation aim): To explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of
      peer support for chronic pain, intervention costs, and fidelity to the model.
