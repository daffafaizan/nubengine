      pregnancy with ≥ 37- ≤ 41+5 weeks of gestation. Participants are randomised to two groups:
      one hundred are randomised to the inpatient and one hundred to the outpatient group.

      The main outcome measure is the pain evaluated by VAS at one, five , nine and 13 hours after
      the placement of double balloon induction catheter. The investigators assess also the effect
      of the sleep disturbance and depression of the mother to the pain during balloon catheter
      induction of the labour.

      The total hospital stay and induction to delivery interval time is measured. Also the mode of
      birth as well as maternal and neonatal morbidity and patient satisfaction are recorded.
