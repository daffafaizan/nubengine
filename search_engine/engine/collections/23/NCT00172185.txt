    
      Teduglutide is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a
      peptide secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. GLP-2 is known to increase intestinal
      and portal blood flow, and inhibit gastric acid secretion. Teduglutide binds to the
      glucagon-like peptide-2 receptors located in intestinal subpopulations of enteroendocrine
      cells, subepithelial myofibroblasts and enteric neurons of the submucosal and myenteric
      plexus. Activation of these receptors results in the local release of multiple mediators
      including insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, nitric oxide and keratinocyte growth factor
      (KGF).

      This multicenter, double-blind, international, Phase III trial will have a treatment period
      of 28 weeks. Subjects in this study are those who received teduglutide or placebo in protocol
      CL0600-004 (NCT00081458). These subjects will receive daily subcutaneous injections of 0.05
      milligrams or 0.10 milligrams of teduglutide per kilogram of body weight. Subjects will have
      visits every 4 to 6 weeks and will be assessed for parenteral nutrition (PN) reduction with a
      follow-up period of 4 weeks duration for those subjects who do not complete this protocol, or
      do not enter into the long-term safety extension protocol CL0600-010.
