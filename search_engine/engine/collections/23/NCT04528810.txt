      the Haddon Injury Control Model, 90 percent of injuries are both predictable and preventable.
      Injuries are preventable, not "accidents". All unintentionally and intentionally injured
      children first visit to the emergency department are recruited in the study. Children's
      Hospital of Fudan University with a Regional Pediatric Trauma Centre is also the first
      Pediatric Injury Prevention Center established in China. We conduct a prospective cohort
      study to investigate the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of the injured child
      first visit to the emergency department, which expected to serve as evidence of injury
      prevention and promising practices. In the study, we collect and analyze high quality data of
      child injury based on data mining.
