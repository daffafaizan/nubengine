      patients ranging from 25-70 years diagnosed with erectile dysfunction will be selected. This
      diagnosis is based on medical history, validated questionnaires, physical examinations,
      laboratory tests and specific diagnostic tests.

      The patients are followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as
      Doppler ultrasound.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intracavernous injection of stem cells will facilitate
      the recovery of erectile function resulting in satisfying clinical outcomes in patients.
