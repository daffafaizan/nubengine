      single and repeat dose study. A total of 16 healthy subjects aged 18-45 years will be
      randomised with the aim of achieving at least 10 evaluable subjects to each treatment period.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the systemic steroid PD effects (serum cortisol 24 hour
      weighted mean on Day 7) of FF and systemic ÃŸ-adrenergic PD effects (ECG maximum QTcF 0-4h and
      whole blood potassium 0-4h in Day 1 and Day 7) of VI; the secondary objectives are aimed to
      evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of FF/VI inhalation powder after a single and repeat
      dose administration.
