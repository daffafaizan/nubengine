    
      This is a 12-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      flexible-dose study of duloxetine 60-120 mg/day in patients with BED and comorbid depressive
      disorders. Patients will be randomly assigned to either duloxetine 30 mg capsules or matching
      placebo at the baseline visit. The initial dose of study medication will be one 30 mg
      duloxetine capsule/day or placebo with a planned increase to 60 mg/day (2 X 30 mg) or
      matching placebo at the end of week 1. Further dose increases of 30 mg up to 120 mg/day will
      be allowed after the end of week two based on the investigators' assessment of efficacy and
      tolerability. Dosing will be either once per day or twice a day depending on tolerability.
      Patient visits will occur at screening and baseline and at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10, and 12. Study drug will be tapered by 30 mg every 3 days at the end of the study.
