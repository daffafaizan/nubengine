      post-myocardial infarction systolic dysfunction in three major randomized placebo controlled
      trials. Together these trials have demonstrated a reduction in mortality, hospitalization and
      a regression in left ventricular mass by MRI.

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study will be to assess the change in markers
      of collagen turnover and correlate this with specific measures of left ventricular mass
      regression and diastolic function on MRI after 4 months of aldosterone blockade.

      Study Design and Methods This study is a double-blind, concealed allocation, randomized trial
      at the University of Alberta where patients with diastolic heart failure will be randomized
      to spironolactone or matching placebo for 4 months. Outcomes assessed include LV mass by MRI,
      collagen markers, other biomarkers, clinical outcomes, quality of life and exercise testing
