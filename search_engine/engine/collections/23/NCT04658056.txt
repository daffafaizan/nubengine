    
      The study is a post-market, non-interventional, two-arm, long-term follow-up study of
      patients previously enrolled in the WATER Study (NCT02505919) - which was a prospective
      multi-centre randomized blinded study comparing Aquablation of the prostate with the AQUABEAM
      Robotic System with standard transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the treatment
      of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). In POST WATER, up to 46 WATER Study subjects in the
      United Kingdom who were active on the study at 36 months will be invited to participate,
      across 3 clinical study sites in England and Wales. The study will consist of one follow-up
      time-point at 60 months (5 years) from the time of initial WATER Study treatment date.
