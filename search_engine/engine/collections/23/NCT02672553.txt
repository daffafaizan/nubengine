    
      This is a randomized study to compare the cross-clamp time (XCT) and cardiopulmonary bypass
      time (CPBT) of the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system in a minimally invasive surgical approach
      (MIS) with any commercially available aortic bioprosthesis in standard full sternotomy
      surgical approach, in patients with logistic EuroScore < 20 undergoing elective isolated
      aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

      Additionally, the aim is to gather sufficient data to quantify the effect size of short term
      patient benefit outcomes previously identified from literature and to explore additional
      healthcare resource utilization endpoints.
