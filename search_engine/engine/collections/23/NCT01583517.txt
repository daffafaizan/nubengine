    
      Patients with idiopathic RAP, defined as ≥2 unexplained (per the treating physician) episodes
      of acute pancreatitis (based on standard criteria) requiring hospitalization, will be
      prospectively enrolled. All patients will undergo ERCP with manometry, with stratified
      randomization based on the assessment of pancreatic basal sphincter pressure. If <40mmHg, the
      patient will be randomized to sham or biliary sphincterotomy (BES). If ≥40mmHg, the patient
      will be randomized to BES or pancreatobiliary ("dual") sphincterotomy (DES).

      Patients and physicians will not be blinded to the assignment group. Patients will be
      followed for up to 10 years to determine 1) incidence of RAP requiring hospitalization (using
      standard definitions) or 2) interval development of chronic pancreatitis (CP).

      Differences between patients who did and did not develop RAP during follow-up will be
      compared to evaluate for factors associated with AP during follow-up.
