      electromagnetic pulses to the brain lasting twenty minutes. The field and timing parameters
      of the LFMS pulses, such as pulse timing, duration, frequency, and electric and magnetic
      field distribution and direction are different from other neurostimulation methods.

      The mechanism of action for the antidepressant effects of LFMS is hypothesized to be an
      effect on dendritic or synaptic activity in the cortex, brought about by low level electrical
      stimulation applied with particular timing. This is analogous to the synaptic effects of
      pharmaceutical antidepressants in providing a "boost" to synapses in certain brain regions.

      Previous investigations of LFMS included depressed subjects with bipolar disorder. This study
      will evaluate the antidepressant effects of multiple LFMS treatments in bipolar disorder and
      major depressive disorder.
