      suffer from severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). They are still at high
      risk of mortality and long term morbidity especially of the lung and the brain. At least
      death and chronic lung disease (CLD) are related to the need and the duration of mechanical
      ventilation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to be effective to
      avoid mechanical ventilation in the treatment of IRDS but it often fails in the most immature
      infants. Early or prophylactic surfactant application is effective in the treatment of IRDS
      and is the only causal therapy, but it is usually related to intubation and mechanical
      ventilation that should be avoided.Therefore to overcome the dilemma between need for
      mechanical ventilation with surfactant administration on the one hand and surfactant
      withholding with the use of CPAP on the other hand, a strategy was developed to administer
      surfactant during spontaneous breathing with CPAP (1). In the proposed prospective randomised
      controlled trial this strategy shall be compared with the recent gold standard in the therapy
      of extremely preterm infants with IRDS, that is intubation, mechanical ventilation and
      surfactant administration. Based on the results of a feasibility (1) study and some clinical
      observations it is hypothesised that the new approach is superior in avoidance of death and
      chronic lung disease compared to the recent gold standard.
