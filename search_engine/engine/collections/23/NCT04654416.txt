      Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV2 (RT-PCR SARS-CoV2), Berlin protocol, who required
      hospitalization in three hospitals in Antioquia, Colombia. Patients were treated according to
      the institutional protocol (from March 20, 2020 to June 30, 2020) with corticosteroid if the
      patient required supplemental oxygen. From July 1, 2020, the management protocol changed with
      the addition of colchicine to all patients admitted to the institutions. The treatment was
      supervised and monitored by the same specialist in infectology of the institutions.

      We describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patients who received these
      treatments. The patient's information was analyzed according to the outcome of interest
      (alive/dead) with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate measures to adjust the variables
      that presented statistical association.
