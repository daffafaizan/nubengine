      somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and
      may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect
      quality of life. It is therefore of utmost importance to accurately assess upper limb
      impairments. Clinical assessments exist for both motor and somatosensory function, but lack
      good psychometric properties. Robotic technology show promising potential and is readily
      available to assess motor function and proprioception. Robotic assessment for sensory
      processing is currently not yet available, despite being the most relevant somatosensory
      function. Indeed, sensory processing shows the strongest association with upper limb
      movement, and only shows incomplete recovery at 6 months after stroke.

      The investigators recently developed a novel robotic assessment of sensory processing, using
      the Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies Ltd., Canada). This cross-sectional study was set
      up to initially validate this novel robotic assessment and to collect pilot data to form the
      basis for future research. 20 chronic stroke patients and 20 age-matched controls will be
      recruited and will undergo extensive clinical and robotic assessment of upper limb motor and
      somatosensory function. The investigators hypothesize stoke patients with sensory processing
      deficits to have a worse performance on this novel robotic assessment compared to healthy
      controls and patients without sensory processing deficits. The investigators also hypothesize
      to see moderate to high correlations between the robotic assessment of sensory processing,
      and clinical assessments for both somatosensory and motor function.
