      activation and expansion of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor environment
      have the potential to induce an effective anti-tumor immune response in patients. NKTR-262 is
      a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8 designed to be retained in the
      tumor micro-environment in order to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as
      dendritic cells, to create new antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. As a CD122-biased agonist,
      bempegaldesleukin monotherapy increases newly proliferative CD8+ T cells in tumors. NKTR-262
      plus bempegaldesleukin is expected to increase expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In
      preclinical studies, a single IT injection of NKTR-262 plus IV bempegaldesleukin resulted in
      complete abscopal effects in tumor models. Preliminary clinical data show bempegaldesleukin
      plus nivolumab enhances immune-stimulatory responses. The REVEAL trial will assess safety and
      anti-tumor activity of NKTR-262 with bempegaldesleukin +/- nivolumab for the treatment of
      selected cancers.
