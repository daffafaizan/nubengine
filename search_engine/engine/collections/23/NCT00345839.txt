      parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and may develop large parathyroid glands in the neck.
      Patients with secondary HPT may have bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease may
      cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. Other problems from
      secondary HPT may include increases in blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. These may
      cause calcium to deposit in body tissues. Calcium deposits can cause arthritis (joint pain
      and swelling), muscle inflammation, itching, gangrene (death of soft tissue), or heart and
      lung problems. New evidence suggests that secondary HPT is associated with cardiovascular
      disease and increased death risk. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      cinacalcet (cinacalcet HCl or Sensipar®/Mimpara®) on cardiovascular events (having to do with
      the heart and its blood vessels) and death in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who are receiving dialysis. These events include death
      from any reason, heart attack and episodes where the heart does not get enough oxygen,
      peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of vessels that carry blood to the legs, arms, stomach
      or kidneys), and heart failure (a condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump
      enough blood to meet the need's of the body's tissues)
