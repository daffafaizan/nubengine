      equal groups, 35 patients each. All patients received premedication one hour before the
      procedure. PG group received 150 mg pregabalin and C group received placebo. All patients
      sedated to achieve optimum working conditions. Intra-operative respiratory rate and post
      procedure patients' and pulmonologists' satisfaction were compared in both groups.
