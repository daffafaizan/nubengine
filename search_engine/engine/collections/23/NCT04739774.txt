    
      This clinical trial is a single centre, single dose Phase I study, with a non-randomized,
      open label, one sequence cross-over design.

      A total of 24 healthy male and female are planned to be included.

      Participants will be dosed with CHF6001 before and during co-administration of Itraconazole
      and will act as their own control. The study will be run with a one-sequence crossover
      design, where all subjects will be treated with CHF6001 in the first treatment period and
      CHF6001+Itraconazole in the second treatment period in order to avoid the need of a very long
      washout from the CYP3A4/5 inhibitor.

      Standard safety assessments will be conducted during the Study, including safety blood and
      urine laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs and observations of any
      adverse events. Blood samples will be also collected for PK analysis.
