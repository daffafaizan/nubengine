      while we are fixing their broken hips. The spinal anesthesia provides pain relief at the site
      of surgery, while the sedative drugs keep people "asleep" during the procedure. We want to
      find out whether the amount of sedation we give might (1) make patients be confused when they
      wake up or (2) have anything to do with how well patients can do their ordinary daily
      routines a few months after their surgery.
