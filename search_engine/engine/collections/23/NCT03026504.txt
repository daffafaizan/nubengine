    
      Baricitinib, an orally administered, potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and
      JAK2 has shown preliminary safety and efficacy in chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory
      conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This small molecule is uniquely suited
      as a potential novel therapeutic agent in GCA because of its suppressive effect on both the
      Th17 (IL-6, IL-23) andTh1 (IL-12, IFN-Î³) pathways.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in a population of
      patients with relapsing GCA. The study is an open-label pilot study assessing the safety and
      tolerability of baricitinib (4 mg daily, oral, for 52 weeks) in addition to a standardized
      glucocorticoid taper. It is anticipated that adjunct baricitinib will be safe and well
      tolerated by patients with GCA and demonstrate preliminary efficacy as measured by reducing
      inflammatory markers, decreasing steroid requirements and increasing relapse-free survival.
