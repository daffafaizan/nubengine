      all-trans-retinoic acid, ascorbic acid (AAA) based-induction for 42 days. Daunorubicin
      (50mg/m^2/day for 3 days) will only be used during induction in patients <65 with presenting
      white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 10 x 10^9/L. In patients not receiving daunorubicin,
      hydroxyurea (2-4g/day) if WBC ≥ 5 x 10^9/L within the first 14 days of induction. Molecular
      monitoring monitoring with RQ-PCR or ddPCR for PML-RARA will be performed weekly during
      induction. A reassessment bone marrow aspirate will be performed on day 28 of induction for
      assessment of morphologic remission.

      Four weeks after the completion of induction phase, all patients, regardless of initial WBC,
      will receive two cycles of chemotherapy-free AAA consolidation (14 days every 28 days).

      Four weeks after completion of consolidation, all patients will receive 12 cycles of
      chemotherapy-free AAA maintenance (14 days every 8 week).

      Molecular monitoring monitoring with RQ-PCR or ddPCR for PML-RARA will be performed during
      every 4 weeks during consolidation, every 8 weeks during maintenance, and every 3 months for
      24 months after completion of maintenance.
