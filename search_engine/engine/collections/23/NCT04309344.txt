      patients will start immediately after the ethical committee approval. Considering our cases
      and our experience we plan to reach 40 patients (20 patients for group) which respect the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in 2 months. We plan to enroll 6 more patients (3 for each
      group) in order to cover eventual loss of patients during the follow-up and these patients
      will be evaluated after surgery only if there will not be any losses among the initial 40
      patients. During surgery, assessment of the chondropathy will be done and only patients with
      International Cartilage Regeneration and Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) grade 2 or 3
      chondropathy will be enrolled. After addressing the rotator cuff pathology, the patient will
      be randomized and the radio-frequency (RF) debridement will be performed or not performed, so
      the patients will enter the control group (no RF) or the treatment group. The clinical
      evaluation will be performed by R.R., preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months
      after surgery. At 3 months post-operatively an MRI will be obtained and assessed by an expert
      shoulder doctor with particular attention for the cartilage. All the data will be completed
      and analyzed in about 12-13 months after the enrollment is completed and we estimate to
      present the data by May 2020.
