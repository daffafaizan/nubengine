      can be diagnosed noninvasively based on its characteristic imaging features, that is,
      arterial hyperenhancement (washin) and hypoenhancement (washout) on portal or delayed phase
      at contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using
      extracellular contrast media (ECCM). According to Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System
      (LI-RADS), hypointensity and isointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) at gadoxetic
      acid-enhanced MRI are suggestive of malignancy and benignity, respectively, and those
      features are uniquely provided by only hepatocyte-specific contrast agent. However, these
      features are not included in diagnostic criteria because of its non-specificity, and indeed,
      gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is not yet included in AASLD and EASL guidelines as a diagnostic
      modality. If gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI would provide better performance to diagnose HCC
      than CT, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI should be considered as a next step before biopsy in
      those small and/or atypical nodules to avoid potential diagnostic pitfall and morbidity,
      which is currently depending on physicians' decision. Thus, it would be valuable to evaluate
      whether gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI would provide additional value for characterizing
      atypical or small (1~2cm) hepatic nodules at CT and to reduce the necessity of biopsy in
      patients with high risk of HCC.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate added value of gadoxetic acid-enhanced
      MRI for diagnosis of HCC in patients with small (10-19mm) or atypical hepatic nodules at CT.
