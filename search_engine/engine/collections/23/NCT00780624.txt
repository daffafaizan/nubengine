      some breaths, or extra support, to newborn infants through a small tube in the nose. NIPPV is
      safe and effective, and already in use as an alternate "standard" therapy. Nevertheless,
      NIPPV has never been used in chinese babies.

      The submitted trial is the first prospective, randomized trial Comparing NIPPV vs nCPAP in
      newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome.
