      associated with considerable disability.Under normal circumstances, synovial fluid in the
      knee joint cavity is absorbed by lymphatic vessels, and the balance of secretion and
      absorption of synovial fluid in the knee joint is maintained by the lymphatic system.

      When there is some kinds of injury of the knee joint synovial received cartilage stimulate,
      stimulate the synovial vasodilation, synovial cell proliferation activity, produce a large
      number of joint synovial fluid and secrete a large number of inflammatory liquid, lymphatic
      metabolism disorder, make joint cavity inflammatory liquid secretion is greater than the
      absorption, due to the repeated joint fluid absorption and secretion, articular synovial
      hyperplasia gradually, eventually lost its normal function, a swelling in the knee joint, and
      the content of inflammatory cytokines in joint fluid, obvious rise, stimulate the immersion
      in the subchondral bone nerve pain in synovial fluid.In the formation of inflammatory
      response, the pressure difference between the tissue fluid and the lymphatic vessels promotes
      the increase of lymphatic reflux, while the input lymphatic vessels tend to converge to the
      drainage lymph nodes in different regions.Therefore, the observation of changes in lymphatic
      reflux is more conducive to the evaluation of synovial inflammation and the occurrence of
      lymph node metastasis. Therefore, regional drainage lymph node metastasis can also be used as
      an important biological indicator for the evaluation of prognosis and the formulation of
      treatment strategies.

      Acupuncture could be a promising treatment option for knee OA due to the effectiveness of the
      pain relief and the rarity of adverse effects. In order to get some more reliable data to
      confirm acupuncture effectiveness on KOA, a long-term follow up interventional study with
      clear design, standard criteria, control group, will be started to confirm the effects of
      long term for acupuncture treatment.
