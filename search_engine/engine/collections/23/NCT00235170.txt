      45-50 centers which will include six hundred eligible patients with multivessel disease who
      should be equally treatable by surgery or stenting. In all patients the sirolimus-eluting Bx
      VELOCITYâ„¢ balloon expandable stent of Cordis will be used for treatment.The results of ARTS
      II will be compared with the by-pass arm of ARTS I as the historical control. It is
      hypothesized that a similar or higher number of lesions will be treated by stenting. We
      assume that the use of this eluting stent will not only reduce the rate of MACCE at 30 days,
      but that it will considerably reduce the need for re-intervention, which was historically
      21.0% in ARTS I.
