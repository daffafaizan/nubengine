      arrive in compromised state of mental, physical, and social health. This complexity asks for
      provision of integrated medical and social care to newly arrived refugees. With this aim, a
      university-community initiative developed a Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment
      tool (CaPRA) in Dari/Farsi for Afghan refugees. This innovative eHealth approach is first of
      its kind for Canadian refugees accessing primary care. In this model of care, patients
      complete an interactive multi-risk iPad computer survey in their own language before seeing
      the provider. The computer then generates individualized recommendation sheet for patients
      and a risk-report for providers at the point of care. The tool was developed through a
      collaborative process by working with Access Alliance Multicultural Health and Community
      Services and advisory board with community representatives.
