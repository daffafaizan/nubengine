      or placebo). The duration of the supplementation is 6 months. The total sample size at
      baseline is 100 subjects aged 60+ years with Metabolic Syndrome, and therefore at risk of
      cognitive decline but without definite cognitive pathologies.

      The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effect of nutritional
      supplementation with MERIVA® on the cognitive performance of subjects with Metabolic
      Syndrome, and therefore at risk of cognitive decline, with a view to maintaining the
      homeostatic balance of the function.

        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on the
           arterial properties of Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;

        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on
           glucose metabolism and on the lipid and immune structure of Subjects with Metabolic
           Syndrome;

        -  Evaluation of the influence of gender / gender on the response to nutritional
           supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;
