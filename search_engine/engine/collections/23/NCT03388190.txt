    
      Hypothesis: Most patients with mCRC harbor tumor that can be transformed into an immunogenic
      disease by oxaliplatin, and may thereby benefit from the addition of immune-modulating
      therapy to improve outcome of the current oxaliplatin-based standard-of-care.

      Primary objective: To determine progression-free survival (PFS), in terms of failure of
      treatment strategy, of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX (5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin
      and leucovorin) regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen
      in previously untreated MSS mCRC.

      Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability of sequential treatment with the
      Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen. To
      monitor and compare quality-of-life (QoL) alterations during therapy courses.
