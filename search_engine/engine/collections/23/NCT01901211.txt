      cardiovascular fitness and social wellbeing related to friends/peers in youths with CP. The
      secondary objectives of the study will be to evaluate the impact of the exergaming
      intervention on additional components of physical fitness including anaerobic fitness, and
      muscle strength. In addition, the effect of the exergaming intervention on overall
      health-related quality of life (HRQL), self-esteem and motor participation will also be
      measured. Finally, the effectiveness of a technique for balancing performance in multiplayer
      exergames will be evaluated. The objectives will be investigated using a randomized crossover
      study design.Outcomes will be measured a total of four times: at study entry and after the
      first ten-week period (either comparison or intervention), at the end of a six-week washout
      period, then again after second period (either intervention or comparison). Outcomes will be
      assessed by physiotherapists and research staff members who will be blinded to the condition
      of the participants.
