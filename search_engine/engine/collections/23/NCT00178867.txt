      carcinoma (a form of cancer arising within the liver) and compare these factors in patients
      from different ethnic groups and from different parts of the United States. The researchers
      will also conduct a survey of the stage of the cancer (how far advanced it is) and what
      treatments are used for this difficult-to-treat tumor.
