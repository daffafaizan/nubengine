      which influences the quality of life all over the world. A total of 100 patients diagnosed as
      slow transit constipation (STC) using Rome III criteria were randomized to receive either
      synbiotic or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical
      remission and improvement rate at week 4 and 12. Stool frequency and consistency, colonic
      transit time (CTT), evacuation and abdominal symptoms, Patient Assessment of Constipation
      Symptoms (PAC-SYM scores), Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index (GIQLI), Satisfaction
      scores and adverse events were also monitored.
