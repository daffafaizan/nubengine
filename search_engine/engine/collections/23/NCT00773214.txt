    
      Purpose - To identify predictors of weight loss in overweigh/obese volunteers following a 12
      week supervised exercise programme, and to characterise the variability in weight loss
      response.

      Method - Longitudinal study aiming to identify predictors of weight loss in response to a
      12-week exercise programme in healthy overweight/obese volunteers.

      Subjective and objective measures of appetite, cardiovascular fitness, anthropometry, body
      composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), fat and carbohydrate oxidation in the fasting
      state will be measured at baseline, before participants enroll for the study and after the
      exercise intervention.

      The preload/test-meal paradigm (using a high and low-energy preload: HEP vs LEP) will be used
      to assess short-term appetite control before and after the exercise intervention following a
      randomized single-blinded crossover design. Moreover, the long-term effects of exercise on
      cytokine plasma levels and fasting and postprandial levels of appetite related
      hormones/metabolites will also be assessed at baseline and end of the study. Participants
      will act as their own controls throughout the study.
