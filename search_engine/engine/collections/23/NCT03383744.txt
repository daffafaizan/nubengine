    
      Five months after the last supplementation (day 0), an oral dose (2 mg retinol equivalents)
      of label vitamin A ([2H8]-retinyl acetate) in oil will be administered to 80 eligible
      children together with a low vitamin A high-fat snack. Fasting venous blood samples (about 7
      ml) will be collected into evacuated foil-wrapped blood collection tubes specifically
      designed for the collection of serum (containing no anticoagulant and metal free) on the
      mornings of days 0 before the administration of the dose and on day 14 for quantitative
      estimation of initial vitamin A pool size and determination of potential confounding
      parameters (CRP, AGP, iron, zinc, malaria, carotenoids and retinoids). About six months after
      the last supplementation (day 30), each child will received the vitamin A supplement. After
      30 days and 90 days, two groups of 40 children (Grp1, Grp2) will respectively received a
      second dose of labeled vitamin A ([2H4]-retinyl acetate); fasting venous blood samples will
      be obtained before the administration of the dose and 14 days after dosing for quantitative
      estimation of final vitamin A pool size and determination of potential confounding
      parameters.
