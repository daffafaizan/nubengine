      It is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in addition to being
      associated with diabetes and CVD risk factors. Weight loss interventions that target body fat
      reductions are associated with reductions in cholesterol levels, blood pressure and fasting
      glucose. Xenical (orlistat) is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor which results in a
      reduction in the absorption of exogenous fat. Studies of up to two years duration have
      demonstrated that those taking Xenical plus diet lost significantly more weight than those
      taking placebo plus diet. Coincident with this were decreases in cholesterol levels. The use
      of Xenical in Type 2 diabetic patients being treated with sulfonylurea resulted in greater
      discontinuation of the sulfonylurea plus a greater reduction in sulfonylurea dosage compared
      to placebo. The use of Xenical in the clinical environment has the potential to improve CVD
      risk factors and potentially reduce the burden of other medications.This is a pilot study to
      investigate the effectiveness of Xenical on cardiovascular risk factors in the patients of
      St. Paul's Hospital Lipid Clinic.
