      treatment and have complained of dry mouth or developed worsening of a pre-existing dry mouth
      as an effect of CPAP treatment will test the effectiveness of NeutraSal mouthwash in
      preventing or reducing his/her dry mouth perceptions and improving their compliance with
      CPAP.
