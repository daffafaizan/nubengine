      Primary

        -  Compare the impact of telephone genetic counseling (TGC) versus standard genetic
           counseling (SGC) on utilization of BRCA1/BRCA2 testing in women at risk of carrying the
           BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation.

        -  Compare the relative efficacy of TGC versus SGC on satisfaction with the counseling
           process, informed decision making, psychosocial distress, and quality of life.

      Secondary

        -  Identify participant characteristics that predict differential response to TGC.

        -  Explore the mechanisms by which TGC or SGC impact distress and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to
      participating site. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  Group 1 (standard genetic counseling): Participants undergo an in-person genetic
           counseling session. Participants are then given the option of providing blood for
           genetic testing at the study site. Participants who choose to undergo genetic testing
           receive their results in-person from their genetic counselor.

        -  Group 2 (telephone-based genetic counseling): Participants undergo a telephone-based
           genetic counseling session. Participants who choose to undergo genetic testing receive a
           pre-labeled blood kit in the mail. Participants receive their results over the phone
           from their genetic counselor.

      After completion of genetic counseling, all participants are followed periodically for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 participants will be accrued for this study.
