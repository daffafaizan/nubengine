      not affect measured internal or external rotation, however patients with neutral version may
      experience better function with daily activities requiring internal rotation compared to
      those with 30 degrees of retroversion. Prospective data on clinical outcomes comparing
      different humeral component versions in RTSA is currently lacking. The proposed study is a
      prospective, single-blinded, randomized trial to investigate the impact of humeral component
      version on shoulder range of motion and patient reported functional outcomes following
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.
