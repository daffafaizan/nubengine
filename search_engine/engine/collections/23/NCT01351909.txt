      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of veliparib (ABT-888) that can be combined
      with metronomic dose cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the macroH2A1.1 and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)
      polymerase 1 (PARP1) expression status in archival paraffin embedded tumor specimens from
      either the primary tumor or metastatic disease is predictive of clinical benefit with
      veliparib (ABT-888) plus cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and cyclophosphamide PO QD on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
