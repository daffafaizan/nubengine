    
      This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-dose, multicenter (the study will be conducted at more than one
      center), parallel-group study (each group of volunteers will be treated at the same time) to
      assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) in volunteers with varying
      degrees of kidney function. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an
      open-label treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. Volunteers will be
      assigned to 1 of 5 groups (depending on kidney function): group 1 will have normal kidney
      function; group 2 will have mild kidney impairment; group 3 will have moderate kidney
      impairment; group 4 will have severe kidney impairment; and group 5 will comprise volunteers
      requiring hemodialysis. Volunteers in groups 1 through 4 will receive a single dose of
      canagliflozin on Day 1. Volunteers in group 5 will receive a single dose of canagliflozin
      following dialysis and then, approximately 10 days later, they will receive a second dose
      before dialysis. Volunteers in groups 1 through 4 will participate in the study for 27 days.
      Volunteers in group 5 will participate in the study for 40 days.
