      I. To evaluate gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 (68Ga-NeoBOMB1) and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2
      (68Ga-PSMA R2) PET/MRI for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in
      patients meeting the criterion of biochemical recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 intravenously (IV) and 45 minutes
      later, undergo PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV then
      undergo PET/MRI 45-60 minutes later.

      ARM II: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV and 45-60 minutes later undergo
      PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 IV then undergo
      PET/MRI 45 minutes later.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 12 months.
