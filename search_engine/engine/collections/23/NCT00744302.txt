      allocated to physiological calcium dialysate (1.25 mmol/L calcium dialysate) group (PCD
      group), and normal calcium dialysate (1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate) group (NCD group). The
      follow-up duration was 36 months.

      Calcium carbonate was mainly used as the phosphate binder. Active vitamin D metabolite,
      calcitriol (Rocaltrol, Hoffmann La Roche, and Basel, Switzerland) was given as to control the
      secondary hyperparathyroidism. The doses of these agents were adjusted according to the serum
      calcium level, serum phosphate level, calcium-phosphorus product and serum iPTH level, which
      were recommended by the K/DOQI Guidelines 6.3b and 8B. Aluminum hydroxide might be introduced
      as a phosphate binder for no more than 4 weeks in addition to calcium carbonate and dietary
      restriction when serum phosphate level could not get a good control (serum P levelâ‰¥1.78
      mmol/L, lasting above 4 weeks). A non- calcium-containing phosphate binder could be
      administered for 1~2 weeks in patients with hypercalcaemia during the observation. At the
      time of the study, non-calcium, non-aluminum based phosphate binders as well as calcium
      acetate were not available in our country.
