      accelerated decline in lung function and diminished response to treatment with inhaled and
      oral corticosteroids, more than 25% of asthmatics continue to smoke. Smoking cessation advice
      is often ineffective.

      Statins are used as cholesterol lowering agents, however, there is now also evidence that
      they have additional anti-inflammatory effects which may be useful in treatment of smokers
      with asthma.

      This is a randomised placebo controlled double-blind parallel group study.

      Following screening to assess suitability for the study, patients will be randomised to
      treatment with either Atorvastatin 40mg or placebo (blank tablet)for 8 weeks.

      After 4 weeks of treatment, all patients will be commenced on a low dose inhaled
      corticosteroid for the remainder of the study to assess whether treatment with statins can
      overcome steroid resistance in smokers with asthma.
