      recurrent organ-confined prostate cancer after radiotherapy. II. Determine the efficacy of
      this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of disease progression as demonstrated
      by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive Leuvectin
      intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under transrectal ultrasound guidance on days 0 and 14.
      Patients are re-evaluated at week 10. Treatment repeats every 10-11 weeks or 1-6 days after
      completion of each week 10 re-evaluation for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients were accrued for this study.
