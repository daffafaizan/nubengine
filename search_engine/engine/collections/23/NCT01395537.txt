        1. Phase I: To assess the toxicity and feasibility of the addition of lapatinib to
           carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent/metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
           esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.

        2. Phase II: To assess the response rate to this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        1. There will be an initial phase I safety cohort studies requiring up to 12 patients,
           followed by a phase II cohort using the lapatinib dose defined in phase I. Carboplatin
           and paclitaxel doses will not be escalated.

           The initial dose of lapatinib of 750 mg daily by mouth will be given to 6 patients.
           There will be no dose escalation of the lapatinib above 1000 mg daily. The lapatinib
           dose for the phase II cohort of this trial will be based only on toxicities experienced
           during the first cycle (3 weeks) of treatment.

        2. Phase II: Once the optimal lapatinib dose has been chosen, all remaining patients will
           initiate treatment at this dose level. Patients with stable or responding disease after
           6 cycles will continue treatment with lapatinib alone until progression of disease or
           intolerable side effects. Feasibility, toxicity and response rate of this combination
           will be assessed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
