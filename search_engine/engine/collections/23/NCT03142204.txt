    
      This is an exploratory Phase 1, prospective study assessing the biodistribution and radiation
      dosimetry of the Positron Emission Tomography [18F]FAraG (VisAcT) in cancer patients selected
      for immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Each patient may have up to two [ 18F]FAraG PET
      imaging sessions, a baseline scan and a post start of immunotherapy scan. For each imaging
      session, patients will receive a single injection of [18F]FAraG and undergo a whole-body PET
      scans an hour after injection of the tracer. Following each imaging session, the patient will
      be called within 72 hours to note any side effects.

      Optional - Blood samples may be collected at up to 9 time points post-injection to analyze
      whole-blood/plasma time activity of [18F]FAraG in addition an urine sample may be collected
      post scan.
