      especially vulnerable to this effect. The anthropometric measures routinely used to monitor
      these metabolic side effects may, in fact, underestimate risk in the pediatric population as
      they are not a good index of hepatic and visceral adipose tissue.

      This study will measure fat accumulation over a 12 week period in adolescents and young
      adults taking an AAP for the first time. MRI imaging will measure hepatic, and visceral
      adipose tissue at baseline and study end. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test will measure glucose
      resistance and insulin sensitivity. In an exploratory fashion, investigators will also image
      the brain to assess for volumetric changes which may occur in association with AAP treatment
      and changes in metabolic indices.
