    
      At Visit 1, patients in 3 diagnostic arms,(consisting of subjects with episodic migraine,
      chronic daily migraine or non-migraineurs/controls), of 11 subjects each, will be consented
      and then have a physical exam, medical history and current medication use documented. Each of
      these enrolled subjects will have a PRIME MD assessment administered, and will complete the
      MIDAS and ASC-12 questionnaires.

      At Visit 2 these same subjects will have an fMRI performed.

      Subjects will be greater than age 18, have the appropriate diagnoses, be able to be consented
      and not be pregnant or have an inability to have the fMRI performed (have implanted metal
      devices, have severe claustrophobia).
