      Pachymetry is systematically used for the monitoring of corneal oedema, for the management
      and assessment of the progression risk of the ocular hypertension, for the diagnosis, the
      management and follow-up of keratoconus, as well as it is important in the pre and
      postoperative management of corneal surgical procedures. CCT is a factor well known to
      influence tonometry. Its assessment is fundamental in glaucoma practice to allow a correct
      intraocular pressure (IOP) evaluation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare CCT measurements using four different instruments:
      Scheimpflug camera tomography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT),
      anterior chamber SD-OCT and ultrasound pachymetry.
