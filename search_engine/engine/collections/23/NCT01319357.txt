      million people in 2000 and an expected 366 million people in 2030 [1].. Currently available
      therapies for type 2 diabetes have various limitations and are associated with increased risk
      of hypoglycemia, weight gain, gastrointestinal side effects or edema and heart failure.

      A new and promising class of drugs are the gliptins. Gliptins act by inhibiting the enzyme
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is responsible for the rapid inactivation of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) - an incretin hormone of the gut [2-4], thereby enhancing and
      prolonging the effects of GLP-1. GLP-1 - member of the incretin hormones - is released into
      the blood after meal ingestion and stimulates the insulin secretion in a glucose dependent
      manner. This accounts for the marked prandial insulin response, which prevents prandial
      hyperglycemia. Several efficacy studies demonstrated a significant improvement of HbA1c with
      gliptins. In addition, gliptins improved fasting as well as prandial glucose levels and did
      not induce weight gain. Due to these positive metabolic effects in combination with a very
      small spectrum of side effects gliptins might very well be part of the standard therapy for
      type 2 diabetes in the future.

      Apart form surrogate parameters like reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose
      levels or improvement of HbA1c, the effect of gliptins on micro- and macrovascular function
      and cardiovascular outcome has not been the primary focus of current studies. However,
      infusion of GLP-1, the incretin hormone affected by gliptins has been reported to ameliorate
      endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from coronary artery disease [5] and it was
      recently shown that infusion of GLP-1 into healthy human subjects increases both normal and
      ACh-induced vasodilatation [6]. In studies on rats with diabetes, GLP-1 infusion nearly
      re-established their normal vascular tone [7] and there are further data from experimental
      animals that indicate a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on endothelial function [8].

      Diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with microangiopathy and macroangiopathy and is a
      strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality [9].
      Endothelial dysfunction which plays a crucial role in the atherosclerotic process is commonly
      observed in patients with diabetes mellitus and already prediabetes and has - amongst other
      factors - been linked to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. Taken into account that
      gliptins reduce hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic peaks by preventing inactivation of GLP-1,
      which exerted beneficial effects on the endothelium in previous studies it is of major
      interest whether therapy with gliptins improves endothelial function of the micro- and
      macrovasculature and thereby might prove to affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      diabetic patients in the long term. The retina offers the unique opportunity to directly
      visualize and investigate the microvasculature in vivo [10-14].
