      pre-hospital setting and has proven its value both there and in difficult airway management.
      The ETC is a double-lumen tube and as such it enables ventilation independent of its position
      in either the trachea or the oesophagus. Since laryngoscopy is not necessary for positioning
      the ETC, it is especially favoured in pre-hospital setting, but is also used in clinical
      setting.

      Objectives: Retrospective evaluation of a database of ETC routine uses during general
      anaesthesia.
