      operative time, intra-operative blood loss, post-operative pain and the possibility of early
      hospital discharge and return to normal daily activities in a short time.

      Despite these points arewidely validated in the literature, sometimes patients undergoing
      laparoscopy complain of abdominal pains (although slight in intensity and temporary) in the
      post-operative period. In some cases, the pain is characteristically irradiated at the
      shoulders, due to a probable irritation/compression of the phrenic nerve that runs on the
      lower surface of the diaphragm.

      Recent evidence has shown that the onset and intensity of post-operative pain are
      significantly related to the amount of residual pneumoperitoneum at the end of the surgical
      procedure. In addition, the use of low pressures of carbon dioxide (CO2) for induction of the
      pnemoperitoneum has been associated with a reduction in post-operative pain, probably due to
      a lower abdominal distension and a consequent reduced compression of the pelvic, abdominal
      and sub-diaphragmatic pain nerve fibers.

      The reduction of the residual pnemoperitoneum at the end of the surgical procedure could
      therefore play a key role in the reduction of post-operative pain, with consequent greater
      comfort for the patient and reduction of the use of analgesics.

      In view of the available evidence, the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the
      application of Jackson-Pratt drain, for one hour from the end of the surgical procedure, can
      significantly reduce post-operative pain and the need of analgesics in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic gynecological surgery.
