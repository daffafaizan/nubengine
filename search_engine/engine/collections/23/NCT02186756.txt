      EMG-biofeedback in patients with Fibromyalgia. The assessors are blinded to the group
      assignment. There are three time points of assessment: before intervention, at the end of
      treatment (T1) and 3-months follow-up (T2). Patients are recruited from the waiting list of
      the Fibromyalgia day hospital program at the University Hospital Munich fulfilling the
      inclusion criteria. The intervention group is treated with 14 sessions of EMG-biofeedback
      during eight weeks in addition to usual care. The control group receives usual care only. The
      main specific aim is to assess the change in fibromyalgia specific health status.
