    
      Objective:

        1. To compare cross-sectionally the fractions of kidney lipid between controls, individuals
           with type 2 diabetes and no diabetic kidney disease and individuals with type 2 diabetes
           and non-severe diabetic kidney disease.

        2. To assess by intervention trial whether ezetimibe reduces albuminuria and kidney
           parenchymal triglyceride fraction in individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-severe
           diabetic kidney disease.

      Design:

        1. Cross-sectional study on 30 controls, 30 individuals with type 2 diabetes and no
           diabetic kidney disease and 60 individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-severe diabetic
           kidney disease.

        2. Single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and parallel intervention
           trial in 60 individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-severe diabetic kidney disease
           Comparative treatment regime: Ezetimibe 10mg per day versus placebo for 16 weeks

           Primary endpoint in cross-sectional study:

             -  Kidney parenchymal triglyceride fraction (estimated by magnetic resonance
                spectroscopy)

           Primary endpoint in intervention trial:

             -  Urinary albumin creatinine ratio

           Secondary endpoint in intervention trial:

           • Kidney parenchymal triglyceride fraction (estimated by magnetic resonance
           spectroscopy)

           Main eligibility criteria for control group (cross-sectional study alone):

           • Age 40-75 years

           • No diabetes mellitus

           • No kidney disease or urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30mg/g

           • No contraindication to examination by magnetic resonance

           Main eligibility criteria for group of individuals with type 2 diabetes and no diabetic
           kidney disease (cross-sectional study alone):

           • Age 40-75 years

             -  Type 2 diabetes

             -  No kidney disease or urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30mg/g

             -  No contraindication to examination by magnetic resonance

           Main eligibility criteria for group of individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-severe
           diabetic kidney disease (intervention trial):

           • Age 40-75 years

             -  Type 2 diabetes

             -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30ml/min/1,73m2

             -  Urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30mg/g

             -  No contraindication to examination by magnetic resonance

           Recruitment

             -  Controls are recruited via announcements on relevant websites and, if necessary, in
                newspapers

             -  Individuals with type 2 diabetes are primarily recruited from the ambulatory at
                Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen
