      (BAV) is usually performed under rapid right ventricular pacing (burst >180 bpm) with the
      induction of a functional cardiac arrest for up to 30 seconds. Aortic valve predilation is
      aiming at facilitating the crossing of the aortic annulus, accurate valve positioning and
      does also provide information on the anatomy of the valve complex. However, BAV has been
      shown to have a number of potentially detrimental effects, such as:

        -  Functional cardiac arrest induced by rapid pacing leads to transient coronary, cerebral,
           and renal ischemia.

        -  In patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prolonged cardiac
           depression after rapid pacing is observed and may result in hemodynamic failure and
           systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both are associated with a high
           periprocedural mortality.

        -  BAV has been identified as a major source of thrombotic and valvular material and
           increases the risk for coronary obstruction with subsequent myocardial infarction and
           stroke.

        -  The local trauma in the left-ventricular outflow tract caused by BAV may potentially
           contribute to aortic root rupture.
