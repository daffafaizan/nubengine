      periapical endodontic surgery versus conventional endodontic surgery. Patients having
      mandibular posterior teeth indicated for endodontic surgery will be selected. Full medical
      and dental history will be obtained from all patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      either guided endodontic surgery or conventional endodontic surgery. Surgical procedures will
      be done under magnification. Root-end cavities will be filled using MTA.Post surgical
      instrucions will be given to patients. Surgical time will be recorded. Clinical and
      radiographic success will be asses at 6 and 12 month.
