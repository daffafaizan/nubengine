    
      This five-year pilot study will aim to demonstrate successful execution of the imaging
      protocol and to make observations regarding the calcification activity as measured by 18F-NaF
      PET/CT and any correlation to 1) valve age and valve type, and 2) subsequent degeneration of
      aortic valve bioprostheses based upon clinical, echocardiographic and CT parameters.
      Techniques that can identify specific increases in calcification activity are therefore
      likely to provide important insights into predicting the longevity of TAVR valves and
      guidance towards subsequent interventions.

      Twenty patients whom have undergone either TAVR or surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve
      replacement will be invited to participate in an 18F-NaF PET scan (baseline) and CT scan
      imaging (baseline and Year 2). Baseline, Year 1 and 2 will also include clinical assessment,
      labs and echocardiograms. Telephone contact at Years 3, 4, and 5 will provide follow up for
      major cardiovascular adverse events.
