      cause of pain, evaluation of treatments and development. Employees from a large local
      manufacturing company are sent for a complete orthopedic and pain evaluation immediately
      after onset of acute low back pain. The patients go through x-ray examinations, physical
      examinations, they complete a battery of questionnaires covering history of acute low back
      pain, lifestyle characteristics, work place factors, psychosocial factors, and indicate pain
      intensity and pain locations. Thereafter the patients are randomly allocated to one of two
      treatment advices: stay active as much as possible in spite of pain or adjust the activity to
      the pain. During seven days after the medical examination the patients wear a pedometer
      attached to the waist and annotate the number of steps and pain intensity, pain location and
      pain-related disability in a diary. A numeric graphic scale is used for pain intensity. Work
      absenteeism and sick leave due to the current acute back pain is collected from the company
      records. Immediate inclusion after pain onset is facilitated with continuous communication
      with the manufactory company. Physical activity and pain development over the seven days is
      investigated statistically using linear mixed models for repeated measures.
