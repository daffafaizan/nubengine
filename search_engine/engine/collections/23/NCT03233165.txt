      lasers in the treatment of oral leukoplakia. Furthermore, the purpose was to compare
      reciprocally and evaluate the subjective and objective postoperative parameters for two
      different tested ablative lasers, Er: YAG and Er, Cr: YSGG.

      All the patients were referred to the Department of Oral Medicine or Oral Surgery where a
      biopsy and measuring the size of lesion that meet the criteria of the histopathological
      diagnosis of leukoplakia was performed. Patients who met the conditions of pathohistological
      diagnosis of leukoplakia and clinical criteria for diagnosis of non-homogeneous leukoplakia,
      were included in the research.

      The patients were randomly allocated into one of the two test groups. In the first group of
      patients leukoplakia lesion were removed using high-power ablative laser Er: YAG and to those
      in the second group using high power ablative Er, Cr: YSGG laser.

      The patients were monitored one year and six months after treatment to evaluate subjective
      and objective parameters focused on life quality after treatment and in case of eventual
      relapse. Criteria of effectiveness for lasers were appearance of relaps in one year and six
      months following.
