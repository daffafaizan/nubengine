        -  Determine the survival of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated
           with gemcitabine and irinotecan.

        -  Determine the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
