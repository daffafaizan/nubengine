      mortality. The most recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa resulted in
      over 11,000 deaths and disabling sequelae among survivors, among which eye complications are
      highly represented. Chronic intraocular inflammation and viral persistence may result in
      posterior synechiae and cataract formation, resulting in loss of visual acuity and requiring
      surgical intervention to resolve. Approximately one out of ten Ebola survivors present with
      cataract, most of whom will require intraocular surgery during their lifetime, and many of
      whom require intervention in the near future to regain quality of life. For survivors who are
      blind from cataract, cataract extraction is necessary to restore visual function, allow
      reintegration into society and facilitate performance of activities of daily living.

      However, surgical parameters among Ebola survivors are unknown, including whether Ebola viral
      RNA persists in aqueous humor, whether additional anti-inflammatory medication is needed, and
      the expected degree of improvement in visual function. Moreover, sites of viral persistence
      are unknown, and it is unclear if lens tissues removed during cataract surgery may harbor
      virus in Ebola-affected eyes. We propose following EVD survivors and control subjects
      undergoing cataract surgery to determine visual outcomes among Ebola survivors and explore
      detection of the presence of virus in lens tissues. The data will inform both future surgical
      intervention and aid in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Ebola-associated eye
      disease.

      Study Population: Up to 60 Ebola survivors and up to 60 controls will be enrolled. The
      accrual ceiling is 120 participants.

      Design: This is a prospective, natural history study to evaluate the persistence of Ebola
      viral RNA in the eyes of Ebola survivors and assess the response to cataract surgery in
      survivors as compared to controls. EVD survivors will first undergo assessment of aqueous
      humor for the presence of viral RNA. Survivors testing negative for viral RNA and control
      subjects will undergo clinically indicated cataract surgery. Subjects will be evaluated 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery for safety and visual outcome
      assessments, and more often as clinically indicated.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are: 1) the proportion of EVD survivors with evidence
      of persistence of Ebola viral RNA in ocular tissue and 2) the comparison of amount of
      intraocular inflammation, as measured by average grade of anterior chamber cell by SUN
      criteria, between EVD survivors and controls at 1 month and 3 months following cataract
      surgery. Secondary outcomes include: 1) the proportion of survivors with at least 20/40 best
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after cataract surgery, relative to controls; 2) impact the of
      covariates, age and gender on viral persistence and cataract outcomes; 3) post-operative
      optical coherence tomography results in EVD survivors.
