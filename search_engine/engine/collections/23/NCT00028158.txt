      genetically engineered herpes simplex type-1 virus. Up to 21 patients will be enrolled in the
      phase Ib portion and will receive doses of G207 that are higher than tested in the previous
      trials. The highest G207 dose tested in a previous phase I trial (NG1-001) was 3E9 plaque
      forming units (pfu). G207 was generally well tolerated and safe in NG1-001, and there was no
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients' deaths were due to progressive cancer disease except for
      one (due to radiation necrosis), and two patients remain alive today.

      Patients in the phase Ib portion of NG1-003 will receive G207 in divided doses. Initially,
      15% of the assigned dose will be injected into the tumor. Two days later, the tumor will be
      removed, and the assigned dose of G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of
      resection. The assigned doses are as follows: 1E9, 3E9, and 1E10 pfu. Patient status will be
      followed by MRI, Karnofsky performance, neurologic examination and the presence of G207 virus
      in the body, in addition to other medical tests done at specific study visits.

      The phase II portion of protocol NG1-003 is a two-stage study. The phase II portion will
      begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion. The goals are to
      determine the safety of G207 and survival at six months. Enrollment of up to 14 patients is
      planned for stage one. Additional patients will be enrolled (up to 30 additional patients and
      44 overall) in stage II if at least 6 of the 14 patients in stage 1 survive 6 months or
      longer. Participants in phase II will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose
      determined to be safe from phase Ib. G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of
      resection. Again, patient status will be followed as previously described and survival will
      be evaluated.
