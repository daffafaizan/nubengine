    
      The objective of the TRUE-AHF study is to evaluate the effect of a 48-h continuous IV
      infusion of ularitide (15 ng/kg/min) versus placebo on the clinical status of patients with
      acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

      The study drug will be administered in addition to the standard treatment. The nature of
      standard therapy will be carried out according to the clinical judgment of the Investigator
      and may include vasodilator, inotropic, and diuretic drugs, as clinically indicated.

      There are two co-primary endpoints for this study. Co-primary endpoint 1 will be a
      hierarchical clinical composite variable that includes a patient-centered assessment of
      clinical progress, an assessment of lack of improvement or worsening of HF requiring a
      pre-specified intervention, and death.

      The endpoint is intended to mimic the assessment that would be carried out by a physician
      caring for the patient. If, during the 48 h infusion, a patient's clinical course
      deteriorates because he/she dies, fails to improve or develops worsening HF requiring a
      pre-specified intervention or if the patient considers his/her general clinical status as
      moderately or markedly worse, the patient will be considered to be "worse". If the patient
      considers his/her general clinical status as moderately or markedly improved and if such
      improvement is sustained without fulfilling the criteria for "worse" throughout the 48-h
      infusion (from 0 h to 48 h), the patient will be considered to be "improved". If the patient
      is neither improved nor worse, the patient's clinical status will be considered to be
      "unchanged".

      Co-primary efficacy endpoint 2 evaluates freedom from cardiovascular mortality during follow
      up after randomization, for the entire duration of the trial.
