        -  Define the activity of Gliadel® wafers in combination with a 5-day infusion of
           O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Define the toxicity of Gliadel® wafers in combination with 5-day infusion of
           O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor followed by placement of Gliadel® wafers .
      Within 6 hours after completion of surgery, patients receive a 1 hour high dose infusion of
      O6-benzylguanine followed by a lower dose continuous infusion for 5 days. Every 48 hours a
      repeat infusion of the high dose over 1 hour will be administered for a total of 3 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients should be accrued for this study.
