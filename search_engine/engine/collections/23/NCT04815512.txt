      filling-station workers, service station attendants, drivers of gasoline trucks and refinery
      workers.Benzene is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 to benzene oxide.
      The metabolites undergo further metabolism through oxidation, dehydrogenation or conjugation
      with sulfate or glucuronic acid . Activation of benzene and its reactive metabolites leads to
      continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to lipid peroxidation and
      damages DNA, RNA, leading to genetic modification and alterations in the functions of
      important enzymes (i.e. liver) and proteins .

      Volatile organic compounds such as gasoline and other fuels are associated with a wide
      variety of deleterious health effects including liver and kidney diseases. A comparative
      cross sectional study was conducted from January 2018 to April 2018 at Mekelle city, Tigray
      region, Northern Ethiopia among gasoline station workers and reporting that the mean level of
      ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine, and uric acid was significantly higher among gasoline stations
      workers when compared to control study participants and there was also a significant increase
      in ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine and uric acid among gasoline stations with increase duration of
      exposure .
