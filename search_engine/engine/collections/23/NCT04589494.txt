      cancer and non-cancer-related pain]. Opioids are known to suppress immune function following
      both acute and chronic administration; however, they appear to be different according to the
      schedule of administration as well as the state of the organism. Programmed death-1 (PD-1,
      also known as CD279) belongs to the CD28 receptor superfamily. It is an inhibitory receptor,
      and its expression is upregulated on activated leukocytes, resulting in an inhibited immune
      response. PD-1 interacts with two ligands: programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also referred to
      as B7-H1) and programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2, also known as B7-DC). PD-L2 is expressed
      mainly on activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, whereas PD-L1 is distributed
      widely. In addition to immune cells, some subsets of tumor cells also express PD-L1 to escape
      from immunosurveillance. It has been reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be activated
      by surgical stress.
