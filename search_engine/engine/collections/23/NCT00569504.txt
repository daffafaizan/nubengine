      For each subject

        -  abdominal circumference

        -  body mass index

        -  lipid profile : TG, HDL-chlo, total chol

        -  systolic/diastolic blood pressure

        -  fasting blood glucose will be measured.

      we will calculate the rates of patients who meet the criteria for the Metabolic syndrome.

        1. Abdominal obesity : absolute criteria
