      (n=52) or non-exercising control group (n=48) for 20 weeks. Participant in the SWM group
      trained 3-4 days/week, progressing in duration from 25 to 45 min. Participants' carotid to
      radial PWV (crPWV), systolic and diastolic BP, AIx, strength and VO2max were measured at
      baseline and after 20 weeks of their assigned intervention.
