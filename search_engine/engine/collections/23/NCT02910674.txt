      the subject's fingertip using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System paired with a
      reference device from one of three Android smart mobile device families as compared to the
      results from the Yellow Springs Instrument 2300 STAT Plus. The usability of the Dario Blood
      Glucose Monitoring System when paired with a reference device from one of three Android smart
      mobile device families and used by laypersons is also evaluated.
