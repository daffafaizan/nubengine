      consequences.

      ED patients who were not being treated for critical conditions were asked about their use of
      alcohol and marijuana. Patients who self-reported the use of both substances were asked to
      participate in the study.

      Recruited participants were given a baseline assessment and then randomized a treatment or a
      control condition. The treatment condition consisted of two 40 minute sessions of brief
      counseling. The first session took place in the ED the second session occurred within two
      weeks of being seen in the ED.

      Participants completed assessments three and twelve months after being recruited in the ED.
      The primary dependent variables for this study are 12 month injuries and self-reported levels
      of negative life consequences associated with alcohol and marijuana use.
