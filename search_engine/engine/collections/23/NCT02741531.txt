      criteria will be contacted by the research assistant at a pre-operative visit. The risks and
      benefits of participation will be explained to them. If they choose to participate they will
      sign the consent form at that time.

      At the time of the surgery, the research coordinator will open a sealed envelope containing
      the patient's assignment to partial bladder filling or no bladder filling. The research
      coordinator will then notify the surgeon via secure phone call or secure messaging service
      and the patient/subject will have their bladder partially filled or completely emptied as
      relayed to the surgeon at the end of the procedure in the Operating Room, unless there are
      issues of patient safety or operative complications. In the patients who are chosen for
      partial bladder filling, the bladder will be back-filled with 150 cc of normal saline and
      then the Foley catheter will be removed at the end of the procedure. In patients who have no
      bladder filling, the bladder will be completely emptied and then the Foley catheter will be
      removed. One of the providers who perform the gynecological surgical procedures will be
      responsible for back-filling or completely emptying the bladder with the Foley catheter.

      The patients will be followed in the PACU to determine the time it takes for them to void.
      The will also be followed for any complications until they are four weeks post surgery. The
      electronic medical record will be examined to see if they have any complications reported at
      their post-operative visits or any readmissions to the hospital.
