    
      Intervention and procedures:

      a) The patients will first be assigned to standardized moderate-to-vigorous exercise for SG
      determination; b) similar exercise will then be repeated with preemptive adaptation of
      insulin dose (tailored on SG evolution during first exercise) for determination of potential
      influences on SG evolution.

      Intervention Plan:

        -  At first visit (day [>18h] before exercise): setting of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring
           System

        -  At second visit: moderate-to-vigorous exercise with treadmill.

        -  At third visit (2 days after exercise): removal of CGMS

        -  At fourth visit (day [>18h] before fifth visit): setting of a Continuous Glucose
           Monitoring System

        -  At fifth visit: moderate exercise with treadmill, and insulin dose modification (basal
           rate, bolus, reduction, increase)

        -  At sixth visit (2 days after exercise): removal of CGMS

        -  Total number of visits: 6

        -  The exercises will be performed between 1 and 2 hours after breakfast or after lunch;
           the second exercise will be performed ≥2 weeks after the first exercise.

      Controls:

        -  Moderate exercise with and without modification of insulin dose in MDI patients (by
           comparison with CSII patients). MDI patients will be matched to CSII patients according
           to gender, age, BMI (±0.5 z-score) and HbA1C levels (±1%) to exclude any bias in patient
           allocation.

        -  Moderate exercise without modification of insulin dose at first visit (by comparison
           with modification of insulin dose).
