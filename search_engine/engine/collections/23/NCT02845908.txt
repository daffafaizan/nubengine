      (FOLFOX) is active in patients with AGC. Meanwhile, Paclitaxel monotherapy is also active in
      patients with AGC. In previous studies, we found that POF(A combination of oxaliplatin,
      fluorouracil and Paclitaxel) regimen appears to be of good efficacy and is well tolerated in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer. This study is being done to find out if three drugs
      combination maintain manageable side effects but have better benefit than two drugs
      combination. Intraperitoneal paclitaxel showed high local concentration in abdominal cavity
      and low systemic toxicity. This study is being done to find out if the combination with
      Intraperitoneal paclitaxel and FOLFOX have higher local control rate and lower systemic
      toxicity.
