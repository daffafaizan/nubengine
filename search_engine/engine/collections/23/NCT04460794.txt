      qualitative evaluation will be conducted. A total of 40 stroke participants will be recruited
      from two acute public hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the
      interention and usual care, or usual care only. Data will be collected in multiple forms:
      recruitment/retention rates, adherence to the intervention, journals, field notes, verbal
      feedback, audio records, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires on outcomes (balance,
      confidence in balance, gait, walking endurance). This study is the first of its kind in Hong
      Kong. Findings will address the cross-cultural applicability of dance interventions and lay
      the groundwork for examination in a larger-RCT about its effects on survivors' balance, gait
      and memory.
