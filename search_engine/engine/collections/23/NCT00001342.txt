      individuals with glycogen storage disease are followed and studied, it becomes apparent that
      when individuals with glycogenosis are viewed from a longitudinal perspective, the condition
      is much more complex and diverse in its related conditions than one would have reason to
      believe, even in hindsight. It is relevant to follow these individuals, searching for
      abnormalities not only with glycogen storage disease in mind, but also because other
      heritable metabolic disorders, including cystinosis and cystic fibrosis, reflect the
      accumulation of associated disorders with age which often have no apparent direct association
      with GSD.
