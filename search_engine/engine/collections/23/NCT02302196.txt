      about 100 women who have had a lumpectomy and consent to be in the research arm and have AFG
      and 100 from the control arm (retrospective chart review).

      Autologous Fat Grafting Arm: Breast-Q survey of patient satisfaction will be collected before
      and after AFG. Assessments will be done 3 months post grafting for efficacy (excellent 100%
      correction of defect), good (75% correction of defect), fair (50% correction of defect), poor
      25% or less correction of defect) result will be recorded. AFG may be repeated x 2 at a 3-6
      month interval if deemed necessary by the treating surgeon, then reassessed again 3 months
      later in the same way. A mammographic assessment of the breast, scored by radiologist in a 6
      step scoring system (BIRADS score) will be done 1 year after AFG. BIRADS scores and new
      physical finding will continue to be collected for a 5 year period post AFG post lumpectomy
      group.

      Control (non-Autologous Fat Grafting) arm: Retrospective chart review for women who have
      undergone standard treatment to treatment to reconstruct their breasts. Data collected will
      include; BIRADS scores as well as frequency of subsequent surgical intervention (as
      necessitated by increased BIRADS scores or by new physical findings on exam) over a 5 year
      period post lumpectomy.
