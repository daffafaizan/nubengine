      study in 36 patients with primary aldosteronism to determine the dose-dependent efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of DP13 after a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period followed by
      a randomized 8-week double-blind treatment period. After an additional single-blind, 2-week
      DP13 placebo withdrawal period, patients are switched to standard of care.
