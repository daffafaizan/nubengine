      parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under
      spinal anesthesia. Participants will receive either 500 mL colloid preload and 500 mL
      crystalloid coload (Combination group) or 1000 mL crystalloid coload (Coload group). Systolic
      blood pressure will be recorded every minute and ephedrine will be administered when
      hypotension occurs according to a predefined protocol. The total ephedrine dose, time to the
      first ephedrine dose, heart rate, inferior vena cava diameter, nausea/vomiting, and neonatal
      Apgar scores will be recorded.
