      expression and reduce the population of potentially infectable cells. Furthermore, no studies
      have been performed to systematically evaluate immune function in prednisone-treated,
      HIV-infected patients or the immune mechanisms that may facilitate increases in CD4+ cell
      number. This study explores this issue.

      Patients are separated into 2 arms according to whether or not they are currently receiving a
      protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their antiretroviral (ARV) therapy regimen (PI vs no PI
      therapy). Arm I: Current stable ARV therapy plus prednisone for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks
      at half the prior dose, then a 2-week taper. Arm II: Current stable ARV therapy plus
      prednisone placebo for 12 weeks.
