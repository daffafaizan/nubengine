      chronic course of COVID-19, with isolated or concomitant aggressions of various organs and
      systems, making this disease a potential chronic condition, impacting aspects of quality of
      life related to health (HRQoL), physical and mental health. In addition, pediatric COVID-19
      can induce autoimmunity (with the possibility of primary hypothyroidism and type I diabetes
      mellitus), delayed linear growth and delayed pubertal development, secondary immunodeficiency
      and present genetic polymorphisms in brain plasticity impacting rehabilitation. School-aged
      children and adolescents with COVID-19 could present muscle weakness, dysautonomy, asthenia
      and physical inactivity, so it is essential that safe and effective interventions are
      developed to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and that they can be implemented
      on a large scale. However, to date, there are no systematic longitudinal studies that have
      evaluated all these aspects in a pediatric population that survived COVID-19, particularly
      with chronic conditions and who were hospitalized in a tertiary service.
