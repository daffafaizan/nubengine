      hours/day (except for bathing/swimming time) on their wrist for 12 weeks. Participants will
      participate in four team-based walking races, each two weeks long. Participants will view
      their team progress on TV monitors placed in various locations at the Oaknoll facility. The
      Oaknoll leadership has given the research team approval to do this at their facility. The
      monitors will present aggregated team data and will not report any individual data that could
      link back to the individual participant.

      At the end of the 8 week active intervention, research team members will meet with
      participants at Oaknoll to administer an exit/process evaluation survey. The exit survey will
      ask about psychosocial predictors of physical activity as well as participants thoughts and
      opinions of the MapTrek game. This survey should take approximate 10-15 minutes to complete.
      The participants will then be asked to wear the Fitbit for four more weeks without playing
      MapTrek, which will act as a control condition since this is a single-arm study.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving physical activity levels of older
           adults living in a residential facility.

        2. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving psychosocial outcomes(e.g.,
           self-efficacy, social support, outcome expectations) among older adults living in a
           residential facility.

        3. To determine the acceptability of MapTrek among older adults living in a residential
           facility.
