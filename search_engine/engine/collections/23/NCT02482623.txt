    
      The Dementia Symptom Management at Home (DSM-H) Program is an integrated bundled
      implementation science intervention to improve interprofessional care in home healthcare
      (HHC). It consists of training, assessment instruments, patient-caregiver centered care plans
      and workflow changes. The investigators will perform a cluster randomized controlled clinical
      trial at a single, urban, non-profit HHC agency, randomizing care teams to either be trained
      in performing the intervention or serve as controls. The aims of this program are to examine
      the efficacy of this program to:

      Aim 1: Measure the effects of DSM-H on pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver rated
      QOL in the person with dementia receiving HHC.

      Aim 2: Assess the effects of DSM-H on QOL, burden and depression for the informal caregiver
      of persons with dementia receiving HHC.

      Aim 3: Assess the effects of DSM-H on the number of emergency room visits and hospital
      admissions.
