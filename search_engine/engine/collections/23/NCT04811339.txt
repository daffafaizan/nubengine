      oral hydration can be health saving measures of great convenience for those affected by
      enteric bacterial and viral infections. BSS is a non-proprietary monograph product that is
      available in the USA and abroad, over-the-counter (OTC). Of all OTC medications for
      traveller's diarrhea (TD), bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) has the greatest antimicrobial
      activity against pathogenic bacteria .BSS has also exhibited significant inhibition on viral
      invasion of host cells and viral efficacy. Both BSS and bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl, which is
      formed in the stomach after ingestion of BSS) at low concentration (0.004-0.13mg/mL)
      significantly reduced NoV RNA levels, suggesting an in vivo antiviral mechanism. BSS has also
      been shown to have antiviral activity since it inhibited replication of 4 strains of
      rotavirus in tissue culture cells and caused a dose-dependent reduction in the growth of
      several enteric viruses.

      Historically, BSS has been indicated and effectively used for the treatment of TD or enteric
      infection, mainly when vomiting occurs. Although the safety and efficacy of BSS is well
      known, some of the research done with BSS resides within the industry and have not been
      published. We have recently completed an extensive meta-analysis using unpublished clinical
      studies regarding BSS safety and efficacy. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled clinical
      trials were performed with studies specifically designed to capture prevention of
      manifestation and relief of diarrhea.
