      favourable physical properties and easy detectability by anaesthetic gas analysors predispose
      nitrous oxide to become a possible "tracing gas" for leak detection in experiments in which
      modified breathing system are in use. In these breathing experiments, the inspired
      concentrations of nitrous oxide would be well below the anaesthetic/analgesic concentrations.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of these low concentrations of nitrous
      oxide (5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 %), compared to placebo (air, 0% nitrous oxide). The cognitive
      functions are tested using Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Reaction Time and Visual Analogue
      Scale.
