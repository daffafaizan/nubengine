      resolve T2D symptoms or dramatically reduce oral and/or insulin requirements, (ii) metabolic
      endotoxemia may incite the pathologic conditions of low-grade inflammation and subsequently
      insulin resistance, obesity and T2D, (iii) significant intestinal microbiologic flora
      differences exist between normal weight and obese/diabetic individuals, and (iv) RYGB alters
      long-term intestinal microbiologic flora. Therefore, it is logical to evaluate short- and
      long-term circulating endotoxin concentrations and intestinal microbiologic flora in context
      with weight loss and restoration of euglycemia to expand our knowledge of the mechanism of
      the benefits observed following RYGB.
