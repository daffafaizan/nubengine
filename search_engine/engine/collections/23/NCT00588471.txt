      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor will reduce the post inflammatory response after percutaneous
      coronary interventions (PCI), and/or change endothelial function as assessed by peripheral
      arterial tomography (PAT). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as
      coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the
      stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease.

      Patients will be pretreated with simvastatin 80 mg prior to undergoing PCI. Endothelial
      function will be assessed before and after treatment via PAT. Our working hypothesis is
      patients pretreated with simvastatin, will have 1) attenuated inflammatory response, as noted
      by decreased levels of serum high sensitivity CRP and IL-6 and 2) improved endothelial
      function as compared to patients not pretreated with statin therapy.
