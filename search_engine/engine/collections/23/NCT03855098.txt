    
      For biomarker discovery a cross-over study where participants will visit the Human
      Intervention Centre (in UCD) on 3 occasions (3 study days) with a minimum one week between
      each visit. The order of consumption of the test foods will be randomized. The test foods are
      mixed vegetables (spinach and lettuce), green beans and mixed berried (strawberries and
      blueberries). For each study day, the participants will arrive fasting and provide a urine
      sample (0h sample). For 24h prior to the study day participants will avoid the test foods.
      Participants will consume the food and urine samples will be taken at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post
      consumption . Standard portions of the test food will be eaten on each occasion. Between the
      visits, participants will consume their habitual diet.

      The samples will be analysed using the metabolomics platforms LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy.
      Both NMR and LC-MS data generated will undergo statistical analysis such as principal
      component analysis (PCA) and supervised analysis such as partial least squares-discriminant
      analysis (PLS-DA). Validation of such models will be performed using permutation testing.
