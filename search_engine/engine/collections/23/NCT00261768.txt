      incorporating three noise reduction strategies (i.e., directional microphones alone vs.
      directional microphones with DSP noise reduction algorithm 1 vs. directional microphones with
      DSP noise reduction algorithm 2) in terms of both speech understanding outcomes and
      functional outcomes. The second goal is to identify individual characteristics that are
      predictive of successful functional outcomes with hearing aids.

      This study employs a multi-site, randomized, blinded, 2x2 factorial parallel group design.
      Three hundred subjects will be studied at three VA Medical Centers (Mountain Home, TN; Bay
      Pines, FL; and Los Angeles, CA) over a period of three years.

      Objective (word recognition ability and performance with degraded speech stimuli) subjective
      (self-assessment questionnaires, personality and depression assessments) and
      cost-effectiveness assessments will be measured for 4 randomized treatment groups receiving
      different digital hearing aid technology. Subjects will be randomly assigned to wear hearing
      aids with directional microphones alone or directional microphones with noise reduction
      algorithm 1 or directional microphones with noise reduction algorithm 2 for a period of 8
      weeks. Subjects will complete post-testing after 8 weeks of hearing aid use.
