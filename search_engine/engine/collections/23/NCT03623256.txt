      prospectively study pregnant patients who undergo neuraxial labor analgesia. All patients
      will receive combined-spinal-epidural analgesia. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of
      four groups by means of sealed envelope technique. Group A will receive a spinal dose of
      preservative-free fentanyl 25 mcg. Group B will receive one dose of spinal preservative-free
      0.25% bupivacaine. Group C will receive a spinal combination of preservative-free 0.25%
      bupivacaine and fentanyl 25 mcg. Group D will receive spinal preservative-free 0.25%
      bupivacaine and epidural fentanyl 100 mcg. After the procedure, we will monitor the fetal
      heart rate and tocometry tracings for 20 min. Thereafter, an epidural infusion with a
      solution containing 0.125% bupivacaine and 2mcg/mL of fentanyl will be started. We will
      record demographic variables (age, and BMI), obstetric variables (parity, gestational age,
      cervical dilation, oxytocin infusion) and anesthetic variables (level of insertion of
      epidural catheter).

      Primary outcomes:

      Fetal heart rate (baseline, minimal and abnormal patterns)

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean) measured at baseline and every 5 minutes
           after administration of medication.

        -  Dermatomal level measured after 20 minutes of medication administration.

        -  Pain level (visual analogue scale) after 20 minutes of medication administration.

        -  Patient satisfaction level (1-10 scale) after 20 minutes of medication administration.

        -  Uterine tone measured with tocometer at baseline and during 20 minutes after medication
           administration.
