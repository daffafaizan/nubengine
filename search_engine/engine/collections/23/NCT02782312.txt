      disease (COPD) patients. However, there is presently no clear evidence on the effect of ICS
      and LABA combined inhaled therapy for non-CF bronchiectasis patients.

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized,control trial. Patients are divided into
      two groups, one group inhaled with ICS and LABA (Seretide), another group received routine
      therapy (oxygen uptake, phlegm dissipation, hemostasis postural drainage and naturopathy).The
      course of treatment is 12 months. All patients underwent reviews at baseline entry to the
      study and at months 6 and 12 of treatment.

      The quality of life (QOL) scores：St George's dyspnea score (SGRQ score）, modified british
      medical reserach council（mMRC score) and COPD assessment test (CAT score); lung function
      test: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1）,FEV1% predicted, the ratio of forced
      expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC%); short-acting
      β2-adrenergic agonist（SABA）use and the incidence of adverse event were monitored throughout
      the study.
