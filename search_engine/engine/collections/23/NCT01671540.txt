    
      A Multicenter study conducted in university Hospital Antwerp (UZA) and ZNA Middelheim.

      Tests are taken before and after one week IPV treatment. IPV is applied for 1 week during the
      physical therapy treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary desease (COPD) patients admitted
      to the hospital for an excarebation. The IPV treatment is an additional treatment upon the
      standard treatment of the patients. The standard treatment consists out of existing drainage
      techniques to remove secretion out of the lungs by means of breathing control exercises.
      Patients are randomized into either the experimental group or the control group. The control
      group receives a standard physical therapy treatment without additional IPV treatment.
