      after bariatric surgery, characterized by severe hypoglycemic episodes accompanied by
      symptoms of hypoglycemia. At the moment, no medical therapies have been developed for this
      disorder, but the clinical need is great. The major contributory factor is thought to be an
      exaggerated secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) due to altered nutrient transit
      after bariatric surgery. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone secreted primarily by the distal ileum
      that contributes to postprandial glucose regulation. Exendin (9-39) is a specific GLP-1
      receptor antagonist, that when given via continuous IV infusion, has been shown to
      effectively prevent postprandial hypoglycemia and reduce symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients
      with PBH. This study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile
      of a novel subcutaneous formulation of exendin (9-39).
