      cirrhosis, mainly due to microbial translocation. According to several studies,
      administration of probiotics in patients with cirrhosis has positive effect on minimal
      hepatic encephalopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of probiotics
      administration on outcomes of patients qualified for liver transplantation, both in the
      pre-transplant period and in the early postoperative period. This study will be performed on
      200 patients randomized into the probiotic and placebo groups. Daily administration of either
      probiotics or placebo will be continued from the date of inclusion in the study until the
      date of liver transplantation. A quantitative and qualitative analyses of faecal microflora
      will be performed in each patient before and after 10 week period (or shorter, depending on
      the time on the waiting list) of administration of either probiotic or placebo.
      Microbiological analyses of air samples from patients' home environment will be performed in
      each case. Both groups of patients will be compared with respect to primary and secondary
      outcome measures.
