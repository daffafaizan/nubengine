      appendage (LAA) and right atrial appendage (RAA) thrombi before cardioversion or
      instrumentation of the left atrium during ablation proce- dures.1-5 Occasionally, TEE cannot
      be performed because of anatomic limitations requiring an alternative imaging strategy to
      exclude LAA thrombi. Phased-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is routinely used
      during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures to guide transseptal puncture and detect
      complications. The standard position of the transducer is in the right atrium (RA). This
      allows adequate visualization of the interatrial septum and body of the left atrium (LA) but
      not of the LAA because of significant physical distance from the transducer. Imaging of the
      LAA from closer anatomic structures such as the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and
      pulmonary artery (PA) can improve visualization of the LAA. If ICE provided imaging of the
      LAA comparable to TEE with a good safety profile, it could potentially serve as an
      alternative to TEE in patients undergoing catheter ablation. Such an approach could reduce
      risk, cost, and patient discomfort associated with TEE combined with ICE. In this prospective
      blinded study, we sought to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of TEE with ICE
      for detection of LAA and RAA anatomy and thrombus in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias
      undergoing catheter ablation.
