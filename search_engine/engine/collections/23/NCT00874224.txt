      enhanced recovery programmes. Laparoscopic surgery and enhanced recovery programmes both
      focus on faster recovery and consequently shorter hospital length of stay.

      The ORANGE-II trial is a prospective randomised controlled parallel group superiority trial
      with a double-blinded experimental and a prospective registry design to determine whether
      laparoscopic surgery is to be preferred over open surgery in patients undergoing a left
      lateral hepatic sectionectomy within an enhanced recovery programme. The experimental design
      produces two randomised arms; (a) open LLS and (b) laparoscopic LLS. An additional registry
      arm will be based on surgeons/patients that do not want to be randomised because they have an
      explicit preference for either the laparoscopic LLS or for the open LLS (c).

      The primary endpoint of the ORANGE II trial is time to functional recovery. The functional
      recovery criteria consist of adequate pain control with oral analgetics only, mobility
      restored to an independent level, absence of intravenous fluid administration, ability to eat
      solid foods and finally a normal or decreasing serum bilirubin level. A patient is fully
      functionally recovered when all of the five criteria are satisfied.

      Secondary endpoints of this trial are postoperative length of hospital stay, readmission
      percentage, (liver specific) morbidity, quality of life, body image and cosmetic result,
      hospital and societal costs during one year and long-term incidence of incisional hernias.

      The ORANGE-II trial is a randomised controlled multicentre trial that will provide evidence
      on the merits of laparoscopic surgery in patients undergoing a left lateral hepatic
      sectionectomy and participating in an enhanced recovery programme.
