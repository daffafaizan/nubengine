      clinical study of neurological disorders (n=100) and HTLV known-positive (KP) specimens
      (n=50). This study is being conducted to support additional labeling claims and to further
      assess the sensitivity and specificity of the HTLV Blot 2.4 in specimens with neurological
      disorders and HTLV known positive specimens.
