      COVID-19, it could stop the devastation wrought by the pandemic, and do so at a low cost. One
      OTC medication has a pre-clinical and clinical rationale to help: famotidine. For this study,
      150 subjects are randomly assigned 50:50 to blinded treatment with 1 (20-milligram) tablet
      famotidine or matching placebo twice a day and can increase to 1 tablet three times a day.
      This internet-driven study requires subjects to maintain contact with and follow advice of
      their local MD, so it does not increase their risks from the disease. Baseline eligibility
      checklist follows informed consent. Subjects must have at least 5 of the standard symptoms of
      COVID19, be willing to keep taking study medicine and reporting results daily for 30 days,
      must start within the first 6 days of symptoms, and must have a study partner to complete
      their follow-up in case they become unable. The rate of subjects worsening or getting
      hospitalized is the main outcome measure.
