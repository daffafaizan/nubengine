      elastic resistance offered by the ligamentum flavum before entering the epidural space when
      using the loss of resistance (LOR) technique may be blunted or even absent. The investigators
      inferred that the size and elasticity of the ligamentum flavum, in combination with mildline
      appraoch, the gaps could be responsible for a failure to recognize a LOR in some patients. If
      so, the investigators hypothesized that the paramedian approach would be advantageous for
      finding cervical epidural space more easily during cervical epidural steroid injections
      (CESIs). Therefore, the investigators randomly divide our patients into 2 groups; the midline
      approach group and the paramedian group. Then, the investigators examine the patterns of the
      pressure changes at the moment of a puncture of the ligamentum flavum during CESIs.
