      investigated in the USA. These microaggressions may relate to both adoptive status and
      country of origin, or both. However, the prevalence and qualitative characteristics of these
      events have been seldom studied in other countries. Differences in cultural norms and
      practices among countries might influence the type and frequency of microaggressions
      experienced by adopted children and their families. Brief anonymous questionnaires devised to
      elicit personal experiences related to microaggressions will be distributed by 4 clinical
      services serving this population (3 pediatric, 1 child psychiatric) and by 2 large adoptive
      family support networks to adoptive parents in France. Frequencies and relations between
      experience of micro-aggressions and other variables will be analyzed.
