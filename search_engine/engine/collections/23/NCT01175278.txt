    
      This is a prospective single center study designed to compare balloon kyphoplasty to
      non-surgical management (NSM) in the treatment of mildly painful, acute vertebral body
      compression fractures in multiple myeloma patients. Because of the pilot nature and the small
      sample size of the study, patient randomization will NOT be stratified. Patients with mildly
      symptomatic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) will undergo a 1:1 randomization either
      balloon kyphoplasty or non surgical management. Randomization assignments will be generated
      by computer and investigator notified once the patient enrolled.

      The observational arm will be compared to each of the other two arms; control and
      intervention arm using the same outcome variables and statistical methods.
