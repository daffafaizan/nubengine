      from March 1 to September 31, 2015 were recruited into this study. Before the endomicroscopic
      examination, 20,000 U Î±-chymotrypsin and 80 mg dimethylpolysiloxane were given orally to
      remove gastric mucus. All patients were given intravenous injections of 1 ml of 2%
      fluorescein sodium (Baiyunshan Mingxing Pharmaceutical, Guangzhou, China) as an allergy test
      before procedures were carried out. Conscious sedation was achieved for each patient by using
      propofol and fentanyl, and vital signs were monitored during the entire procedure. After
      successful intubation of the endoscope into the gastric antrum, 1 mL fluorescein sodium
      solution was applied intravenously as a contrast dye. The CLE procedure did not differ from
      that of conventional colonoscopy, except for the additional storage of pCLE images and videos
      in the gastric antrum. Finally, targeted biopsy of the examined site was performed.
