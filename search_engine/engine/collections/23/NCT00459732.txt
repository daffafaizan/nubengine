      young patients with thalassemia. Osteoporosis is a significant co-morbidity in patients with
      thalassemia which leads to decreased quality of life. The most effective way to prevent
      osteoporosis is to build strong, dense bones in the early years. A combination of disease,
      endocrine and nutritional factors likely contribute to the etiology of osteoporosis in this
      population. However, even well transfused patients with normal gonadal function who are
      supplemented with calcium have low bone mass. It is hypothesized that patients with
      thalassemia have low bone mass, in part, due to zinc deficiency. Sub-optimal zinc status has
      been identified in patients with thalassemia and zinc supplementation has been shown to
      improve linear growth. To test the primary hypothesis, an 18 month randomized
      placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation (25 mg Zn/day) vs. placebo will be conducted
      in 60 young patients (6-30 yrs) with thalassemia and low bone mass (spine BMD Z-score <-1.0).
      Bone health, as estimated from measurements of bone mass (by DXA and pQCT) and markers of
      bone formation and resorption will be the primary outcome variables. This will be the first
      study to examine the effects of zinc. supplementation on bone health in patients with
      thalassemia. If zinc supplementation is found to have a clinically important effect, this
      simple, safe, non-invasive therapy could quickly become a part of the standard care of these
      young patients and improve overall health in children and adult patients with thalassemia
