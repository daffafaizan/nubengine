      drops and their combination (both Alphagan and Xalatan) on corneal temperature in healthy
      subjects with and without a primary vascular dysregulation (PVD).

      The investigators would like to answer the following questions:

        1. Do the individual drugs influence the circulation to the eye as quantified indirectly
           via corneal temperature?

        2. Does the combination of Alphagan and Xalatan give an additive or even potentiated
           effect?

        3. Is the sequence of application of drugs of relevance (Alphagan applied first, Xalatan
           second, or vice versa)?

        4. Do PVD and non-PVD subjects respond differently to these drugs?

      20 healthy non-PVD subjects and 20 healthy PVD subjects in the age range from 20-40 years
      will be recruited. Recruited subjects will have all measurements: corneal temperature,
      intraocular pressure (IOP), ear temperature, blood-pressure. Both prior to and after
      instillation of eye drops (Xalatan, Alphagan and placebo).
