    
      The aim of this prospective observational trial is to compare the duration of inhalation and
      intravenous anaesthesia induction in paediatric patients, who undergo elective surgical or
      diagnostic procedures. After the approval of the study by the Ethics Committee of the
      University hospital Brno and registration of the protocol at clinicaltrials.gov, the duration
      of inhalation and intravenous anaesthesia induction in the patients undergoing general
      anaesthesia in the Departement of paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care unit, University
      Hospital Brno in the term from 1.9.2020 until 30.6.2021 will be measured. Measurement will be
      done in all patients in the given time period, who will undergo elective surgical or
      diagnostic procedure. The measurement will begin after the patient's arrival at the operating
      theatre, after the control of the documentation and beginning of the vital signs monitoring.
      The measurement will be terminated at the occurence of the first end-tidal carbon dioxide
      (ETCO2) wave, after securing the airway with laryngeal mask or orotracheal intubation

      For the inhalation induction sevoflurane will be used (in the mixture with O2 + air, or O2 +
      N2O), for the intravenous induction, commonly used induction anaesthetics will be used
      (propofol, etomidate, ketamine, midazolam).

      The type and the dose of the induction anaesthetic agent will be recorded (in the case of
      inhalation induction the dose of inhalation anaesthetic set on the vaporizer, in the case of
      intravenous induction the dose in mg/kg body weight).

      The type and dose of the sedative premedication will be recorded, the number of attempts
      needed to secure i.v. line, success rate of securing the i.v. line while using Eutectic
      Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) patch and/or Buzzy (vibration device for patient
      distraction), the number of attempts needed to secure the airway, incidence of adverse events
      which might occur during anaesthesia induction (tachycardia, bradycardia, bronchospasm,
      laryngospasm).
