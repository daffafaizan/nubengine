      monitoring with a detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care
      including a suggestion during the pre-operative clinic appointment to follow up with Primary
      Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood pressure treatment and
      medication adherence. We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in
      hypertension treatment at 60 days post-operative, through a telephone call. This information,
      along with information regarding patient acceptance of the intervention will be used to
      inform the design of a future clinical trial powered to outcomes, including follow-up visits
      and blood pressure management.
