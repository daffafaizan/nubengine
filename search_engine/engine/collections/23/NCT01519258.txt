      electrical activity of the diaphragm and uses it to initiate and terminate the inspiratory
      phase, offering inspiratory assistance in proportion to patient effort, cycle by cycle.
      Studies in animals and humans have shown that NAVA reduces the work of breathing and improves
      patient-ventilator interaction in comparison with traditional modes. Because it is an
      assisted mode, its use requires less sedation.

      The use of NAVA could contribute to the reduction of complications of prolonged mechanical
      ventilation in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) submitted to
      protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and limited plateau pressure. However, there
      are no studies with NAVA in the acute phase of ARDS, in which assisted-controlled modes are
      generally used, allowing for adjustment of tidal volume and/or plateau pressure.

      With this project, the investigators intend to evaluate the behavior of NAVA mode in the
      acute phase of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients, to assess whether this mode can be
      used to deliver an assisted lung protective ventilation strategy.
