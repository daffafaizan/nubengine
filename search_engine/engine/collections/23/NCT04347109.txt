    
      Non-invasive mapping using the Cardio Insight system is prospectively performed routinely in
      heart failure patients requiring cardiac resynchronization therapy.

      Control patients are included, requiring chronic permanent right ventricular pacing.

      Specific focus include: optimization of programming parameters, pacing-induced
      cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, defibrillation threshold testing and electrical
      shocks.
