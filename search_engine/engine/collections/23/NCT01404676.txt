      diabetes has led to development of new agent for hypoglycemic therapy. Vildagliptin is a
      potent and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that augments the active
      glucagon-like peptide(GLP)-1 concentration, increases insulin secretion and improves glucose
      tolerance. Vildagliptin has a similar glucose lowering effect, but lower hypoglycemic events,
      as compared to glimepiride. Vildagliptin could improve not only the mean glycemic control but
      also 24 hour glycemic fluctuation by restoring the physiologic pattern of insulin and
      glucagon secretion. Furthermore, decreased postprandial glycemic excursion might reduce the
      oxidative stress markers and improve endothelial dysfunction. Those effects might be
      amplified in Asian patients because of prominent early phase insulin secretory defects
      accompanied with relatively less degree of insulin resistance. In addition, GLP-1 and GLP-1
      analogues exert direct beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Therefore
      DPP-4 inhibitors may directly improve endothelial dysfunction.

      Based on this assumption, this research will focus on the effect of vildagliptin on glycemic
      variability, oxidative stress markers and endothelial cell function compared to long acting
      sulfonylurea glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycemic control on
      metformin.
