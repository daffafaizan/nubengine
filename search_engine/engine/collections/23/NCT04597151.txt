      I. To describe the feasibility and acceptability of a group diet education intervention for
      colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFGH).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe perceived barriers to healthy diet among CRC survivors at ZSFGH.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for differences in feasibility and acceptability of a group diet education
      program, based on sociodemographic factors such as education, food insecurity, employment,
      and race.

      II. To explore changes in health-related behaviors pre and post intervention using a
      validated lifestyle score.

      Patients attend group diet education sessions over 1.5-2 hours every 2 weeks (weeks 1, 3, and
      5).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 weeks.
