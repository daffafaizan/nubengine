      in a vehicle collision or in a fall do not survive or, if they do, suffer from long-term
      disability. Previous studies have shown that about 1,000 people in Australia and New Zealand
      suffer a moderate or severe TBI every year. With current best available treatment and
      therapies many of these patients sustain loss of brain function and long term disability in
      varying degrees.

      When a patient sustains a traumatic brain injury there are two phases to the injury. First,
      the head-impact causes immediate damage to the brain. The secondary injury, which can evolve
      over hours or weeks, is a very complicated process. It involves many, linked, changes to the
      cells, brain chemistry, tissues or blood vessels that can destroy brain tissue. The treatment
      of brain injury focuses on trying to minimize the secondary injury and there is much research
      being done to try to find treatments that will prevent it.

      Erythropoietin (EPO) has recently emerged as a drug that may help reduce secondary injury and
      improve brain function. It has been found to offer some protection to the brain when brain
      cells are deprived of their normal oxygen supply causing cells to die or be impaired.

      The aim of this study is to determine if EPO reduces secondary brain injury and helps
      patients make a better recovery after traumatic brain injury. The investigators also plan to
      monitor the effect of EPO on the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT - blood clots in the large
      veins in lower extremity) in patients with moderate or severe TBI in the intensive care unit
      (ICU).

      Study Hypothesis:

      In patients with moderate (GCS 9-12) or severe (3-8) TBI, EPO therapy improves long-term
      neurological function assessed 6 months after injury.
