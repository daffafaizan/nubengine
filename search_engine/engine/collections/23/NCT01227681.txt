      of PD still progress during the ensuing years. Currently, there is no promising medical or
      surgical treatment to abrogate the disease deterioration. Granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF), one of hematopoietic growth factors, has been routinely used for hematologic
      disorders and stem cell harvest from normal subject. G-CSF also demonstrated neuroprotection
      for rodents PD model. We hypothesize G-CSF will exert the effectiveness of neuroprotection
      for PD patients.
