      main pancreas duct, a balloon catheter will be placed in the main pancreatic duct via ERCP.
      The balloon catheter will isolate the cyst from the main pancreatic duct, allowing ethanol
      injections of the cyst. A pancreatic duct stent will be placed in some patients, requiring
      repeat endoscopy for removal at another time.
