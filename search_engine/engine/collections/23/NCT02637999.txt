    
      The study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of MXB in a subset of HBV infected
      patients who are co-infected with HDV. Hepatitis delta represents the most severe form of
      chronic viral hepatitis and there is no approved treatment option available for patients
      infected with both HBV and HDV.

      24 patients will be randomised into 3 arms: pre-treatment with MXB followed by PEG-INF-a
      treatment versus a combination of both drugs versus PEG-INF-a.

      Prolonged blockade of HBV entry into hepatocytes should also block infection with HDV
      particles (which uses hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as its envelope) and thus provide a
      therapeutic option for this otherwise hardly treatable disease. PEG-INF-a is used for the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis delta. The study endpoints are virological response (HBsAg,
      hepatitis delta virus ribonucleic acid (HDV RNA), hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid
      (HBV DNA)), as well as safety and tolerability and drug immunogenicity.
