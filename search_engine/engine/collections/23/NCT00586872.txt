    
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease in which the
      normal squamous lining of the esophagus is replaced by specialized columnar epithelium.1
      Approximately 5%-10% of patients diagnosed with BE are thought to be at risk of developing
      esophageal adenocarcinoma.2 Patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) on biopsy are at the
      greatest cancer riskÂ³. EMR is being performed clinically in our Barrett's Esophagus Unit on a
      regular basis during endoscopy for patients with Barrett's Esophagus and/or early esophageal
      adenocarcinoma. There are two predominant endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) techniques exist
      using FDA approved devices - the EMR cap method using a transparent cap/snare combination and
      the endoscopic variceal ligation method using a band ligator/snare combination to resect
      tissue.
