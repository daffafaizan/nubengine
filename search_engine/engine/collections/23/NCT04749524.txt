      otoacoustic emissions, that can be used to efficiently assess peripheral neural function
      (including retrocochlear disorders) using the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR). Measuring
      neural function via the MOCR. This reflex has been shown to be abnormal in patients with
      neural disorders. The focus of this project will be the development of a screening method
      that incorporates OAE screening and measurement of the MOCR in the same test procedure. The
      target population in the proposed research is infants, particularly those in environments
      where auditory brainstem response (ABR) screening is not performed routinely. Addition of the
      MOCR to screening where ABR is not performed will address the shortcoming of OAE screening
      which misses neural forms of hearing loss.
