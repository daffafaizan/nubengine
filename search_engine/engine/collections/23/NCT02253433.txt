      reduction and asthma control intervention to enhanced in-clinic care will result in
      statistically significant improvements in key measures of health and quality of life among
      Houston-area African-American adults with poorly controlled asthma.

      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of a
      customized, holistic, patient-centered, home-based environmental intervention for improving
      asthma control (the "intervention") with enhanced clinic-based care. Both arms receive
      identical in-clinic care, including collected self-report information from detailed health
      and exposure questionnaires, asthma education, assessment for allergies, and a customized
      asthma self-management plan developed using motivational interviewing. The intent of the
      study is to assess-real-life effectiveness of a home-based intervention in African-American
      adults with poorly controlled asthma.
