      the small airways, leading to bronchiolar obstruction. Corticosteroids are frequently
      prescribed as anti-inflammatory drugs. The usefulness of corticosteroids for this disease
      remains controversial, despite many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Recently, a
      meta-analysis and systemic review showed significant improvement in clinical symptoms, length
      of hospital stay and duration of symptoms in children with this disease after treatment with
      various regimens of systemic corticosteroids.

      Dexamethasone is a long acting corticosteroid with biologic half-life ranging from 36-72
      hours. A single dose of dexamethasone has been the standard recommendation for the treatment
      of croup which has a similar pathophysiology without evidence of adverse effects.
      Furthermore, there is no previous report of this single dosage form of dexamethasone for the
      treatment of acute bronchiolitis in young children.
