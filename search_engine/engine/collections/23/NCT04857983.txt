      therapies which improve some symptoms, but do not sufficiently restore cognitive functioning
      or reduce psychosocial disability. We propose and will test a novel "augmentation strategy"
      for using medications to specifically enhance the benefits of targeted cognitive training
      (TCT) in schizophrenia. This project tests a rational and empirically supported platform for
      augmenting the benefits of TCT in antipsychotic medicated SZ patients by adjunctive daily
      treatment of 20 mg memantine, an FDA approved medication for the treatment of cognitive
      dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease. We hypothesize that medications that specifically target
      sensory information processing deficits, rather than psychotic symptoms per se, will
      significantly enhance the benefits of a sensory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT)
      intervention in patients with schizophrenia. We will complete a randomized, double-blind
      clinical trial to: 1) confirm that the drug memantine augments TCT learning; 2) determine
      whether memantine enhances the clinical benefits from a full 30 session course of TCT vs. TCT
      plus placebo in antipsychotic- medicated schizophrenia patients, and 3) determine if
      memantine's enhancement of TCT is most effective in biomarker-defined subgroups of patients.
