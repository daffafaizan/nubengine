      high quality, mental health services for diverse populations through improving the flow of
      clinical work across care settings (primary care and specialty care) by implementing an
      efficient, provider compatible, administratively simple health IT solution: Asynchronous
      Telepsychiatry. To assess the impact of this novel approach, this two-year randomized
      controlled trial of clinical outcomes seeks to evaluate the superiority of the asynchronous
      telepsychiatry (ATP) consultation model on access, quality, cost and outcomes of care over
      the usual care for adults referred from primary care clinics for psychiatric evaluation and
      treatment.

      Aim 1: To assess whether the ATP delivery model improves clinical OUTCOMES in adult patients
      referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs; Hypotheses: Compared to the participants in
      the 'usual care" arm, participants in the ATP arm will show:

      H1: Higher scores over the course of treatment (better clinical trajectory) on the
      Short-Form-12 Health Survey (SF12- the primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale (CGI), the Who Disability Schedule (WHODAS) and the Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF) score.

      H2 (Exploratory): Improved clinical trajectories on specific disorder scales, such as the
      PSQ9, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), the GAD7 and the AUDIT substance abuse scale over
      the those in the "usual care" arm.

      Aim 2: To assess whether ATP improves the QUALITY of care for adult patients referred for
      psychiatric treatment by their PCPs and for PCP providers; Hypotheses: Compared to the
      participants in the 'usual care" arm, participants in the ATP arm will show:

      H1: higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the patient rated Patient Telemedicine
      Satisfaction Survey which includes a general care satisfaction measure to be used across TAU
      and ATP groups and by the provider rated Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire) H2
      (Exploratory- Spanish only speaking participants): will report more positive ratings of their
      provider on the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey short form. Hypothesis: PCP's will be
      highly satisfied with the quality of ATP H3: PCPs with patients referred to the ATP arm will
      report high satisfaction ratings on the Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire. Aim
      3: To assess whether ATP improves EFFICIENCY and REACH through reducing COSTS and increasing
      ACCESS for adult patients referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs; Hypotheses:
      Compared to care in the 'usual care" arm, care in the ATP arm will: H1: be more cost
      effective than "usual care" arm as measured by comprehensive economic data that will be
      collected from patient, provider, and payor perspectives.

      H2: produce shorter wait-times for appointment and consultation feedback as measured by
      comprehensive efficiency data that will be collected from patient, provider, and payor
      perspectives.
