    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites), observational study (study in which the investigators/
      physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of golimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and
      ankylosing spondylitis among Filipino patients.

      The study will enroll approximately 50 patients who would use golimumab with a dosing regimen
      stipulated in the product insert. As this is an observational study, assessment of patients
      will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the Philippines. Patients will be
      monitored from baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter for a period of 24 weeks. Safety
      evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, concomitant
      medications, and co-morbid conditions will be monitored throughout the study. The total study
      will be conducted for 3 years and duration of treatment will be for 24 weeks.
