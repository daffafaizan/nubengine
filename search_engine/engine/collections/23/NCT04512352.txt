      survey with a sample of 1,000 cases from 60 nurseries cum kindergartens to explore the family
      demographics and developmental profiles of low-income children in comparison to others. The
      second phase will be a randomized control trail implementing a 24-month internet-based
      intervention with 200 toddler-parents dyads from 20 to 30 of the original 60 nurseries.
      Interventions will be delivered by older mentors professionally trained by the research team.
      All children, parents and elderly mentors will be evaluated through a set of outcome
      measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The last phase will involve the
      dissemination of research information that may become building blocks for policies on
      internet-based early childhood education, poverty alleviation and social mobility
      enhancement, as well as productive aging.
