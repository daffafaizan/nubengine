      Latin America, the Pacific and developed countries have shown that increasing zinc intake has
      great potential to control common infections in children, but the response to supplementation
      may be different in Africa, where the primary environmental challenge to children's health is
      malaria. Simultaneous supplementation with other potentially limiting nutrients may be
      required to overcome a lack of response when zinc is given alone. The project aims at
      measuring effects of daily oral supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients, given
      either alone or in combination, on malaria incidence and nutritional status, and on
      indicators of immunity.
