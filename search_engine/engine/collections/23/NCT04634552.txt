      increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Talquetamab is a
      humanized immunoglobulin G4 proline, alanine, alanine (IgG4PAA) bispecific antibody designed
      to target G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5-member D (GPRC5D) and the CD3 molecule
      found on T lymphocytes (T cell). This study consists 3 periods: screening phase (up to 28
      days), treatment phase (start of study drug administration and continues until the completion
      of the end of treatment [EOT (30 days (+ 7 days)] visit); and a post-treatment follow-up
      phase (until the end of study unless the participant has died, is lost to follow up or has
      withdrawn consent). Total duration of study is up to 2 years (after the last participant
      receives their first dose). Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), laboratory tests, and
      questionnaire will be assessed at specified time points during this study. Participants
      safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study. The corresponding study
      (NCT03399799) is the Phase 1 part of the study and TALMMY1001- Part 3 is the Phase 2 part of
      the study.
