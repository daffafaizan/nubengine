      multi-center, prospective (the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for
      the outcome of the study) observational study assessing the safety and effectiveness of
      prucalopride among Filipino patients with chronic constipation. Chronic constipation is a
      condition in which bowel movements are infrequent or incomplete for a prolonged time. The use
      of prucalopride should be used in accordance with the approved product label and will follow
      the normal medical practice of the investigators. Patients should take 2 mg prucalopride
      tablet orally once daily. For elderly patients (>65 years old), patients with renal
      impairment not requiring dialysis or patients with severe hepatic impairment, 1mg
      prucalopride once daily should be given. Patients will be asked to fill-up a patient diary
      daily for 12-weeks to monitor the bowel movement during the study period. All adverse events
      and concomitant medications taken by the patients during the study will be documented
      accordingly. Patients will be monitored during the 12-week period of observation while the
      patients are in prucalopride treatment.
