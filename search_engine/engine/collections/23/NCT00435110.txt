      ARDS is identified (Day 0) or 24 hours (Day 1) later: (1) would have an impact on the
      reclassification of patients into ALI or ARDS, and (2) would identify groups with different
      clinical outcomes. Our hypothesis was that the assessment of PaO2/FiO2 on standard ventilator
      settings 24 hours after patients originally met the AECC definition of ARDS would identify
      patients with established ARDS (persisting over 24 h) from others with different degrees of
      lung injury. If this hypothesis is supported, it would suggest that patients with a better
      outcome could have been preferentially entered into one group of previously conducted
      clinical trials, resulting in a viable therapy being proved useless or useless therapy proven
      viable.
