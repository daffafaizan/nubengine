      (allostatic load), and health among toddlers living in economically stressed communities.
      Sleep difficulty, including short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency, is closely
      related to measures of stress, including interleukin (IL-6), cortisol, c-reactive proteins
      (CRP), secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), and body mass index (BMI) and may therefore
      contribute to 'wear and tear' on the body (allostatic load), a problem that places children
      at high risk of physical and mental health problems. Young children who live with
      socioeconomic adversity are especially vulnerable to both sleep difficulty and higher levels
      of physiologic stress (allostatic load).
