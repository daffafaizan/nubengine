      ability to sustain a shared interest in social interaction and to use specific joint
      attention skills, such as pointing and showing. The importance of joint attention is
      underscored by data suggesting these skills are important to later language skills. Targeting
      joint attention deficits in developmentally young children using familiar caregivers may
      result in better child language outcomes. This study will teach caregivers how to initiate
      and maintain episodes of joint engagement with their children.

      Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or to a wait list control
      group. Each caregiver and child in the intervention group will participate in 24 1-hour
      sessions, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. In these sessions, caregivers will be taught 10
      different modules for teaching joint attention skills to their children. Outcome measures
      will include language and joint attention skills in the child and caregiver adherence to the
      intervention protocols. Children and caregivers will be assessed at baseline, during the
      course of the 8-week intervention, and 10 weeks after the end of the intervention.
      Participants assigned to the wait list group will begin the intervention at Week 12.
