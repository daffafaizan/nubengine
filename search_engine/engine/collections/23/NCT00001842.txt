      blood cell count in granulocyte donors prior to donation is becoming an increasingly common
      practice. G-CSF is given subcutaneously to the donor on the day prior to donation, generally
      12 to 24 hours before the start of apheresis. It would be advantageous to be able to give
      G-CSF and collect granulocytes on the same day. However, the single most important factor in
      optimizing granulocyte collection is the donor's pre-collection granulocyte count. Therefore,
      any decrease in count would result in a less cellular component. The purpose of this study is
      to assess granulocyte counts in healthy subjects during an 8-hour period after a single 5
      microgram/kg intravenous dose of G-CSF with or without dexamethasone. Sixteen subjects will
      be studied. Each donor will be studied four separate times. The four mobilization protocols
      to be studied are G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg given intravenously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg
      subcutaneously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg intravenously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally, and G-CSF
      5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally. The order of the route of
      administration will be assigned randomly. White blood cell counts, neutrophil counts and
      donor symptoms will be measured before G-CSF administration and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24
      hours after administration. The neutrophil counts measured within the first 8 hours after
      G-CSF will be compared with counts measured 24 hours after G-CSF.
