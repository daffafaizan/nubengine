      confirmatory diagnostic testing. Nerve conduction studies are not sensitive enough in most of
      the cases leaving the ankle skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber
      density (IENFD) as the main diagnostic tool. Despite its utility and reproducibility, skin
      biopsy is invasive, expensive and requires a central laboratory for processing and
      interpretation. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) is also routinely used for
      evaluation of small fiber neuropathy as sudomotor axons can also be involved. This test
      however remains technically challenging and requires testing conditions in specialized labs
      that are not always suitable for all patients' population. By comparing findings on skin
      biopsy and/or QSRT, accepted gold standard for diagnosing SFPN, the investigators seek to
      find faster, less-invasive ways to diagnose and monitor small-fiber polyneuropathy in rare
      diseases using Sudoscan measurement.
