      therefore few effective treatment options. IBS therefore contributes to difficulties in the
      management of the patients. Aloe vera has a long association with herbal medicine, from the
      Ebers Papyrus from 16th century BCE. It is alleged to be effective in treatment of wounds, to
      improve blood glucose levels in diabetics, and it may reduce symptoms and inflammation in
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Evidence of the effects of aloe vera in the treatment of
      IBS, is however limited and contradictory.
