      fallers and repeat fallers. Data source: Documented falls occurring between October 1, 2010
      and October 31, 2012.

      months and 3months and 1 month prior to the first fall along as the most recent value prior
      to the event. Additional data on vitamin D levels and C-reactive Protein values will be
      collected at the 12 month, 6month, and 1 month prior to the first fall

      collected.

      Two constellations of fallers emerged. Those with and those without dementia. The two groups
      appeared to have different nutrition risk factors. All statistical analysis was done using

      < 0.05
