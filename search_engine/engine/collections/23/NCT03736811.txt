    
      This trial is a prospective, randomized trial conducted with the aim to determine superiority
      of anterior colporrhaphy using nonabsorbable sutures over absorbable sutures with regard to
      the primary outcome. Participants will undergo reconstructive surgery for prolapse, including
      anterior colporrhaphy using the assigned suture materials under general or spinal anesthesia.
      The anterior colporrhaphy will be performed in a traditional manner with midline plication of
      the fibromuscular layer using either 2-0 nonabsorbable (polyester or polypropylene; Ethicon,
      Somerville, NJ) or absorbable (polyglactin 910 or polydioxanone; Ethicon) sutures.
      Concomitant procedures will be performed as intended prior to surgery. Women with a uterus in
      situ will undergo hysterectomy and all women will receive an apical suspension procedure,
      including uterosacral ligament suspension, sacrospinous ligament fixation, and iliococcygeal
      suspension, according to the preference of surgeon. Posterior colporrhaphy and incontinence
      surgery will also be performed, if indicated (i.e. women with Bp â‰¥-1 or documented urodynamic
      stress incontinence).

      Enrollment, treatment and data collection will be standardized by all sites. The study will
      be a single-blind study, as it is impossible to blind the study surgeon for the surgical
      procedure to which the subject in assigned. However, all outcomes assessors and the subjects
      will be blinded to the treatment assignment. Postoperative follow-up will take place after 5
      weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Patients will undergo a standard gynecological examination
      including POPQ and fill in questionnaires.
