      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive only
      (CPT-C) result in equivalent improvement in both PTSD symptoms and health-related quality of
      life (QOL). PTSD symptoms will be measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale - CAPS
      and health-related QOL will be measured by the SF-36V Mental Component Summary Score - MCS.
      In an exploratory aim, we will also assess whether there is a clinically meaningful response
      as defined by improvement in both PTSD symptoms and QOL (defined as a reliable change of 12
      points on the CAPS and 10 points on the MCS, respectively, according to the reliable change
      index).7, 8 One hundred fifty-two Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to MBSR (n = 76) or
      CPT-C (n = 76). Comprehensive assessments will take place post-treatment and 3 months later.
      Qualitative analysis of brief semi-structured interview data will be used to identify
      previously unrecognized factors pertaining to participation, adherence and response to
      treatment, spirituality and religion as treatment moderators, and to identify common themes
      that may inform treatment retention efforts for both MBSR and CPT-C. In addition, potential
      moderators of change in PTSD symptoms and QOL for MBSR and CPT-C will be identified.
