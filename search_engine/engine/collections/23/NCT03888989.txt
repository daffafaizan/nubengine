      volunteers, 18-49 years of age. Investigator intends to collect blood from pregnant women and
      then from the same women a year later when they are not pregnant after routine seasonal
      influenza vaccination. By studying the blood of immunized pregnant women and in these same
      women after pregnancy, the investigator will gain a better understanding of the immune
      response to vaccination in pregnancy and after pregnancy.

      Each volunteer will participate for approximately 4 weeks including enrollment, vaccination,
      and completion of sample collection in 2 consecutive flu seasons. The Study has a total of 6
