      standing in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. As a result of considerable functional
      impairment, individuals with POTS are often unable to attend school or work. There is
      agreement that POTS is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple overlapping pathophysiologies
      proposed to underlie the clinical phenotype of patients. It would be important to define the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in an individual patient to design optimal therapy.
      Our overarching hypothesis is that there is a subset of POTS patients (psPOTS) with a central
      sympathetic activation as the primary pathophysiology. We have characterized these patients
      by an increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, a reflection of central
      sympathetic outflow) even at rest. In this project, we will focus on the role of primary
      sympathetic activation in the pathogenesis of POTS. Direct neural recordings of sympathetic
      activity, central sympathetic inhibition and extensive autonomic phenotyping will enable us
      to identify and correct the primary pathophysiology to optimally benefit psPOTS patients.
      This is a mechanistic study, designed to assess the effects of 4 weeks of central
      sympatholysis with moxonidine on orthostatic tachycardia and symptoms (Specific Aim 1),
      hypovolemia (Specific Aim 2) and central and peripheral baroreflex properties (Specific Aim
      3) in a randomized, crossover design with POTS patients having elevated resting sympathetic
      nerve activity.
