    
      Ptergyia are chronic fibrovascular lesions of the ocular surface. This study is designed to
      look for a signal of efficacy when the lesions are in a phase of active vascular growth. This
      phase is most often caught in a newly recurring pterygia post-operatively.

      Patients identified with actively growing lesions, will be offered local injections directly
      beneath the lesions. They will be examined for any adverse side effects and regression of the
      lesion.
