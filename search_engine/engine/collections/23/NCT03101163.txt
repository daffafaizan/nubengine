      parallel-group, Phase 2 study for adults with large or complicated knee articular cartilage
      lesions and are candidates for knee joint cartilage repair surgery. The safety and efficacy
      of intra-articular injections of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) together with hyaluronic
      acid (HA) after subchondral drilling surgery will be evaluated to determine whether PBSC
      therapy can improve functional outcome and reduce pain of the knee joint better than a
      standard treatment (HA injections and physiotherapy regimen).
