        -  Compare survival, disease-free survival, local control, and pattern of recurrence in
           patients with unresectable stage I, II, or low-volume stage III non-small lung cancer
           treated with high-dose radiotherapy either preceded by induction chemotherapy with
           gemcitabine and cisplatin or combined with daily cisplatin.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1), TNM stage, and participating center. Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV
           over 3-6 hours on day 2. Treatment is repeated once 21 days later. Patients undergo
           high-dose accelerated conformal radiotherapy beginning on week 9 (day 57), 5 days a
           week, for 24 fractions, using a concurrent boost technique up to 66 Gy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive low-dose cisplatin IV followed 1-2 hours later by high-dose
           accelerated conformal radiotherapy. Treatment continues daily, 5 days a week, for 24
           fractions, using a concurrent boost technique up to 66 Gy.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment and at weeks 9-11, 19, 27, and 35.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 6-7 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 418 patients (209 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 5 years.
