      significant implications for both the surgeon and patient. Firstly, the technical difficulty
      of a partial nephrectomy will be reduced to a more achievable level owing mainly to the
      removal of a time limit on surgical resection. With the blood flow halted to downstream
      tissue containing the renal neoplasm from preoperative embolization, resection can be made to
      the tumor without clamping of the main renal arteries. This minimizes the ischemic time to
      non-neoplastic renal tissue, allowing for a renal protective effect. Without the need for
      clamping, the overall surgical operative time is drastically reduced. With excision made at
      the ischemic tissue, intra-operative bleeding and ease can be achieved. More surgeons can
      ultimately attempt at LPN by removing the single most limiting surgical factor, warm ischemic
      time.
