    
      This clinical registry is being established to collect de-identified information on this rare
      disease. The registry created by assimilation of de- identified coded patient data will
      centralize information that can be used to improve the management of the many complications
      of this disease and its treatment. This study is focused on collection of clinically and
      biologically meaningful endpoints across multiple institutions; as such, it is not focused on
      a specific set of hypotheses but will collect data that will facilitate such analyses. The
      investigators will collect information related to the symptoms and the clinical course of the
      disease, to the complications from the disease and its treatment, presence of minimal
      residual disease, frequency of relapse and subsequent management, data on novel molecular
      markers associated with the prognosis.

      In conjunction with the Department of Bioinformatics at The Ohio State University, the
      investigators have created a system for safeguarding the confidentiality and the identity of
      all patients who agree to participate in this research registry. Each participating
      institution will be responsible for de-identification of the data, using software developed
      by The Ohio State University, Department of Biomedical Informatics, before it is used in the
      registry. Each institution will confidentially maintain a code for linking this information
      to an individual patient.

      Each participating institution will have direct control over the data contained in the
      registry that is associated with their respective patient population. As a result of these
      measures, should a patient wish to withdraw from the registry, the responsible institution
      will be able to immediately remove all records related to that patient from the registry.
