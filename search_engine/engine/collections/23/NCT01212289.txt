        1. Use bedside blood analysis with ROTEM® in pediatric cardiac surgical patients to provide
           preliminary information on the nature of coagulation abnormalities.

        2. Compare ROTEM® coagulation profiles between subjects having primary surgery and those
           undergoing reoperation.

      In order to test the study hypothesis, pediatric subjects scheduled to undergo cardiac
      surgery involving CPB will be recruited for two study groups: a) primary surgery; b)
      reoperation. For each group, a small amount of blood will be obtained for ROTEM® analysis
      after induction of anesthesia but before skin incision and again following Cardiopulmonary
      Bypass, 5 minutes after protamine administration.
