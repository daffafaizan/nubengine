      Eligible volunteers will be sequentially enrolled into four escalating-dose cohorts at a
      study site. After administration of a single subcutaneous dose of UB-621, subjects will be
      followed for 70 or 112 days and monitored for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      parameters.
