      white light for the detection of minimal change esophageal.Gastroesophageal reflux
      disease(GERD) is a common disease that be defined as a condition which develops when the
      reflux of stomach contents cause troublesome symptoms and/or complications.At present,more
      than half the patients with GERD symptoms were diagnosed as having nonerosive reflux
      disease(NERD).However,by careful analysis,the majority of NERD patients did not have
      completely normal endoscopic finding but were found to have subtle distal esophageal mucosal
      changes.Forty-eight patients with suspected minimal change esophageal reflux disease(positive
      GerdQ but normal conventional endoscopy)and forty asymptomatic control were recruited.The new
      LCI(GF-L590WR) was performed.The criteria for positive liquid crystal thermography (LCT)
      were:a)triangular indentation,b)punctuate erythema.
