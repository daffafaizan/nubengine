      the medical device Ainara®.

      In this study we use polycarbophilic vaginal moisturizing gel (Ainara®) compared with a
      HA-based gel (Hyalogin) for symptomatic treatment of vaginal dryness and we will monitor its
      impact on vaginal dryness symptoms evaluated by Vaginal Health Index and Vaginal Analogue
      Scale.
