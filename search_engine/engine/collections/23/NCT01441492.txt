      traditionally placed drains near the pancreatic anastomosis to control this potentially very
      serious complication. In recent years, advances in interventional radiology have allowed safe
      percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal fluid collections. Some surgeons have abandoned the
      routine use of prophylactic drains placed at the time of pancreas resection and rely on
      percutaneous drainage for the minority of patients who develop a pancreatic fistula.

      Hypothesis:

      This randomized prospective trial is designed to test the hypothesis that pancreatectomy
      without routine intraperitoneal drainage does not increase the severity or frequency of
      complications within 60 days of surgery. The primary endpoint to assess the severity of
      complications will be the number of patients with any ≥ Grade II complication. Severity of
      complications experienced will also be assessed by comparing the number of patients with, any
      ≥ Grade III complication, any serious adverse event (SAE), and the median complication
      severity grade of all complications. The frequency of complications will be assessed by
      comparing the number of patients with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more than 5 complications of any
      severity grade.

      Objectives:

      Primary: Difference in 60-day ≥ Grade II complication rate comparison between patients who
      receive a pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive
      routine intraperitoneal drainage.

      Secondary:

      A. 60-day ≥ Grade III complication rate comparison between patients who receive a
      pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine
      intraperitoneal drainage.

      B. Serious adverse event (SAE) rate comparison between patients who receive a pancreatectomy
      without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine intraperitoneal
      drainage.

      C. Median complication severity grade comparison between patients who receive a
      pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine
      intraperitoneal drainage.

      D. 60-day frequency of complications (any Grade) between patients who receive a
      pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine
      intraperitoneal drainage.

      E. 60-day, and 90-day mortality rate comparison between patients who receive a pancreatetomy
      without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine intraperitoneal
      drainage.

      F. Rate of specific complications compared between patients who receive a pancreatectomy
      without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine intraperitoneal
      drainage.

      G. Length of stay (index admission and total within 60 days) comparison between patients who
      receive a pancreatectomy without routine intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive
      routine intraperitoneal drainage.

      H. Crude cost comparison between patients who receive a pancreatectomy without routine
      intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine intraperitoneal drainage.

      I. Quality of life comparison between patients who receive a pancreatectomy without routine
      intraperitoneal drainage and those who do receive routine intraperitoneal drainage.
