      advanced, platinum-refractory or platinum-ineligible squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck will be sequentially enrolled to a single treatment arm. Patients will be treated with
      continuous, 28-day cycles of 150 mg of erlotinib by mouth daily and 15 mg of temsirolimus
      intervenously weekly. In the absence of grade 3 or higher toxicity in the first cycle, a
      single, intra-patient dose increase to 20 mg temsirolimus will be permitted.
