      including sepsis and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Due to the impaired infection fighting
      ability, patients with immunoparalysis are at risk of subsequent infection which can increase
      mortality. Immunoparalysis can be measured by two methods: 1) ex vivo endotoxin stimulation
      and 2) blood monocyte HLA-DR levels. Since sepsis is also a known complication of Acute
      Kidney Injury(AKI), the investigators hypothesize that AKI is a risk factor for
      immunoparalysis. The investigators plan to look at these blood factors of immune function
      from patients before and 3 days following cardiac surgery. Urine will also be collected from
      the patients before their surgery as well as the 3 days following for AKI biomarker
      measurement. This prospective cohort will enroll 300 patients and determine the duration and
      severity of immunoparalysis among patients who develop AKI and those who do not develop AKI.
