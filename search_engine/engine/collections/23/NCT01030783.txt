    
      This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm
      trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with advanced RCC. The study is designed
      to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, and kidney specific symptoms/health
      outcome measurements of tivozanib and sorafenib.

      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib and stratified by
      geographic region (North America/Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, or rest of the
      world); number of prior treatments (0 or 1); and number of metastatic sites/organs involved
      (1 or â‰¥ 2).
