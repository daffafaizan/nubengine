      the field of hematology/oncology. When carefully and appropriately performed, the puncture of
      the bone marrow has a very low rate of complications and is generally safe for the patient.
      However, it is an invasive and painful procedure associated with anxiety, especially in
      patients undergoing repeated punctures. Therefore an appropriate preparation of the patient
      for the puncture is essential in order to minimize the stress experienced during the
      procedure. In this regard, there are numbers of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      interventions in pedriatric patients aimed at reducing the punction related pain and anxiety
      in this patients. Nevertheless an evidence based approach for the pretreatment of the
      patients is yet to be established. The aim of this study is to investigate three different
      methods for reducing the pain and anxiety associated with the puncture of the bone marrow in
      adult patients. Two of the of the investigated methods involve pretreatment of the patients
      with pharmacological agents (sedative drug or analgetic drug), whereas the third method
      involves cognitive behavioural pretreatment in form of an audio material. The patients in the
      control group receive placebo injections.
