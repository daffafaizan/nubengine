      The 6-week active treatment period includes an inpatient phase and outpatient phase.
      Participants who complete the trial may continue treatment under a long-term extension
      protocol (P05689). Participants who do not continue in the treatment continuation trial
      (whether they complete the 6-week trial or discontinue prematurely) will have a follow-up
      visit 7 days after their last dose of trial medication.
