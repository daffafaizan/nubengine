      this occurs is unknown. Change in quality of sleep is one possible etiology of these
      findings. This study will help to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to reduced
      fatigue/sleepiness and less cognitive dysfunction in MS patients who go on Natalizumab
      therapy. Understanding these factors may help neurologists better differentiate between the
      different therapeutic options for MS and how they may impact symptoms that negatively affect
      quality of life.
