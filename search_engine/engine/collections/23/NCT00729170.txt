      weight by elevating the calcium consumption to reach the recommended level. Milk
      supplementation could be a good alternative to reach this objective, but its impact on weight
      loss and on appetite sensations has not been verified. Furthermore, losing weight leads to
      some negative consequences like a decrease of bone mineral content. Considering the benefits
      of milk on bone health, a higher intake of this food product during weight loss could
      represent a healthy strategy.
