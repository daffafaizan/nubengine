      significantly reduced the per and postoperative complications of this surgery. Retinal
      detachment remains the most feared complication of this surgery in the nearsighted.

      There is currently an increasing popularity in the international ophthalmic community for the
      correction of ametropia, particularly nearsightedness, by ablation of the non-cataracted
      lens, referred to as refractive lensectomy. However, no recent study reports the
      complications of this procedure with the use of modern surgical techniques.

      This study aims to study the incidence of retinal detachment in the nearsighted myopic after
      phakoemulsification lens surgery and use of posterior chamber foldable soft implants with a
      follow-up of 5 years and preliminary results at 3 years.
