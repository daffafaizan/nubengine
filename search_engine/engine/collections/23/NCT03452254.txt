      double blind clinical trial. This trial considers seven continuous days of treatment when the
      participants with hemiparesis as a result of a stroke will be assigned to one of the
      treatment groups: bi-hemispheric tDCS combined with mCIMT or bi-hemispheric sham tDCS
      combined with mCIMT. Besides collecting demographic and clinical info from the subjects, the
      investigators will assess the patients using upper limb scales of functional motor recovery
      and an evaluation of their functional independence in basic activities of daily living
      (ADLs). STATA 14.0 software will be used for data analysis.

      To date, no study has tested the efficacy of early bi-hemispheric stimulation in combination
      with mCIMT in subacute hospitalized stroke patients.
