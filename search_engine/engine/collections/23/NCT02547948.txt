      efficacy in patients with B cell lymphoma or leukemia. The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting
      antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28.
      Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior
      to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell
      infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of
      CAR T cells and efficacy.
