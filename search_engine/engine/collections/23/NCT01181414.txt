      life and reduces the mortality of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, low ejection fraction
      and wide QRS.

      Only 2% of patients included in CRT randomized trials were in AF.

      To obtain a good response to CRT, percentage >90% of ventricular pacing must be obtained.

      Based on observational studies, current guidelines of CRT recommend the atrio ventricular
      junction (AVJ) ablation in those patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.
