    
      Revacept is a protein that is made up of an Fc fragment ("fragment crystallisable") fused to
      the GPVI receptor (the endogenous platelet collagen receptor). Consequently, Revacept binds
      to its ligand (collagen) on atherosclerotic plaques preventing circulating thrombocytes from
      binding to collagen exposed by the injured plaque. All this is achieved without affecting
      systemic hemostasis.

      Thus, blocking of GPVI-dependent pathways by interfering with vascular collagen sites is
      commonly seen as an attractive target for an anti-platelet therapy of atherosclerotic
      diseases.
