      eperisone and diclofenac from Epry-D (containing eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and diclofenac
      sodium 50 mg) capsules of Eisai Pharmaceuticals India Private Limited, India with those from
      Epry (eperisone hydrochloride) 50 mg tablets of Eisai Pharmaceuticals India Pvt. Ltd., and
      voltaren (diclofenac sodium) 50 mg tablets of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India in healthy
      human adult male subjects under fasting conditions. The secondary objective of this study is
      to monitor the safety and tolerability of a single dose of eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and
      diclofenac sodium 50 mg formulation when administered in healthy human adult male subjects
      under fasting conditions. The participants will be screened for demographic data, medical
      history, general physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray
      (Posterior to Anterior view), hematology, clinical bio- chemistry, serology, urine analysis,
      tests for alcohol and drugs of abuse. A total of 24 healthy adult male volunteer participants
      will be housed in the clinical study facility at least 11 hours before administration of the
      Investigational Product (IP) and will continue to remain in the clinical study facility for
      at least 12 hours after administration of the IP in each study period. After overnight
      fasting for at least 10 hours, either one Epry-D capsule or one Epry 50 mg tablet and one
      Voltaren 50 mg tablet will be administered orally to each participant in sitting posture,
      with 240 plus or minus 2 mL of water at room temperature, in each study period, as per the
      randomization schedule. Administration of the IP will be performed by trained study
      personnel. Dosing activity will be followed by mouth check to assess the compliance to
      dosing. A total of 22 (6 mL) blood samples will be collected from each subject in
      pre-specified vacuum tubes containing K2 EDTA in each study period.
