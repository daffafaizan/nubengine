      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry
      intake on a daily basis for eight weeks on arterial function and blood pressure in
      postmenopausal women with pre- and stage 1-hypertension. The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To investigate the extent to which daily consumption of 22 g blueberry drink-mix reduces
           blood pressure in individuals with pre- and stage 1-hypertension.

        2. To determine whether daily consumption of 22 g blueberry drink-mix will improve the
           autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate in individuals with pre- and stage
           1-hypertension.

        3. To measure serum markers of oxidative stress to determine whether increased antioxidant
           defense is in part responsible for blueberry's vascular protective effects.
