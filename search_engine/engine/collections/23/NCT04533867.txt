      the likelihood of dehiscence, bleeding, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, and
      electrolyte loss that lead to increased costs, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed
      recovery. In recent years, selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine sub-type 3 (5-HT3)
      receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron have been introduced
      because they are effective in the prevention and treatment of PONV in bariatric surgery. In
      this study, the effects of ondansetron and palonosetron on PONV in patients who undergo
      sleeve gastrectomy will be compared.
