      x-ray projections acquired over a limited scanning angle. Scatter is known to be the primary
      source of image degradation in x-ray based imaging.

      The investigators have developed an approach that measures scatter through a low dose (3% of
      the conventional scan) scatter measurement technique. Preliminary studies have shown that
      scatter reduction in DCT can significantly improve quality. The approach will characterize
      the reader confidence in lung nodule detection in a scatter corrected chest tomosynthesis
      imaging approach as compared to the conventional chest tomosynthesis.

      Fifty (50) patients who have undergone a clinical non-contrast CT with lung nodules will be
      asked to have an s-DCT (scan) within 4 weeks (+/- 2 week) of their clinical CT with no
      intervening procedures or therapies (i.e. biopsy of lung nodules). Investigators will then
      perform a reader study to evaluate the radiologist reader confidence in images generated from
      the scatter reduction technique versus more conventional chest tomosynthesis imaging.
