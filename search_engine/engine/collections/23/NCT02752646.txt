      tolerability and toxicity of two commercially available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory eye
      drops, nepafenac 0.3% and ketorolac 0.5% (generic formulation). The study will involve one
      eye of each subject. The study will follow good clinical practices (GCP). The primary outcome
      measure will be tolerability of the study medication as measured by the eye drop comfort
      survey instrument.
