      pancreatic surgery, where extensive lymph node dissections are indispensable. Postoperative
      CL is frequently treated with either medium-chain triglyceride diet (MCT-diet) or total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN). Ignoring CL and removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL
      may also be discussed. While dietary restrictions are known to hinder postoperative
      convalescence and prolong the length of stay at the hospital, recent retrospective data show
      that leaving CL untreated is not associated with an increased morbidity rate. More precisely,
      removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL does not result in an increased incidence of
      CT-guided drainages. However, prospective data on CL after pancreatic surgery do not exist in
      the literature. Accordingly, the present trial aims to compare treatment of CL with dietary
      restrictions to removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL.
