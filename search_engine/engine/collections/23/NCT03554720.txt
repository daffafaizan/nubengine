      posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty. In this study, the investigators propose to
      randomize 50 subjects to receive either the standard Attune PS TKA (n=25) or the enhanced
      fixation Attune S+ PS TKA (n=25) and follow them for a period of 2 years post-operatively.
      The primary outcome of the study will be stability of fixation of the tibial baseplate as
      measured by model-based RSA. Secondary outcomes will be to determine the functionality of
      patients after surgery using self-reported questionnaires.
