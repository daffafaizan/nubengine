      respirology clinic at the Ottawa General Hospital will be approached to participate.
      Concealed random allocation will be done if the subject is willing and signed the written
      informed consent. Experimental arm will receive counseling on site enrollment in the Ottawa
      Model of Smoking Cessation which includes IVR automated telephone follow-up and will receive
      a SmartCard worth $110 towards purchase of smoking cessation aids. Usual care arm will
      receive current usual care in our clinic i.e. strong physician advice, +/- prescription for
      smoking cessation aids if requested or willing.

      As a priori, a third arm was added to the parent study entitled, "A PILOT IMPLEMENTATION OF
      BUDDHIST MINDFULNESS TRAINING COMBINED WITH THE OTTAWA MODEL FOR SMOKING CESSATION IN AN
      OUT-PATIENT RESPIROLOGY CLINIC SETTING". For this arm, research ethics board approval was
      sought and 10 participants were approached.
