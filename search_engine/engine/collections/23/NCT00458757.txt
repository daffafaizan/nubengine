      representation for a visual stimulus provided that it is presented close to the hand. It is
      therefore interesting to ask whether changes in the brain following limb amputation might
      induce changes in the amputees' perception of the body and consequently it's surrounding. In
      this study, we wish to find behavioral evidence for the question whether an amputation of the
      arm can lead to changes in visual perception or motor responses to objects in peripersonal
      space. We hypothesize that changes in the motor and somatosensory hand-related cortices
      following amputation might lead to changes in parietal hand-related areas. Consequently, we
      expect to find reduced perception/attention/responses to hand-related objects in the space
      ipsilateral to the amputation.

      In this experiment we plan to employ a paradigm which is inspired by the affordance effect,
      originally introduced by Tucker and Elice (1998): we will present subjects with brief images
      of either manipulable or non manipulable objects in either the left or right visual field.
      The subjects will be required to determine whether the object contains a metal or not, by
      moving either their left or their right shoulder. We predict that while the control group of
      normal subjects would show a congruency effect (that is superior performance (faster and more
      accurate responses) when the responding shoulder is congruent with the position of the
      objects, the amputees will show spatial biases towards the non-amputated side. This effect
      should be more prominent for the manipulable objects.
