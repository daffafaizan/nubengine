    
      In this study, subjects with HFpEF and new onset paroxysmal or persistent AF (diagnosed in
      the past 6 months) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or medical
      therapy alone. Twenty subjects will be enrolled to each group for a total of 40 subjects
      across all enrolling sites. Subjects randomized to the intervention Group will undergo early
      RF ablation of AF using CARTO 3 and a Thermocool ST SF ablation catheter. The medical therapy
      alone cohort will receive management of AF consisting of either rate or rhythm control. All
      patients will be implanted with an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) as standard of care for
      AF management in heart failure except for those who already have in place an existing cardiac
      implantable electronic device (CIED) such as pacemaker, ICM, or implantable cardiac
      defibrillator (ICD). The ICM procedure will occur within 2 calendar months of randomization
      for both study groups (intervention or control). For the intervention arm, the CIED procedure
      will occur prior to or at the time of the AF ablation procedure. Subjects will be followed
      for 1 year with in-clinic visits occurring at 3, 6, and 12 months.
