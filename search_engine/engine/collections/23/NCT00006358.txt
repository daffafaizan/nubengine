      recurrent or progressive supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. II. Determine
      the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days
      1-5 and oral thalidomide daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of
      24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed at 1 month and then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 months.
