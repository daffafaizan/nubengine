      caries. It is generally agreed that anti-caries effect of fluoride (F) is mainly by
      decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel
      remineralization. An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness (SMH) test is widely used to evaluate
      enamel demineralization and remineralization during the caries process. Determination of
      fluoride uptake in-situ also provides better estimation of true fluoride bioavailability of
      fluoride dentifrice products. In this study, an in-situ remineralization fluoride uptake
      model will be used to compare the efficacy of experimental dentifrice with a marketed
      dentifrice and placebo dentifrice. Participants wore partial dentures containing two
      partially demineralized enamel specimens for two weeks- 24 hours per day, except when
      brushing (twice daily) with test dentifrice. Following each treatment period, the enamel
      specimens were analyzed for SMH recovery and fluoride uptake through microdrill enamel biopsy
      technique.
