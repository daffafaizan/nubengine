      axillary lymph nodes are important in evaluating breast cancer since, if they are positive,
      it suggests that the cancer cells have spread outside of the breast. The current standard of
      care is for most breast cancer patients undergoing surgery to have a sentinel lymph node
      biopsy which is a procedure to take a sample of the lymph nodes in the armpit (also called
      the axilla) during their breast surgery. However this intraoperative biopsy comes with
      certain risks such as arm swelling or lymphedema, arm pain, arm numbness/tingling, and/or
      psychological distress from waiting for the results or the possibility of further
      interventions. In order to avoid this and have a result before surgery, this study will
      explore a nonsurgical method of sampling these lymph nodes. Normally suspicious lymph nodes
      are hard to find accurately by exam and ultrasound.

      A new method has been developed that involves injecting a small amount of iron dissolved in
      liquid into the breast that gets absorbed by the lymph nodes making them bright on ultrasound
      and possible to biopsy. This method has been shown to have results as accurate as standard
      sentinel lymph node biopsy by comparing them in the operating room. This study will now
      investigate performing these ultrasounds and biopsies in the office as well as compare these
      results to the results of the standard sentinel lymph node biopsy in the operating room. The
      results of this study could help future breast cancer patients to avoid invasive sampling and
      all of the accompanying risk as well as give patients and the care team an idea of the extent
      of disease sooner in order to guide management.
