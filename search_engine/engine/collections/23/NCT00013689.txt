      of lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Although, there are treatments
      for many of its autoimmune complications, there currently is no safe and effective therapy
      for this syndrome itself. Recently investigators in Europe serendipitously found that a child
      with ALPS type I had significant clinical improvement while on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine
      (Fansidar) for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis.

      Based on this finding, we propose to conduct a pilot study to obtain information on safety
      and initial data on efficacy of the drug combination Fansidar for the treatment of ALPS. Six
      to 8 individuals, with ALPS who report no allergy to sulfa drugs will be treated for up to 3
      months with weekly Fansidar at escalating doses adjusted by weight. The effect of Fansidar
      treatment on lymph node and/or spleen size will be assessed by CT scanning. The effect of
      treatment on other laboratory features of ALPS will also be assessed. Evaluating the effects
      of Fansidar on these clinical and laboratory parameters will allow us to determine if this
      drug demonstrates sufficient activity to warrant further study in a larger randomized
      controlled trial.
