      interrupt pain signaling at the spinal level. Side effects may be limited by the focal
      distribution of vector delivery and preproenkephalin expression. Preproenkephalin is a
      natural human gene that produces peptides that bind to opioid receptors in the body. The
      therapeutic being evaluated, NP2, is a replication defective herpes simplex type 1 virus
      (HSV-1) modified to express the human preproenkephalin gene that has demonstrated efficacy in
      numerous model of pain, including pain caused by cancer.
