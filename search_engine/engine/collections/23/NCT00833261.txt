      Primary

        -  To evaluate whether treatment with cetuximab, cisplatin, and intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy improves the overall survival of patients with recurrent squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and local-regional progression in these
           patients.

        -  To identify and estimate the incidence rate of acute and late toxicities associated with
           this treatment regimen.

        -  To determine the pattern of disease progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-7. Patients also
      receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes once weekly and undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      once daily 5 days a week in weeks 2-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
