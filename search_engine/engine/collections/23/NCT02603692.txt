      cause of death related to pediatric malignancies. Over decades of work and through the
      efforts of collaborative groups, cure rates have increased significantly. However, various
      types of CNS malignancy outcomes have remained stagnant. Moreover, side effects from
      treatments of even the most curable CNS tumors may have dramatic short and long-term sequela
      ranging from cognitive, endocrine malfunction, functional mobility, neurological, and
      ophthalmologic compromises. As science and protocol directed therapies continue to find cures
      for these patients, work also must continue in efforts to explore patient reported outcomes
      (PROs) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) throughout the trajectory of a patient's
      disease process. Increased efforts in patient reported outcomes will lead to improvements in
      symptom management, functional status, and overall quality of life (QOL).
