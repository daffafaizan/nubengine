      representative dataset (BRFSS, 2017) will be used to answer our research questions. Our
      rationale is that there is insufficient research assessing the relationship between pulmonary
      status and e-cigarette use and that some factors, such as behavioral variables or
      psychosocial variables, might influence this relationship. Our expectation is that this study
      will deepen the understanding of the relationship between pulmonary status and e-cigarette
      use among U.S. adults. This study will cast light on different factors that influence the
      relationship between pulmonary status and e-cigarette use. Also, the following secondary
      outcomes will be tested: Severity of COPD symptoms (COPD group) moderate the relationship
      between pulmonary status (COPD status) and e-cigarette use, and Severity of asthma symptoms
      (asthma group) moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (asthma status) and
      e-cigarette use.
