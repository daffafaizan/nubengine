      enrolled in this study. The study will randomize 46 US cardiology clinics to an intervention
      arm vs. control arm. The clinic-level multi-faceted educational intervention will include
      strategies to develop cardiology and endocrinology partnerships and guideline-recommended
      care pathways with measurement and feedback to improve the care of patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

      Patients must be enrolled during a routine visit in a cardiology clinic, and the clinic must
      have at least 3 physicians and/or APPs on staff with independent patient populations.
