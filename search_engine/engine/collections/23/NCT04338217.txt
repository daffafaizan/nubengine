      hereditary and environmental. Prolonged sucking habits and hyper-divergent facial
      characteristics are significant risk factors for an anterior open bite in the mixed
      dentition. Abnormal tongue posture (frequently associated with enlarged adenoids or tonsils)
      and tongue thrust also can be involved in the establishment of alveolar and skeletal
      discrepancies concurrent with vertical problems Two types of an open bite are recognized in
      this profession: (1) dentoalveolar open bite: the abnormality formalities aspects limiting in
      the dental and alveolar region, usually associated with abnormal function habits as the thumb
      sucking and (2) Skeletal open bite: that's associated with an over high of the lower facial
      vertical dimension and a large plane angle of the lower jaw. open bites associated with
      excessive vertical skeletal dimensions are difficult to treat and tend to relapse The
      investigators must be recognized between the dentoalveolar open bite and the open bite caused
      by formalities disorders and the position disorders of the upper or the lower jaw or both.
      Dental an open bite can be corrected by itself if the treatment was beginning early and it's
      responding Easley to the mechanical treatment methods and the functional treatment approaches
      that depending on the muscular activity
