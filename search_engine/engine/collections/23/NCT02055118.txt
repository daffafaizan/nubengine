      administered intravenously. A revised formulation of idursulfase, idursulfase-IT, that
      differs from that of the intravenous (IV) formulation, Elaprase, has been developed to be
      suitable for delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via intrathecal administration.

      Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is a rare, X-linked, inherited disease that affects males
      nearly exclusively. The disease is caused by the absence of, or deficiency in, the activity
      of the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) which acts to cleave O-linked sulfate
      moieties from the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) molecules dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.

      Study HGT-HIT-094 is a controlled, randomized, two-arm, open-label, assessor-blinded,
      multicenter study to determine the effect on clinical parameters of neurodevelopmental status
      of monthly IT administration of idursulfase-IT 10 mg for 12 months in pediatric patients with
      Hunter syndrome and cognitive impairment who have previously received and tolerated a minimum
      of 4 months of therapy with Elaprase.

      Pediatric patients under 3 years of age will be enrolled into a separate substudy to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of idursulfase-IT. The separate substudy is open label and single
      arm. Patients who are enrolled in the substudy will receive idursulfase-IT treatment and
      follow the same schedule of study visits.
