    
      Multiple myeloma (MM), characterized by malignant plasma cell proliferation, bone
      destruction, and immunodeficiency, is a disease with a median age at diagnosis of
      approximately 65 years. It is responsible for about 1 percent of all cancer-related deaths in
      Western Countries. Conventional treatments with chemotherapy and radiation therapy are
      non-curative but improve quality of life and duration of survival. Attempts to cure myeloma
      through high-dose therapy followed by autografting or allografting have largely failed due to
      a combination of relapsed disease or transplant related mortality (TRM). High-dose therapy
      with autologous transplantation is safe and has low TRM (less than 5%), but is associated
      with a continuing and nearly universal risk of disease progression and relapse. Even so,
      autologous transplantation is superior to continued conventional chemotherapy. Recent data
      indicate that tandem autologous transplants are superior to a single procedure. Even with
      this approach, patients remain at risk of relapse and additional approaches are needed.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The overall study design is that of biologic assignment, based on the availability of an
      HLA-matched sibling, to one of two treatment strategies for MM patients. Patients without an
      HLA-matched sibling will undergo tandem autologous transplants. Patients with an HLA-matched
      sibling will undergo an autologous transplant followed by a non-myeloablative allogeneic
      transplant. In addition, the tandem autologous transplant recipients will be randomized to
      either observation or one year of maintenance therapy to begin following the second
      autologous transplant. The large number of MM patients without an HLA-matched sibling enables
      us to evaluate the role of maintenance therapy following tandem autologous transplants.
