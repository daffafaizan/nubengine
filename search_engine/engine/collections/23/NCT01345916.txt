      + formoterol fumarate 100/6 μg), 1 inhalation twice daily, is non-inferior to the
      corresponding dose of CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of pulmonary function test (change from baseline
      to the entire treatment period in average pre-dose morning PEF) in asthmatic adult patients ≥
      18 years under treatment with fixed dose combination of Foster® (beclomethasone dipropionate
      + formoterol fumarate 100 / 6 μg) 1 inhalation bid.
