      medications called antipsychotics that are used to treat schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder. Specifically, we are looking at long-acting medications that are given by injection
      every month, instead of being taken by mouth every day. In this multi-site study, we are
      comparing the risk and benefits of two FDA-approved long-acting injectable medications
      (paliperidone palmitate and haloperidol decanoate). Study participants with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder are expected to benefit from the improved medication schedule.

      This study aims to enroll 360 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder for
      whom treatment with a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication is likely to be
      helpful. Study participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with either paliperidone
      palmitate and haloperidol decanoate for up to 24 months. Participants will have an equal
      chance of being assigned to each medication, however participants will not know which
      medication they are taking.
