      telephone monitoring to PTSD patients as a supplement to usual specialty mental health care
      improves 12-month clinical outcomes (a reduction in PTSD symptoms, violence, and substance
      use). Secondarily, this study will determine whether telephone monitoring promotes better
      engagement in outpatient treatment (Number of mental health and psychotherapy visits during
      the 3-month intervention period).

      Demand for VA PTSD treatment is increasing as troops return from combat deployments in
      Afghanistan and Iraq. Telemedicine is likely to be an important component in developing more
      effective and efficient models of PTSD care that improves patient functioning and treatment
      utilization. It is hoped that using telephone case monitoring as an inexpensive adjunct to
      standard care may improve clinical outcomes and reduce hospitalization among veterans with
      PTSD.
