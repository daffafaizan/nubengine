      irritation by CO2 during laparoscopic surgery. The investigators postulate that lowering the
      CO2 level in the plasma, will lower tissue CO2 level in the diaphragm and decrease the
      hypothesized irritation. In this study, patients will be divided into an interventional group
      which will receive mild intraoperative hyperventilation determined by an End-Tidal CO2 level
      of 30-32 mm Hg and a control group in which End Tidal CO2 is kept at normal levels (35-40
      mmHg). All other intraoperative factors will be standardized for all patients. Patients will
      be followed up postoperatively and asked whether the participants developed shoulder pain as
      a primary study outcome. The pain will be recorded in terms of severity, site, and position,
      and any associations (Nausea and vomiting). Appropriate statistical tests will be used to
      check for any significant effects of the technique.
