      blood-activating Chinese medicinal components in treatment of Acute Cerebral Infarction (ACI)
      and to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of multi-target anti-inflammatory action
      involved from the standpoint of pathology, cell and molecular biology, as well as immunology.
      In particular, investigators choose heat-clearing Ixeris of sonchifolia Hance(Kudiezi
      Injection) and blood-activating Panax notoginseng saponins(Xueshuantong Injection)as the
      therapeutic interventions to carry out the investigation, applying the key techniques such as
      Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference, co-immunoprecipitation and immunomagnetic beads.

      With the joint efforts, investigators hope to find out the combined therapeutic targets based
      on better understanding of the inflammatory pathology in ACI and illuminate the synergistic
      mechanisms involved, which may validate the Chinese medicine theory of"cerebral vascular
      damage due to heat toxicity" in the pathogenesis of ACI and yield new therapeutic strategies
      for ACI. As an international science and technology cooperation project, the study is of
      great significance in establishing an international technology platform of intervention
      target system for the treatment of ACI; moreover, it marks a key step forward for China to
      enhance China's international brands through exploring a successful mode of foreign
      cooperation in Chinese medicine.
