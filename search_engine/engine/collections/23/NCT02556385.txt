      aimed to reinforce the activity of the brain regions in the left hemisphere. This goal can be
      achieved by using an excitatory protocol to reactivate the perilesional area or inhibitory
      protocol to reduce activities in the contralesional area. However, most conventional rTMS
      studies employed an inhibitory low frequency protocol for the contralesional homologs of
      Broca's area.

      In the present pilot study, investigators will perform functional near-infrared spectroscopy
      (fNIRS) prior to rTMS treatment for selection of the most appropriate application of
      stimulation. Stimulation site and protocol (high frequency or low frequency rTMS) will be
      determined by activation pattern from the fNIRS findings with language task in individual
      patients.
