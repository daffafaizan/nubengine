    
      Patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty procedures at University Pain Institute at
      Hahnemann will be included in this study.

      Following Institutional Review Board's approval, eligible patients will be selected from the
      Pre Admission Testing for total knee or hip arthroplasty surgeries planned at Hahnemann
      University Hospital.

      The cases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either Group 1 or Group 2. Group 1 will
      receive 800 mg Caldolor at the induction of anesthesia, followed by 800 mg Caldolor every 6
      hours until discharge or for a total up to 120 hours (5 days) Group 2 will receive 800 mg
      Caldolor at the induction of anesthesia and 1000 mg Ofirmev at the time of surgical wound
      closure, followed by 800 mg Caldolor plus 1000 mg Ofirmev every 6 hours until discharge or
      for a total up to 120 hours (5 days)

      After the surgery, at the request of the patient they could receive morphine administered by
      patient-controlled analgesia pump, or by hospital staff.

      The analgesics and procedures involved in this study are all standard of care drugs
      prescribed and administered by the attending anesthesiologist for control of total knee or
      hip arthroplasty surgery related pain. Data collected for every patient will exist in the
      patient's medical chart as part of their standard medical care. No additional patient
      procedures or activities are mandated by this study.

      The data collection and analysis will be completed in duration of 1 year
