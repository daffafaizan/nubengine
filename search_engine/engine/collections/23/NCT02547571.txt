      PEG high-volume (2L+2L) split-dose versus PEG (1L+1L)+Bisacodyl low-volume split-dose, or PEG
      high volume (4L) non-split day before versus PEG low volume (2L) non-split same day
      preparation, according to time of endoscopy (early or later), as well as assess the role of
      diet (low residue or clear liquid diet) according to these different Canadian outpatient
      preparation regimens.
