      Especially in the elderly population, integrated rehabilitation programs are frequently used
      to improve patients' symptoms and quality of life. To estimate the costs and utility of the
      rehabilitation programs may help clinicians decide optimal treatment strategy with proper
      usage of resources. Therefore, we aimed to to compare the cost-effectiveness of inpatient and
      outpatient physical therapy programs in patients with knee osteoarthritis.The study included
      52 patients with the diagnose of knee osteoarthritis. Patients were divided into two groups.
      Group 1 (n=30) received 21 sessions of inpatient physical therapy program including
      electrotherapy, superficial- deep heat applications and basic knee exercise program. Group 2
      (n=22) received the same physical therapy program at outpatient clinic.
