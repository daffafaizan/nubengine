    
      This "Quality of Life" study is directly related to the "BANDING-SET" study (NCT03247231),
      whose main aim is to analyze the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic band ligation without
      resection in the small gastrointestinal subepithelial tumours management.

      Using three validated tests (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Cancer Worry Scale
      [CWS] and European Five-Dimension Quality of Live test [EuroQol-5D]) patients are evaluated
      before and after the endoscopic procedure.

      Three main groups of patients are presented:

        -  GROUP A, in which the subephitelial tumour is successfully removed [hypothesis: anxiety
           and fear of cancer should decrease].

        -  GROUP B, in which the subephitelial tumour is not successfully removed due to various
           reasons (size >15-mm, not technical success,...) [hypothesis: anxiety and fear of cancer
           shuold be similar before-after].

        -  GROUP C, in which the subephitelial tumour is not observed or is a benign entity, which
           does not require further interventions for these patients [hypothesis: anxiety and fear
           of cancer should decrease].
