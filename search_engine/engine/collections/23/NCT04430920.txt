      surgery. However, whether avoiding intraoperative hypotension can reduce the incidence of
      postoperative cardiovascular events remains unclear. The objective of this study is to assess
      the effects of an intensive intraoperative blood pressure management strategy (to maintain
      intraoperative MAP ≥ 80mmHg) with that of conventional practice (to maintain intraoperative
      MAP ≥ 65mmHg) on the incidence of cardiovascular events after major abdominal surgery.
