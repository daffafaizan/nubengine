      potential first-line treatment for major depression. tDCS generates a small electric current
      which modulates how easy it is for active brain cells to discharge. The device is a neoprene
      cap worn over the head, and in the cap there are two electrodes, which are small metal discs,
      where the current comes from. tDCS does not directly stimulate brain cells to cause a seizure
      like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and it does not induce brain cells to discharge like
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

      Clinical studies have shown that tDCS treatment could help to improve the symptoms of
      depression. The main side effects have been redness, skin irritation or sensations (itching,
      tingling or burning) under the electrodes. Less commonly reported side effects include
      headache or tiredness. tDCS is a portable and safe treatment.

      The studies to date have mostly looked at tDCS treatment which has been provided in a
      research setting. This is a problem because the treatment requires daily sessions for several
      weeks which could limit whether individuals would be able to go every day. As tDCS is a
      portable and safe treatment, it could be provided in the community.

      The study research question is whether tDCS could be provided as a home-based treatment for
      major depression. The study will include adults with major depression.
