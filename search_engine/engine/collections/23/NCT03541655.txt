    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, active control study in participants undergoing primary
      unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). Fifty (50) participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive either a single, 3.5 mL dose of F14 (celecoxib) concurrent with standard of care
      analgesia, or only standard of care analgesia. F14 will be administered into the joint space
      at the end of surgery and just prior to wound closing. Safety will be evaluated through
      recording of adverse events, vital signs, ECG, physical and knee-specific examinations,
      laboratory blood tests and standing x-rays of the TKR obtained at 3 and 12 months.
      Post-operative pain will be assessed using visual analog scores (VAS) and Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaires and the Timed Up and Go
      test. Concomitant medication usage including MSO4 equivalents will be monitored daily for 3
      months with participant drug diaries, and at the 12-month visit. Perceived benefit of
      analgesia will be compared using the Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS). The
      pharmacokinetic profile of celecoxib in plasma will be assessed up to 3 months. Standardized
      physical therapy will be implemented post-operatively. Follow-up study visits will occur at
      1, 2, 3, 4 (phone) and 6 weeks, 3 and 12 months.
