      orthopedic rehabilitation department in our institute. Participants will be assigned randomly
      to be fitted with a SACH or a 1M10 Otto Bock foot in their prosthesis.

      Both types of feet will be "dressed" to look similarly. All participants will receive the
      same rehabilitation protocol. After three weeks all participants will be tested functionally
      in the "10 meter walk test" , and a "Get up and go test". The participants will answer a
      satisfaction questionnaire that is based on the "Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire" and
      modified according to the aims of this trial.

      Pressure patterns and gait parameters will be recorded using a pressure mat. At this time the
      foot will be switched to the other study prosthetic foot, and the rehabilitation will
      commence.

      At the end of three weeks wearing the new foot the same set of tests will be run again.

      The investigators aim to present the difference in satisfaction and in the functional
      performance of the same participant wearing the two feet.
