      between oncologists and Latinos with cancer. These communication disparities are evidenced by
      gaps in Latino's understanding of their condition and treatment options, and by worse
      satisfaction with provider communication. Limited English proficiency and health literacy are
      very common among Latinos, yet few interventions have been developed to help Latino cancer
      patients better understand their condition and treatment options.

      In this study the investigators have partnered with Latino patients, providers, and
      researchers to develop a Spanish/English language intervention aimed at better informing
      Latinos with advanced gastrointestinal cancers about the risks and benefits of their
      chemotherapy options. Specifically, the intervention consists of a dual language,
      regimen-specific suite of videos and booklets explaining the most common chemotherapy options
      used to treat advanced colorectal cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer. The videos feature
      Latino patients describing their experiences on treatment, as well as clinicians describing
      factual information about treatment risks, benefits, and alternatives.

      In this study, self-identifying Hispanic/Latino patients with metastatic colorectal cancer,
      locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer considering treatment with first line
      chemotherapy will be randomized to the usual care, or to usual care supplemented by access to
      the relevant chemotherapy educational materials. Caregivers will also be enrolled on the
      study. Participants will be surveyed at baseline, 2-weeks post-treatment initiation, 2-3
      months post-treatment initiation, and 4-6 months post-treatment initiation regarding their
      understanding of chemotherapy risks and benefits, decisional conflict, and other metrics of
      informed decision-making.
