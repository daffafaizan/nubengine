      PSADs serve a potentially important role in providing audibility of sounds for adults who
      find themselves having difficulty hearing and understanding speech in some daily living
      situations, but may not be candidates for traditional, high-amplification hearing aids.
      Despite hearing loss being a very common problem, few adults who could benefit from some
      level of amplification actually access the technology. Only approximately 1 in 7 adults (14%)
      over the age of 50 with a hearing loss using amplification. High cost is the most commonly
      cited reason for not wanting to try amplification, and indeed, hearing aids range from $1000
      to $5000 each (i.e., per ear). PSADs range from $50-$600 each, and may provide a reasonable
      option for people who are not ready, or are unwilling, to wear a hearing aid. This project
      aims to examine the feasibility of a PSAD to provide audible and clear sound signal to adult
      listeners. The significance of this project is its potential to develop an option for
      individuals to take advantage of amplification and access sound to improve quality of life,
      who may not otherwise do so without this technology.
