    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, sequential-cohort, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1
      study of PRT543 in patients with advanced cancers who have exhausted available treatment
      options. Enrollment will take place concurrently into two distinct patient groups (one for
      solid tumors/lymphomas and one for hematological malignancies). The study will consist of 2
      parts, a dose escalation part, and once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been
      determined, a cohort expansion part involving up to nine separate cohorts. For patients, the
      study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post treatment follow-up
      phase. An end-of-study visit will be conducted within 30 days after the last dose of PRT543.
