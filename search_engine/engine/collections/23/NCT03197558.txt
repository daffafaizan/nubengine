    
      The objective for Group B in the study is to evaluate tolerability and safety of tympanostomy
      tube (TT) placement in adults following local anesthesia in a physician's clinic setting.

      Group B will consist of 30 evaluable adults who require unilateral or bilateral tube
      insertion.

      The iontophoresis system (IPS) will be used to facilitate anesthetic delivery to the tympanic
      membrane (TM). The lidocaine-based solution used for local anesthesia of the TM is Tymbion
      (2% lidocaine HCl/ 1:100,000 epinephrine).

      Subjects will receive active Tymbion iontophoresis and will have tubes placed using the TDS
      in all ears indicated for tube placement. The subject will rate the pain upon TDS tube
      insertion using the VAS, and the pain score will be compared to a performance goal.

      Safety will be evaluated post procedure and at a follow-up visit.
