      to how high-intensity functional circuit training (HIFCT) affects CF. This study aims to
      compare the acute effects of one HIFCT bout against an inactive control condition as well as
      against one bout of conventional aerobic exercise.

      Healthy participants will be randomly allocated to either a HIFCT group, an aerobic exercise
      group (walking) or an inactive control group. In the HIFCT group, participants perform a
      15-minute workout, which is composed of functional exercise mimicking activities of daily
      living (e.g. squat, step-ups) and conducted in a circuit format. Each exercise is performed
      at all-out intensity for 20 seconds, followed by a 10-second break. Thus, the 15-min workout
      consists of 30 exercise intervals.

      In the control group, participants will be inactively seated for 15 minutes, reading sports
      brochures and literature.

      In the walking group, participants will walk at moderate intensity on a treadmill for 15
      minutes.

      Outcomes assessed pre and post-workout include the stroop test, trail making test,
      stop-signal task, heart rate, subjective arousal, rate of perceived exertion and exercise
      enjoyment.
