      inhibition of prostanoid synthesis by NSAIDs forms the basis of their therapeutic as well as
      side effects. NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [COX], which leads to reduction of
      prostaglandin synthesis and also to gastric erosions, inhibition of platelet aggregation and
      nephrotoxicity. The identification of the two isoforms of COX lead to the hypothesis that
      COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins following tissue injury, while
      COX-1 is involved in normal homeostasis.

      The selective COX-2 inhibitors are believed to be efficacious anti-inflammatory drugs devoid
      of the side effects associated with the inhibition of COX-1. However, the selectivity of
      these drugs has only been demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo, which may not be a reliable
      indicator of the in vivo selectivity. The proposed study aims to evaluate the in vivo
      selectivity of celecoxib, a drug demonstrated to be a selective inhibitor of COX-2 in vitro
      in the oral surgery model of acute inflammation.
