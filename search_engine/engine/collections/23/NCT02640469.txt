      Providine-iodine is safe and effective at reducing skin colonization with gram positive and
      negative bacteria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi and viruses. Chlorhexidine similarly
      disrupts cellular membranes. It is bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic and has immediate and
      more lasting effect than iodine because it can bind to the stratum corneum of the skin and is
      effective against gram positive and negative organisms, lipophilic viruses and yeasts.

      All subjects who are employees of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and have experience
      with surgical hand disinfection will be asked to enroll. Subjects will be randomized into one
      of three study arms using an online randomizer: (1) the standard chlorhexidine with water
      rinse, (2) chlorhexidine without water rinse(experimental), and (3) standard chlorhexidine
      followed by sterillium hand rub. After hand disinfection protocol has been completed, each
      subject will have each hand cultured three times using a cotton swab culture stick and sent
      to the microbiology lab for processing
