      Intrauterine infection is associated with significant white and grey matter brain injury in
      newborns and is particularly important in the pathogenesis of periventricular leukomalacia
      (PVL) and cerebral palsy (CP). CP has been shown to be 4-9 times higher in babies exposed to
      intrauterine infection than in normal infants. Antibiotics have not changed the risk for
      brain injury in the newborn.

      NAC is a promising anti-oxidant therapy that has shown effective neuroprotection in an animal
      model of chorioamnionitis, and has a favorable safety profile with limited and manageable
      side effects.

      In this trial, intravenous NAC was given to mothers antenatally and to their infants
      postnatally, who presented with the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, to evaluate safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in mothers and infants. Mothers at ≥24 weeks gestation and their
      infants were randomized to receive either saline NAC within 4 hours of a clinical diagnosis
      of chorioamnionitis. Infants were stratified into term (≥ 33wk) and preterm (24-32wk)
      cohorts, due to different expected rates of metabolism and clearance.

      Information gained from this trial will be used to determine how rapidly NAC is metabolized
      by mother, fetus, infant, and the ability of NAC to cross placenta. This study will also
      elucidate the safety of NAC in the setting of chorioamnionitis for fetal neuroprotection.
