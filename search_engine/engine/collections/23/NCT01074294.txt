      different one. In addition, subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to the
      investigational medication or placebo (pill without active medication). Total study
      participation lasts 6-20 weeks (up to 5 months). 675 men and women will be in the study at 40
      study centers throughout the U.S.
