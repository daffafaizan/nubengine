      lidocaine infusion (Lidocaine group) or 0.9% sodium chloride infusion (Control group).

      Randomization: was performed using Lidocaine group and Control group registers, which was
      placed in sealed envelopes prior to study initiation and opened prior to anesthesia by a
      physician who prepared the intravenous solution and identified it with the patient number,
      according to the envelope drawn. The solution was handed to another physician, blind to the
      prepared solutions' content, who was responsible for the anesthesia. The solution volume was
      equal. The responsible investigator was remained blind to the chosen group until the end of
      the study.
