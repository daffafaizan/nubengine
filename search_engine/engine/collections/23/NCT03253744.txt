      Prostate cancer that recurs after prior radiation treatment can be challenging to cure due to
      the side effects of available treatments such as surgery and cryoablation. Re-irradiation
      with brachytherapy or stereotactic approaches has shown excellent rates of prostate cancer
      disease control with tolerable side effects. Using image guidance to allow highly conformal
      focal reirradiation may potentially increase the efficacy of re-irradiation.

      Objectives:

      -Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of image guided, focally dose escalated prostate
      radiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with a local recurrence
      of prostate cancer after prior radiotherapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histological confirmation of recurrent prostate cancer after prior irradiation (external
           beam or brachytherapy)

        -  No evidence of distant metastases of prostate cancer

        -  No prior prostatectomy

        -  Subject is greater than or equal to18 years old

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to
           60%).

      Design:

      This is a Phase I trial of focal dose escalation with SBRT using image and pathologic
      guidance. Areas in the prostate shown to have tumor on biopsy or with advanced imaging
      studies will be treated with highly conformal SBRT over a period of two to three weeks.
      Treatment will be guided and gated by fiducials implanted in the prostate. Patients will be
      treated to escalating doses based on tolerability of the treatment. Quality of life and
      functional outcomes such as urine, bowel, and erectile function will be assessed with
      questionnaires. Up to 52 patients will be enrolled.
