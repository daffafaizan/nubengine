      adverse event (SAE) of renal failure chronic after receiving his I.V. dose on Day 1. The
      study was taken off hold after the subject recovered and an independent consultant had deemed
      the SAE as not treatment related; however, the site was unwilling to enroll additional
      subjects. Another site, based in New Orleans, was damaged by hurricane Katrina and was unable
      to enroll any subjects. A decision was made by the sponsor to terminate the study on 11 Apr
      2006 due to poor study enrollment. There were no safety or efficacy concerns regarding the
      study in the decision to terminate the trial.
