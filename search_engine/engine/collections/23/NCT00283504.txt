      Primary: Describe inflammatory cell types in study patients and compare changes in
      inflammatory cell patterns before and during anti-IgE therapy.

      Secondary:Describe patterns of sputum eosinophilia and neutrophilia in relation to asthma
      symptom improvement based on ACT and PFT

      Hypotheses:

      Differences in inflammatory response after the addition of anti-IgE therapy can be described
      in neutrophilic, eosinophilic and neutrophilic/eosinophilic asthmatics.

      Neutrophilic asthmatics patients will fail to respond when placed on anti-IgE while
      eosinophilic asthmatics will respond well.

      Sputum inflammatory markers are sensitive markers of inflammation and can predict response to
      new asthma treatment modalities such as anti-IgE therapy.
