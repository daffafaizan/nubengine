      I. To estimate the positive predictive value within each of the early stage testicular
      seminoma and nonseminoma groups using plasma miRNA 371 expression at relapse to detect germ
      cell malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank prospectively obtained serial liquid biospecimens for low and moderate risk of
      relapse patients annotated by patient level clinical data.

      II. To bank prospectively collected, clinically annotated specimens for high risk patients
      and non-testicular primary patients in collaboration with Children's Oncology Group study
      AGCT 1531.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.
