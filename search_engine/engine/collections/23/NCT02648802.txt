      assignment will be written on a slip of paper, and will be placed in a sealed envelop. A
      label with the patients' name and admission ID will be placed on the sealed envelop, which
      will be kept in a locked file. On the day of surgery, a research coordinator will bring the
      sealed envelope to the operation room. During the standard-of-care BCS, the tumor was excised
      with a rim of grossly normal tissue. Additional resections are allowed when any of the
      margins of the tumor-containing specimen were suspected to be inadequate on the basis of
      standard gross evaluation by surgeons. Prior to intra-operative CM assessment, the research
      co-ordinator will unseal the envelop and determine which procedure has been designated to the
      patient. The cosmetic outcome and the quality of life will be evaluated at the day of
      discharge, after completion of radiotherapy and one year by the patient herself, her partner
      and a research co-ordinator.
