      sixth patient suffers from increased depression level, which is associated with higher risk
      of suicide, increased risk of onset and progression of chronic physical conditions. Still,
      depression is under recognized and undertreated in primary care. Moreover, evidence regarding
      the efficacy of depression screening in primary care is insufficient to draw clear
      conclusions. Our previous mono-center depression screening trial in cardiac patients,
      provides first evidence that written patient-targeted feedback improves depression severity,
      encourages greater patient participation and engagement in mental health. To amplify these
      effects, the multi-center GET.FEEDBACK.GP randomized controlled trial is now designed based
      on patients' needs and preferences. In order to evaluate the effect of feedback in the
      broader setting of primary care, a total of 1076 primary care patients with elevated levels
      of depression (PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10) will be randomized into three groups who either receive a)
      patient-targeted and physician-targeted feedback of depression screening results, b) a
      physician-targeted feedback of depression screening results only, or c) no feedback of
      screening results. The primary study outcome is depression severity after 6 months, secondary
      outcomes include the patients' behavior and cognitions after the screening, depression care
      according to German guideline recommendations and the health economic evaluation.
