    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of Flt3/MerTK inhibitor MRX-2843 (MRX-2843) when
      administered along with osimertinib.

      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the tested combinations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To perform biomarker profiling in order to
      identify potential predictive biomarker to optimize treatment efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MRX-2843.

      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and MRX-2843 PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for minimum of 30 days, or
      until resolution of treatment-related toxicity to =< grade 1, whichever is longer after
      removal from study.
