    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients in at least the second PI line, the
      virological failures under Kaletra® and their consequences on protease and reverse
      transcriptase genotypes:

        -  Characterisation of the changes in the resistance genotype in protease and reverse
           transcriptase,

        -  Description of the nature and frequency of selected mutations under Kaletra®,

        -  Description of the predictive factors for mutations and of the impact they could have on
           other PIs used as maintenance treatment (analysis based on available algorithms).

      EOLE is a prospective, multicentre observation study offered to French virology laboratories
      and involving clinical teams .

      It is a transversal study with retrospective data collection for patients meeting the study
      criteria (virological failure under Kaletra® after at least first line PI treatment).

      The study comprises two enrolment periods, separated by an interval of one year, over a
      period ranging from 2007 to 2011. During this period, virological failures under Kaletra® are
      identified. For each period, the virologists collect data only from the moment when
      virological failure under Kaletra® is identified.

      The first wave of data collection is now completed and occurred from December 5, 2007 to July
      03, 2009.

      It is not planned to collect follow-up data in connection with alternative treatment with
      other antiretrovirals after failure under Kaletra®.
