      participating hospitals will be included in the study. First, all hospitals will apply 'usual
      care' to all patients, i.e. risk assessment and subsequent management without application of
      the HEART score. Then, during a 14 month period, each 1,5 month 1 randomly allocated hospital
      will sequentially start to apply the HEART score in all chest pain patients (intervention
      period); during this intervention period patients with a HEART score 0-3 will not be admitted
      to the hospital (in accordance with the results of our validation studies), and patients with
      a HEART score above 3 will be treated according to current guidelines.
