      bifocal contact lens with a distance-center design can slow myopia progression in children.
      Using soft bifocal contact lenses to manipulate the peripheral optics of the eye is a novel
      use for a standard contact lens that may keep children from becoming as nearsighted as they
      would otherwise. Secondary goals are to determine whether the amount of myopic defocus
      imposed on the peripheral retina by soft bifocal contact lenses is associated in a
      dose-dependent manner with slowed myopic progression and to determine whether peripheral
      myopic blur acts to slow eye growth locally or globally. These important pieces of
      information will enable investigators to learn about the role of peripheral optics for
      regulating eye growth, which could ultimately lead to optimization of optical signals to slow
      myopia progression. Ultimately, the information could be used to design optical devices to
      prevent the onset of myopia in young children.

      Slowing myopia progression or eventually preventing myopia onset could potentially affect
      approximately 60 million children in the United States alone. While the consequences of
      myopia are rarely sight-threatening, the quality of life for myopic patients is negatively
      affected and the health care costs to treat myopia are astronomical (approximately $4.6
      billion in 1990). The National Eye Institute recognizes the need to "evaluate the efficacy of
      potential treatments for delaying the onset or for slowing the progression of myopia, such as
      lenses that alter peripheral defocus."

      Using a common treatment of myopia (contact lenses) to potentially slow myopia progression
      and to learn about optical signals that regulate eye growth is a very novel approach to
      solving a problem that affects a large proportion of people in the United States.
