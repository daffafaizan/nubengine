      6-week section patients receive treatment with either TNI or BiPAP and in the second 6-week
      section treatment is changed. The starting therapy is allocated to the patients via
      randomisation and should be started directly after the baseline visit.

      The treatment and the follow-up period end with the second visit after the second treatment
      section and the patient decides which device he/she wants to use further.
