      intervention for smokers (Anger Reduction Treatment or ART). The investigators will
      administer this intervention to smokers (N = 114) who are interested in quitting and have
      elevated levels of trait anger. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: (1)
      computerized ART, consisting of interpretation bias modification, or (2) a computerized
      control condition, which consists of health education and relaxing video clips. The
      computerized sessions (eight total) will take place twice a week for four weeks. All
      participants will have a scheduled quit date for the beginning of the third week of treatment
      (i.e., at mid-treatment). All participants will also receive nicotine patch therapy to use at
      their scheduled quit date. Anger symptoms, smoking cravings, and smoking frequency will be
      assessed throughout treatment. Smoking status, anger, and other measures of negative affect
      will also be assessed at baseline and regularly for 12-weeks following the scheduled quit
      date.

      The investigators will test whether, compared to the control condition, the anger-reduction
      treatment will lead to: 1) greater reductions in anger and 2) greater abstinence rates at
      post-cessation and at follow-up assessments. The investigators will also test whether changes
      in anger-related symptoms account for group differences in abstinence rates.
