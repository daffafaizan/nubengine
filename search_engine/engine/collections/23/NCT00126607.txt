      I. To assess response (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response) in patients
      with advanced high-grade salivary gland carcinoma treated with trastuzumab.

      II. To assess one-year progression-free survival and one-year overall survival for patients
      treated with this regimen.

      III. To assess the toxicities associated with this treatment regimen in this group of
      patients.

      IV. To measure the indicators of C-erb B2 oncoprotein expression and C-erb B2 oncogene
      amplification and epidermal growth factor receptor expression and explore the relationship
      between these markers and response, progression-free survival and overall survival in
      preliminary fashion.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months until 3 years from study
      entry.
