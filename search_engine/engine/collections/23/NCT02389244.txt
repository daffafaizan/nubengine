    
      METHODOLOGY:

      Randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentric, phase II study -This is a double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial, with 5 cohorts: cohort A: Osteosarcoma, cohort B: Ewing sarcoma,
      cohort C: Chondrosarcoma, cohort D : chondroma, cohort E: CIC-rearranged sarcoma. Cohort A, B
      and C will involve a total of 36 patients (24 Regorafenib + 12 placebo), cohort D a total of
      24 evaluable patients (16 Regorafenib + 8 placebo) and cohort E will involve a total of 27
      evaluable patients (18 Regorafenib + 9 placebo).

      159 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
      the following treatment groups :

      The Arm A:

      Regorafenib (160 mg/d) once daily for the 3 weeks on / 1 week off plus Best Supportive Care
      (BSC) until progression (according to RECIST 1.1), intolerance or withdrawal of consent .

      Patients receiving regorafenib who experience disease progression and for whom in the
      investigator opinion, treatment with regorafenib is providing clinical benefit, may continue
      the treatment following consultation with the study coordinator and the sponsor.

      The Arm B:

      Placebo plus BSC until progression (according to RECIST V1.1) intolerance or withdrawal of
      consent. Patients who have received placebo will receive open-label regorafenib after
      objective tumor progression.

      Patients will be stratified at randomization according to histology .
