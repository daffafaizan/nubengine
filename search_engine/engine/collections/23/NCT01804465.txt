    
      This is an open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining SipT with
      ipilimumab in patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve metastatic castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC).

      All patients will be treated with standard SipT (Q2wks x 3). Patients will be randomized to
      one of two arms:

      Arm 1 (Immediate Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 1 day following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Arm 2 (Delayed Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 3 weeks following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Following this ipilimumab treatment, patients will then be followed monthly for 3 months and
      then quarterly until disease progression. The definition of unacceptable toxicity is grade 3
      or higher treatment-related toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4) excluding immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs). The study will assess for the immunogenicity and clinical activity of sequential
      sipuleucel-T treatment followed by ipilimumab. Patients who experience an initial clinical
      response to ipilimumab followed by subsequent disease progression will be offered reinduction
      treatment with ipilimumab.
