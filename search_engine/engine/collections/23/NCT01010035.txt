      in LDL may occur related to atherogenesis.Cholesterol exist in two main forms in organism:
      free cholesterol and the esterified cholesterol. An artificial model to study this two forms
      of cholesterol is the use of LDL-like nanoemulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl esters
      and 3H- cholesterol. This nanoemulsion is made without protein and when in the intravascular
      compartment it is able to acquires apolipoproteins from others lipoproteins, such apos A's,
      C's and E. This model allowed us to use the nanoemulsion particle as a probe to study the
      lipoproteins receptor binding and the cholesterol esterification process.
