      symptomatic COPD. Each patient will participate in seven visits over a 3-4 week period. At
      the first visit patients will provide informed consent and then be familiarized with
      equipment and testing protocols. At visits 2 and 3 patients will inhale 2 puffs of albuterol
      HFA MDI, and then perform symptom limited incremental exercise on the treadmill or cycle
      ergometer (randomized order); after a one hour rest, the patient will perform constant work
      exercise at 80-85% of peak VO2 on the same exercise mode.

      At visits 4 - 7, patients will perform PFTs at baseline and at 30 and 120 minutes after
      inhaling arformoterol or normal saline (randomized order) and then constant work exercise on
      the treadmill or cycle ergometer (randomized order). Metabolic measurements will be made
      throughout exercise, and patients will provide continuous ratings of breathlessness and leg
      discomfort using a system consisting of a computer, monitor, and a mouse.
