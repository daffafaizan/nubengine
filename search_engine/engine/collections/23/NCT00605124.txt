      the operated knee did not recover and may stay under the preoperative level. To find out the
      effects of progressive exercise program the investigators will perform, 6 weeks after TKA, a
      randomized clinical trial of lower extremity strength training using two subgroups of people:
      traditional exercise group and progressive exercise group.
