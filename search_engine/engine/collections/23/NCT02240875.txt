    
      Long- term immunology follow-up: In order to assess the durability of vaccine induced
      immunogenicity, all vaccinated subjects will be invited back to attend a maximum of 3 further
      optional follow up visits at least 12 months after their final vaccination. The 3 visits will
      have a minimum interval of 3 months between them, and the final visit must take place no
      longer than 12 months after the first optional visit.

      Volunteers who attend these visits will be asked about occurrence of any SAEs during the
      intervening period. SAE data for this period will not be collected in those volunteers who
      decline to attend these additional visits.
