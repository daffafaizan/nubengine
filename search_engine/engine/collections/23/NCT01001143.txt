      two agents have each shown efficacy in decreasing leukemic blast counts and restoring normal
      hematopoiesis via different mechanisms of action and with non-overlapping side-effect
      profiles. By combining these agents, the investigators hope to improve overall response
      rates. The investigators further hope to improve platelet and neutrophil counts in an even
      greater number of patients, thus treating two of the most important sources of morbidity and
      mortality in this patient population.
