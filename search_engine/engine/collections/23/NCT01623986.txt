      machine called a Doppler echocardiography machine (also known as an ECHO machine) is a widely
      accepted technique and is used as a screening tool for pulmonary hypertension and heart
      failure. The pressure on this side of your heart reflects the pressure of the blood in your
      veins returning to your heart and the effectiveness of your heart to pump that blood to your
      lungs. The accuracy of this technique depends on making an accurate estimate of the pressure
      in the upper chamber (atrium) of the right side of your heart, known as your right atrial
      pressure (RAP). Right atrium pressure can be measured non-invasively by imaging of your heart
      using an echocardiography (aka ECHO) machine. But the technique depends on the skills of the
      sonographer (the person who operates the ECHO machine) and can take considerable time to
      complete.

      In view of this limitation, a non-invasive technique that could be used to make the RAP
      measurements may be more reliable and/or faster than the current technique.

      Mespere Lifesciences Inc. has developed a new non-invasive device that is expected to allow
      for a simple, rapid and reliable measurement of RAP. The device consists of a set of light
      sensors on a patch that is placed onto the surface of the patient's right side of the neck.
