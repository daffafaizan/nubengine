      intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and methoxsalen
      sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a period of 6
      weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of Week 6). After
      the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial response or
      unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two additional
      booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Treatment will be considered safe provided â‰¤ 2 out of 12
      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first
      intra-tumoral injection. Subjects will have staging scans at baseline, day 8, week 7 and as
      per standard of care during the optional treatment and follow up study periods. There will be
      a two-year follow up period.
