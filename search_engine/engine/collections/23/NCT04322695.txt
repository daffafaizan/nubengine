      evaluate the 3-months RECP. Eligible participants will be recruited from initial completion
      treatment to 6 months after completion treatment and randomized into a control group and an
      experimental group, with the control group patients receiving routine hospital care and the
      experimental group patients receiving the 3-months RECP. Outcomes will be assessed using
      Return to Work Barrier Scale (RTWBS), Fear of Progression Questionnaire (FoP-Q-SF), Social
      Support Scale (SSS), University of Washington Quality of Life Scale (UW-QOL), Karnofsky's
      Performance Score (KPS), Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and Instrument
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL). Subjective data will be collected at four time
      points: baseline (6 months after completion of treatment)(T0) and then 9, 12, and 18months
      after completion of treatment (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Objective data will be assessed
      at the same time points. The mixed-model repeated measure ANOVA will be used to analyze the
      data. The investigators plan to recruit 30 subjects for each group.
