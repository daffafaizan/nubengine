      collaboration from all sites treating TTP patients. It has resulted in a cohort of data and
      samples from UK TTP cases. The registry promotes a collaborative approach with all UK
      patients and physicians involved with this life threatening disorder. The UK TTP registry has
      been used to provide information for highly specialist commissioning via NHS England and
      moving forward will be required to provide data relevant to the UK TTP Group and
      commissioners.

      University College London (UCL) Haemostasis Research Unit (HRU) will collect and collate the
      data and help administrate for those sites participating in the registry. However, ADAMTS13
      assays will no longer be subsidised. For those sites undertaking local assays, a record of
      cases will be shared centrally. The UK TTP registry will be part of the UK TTP Group.
