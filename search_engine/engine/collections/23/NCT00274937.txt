    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate, overall survival, and event-free survival of children with
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma who are treated with induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy and amifostine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma in children.

      II. Investigate the predictive value of the detection of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood of
      children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      III. Determine the incidence of NUT rearrangements in childhood nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      IV. Determine the radioprotective effect of amifostine when given daily prior to radiation
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      stage of disease (I or IIA [stratum I] vs IIB-IV [stratum II]).

      STRATUM I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Patients also receive
      amifostine subcutaneously on the same days they undergo radiotherapy.

      STRATUM II:

      INDUCTION THERAPY (weeks 1-9): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and
      fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or
      stable disease proceed to consolidation therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY (weeks 10-18): Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive amifostine as
      in stratum I. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 22 (2 courses).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.
