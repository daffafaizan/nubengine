    
      This study will assess exercise capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) before
      and after 8 weeks of voxelotor therapy.

      Patients with genetically severe forms of sickle cell disease, including Hgb SS, Hgb S beta 0
      thalassemia, Hgb SC Harlem, etc., age 12 or older, with stable Hgb and Hgb F will be
      recruited. Enrolled subjects will have study labs drawn, undergo baseline CPET in the
      exercise lab, then take voxelotor 1500mg daily for 2 months, followed by repeat study labs
      and a second CPET. Each subject's CPET results before and after voxelotor will be compared,
      and the study labs before and after voxelotor will be compared. Each subject will be compared
      to him/herself.
