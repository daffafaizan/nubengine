      hormone for iron. This specific profile is characterized by an elevated serum iron, an
      elevated transferrin saturation, and parenchymal damages of iron overload. This disease is
      not connected with known mutations of iron metabolism genes.

      The main objective of this study is the clinical, biological, genetic and functional
      characterization of rare iron overload phenotypes associated with hepcidin deficiency except
      C282Y homozygosity.
