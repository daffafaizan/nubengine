      evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce neuroplastic changes that
      modulate cognitive function. However, it is unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive
      trainings can facilitate cortical activity and physiological outcome measures and further
      influence on the cognitive function after stroke. We aim to investigate the effects of two
      hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and
      behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline. This study is a single-blind
      randomized controlled trial. A target sample size of 75 participants will be recruited.
      Stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline will be stratified by Mini-Mental State
      Examination scores and then randomized 1:1:1 to sequential exercise-cognitive training,
      dual-task exercise-cognitive training or control groups. All groups will undergo trainings 60
      min/day, 3 days/week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the resting-state
      functional connectivity and neural activation in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes include physiological biomarkers,
      cognitive functions, physical function, daily functions and quality of life.

      This study may differentiate the effects of two hybridized trainings on cognitive function
      and health-related conditions and detect appropriate neurological and physiological indices
      to predict training effects. This study capitalizes on the groundwork for non-pharmacological
      intervention of cognitive decline after stroke.
