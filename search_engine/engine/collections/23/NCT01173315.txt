    
      A total of 75 diabetic patients (39 men and 36 women), aged 36 to 69 years, having diabetes
      for at least 3 years, was recruited for this study. Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting
      plasma glucose 126 mg/dl (two times repeated) or taking oral glucose-lowering agents.Diabetic
      patients were stratified by sex and randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups
      using block randomization procedure. Depending upon the treatment groups, each subject
      received two capsules per day, 1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner, for a period of 4 months.
      Each capsule contained one of the following preparations and hence determined the
      corresponding groups: Group MV: Zinc sulfate and Magnesium oxide (providing 10 mg Zn and 125
      mg Mg) and vitamin C (100 mg) and vitamin E (100 mg); Group MVB: both of the above mineral
      and vitamin supplements plus vitamin B1 (5 mg), vitamin B2 (5 mg), vitamin B6 (5 mg), biotin
      (50 µg), vitamin B12 (5 µg) and folic acid (0.5 mg); Group P: starch (placebo). All of the
      study medications, including the placebo, were supplied by Pharmaceutical Sciences Research
      Center (Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran) and were indistinguishable from each
      other. They were stored at 20-25 0C.
