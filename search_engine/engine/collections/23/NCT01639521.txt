    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

      To estimate the difference in the rate of unacceptable toxicity for dose-dense methotrexate,
      vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) and gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) in the
      adjuvant treatment of urothelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      To compare rates of disease recurrence at 3 years between dose-dense MVAC and GC.

      To determine whether molecular markers excision repair cross-complementing-1 (ERCC-1)
      ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase M-1 (RRM-1), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) topoisomerase
      2-alpha (Top2A) and protein 53 (p53) can predict those patients more likely to benefit from
      chemotherapy.

      To investigate the potential utility of cytidine deaminase (CDA), ERCC-1, xeroderma
      pigmentosum group D (XPD), glutathione S-transferase P-1 (GSTP-1) and glutathione
      S-transferase M-1 (GSTM-1) as molecular markers which predict occurrence of significant
      toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy for urothelial cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride
      IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive methotrexate IV on day 1, vinblastine IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride
      IV, cisplatin IV on day 2 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 3. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
