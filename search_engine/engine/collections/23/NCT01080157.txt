      subjects will complete the study to determine the relative accuracy of SCOUT DS compared to
      the FPG and HbA1c tests in screening for abnormal glucose tolerance. All methods will be
      compared to the 2 hour value of the OGTT. An algorithm utilizes skin optical modeling as well
      as the spectral and blood assay data accumulated from the initial phase of the study to
      produce a risk score for abnormal glucose tolerance. This algorithm and the calculation of
      the score will be integrated into the SCOUT DS for prospective testing. The design requires
      three patient visits to the clinical site and up to a total of seven measurements on the
      SCOUT device.
