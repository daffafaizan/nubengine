      tract, has become the global incidence of third malignant tumors, including colorectal cancer
      proportion increased year by year. With the way of life of residents in our country, the
      adjustment of diet and aging progress, the incidence of colorectal cancer is rising the
      trend, and most patients have been found in advanced disease. Tumor metastasis is an
      important factor affecting the prognosis of colon cancer, liver metastasis, especially,
      including simultaneous liver metastases and delayed liver metastasis from colon cancer, about
      20% to 34% will appear at the same time of liver metastasis, about 40-50% of CRC patients
      died of liver metastasis at present, multi disciplinary team treatment to surgical treatment
      of the absolute dominance of the more and more attention, and benefit, but the optimum
      sequence of chemotherapy and surgery, is still unclear. The preoperative chemotherapy
      Potential advantages include: early treatment of micrometastasis; assessment of tumor
      response to chemotherapy (with prognostic value, contribute to the development of
      postoperative treatment plan); for those patients with early progression can avoid local
      treatment. Preoperative treatment of the potential disadvantages include: missed the surgery
      opportunity window period ", probably because in early stage of tumor progress, may also be
      because chemotherapy achieved complete remission and to determine the extent of resection
      surgery has become extremely difficult.2015 second edition of the NNCN guidelines that
      resectable metastatic disease initial resectable patients may be liver resection, adjuvant
      chemotherapy and postoperative; another alternative treatment mode is around perioperative
      chemotherapy (perioperative chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy). Therefore, gaps in
      the determination of the timing of chemotherapy is still the guide, worth exploring.

      I center to carry out laparoscopic resection of colon cancer has been more than ten years,
      the accumulated number of cases more than 1000 cases, with rich experience of colon cancer.
      Comprehensive treatment including surgery, oncology, Radiology, pathology, Department of
      radiotherapy, a number of departments, the Department of endoscopy MDT team, and won the
      outstanding team of Chinese Medical Doctor Association in 2016 MDT honor.

      This study used a prospective randomized method, evaluation of colon cancer with simultaneous
      resectable liver metastatic lesions and peri chemotherapy surgery after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy of two therapeutic schemes for short-term and long-term effect, is expected to
      summarize the prospective data to support the operation and chemotherapy
