      solitary pulmonary nodules from the Vanderbilt lung nodule evaluation clinic, including 30
      patients with COPD and 15 patients without COPD. Folate imaging will be performed with
      68Ga-EC2115 within one week prior to scheduled bronchoscopy or from 1 week to 6 months after
      scheduled bronchoscopy, which will be performed for clinical purposes. The unused portion of
      the bronchoalveolar lavage (not necessary for clinical purposes), will be interrogated to
      compare PET imaging with parameters of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In
      addition, PET imaging data will be compared with disease severity based on pulmonary function
      testing.
