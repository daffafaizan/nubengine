      about alcohol and drug use. Adolescents 12-18 who are coming to their doctor's office for a
      routine well-care or follow-up visit will be invited to participate in the study.
      Participants do not have to have ever used alcohol or drugs. All participants will answer a
      computerized questionnaire about alcohol and drug use three times. The first one will be at
      the time of a doctor's visit. The second time will be three months later and the third time a
      year later. Adolescents who agree to be in the study during the first year will be in the
      'control' group. Their doctor will talk to them about drugs and alcohol the same as he/she
      usually does for all his/her patients. Those who agree to be in the study during the second
      year will be in the 'intervention' group. Everyone in the 'intervention' group will receive
      some advice on the computer about their alcohol and drug use. Their doctor will also give
      them some specific advice about drug and alcohol use. The researchers have chosen what that
      advice will be, and all doctors involved in the study will give advice according to the study
      protocol. Participants and their parents will also be given educational information about
      alcohol and drugs. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing drug and
      alcohol use between those who are in the 'control' group, and those who are in the
      'intervention' group.

      We we will also validate the Czech version of the CRAFFT screen before conducting the
      effectiveness trial outlined above in the Czech Republic.
