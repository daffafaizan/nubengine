      treatment for multiple and superficial AKs. The main adverse event is the severe skin
      irritation leading to interruption of the treatment in some cases. In the last decade a
      superficial pulse-peeling using it as agent in sequential applications was described. This
      modality of treatment has been demonstrated efficacy and better tolerability.

      The improvement of the overall aspect of photodamaged skin is observed while treating
      multiple AKs.

      There are no comparative study between the two types of 5% 5-FU use. So that is the purpose
      of our clinical trial.
