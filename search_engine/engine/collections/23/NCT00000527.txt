      Following endarterectomy, platelets adhere and aggregate on the endarterectomized surface and
      release platelet-derived growth factor which induces smooth muscle cell migration and
      proliferation which may result in restenosis. Many patients had been treated with aspirin and
      dipyridamole, but not in a controlled trial. The Recurrent Carotid Stenosis Study established
      whether antiplatelet therapy was beneficial in the prevention of recurrent carotid artery
      stenosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind. Eighty-three patients (90 endarterectomies) were randomly assigned
      to receive 325 mg of oral aspirin plus 75 mg of dipyridamole, beginning 12 hours
      pre-operatively, followed by a second dose administered within eight hours after the
      operation, and given three times daily thereafter for one year. Eighty patients (85
      endarterectomies) received placebo. After the adequacy of the surgical procedure was
      confirmed by intraoperative angiography, restenosis at the endarterectomy sites was evaluated
      using serial duplex ultrasound before hospital discharge and at three-month intervals
      postoperatively for one year.
