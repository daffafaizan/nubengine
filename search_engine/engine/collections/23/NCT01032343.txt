      negative impact on human health. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight is the
      major aetiological factor in skin cancer initiation and progression. Human case-control
      studies have reported an inverse relationship between dietary fish or omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acid (PUFA) intake and occurrence of non-melanoma skin cancer. Omega-3 PUFA have the
      potential to reduce the risk of photocarcinogenesis primarily by their ability to reduce
      production of prostaglandin E2 and consequently photoimmunosuppression. To date, no studies
      have assessed the impact of omega-3 PUFA on skin photoimmunosuppression in humans.

      OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential of dietary omega-3 PUFA to protect against UVR-induced
      cutaneous immunosuppression in humans.

      STUDY DESIGN: A double-blind randomised controlled nutritional study in 64 healthy human
      volunteers with nickel sensitivity. Volunteers will receive 3 months dietary supplementation
      with either omega-3 PUFA (n=32) or gelatine (n=32) both provided in identical gelatine
      capsules.

      The aim is to quantify the influence of omega-3 PUFA on:

        1. UVR-induced suppression of clinical contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses

        2. UVR-induced modulation of epidermal Langerhans cell trafficking

        3. UVR-induced modulation of levels of immunoregulatory mediators
