      prospective protocol that included preoperative CRT and surgical treatment. All patients
      underwent pre-treatment work-up (clinical examination, pancolonoscopy with biopsy, total body
      CT scan, pelvic MRI, and whole body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scan). Eligible patients had
      primary resectable cT2-low lying-T3, N0-N1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, without evidence of
      disease in lateral lymph nodes. Additional eligibility criteria included performance status
      as well as liver, kidney, and bone marrow function that allowed for long-course CRT, older
      than 18 years, and no distant metastases.
