      delivery of a cytotoxic drug to C4.4.a-expressing tumor cells by means of a suitable
      antibody-drug conjugate. The subject population eligible for the current study will be those
      subjects with advanced malignancies known to express C4.4a, which are refractory to standard
      therapy or those without standard therapy or actively refusing any treatment, which would be
      regarded as standard and in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, experimental therapy
      with BAY1129980 may be beneficial.Depending on the number of dose-escalating steps and the
      occurrence of DLTs, the planned numbers of subjects could vary.It is expected that up to 90
      subjects may participate in the dose-expansion phase of the study and up to 6-9 subjects may
      particpate in the dose re-esclation phase.The study assessments in the expansion phase of the
      study are identical to those in the dose-escalation phase.

      Amendment # 3 includes changes to DLT criteria (hematological and non-hematological) and
      allows for frequent follow-up for subjects experiencing drug-related liver toxicity that
      warrants dose reduction or dose interruptions.
