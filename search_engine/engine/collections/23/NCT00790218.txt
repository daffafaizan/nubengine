    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in
      2 phases: a dose-escalation phase, to determine the MTD of CF102 and to evaluate its
      safety/tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary clinical activity; and a
      dose-confirmation phase, which will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD (ie, the RP2D)
      of CF102. Subjects will be treated with oral doses of CF102 in consecutive, 28-day cycles.
      The initial dose of CF102 will be 1 mg twice daily (BID), with subsequent escalations to 5
      and 25 mg BID, unless limited by toxicity. Subjects will be evaluated weekly for the first
      cycle, every 2 weeks for Cycles 2 and 3, and at the end of each subsequent cycle, up to 6
      cycles of CF102 treatment. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after
      completion of the last dose of study drug.
