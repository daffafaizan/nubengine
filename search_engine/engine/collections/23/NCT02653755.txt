      and effectiveness of an investigational treatment to learn whether it is appropriate for
      treating a specific disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain patients between the ages of 50 and
      75 can safely omit radiation treatment after having a lumpectomy.In this research study, the
      investigators are using standard laboratory tests along with the Prosigna test to see if
      certain patients can avoid radiation, without having a higher risk of the cancer coming back
      in the future.

      A portion of the participant surgical specimen will be prospectively maintained for future
      study using institutionally-approved tissue banking procedures.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has cleared the Prosigna test for generating
      a risk category and numerical score to assess the risk of distant recurrence, and has cleared
      us to investigate the use of the Prosigna test for helping with decisions about radiation.
