      increased medical costs, because it is related with atelectasis, lung collapse or pneumonia.
      The mechanism of diaphragm dysfunction is thought to be from not only direct injury to
      abdominal wall and viscera but inhibitory reflexes of phrenic activity. Thoracic or upper
      abdominal surgery is suggested as a risk factor of postoperative diaphragm dysfunction, and
      perioperative analgesic modality is also known to affect diaphragm movements. But there has
      been no trial to investigate the effect of laparoscopic pelvic surgery such as prostatectomy
      on diaphragm movement. Moreover, it is not clear if minimally invasive Robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has any influence on respiratory and diaphragm
      functions.
