    
      Study Activities and Population Group:

      Retrospective dates will be 3/1/06 through the approval date for the prospective component of
      this study. The data will be neurocognitive, depression, tumor-related, overall quality of
      life (QOL), treatment, and demographic variables. The investigators research aims are to

        -  compute correlations among these different variables

        -  to test significant predictors of QOL. The investigators also will conduct a
           retrospective review of all brain tumor patients evaluated at the neuropsychology clinic
           at the PRT-BTC from the date that this prospective study is approved back to 3/20/2006.

      Data Analysis and Risk/Safety Issues:

      The medical record review does not present any obvious source of risk or discomfort to
      patients and their families. For both the retrospective and prospective components of the
      study, as the data for the proposed study were already collected as a part of the standard of
      care at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, there are no additional risks to
      the study sample as a result of data collection.
