      Primary

        -  Compare the anti-tumor activity, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with
           metastatic or relapsed, unresectable uterine or soft tissue leiomyosarcoma treated with
           gemcitabine with vs without docetaxel as second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the response duration and overall survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability and dose intensity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine biological markers with a predictive value for response to these regimens in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to location of
      leiomyosarcoma (uterine vs soft tissue). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4
           weeks for 2-8 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel on day 8. Treatment
           repeats every 3 weeks for 2-8 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 80 patients (40 per stratum and treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study.
