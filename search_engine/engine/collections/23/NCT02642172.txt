    
      The study will include 60 patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which will
      randomize to two groups, receiving either ITF (Inulin/oligofructose-OFS 75/25) or
      maltodextrin (placebo).

      The trial will last for 26 weeks: Stage 1-Run-in period: Subjects will be followed to
      ascertain weight maintenance. Stage 2- Randomized intervention period: Subjects will be
      assigned to receive 16 gram/day of ITF or maltodextrin. Both ITF and placebo will be provided
      in identical opaque packages and both subjects and researchers will be blinded to the
      content.

      After signing informed (-2 week) consent, the following data will be collected: demographics,
      lifestyle habits including dietary questionnaires, and medical history. At week 0, week 12
      and week 24 all the following tests will be performed: Vital Signs: blood pressure,
      anthropometric measurements, body composition determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis
      (BIA). Biochemical blood tests: liver function tests fasting glucose insulin & lipid profile,
      CRP (an inflammation marker), SCFA, BCAA, and LBP and FGF 19. Fecal samples: fecal samples
      will be used for microbiota composition analysis, and BA analysis. Assessment of liver status
      At week 0 and 24 by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), SteatoTest and NashTest
      (FibroMaxâ„¢) and by liver enzymes for evaluating steohepatitis.
