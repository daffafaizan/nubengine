      Children's Hospital Feeding Scale. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and
      criterion validity of Turkish Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale will be
      investigated. The internal consistency will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated for
      test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the scale will be determined by assessing
      the correlation between the Turkish Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale and Behavioral
      Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale.
