    
      Background:

        -  Advanced mycosis fungoides, its leukemic form Sezary syndrome (MF/SS), and adult T- cell
           leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) are all aggressive mature T-cell malignancies which are
           considered incurable without an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

        -  Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated monoclonal antibody directed towards CCR4, a chemokine
           receptor expressed by the majority of MS/SS and ATLL cells. It is approved by the United
           States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsed MF/SS, and is recommended
           by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for treatment of ATLL.

        -  Defucosylation of mogamulizumab is thought to enhance its capacity for antibody-
           dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells and
           macrophages.

        -  The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory
           cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and
           long- term CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several phase I trials in cancer
           patients.

        -  Concomitant administration of rhIL-15 with mogamulizumab may further enhance the ADCC
           capacity of the antibody and result in improved efficacy for patients with CCR4-
           expressing cancers.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard
      intravenous (IV) mogamulizumab treatment

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed mycosis fungoides/S(SqrRoot)(Copyright)zary
           syndrome or adult T- cell leukemia/lymphoma relapsed after or refractory to at least one
           line of systemic treatment.

        -  Adequate organ and marrow function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase I study

        -  Standard "3 + 3" design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with
           fixed dose of mogamulizumab, with an expansion cohort at the MTD

        -  Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycles) of combination therapy

        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, and
           to account for unevaluable patients the accrual ceiling will be set at 20 patients.
