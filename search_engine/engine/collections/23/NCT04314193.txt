      Symptom burden is high, and quality of life (QoL) and social participation are negatively
      affected. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, treatment is recommended in case of
      significant symptoms and/or impaired or deteriorating lung function. Evidence-based treatment
      recommendations are limited, outdated and largely based on expert opinion.

      Prednisone is currently the first-choice therapy in pulmonary sarcoidosis and leads to
      short-term improvement of lung function. Unfortunately, prednisone has major side-effects and
      is associated with impaired QoL. Methotrexate is presently considered second-line therapy,
      and appears to have fewer side-effects. The investigators hypothesize that first-line
      treatment with methotrexate is as effective as prednisone, with fewer side-effects and better
      QoL.
