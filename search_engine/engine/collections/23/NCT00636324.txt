      extubation failure and as treatment of other pulmonary diseases. An upsurge in its popularity
      has resulted in some controversial aspects, including the level of pressure to be used. The
      level that has been used in very preterm infants after extubation, which mostly came from
      anecdotal data, varies from 3 to 10 cmH2O.

      Physiologic studies show higher nCPAP pressures improve lung mechanical properties. Though
      potential side effects have been of concern in practical application, there is no formal
      evidence supporting the concept that increased CPAP pressure results in a higher risk of
      complications. In relatively stable preterm infants, the range of optimal CPAP level needs to
      be established in order to adequately support the upper airway and lungs, without increasing
      complications secondary to the pressure applied. Given the uncertainty of the nCPAP pressure
      that should be used in very preterm infants, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      compare the effectiveness of two ranges of nCPAP pressure for post-extubation support in very
      preterm infants.

      The purpose of this trial is to compare the rate of successful extubation of using the nasal
      CPAP level of 7 to 9 cmH2O compared to level of 4 to 6 cmH2O.
