      genetic counseling that can both inform the practice of prenatal genetic counseling and serve
      as the springboard to a later, more comprehensive study. The research participants will all
      be practicing prenatal genetic counselors recruited from regional meetings and a national
      meeting of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Participating genetic counselors will
      be asked to perform a prenatal genetic counseling session with a simulated client (an actor)
      or simulated clients (actor and actor posing as spouse) presenting with the indication of
      advanced maternal age. The participating genetic counselors will also be asked to address
      cystic fibrosis carrier testing within the course of this session. This session will be
      videotaped. In addition, both the genetic counselor and simulated client will be asked to
      fill out questionnaires related to characteristics of the counselor and the session itself.
      The process and content of the genetic counseling communication will be analyzed
      qualitatively and quantitatively (using Roter Interaction Analysis System). Through these
      analyses, we hope to both describe the nature of prenatal genetic counseling communication in
      a relatively large sample and to determine the ways in which a variety of client and
      counselor factors affect the communication process itself (determined through changes in the
      RIAS communication codes). In addition, we hope to provide information on the logistics of
      data collection in order to inform a similar larger study planned to look at the impact of
      communication on client outcomes.
