      post-stroke, with a motor problems in the lower extremity will be able to walk and move the
      affected leg better after 30 treatments with a new robotic therapy device, the AMES device.
      The device rotates the ankle while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that
      move the ankle. Testing will be done before, during and after the treatments to determine
      response to the therapy.
