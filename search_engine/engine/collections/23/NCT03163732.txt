      collected tumor sample.

      For each patient, the tumor genomics data will be reviewed, at time of documented progressive
      disease, independently by a dedicated MTB to make a recommendation of therapy for a given
      patient based on its molecular profile. First, the genomics data issued from the panel
      defined by the randomization will be reviewed and recommended therapy resulting from
      randomization will be revealed to the Investigator. If a recommended therapy can be
      identified, this therapy will be recommended.

      If none recommended therapy can be identified, the 2nd panel performed will then be reviewed.

      In case of confirmed clinical or radiological progression (at Investigator's discretion)
      and/or unacceptable toxicity as per Investigator judgment during the line of therapy
      recommended by the MTB, the results of the second panel will be reviewed by MTB. Based on all
      genomics data available (i.e. randomized and 2nd panels), the MTB will recommend other
      treatment options. All results will be disclosed to Investigator in order to offer other
      treatment options.
