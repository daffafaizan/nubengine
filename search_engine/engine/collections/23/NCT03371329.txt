      escalation study entitled "A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety and Feasibility of
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy in Patients with Recent Intracerebral Hemorrhage". This study
      will be performed under this current IND application and will be limited to the proposed 12
      subjects (3 IV and 1 IT dose groups).

      In this application the investigators are proposing to evaluate safety and feasibility of
      allogeneic, bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to induce
      neuroregeneration, improve neurological function and alleviate inflammation.
