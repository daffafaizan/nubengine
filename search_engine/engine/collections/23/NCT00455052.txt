      (1 Cycle). Blood sampling for PK analyses will be performed immediately prior to dosing, and
      9 times after dosing. Patients will be assessed for toxicities known to occur with other
      drugs of this class, such as bone marrow suppression, elevated liver function enzymes,
      hemorrhagic cystitis, and diarrhea. Tumor imaging will be performed every 2 cycles.
