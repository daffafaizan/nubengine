      People 2010 leading health indicators. Despite the body of evidence showing the adverse
      effects of in-utero and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke products (TSP) and environmental
      tobacco smoke (ETS) to the respiratory health in children, studies continue to be needed to
      elucidate when TSP exposure causes the greatest damage, possible mechanisms that underlie the
      damage, and how harm to the respiratory system of infants and vulnerable children can be
      prevented. and, while some efforts to reduce prenatal and childhood ETS exposure over the
      past decade have been successful, there is a paucity of randomized, controlled, intervention
      studies in the literature targeting ETS exposure reduction among infants age 0-12 months.
      Moreover, the effectiveness of ETS exposure prevention interventions in reducing the
      occurrence or severity of health symptoms and outcomes has rarely been systematically
      evaluated.
