      Patients that are scheduled for a single-level L4-S1 discectomy and who meet the
      pre-operative eligibility criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients that
      meet all intraoperative criteria will be enrolled into the study and treated with lumbar
      discectomy and additional annular closure device implantation. All enrolled subjects will be
      followed for at least 12 months.
