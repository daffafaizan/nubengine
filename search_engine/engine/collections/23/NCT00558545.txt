      cause of cancer death, and the main cause of death in women ages 45 to 55. In 2006, 212,920
      American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,970 will die from this
      disease.[1]. Fewer than 10 percent of women present with metastatic disease at the time of
      diagnosis. However, the majority of women who relapse after initial definitive therapy for
      early stage or locally advanced disease will do so with disseminated metastatic disease
      rather than an isolated local recurrence. Treatment for metastatic disease is palliative in
      intent and will usually involve hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy with or without
      trastuzumab. Active chemotherapy agents include anthracyclines, taxanes, vinorelbine,
      alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Taxanes have become the cornerstone of first-line
      treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Weekly doses of paclitaxel can be administered
      continuously for several weeks with a remarkable lack of myelosuppression [2]. Weekly
      paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) was directly compared to every three-week therapy (175 mg/m2) in 585
      women with metastatic breast cancer. Weekly therapy was associated with a significantly
      higher response rate (40 versus 28 percent) and longer TTP (nine versus five months), but
      similar overall survival and worse neurotoxicity [3]. Since patients with metastatic breast
      cancer are unlikely to be cured of their disease [4], they should be considered candidates
      for a clinical trial.
