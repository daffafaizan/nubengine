      indicated for use with the EMED detrusanTM 500 electrical generator for the treatment of
      overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence (UI) in women who are not satisfied with or
      cannot tolerate other conservative treatments. EMED is interested in conducting a prospective
      randomized multi-center study of IVES therapy vs conventional UI treatments. In order to gain
      sufficient knowledge of the treatment effect and variability of IVES therapy to power an RCT,
      a pilot study will be initially conducted.

      The pilot study is intended to show the efficacy of IVES in treating overactive bladder with
      or without frequency and/or urgency urinary incontinence with safety profile of IVES being no
      worse than with standard urological catheters.

      A primary endpoint at 3 months showing reduction in incontinence events via a 7-level patient
      global impression of improvement will be established. Secondary endpoints will include PCI
      for subsets of symptoms, 3 day voiding diary, and patient satisfaction questionnaires.

      Follow up at end of therapy and 3 months from the first therapy session will be conducted.
      6-month, 9-month, and 12-month follow up can be conducted to establish durability of IVES
      therapy if it is found to be effective at 3 months after the first treatment
