      I. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of dasatinib in all patients (i.e., stages 1B and 2
      combined) with recurrent/progressive glioblastoma (GBM) as measured by 6-month
      progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of dasatinib for stage 1B patients with
      recurrent/progressive GBM as measured by a hybrid endpoint of 6-month progression-free
      survival OR objective response of (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) rate.

      II. To determine patient overall survival. III. To determine the toxicity of dasatinib in the
      treatment of patients with GBM.

      IV. To determine radiographic response rate to treatment. V. To determine patient
      progression-free survival. VI. To explore molecular correlates of clinical outcome. VII. To
      explore pharmacokinetic correlates of dosing, toxicity, and efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
