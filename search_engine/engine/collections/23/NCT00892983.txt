    
      We plan on undertaking a 4-arm randomised controlled trial to test the following hypotheses:

        1. That anticipatory guidance and extra education and support in infancy around weaning and
           decreasing/avoiding television watching will delay the timing of introduction of solid
           foods, will be associated with more successful introduction of nutrient dense foods with
           appropriate portion size and decrease small screen exposure leading to a lower number of
           children with excessive weight velocity in infancy and early childhood.

        2. That anticipatory guidance, education and extra support around the early development of
           infant sleeping patterns will decrease sleep problems, increase infant sleeping time,
           decrease arousals at night and lower sleep latency which will in turn influence rate of
           early infant weight gain.

        3. That interventions 1 and 2 will interact additively with regard to infant and early
           childhood weight gain.

        4. That intervention 2 will lead to lower rates of maternal depression and increased family
           well being.
