    
      Screening Period Subjects will provide a written informed consent during Screening Visit 1.
      They will be scheduled to return to the clinic 10 days prior to randomization for Screening
      Visit 2. At this visit, a CGM sensor will be placed with appropriate instructions by the
      study team for a 10-day blinded CGM data collection by the site. Subjects will then return to
      the clinic after 10 days (± 1-day) for removal of the CGM sensor. The subjects will be
      randomized to one of the three arms of the study treatment.

      3.1.2 26-Week Double-Blind Treatment Period After the Screening Period, subjects will be
      randomized to 26 weeks of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. In a double-blind, double dummy
      randomization scheme, subjects will either receive ORMD-0801 administered once-daily at night
      (1 x 8 mg capsule between 8 PM to 12 Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner); or
      ORMD-0801 8 mg (1 x 8 mg capsule) administered twice daily, each morning approximately 45
      minutes (±15 minutes) prior to breakfast and each night prior to bedtime (between 8 PM to 12
      Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner) or matching placebo. Subjects will receive 1
      capsule approximately 45 minutes (±15 minutes) prior to breakfast and 1 capsule between 8 PM
      to 12 Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner.

      During the Double-Blind Treatment Period commencing at Week 0 (Visit 1, CGM removal),
      subjects will return to the clinic at the following intervals: Week 6 - Visit 2; Week 12 -
      Visit 3; Week 18 -Visit 4; Week 24 - Visit 5 (10 days (± 1-day) prior to Week 26 for CGM
      application) and Week 26 - Visit 6 (CGM removal and end of Double-Blind Treatment Period
      visit).

      The visit requiring CGM application will occur 10 days prior to the CGM removal visit within
      ± 1-day window.

      3.1.3 26-Week Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period Following the completion of the
      Double-Blind Treatment Period, subject will enter a 26-week Double-Blind Treatment Extension
      Period. Subjects previously randomized to placebo during the Double-Blind Treatment Period
      will be randomized to receive either ORMD-0801 8 mg QD or 8 mg BID for the duration of the
      Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period. Subjects previously randomized to 8 mg QD or 8 mg
      BID during the Double-Blind Treatment Period will remain in the same treatment arm for the
      duration of the Double-Blind Treatment Extension Period. The Extension Period treatment
      assignments will remain blinded for the duration of the study.
