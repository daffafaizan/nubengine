    
      The study is a controlled, double blind, prospective, randomized and performed at Sahlgrenska
      University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden. The injectant mixture consists of 300 mg ropivacaine
      mixed with 30 mg ketorolac and 0.5 mg epinephrine. Total volume of the solution is 156 ml.
      The normal saline injection is used in the control group in the same manner as in the LIA
      group. The parameters which would be evaluated are consumption of morphine, pain intensity
      and side effects.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether local infiltration analgesia (LIA) into the
      operating field will reduce morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours in
      patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy (AH).

      Secondary end-points are pain intensity, incidence of nausea and vomiting, sedation
      intensity.
