      or progressive high-grade glioma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these
      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine
      the response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine IV over 1-4 hours on
      days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      taurolidine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
