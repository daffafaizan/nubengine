      referred to the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Sunnybrook hospital. During
      initial consultation with the hand surgeon, treatment is chosen. Patients are follow-up with
      their hand surgeon at 4-, 8-, and 12--week intervals.

      Supportive splinting: Patient's are given a removable plaster/fiberglass splint with a tensor
      bandage underneath.

      Behavioral Modifications: Patients are not splinted, but provided a tensor bandage. Patients
      are instructed on specific behaviours to prevent movement of the injured part of the hand.

      The purpose of the study is to compare pain and short-term hand function in patients who
      undergo supportive splinting compared to patients who undergo behavioral modifications
      treatment only to see which option is associated with shorter functional recovery and which
      option is associated with less pain during the first 4 weeks after initial treatment.

      On follow-up appointments at 4, 8,and 12 weeks, as well as initial consultation with the hand
      surgeon, participants will be asked to perform a grip strength test with a Jamal Hydraulic
      hand Dynanometer. Participants will be asked to fill out a Brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire
      along with the grip strength test as well as quick demographics survey at initial
      consultation with the hand surgeon. After the 12-week follow up appointment, study
      participation will end.

      If a patient is unable to follow-up with the hand surgeon, the Brief Michigan Hand
      Questionnaire will be done via phone whenever is most convenient for the patient. It's
      anticipated that about 40 people will participate in this study at a single centre in
      Toronto.
