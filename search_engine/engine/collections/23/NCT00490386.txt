      patients having their first acute alcohol induced pancreatitis (AAIP) when compared to
      subjects with similar alcohol use but no history of pancreatitis. This subject has not been
      studied in humans until now. Therefore we seek to study, with a larger material, wether AAIP
      is associated with lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, by measuring the antibodies
      against Helicobacter pylori from the sera of AAIP patients and from a control group of
      alcoholics with no history of AAIP.
