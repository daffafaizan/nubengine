      underlie the beneficial effects seen among cancer patients who pray. It will evaluate the
      effect of prayer on humoral (including biochemical/physiological inflammatory/immune)
      parameters, monitor changes in cancer related biomarkers and evaluate the effect of prayer on
      blood pressure, quality of life, health and dietary habits in relation to prayer activities,
      using validated questionnaires.
