    
      Primary objective:

      Determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide
      combined with dexamethasone in subjects with previously- treated light-chain (AL)-amyloidosis

      Secondary objectives:

      Determine the following at the MTD:

        -  Hematological complete (CR) very good partial (VGPR) and partial (PR) rates

        -  duration of response

        -  organ response

        -  Time-to-event

        -  Survival

      Exploratory study objective:

      To investigate the relationship of changes in the levels of the biomarkers B-type natriuretic
      peptide (BNP) and troponin I to frequency of specific adverse events and the occurrence of
      DLT
