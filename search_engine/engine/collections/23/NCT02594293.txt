      required. Therefore, NUC resistance is an important clinical risk resulting from long-term
      therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) management. Discontinuation of NUC is a feasible
      strategy to reduce resistance. However, the high rate of relapse after cessation of NUC
      treatment in CHB patients remains a big problem. NUC treatment of how to safely stop drug
      needs to be solved.

      Peg-IFN can clear HBV by direct anti-viral and immune regulation mechanisms including
      enhancing natural killer cell response, increased cluster of differentiation 8(CD8 +) T
      lymphocytes and other mechanisms to restore and enhance the immune response in patients with
      CHB. Response to PEG-IFN is frequently sustained after a finite treatment course due to its
      immune modulating capacity.
