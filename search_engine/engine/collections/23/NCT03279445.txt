      which will not require seeing the patients or conducting assessments in the clinic space. The
      second portion will involve clinical assessment and blood drawl at routine clinic visit.

      The investigators will focus on African American PD patients who have access to health
      insurance and are from a similar geographic location as white PD patients. Among these two
      populations, demographics and socioeconomic status will be compared. Disease features, such
      as the duration after the onset to have the first visit, severity of the disease at the first
      visit, compliance in follow-up, co-morbidity rates, and milestones of the disease progression
      (aspiration pneumonia, wheelchair bound, nursing home, death, etc.) will also be assessed.
      Socioeconomic status will also be factored into the analysis. The investigators will also
      compare information from the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's
      Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Schwab and England
      Activities of Daily Living (SEADL).

      The genetic differences between blacks and whites with PD are poorly understood and studied.
      As such, the investigators will also be collecting blood samples at patients' follow-up
      visits for future genetic analysis, such as mutations in the LRRK2 and GBA genes and even
      GWAS study, to see if there are significant differences in the genetic profiles of African
      American and Caucasian PD patients that account for the low PD prevalence rate in the black
      population
