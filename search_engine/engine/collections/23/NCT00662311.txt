      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat when administered in
      combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced
      NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of vorinostat when administered in combination with
      paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

      II. To determine the radiological response rate, by computed tomography (CT) scan, of
      vorinostat when administered in combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in
      patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

      III. To describe the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of this
      regiment over 3 years of follow up.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD), 5 days a week and paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once a week. Patients also undergo radiation therapy QD, 5
      days a week. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
