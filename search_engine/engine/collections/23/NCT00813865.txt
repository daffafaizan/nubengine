      type 1 Gaucher disease who successfully completed Study GAU-CL-202 (NCT00446550).
      Participants could enter the study immediately upon completion of participation in the
      lead-in study GAU-CL-202, or at any later time point. Participants received 225 milligram
      (mg) afegostat tartrate, administered orally for 30 months, and remained in 1 of the 2
      randomized treatment regimens of Study GAU-CL-202: afegostat tartrate once daily (QD) for 3
      consecutive days, then no afegostat tartrate for 4 consecutive days (consecutive
      3-days-on/4-days-off) or QD for 7 consecutive days, then no afegostat tartrate for 7 days
      (consecutive 7-days-on/7-days-off). Amendment 2 removed the 7-days-on/7-days-off regimen and
      added an alternative 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen: afegostat tartrate QD on Monday,
      Wednesday, and Friday, then no afegostat tartrate on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday
      (MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off). Once Amendment 2 was implemented at a site, participants assigned
      to the 7-days-on/7-days-off regimen switched to a 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen; those on the
      original 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen could switch to the MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen.
      Amendment 4 removed the original 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen and any participants still on
      that regimen switched to the MWF 3-days-on/4-days-off regimen. Study visits occurred every 3
      months for 30 months. Participants were contacted approximately 1, 3, and 6 months after the
      end of treatment (EOT) or early termination for follow-up assessments.
