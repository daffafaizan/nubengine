      3 formulations of GSK's MenACWY conjugate vaccine will be administered in a double-blind
      manner, while the 4th one will be single-blinded. Administration of the candidate vaccine or

      will be conducted in two stages: The primary vaccination phase (Study Stage 1) of the study
      will include all subjects; the second (booster/persistence) phase of the study (Study Stage
      2) will include subjects in the active control groups and in the group which was primed with
      the selected MenACWY formulation.

      The study will be conducted in a double-blind manner for groups receiving formulations A, B,
      C and in single blind manner with respect to the group receiving formulation D. The control
      vaccines will be administered in an open manner with respect to the investigational
      vaccination regimens.

      Each group will have one blood sample prior to and one blood sample one month after the first
      vaccine dose.
