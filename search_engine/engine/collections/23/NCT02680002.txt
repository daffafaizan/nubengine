      immunogenicity of 2 doses of long-term stored inactivated monovalent influenza A/Vietnam/H5N1
      virus vaccine administered intramuscularly with or without MF59 adjuvant in healthy males and
      nonpregnant females, aged 18 to 49 years, inclusive. This study is designed to assist in
      stockpile management and will assess the usability of long-term stored H5N1 antigen (ie,
