    
      50 lean and 50 patients with obesity between 20 and 55 years old (50% women and 50% men),
      will be recruited. After an evaluation of their body composition by impedance meter, and of
      their dietary status by questionnaires (TFEQ/DEBQ), they will be asked to perform twice the
      same experimental sessions. They will be asked during this session to arrive at 08:00 am
      after a 12-hour fast and will receive a calibrated breakfast. Before and after a lunch
      calibrated meal, they will be asked to perform the French version of the computerized
      questionnaire LFPQ. Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals.
