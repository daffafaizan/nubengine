    
      The study consists of an open-label, safety run-in to confirm the safety of Itacitinibin
      combination with erlotinib in subjects with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent whose tumors have EGFR activating mutations.
      Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label Itacitinib and erlotinib.

      In the second part of the study, subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      erlotinib (open-label) and either Itacitinib or placebo in a blinded manner. The dose of
      Itacitinib administered will be determined from the data produced in the safety run-in phase.

      Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Subjects will take erlotinib tablets daily
      and Itacitinib/placebo will be self-administered daily during the entire cycle.
