      consisting of a combination of mobility exercises joint, muscle stretching, strength
      training, motor coordination exercises, unilateral and bilateral motor tasks as well as
      oriented tasks training upper limb with a focus on functional tasks. The other groups will
      receive additional intervention consisting of aiming movement practice according two
      different protocols: discrete movements to targets placed in different directions and
      distances; and rhythmic movements also to targets placed in different directions and
      distances. Both additional interventional interventions will be conducted for 30 minutes over
      a 5 week-period (total: 10 sessions).

      Clinical outcomes (motor control), functional and kinematic will be collected at baseline and
      at five weeks. Functional results will be collected at the beginning, after 5 weeks and 3
      months after randomization. Data will be collected by a blinded assessor on patients'
      allocation group. All statistical analyzes will be carried out following the principles of
      intention to treat analysis and differences between groups will be performed using linear
      mixed models.
