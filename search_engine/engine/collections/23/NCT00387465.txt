      I. To assess safety, characterize toxicities, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      5-AZA (azacitidine) with a fixed-dose of entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine the objective response rate of
      5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with
      recurrent NSCLC.

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-AZA and entinostat on deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) methylation, histone acetylation, and gene re-expression in patients with recurrent
      NSCLC through analysis of blood, sputum and tissue biopsies.

      III. To explore the effect of 5-AZA and entinostat on progression-free and overall survival
      in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      IV. To explore the differing response rates and progression-free survivals of two schedules
      of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by an
      open-label, phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally
      (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
