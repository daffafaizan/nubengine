      frequency TMS protocol is efficient in the treatment of the Negative Symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

      Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that hypoactivity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (LDLPFC) was associated with negative symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesize that iTBS applied to LDLPFC will improve negative symptoms and
      will improve activity of the LDLPFC measured with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).
