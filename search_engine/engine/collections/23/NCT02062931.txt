      and injected in the ovaries through laparoscopy. Endometrial fractional biopsy was taken,
      stained with H&E stain and by IH staining by stem cell marker OCT4. Immunohistochemical
      expression of stem cell marker OCT4 was evaluated before and after transplantation according
      to Edessy Stem Cell Scoring (ESS). Participants were followed up monthly for a period of six
      months by hormonal (FSH, LH and E2), clinical (resuming menstruation), US (folliculometry),
      histopathological (HP), and IH expression of stem cell marker OCT4 of the endometrial biopsy
      (stem cell positivity according to ESS) outcome.
