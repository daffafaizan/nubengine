      investigated. The objective of the study is to determine the readability of PPG and
      single-lead ECG measurements, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG, and investigate
      whether additional information positively impacts the readability of PPG. Medical
      professionals (cardiologists and cardiology residents), blinded for the patients'
      characteristics and history, are instructed to separately analyse the following signals,
      obtained from 30 patients.

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram and Poincaré

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram, Poincaré, and algorithm interpretation

        -  30 outputs with single-lead ECG waveforms

        -  30 outputs with 12-lead ECG waveforms

      Participants report the results of the qualitative analysis via a digital questionnaire with
      multiple-choice questions. Medical professionals classify each rhythm trace as regular
      rhythm, one or more ectopic/missed heartbeats, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation,
      unreadable, or other. The tachogram, Poincaré, and the algorithm interpretation are
      subsequently added to investigate whether the additional information improves the readability
      of PPG. Based on the provided answers, the study team will determine the readability of PPG
      and single-lead ECG analysis interpretation, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG
      diagnosis.
