      function. The pupillary light reflex is one of the few objective indicators of afferent input
      from the retina and optic nerve. Since the pupillary light reflex is processed through the
      retina, it may be used to assess visual integrity (1). Pupillometry is a reliable technology
      capable of providing repetitive data on quantitative pupillary function in states of health
      and disease (2). Amplitude, latency, maximum constriction velocity, mean constriction
      velocity, and dilation velocity are measured using the Neuroleptics pupillometer. The effects
      of varying levels of ambient light on these parameters of the pupillary response have not
      been extensively studied. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of
      varying luminescent levels on the pupillary response.
