      active surveillance after orchiectomy, with relapses occurring in 15-20% of patients. The
      majority of relapses occur in the lymph nodes as lymphogenic spread is the dominant route of
      dissemination. A sentinel node procedure, in which the sentinel lymph node is resected and
      pathologically examined, could be more reliable to identify patients who are likely to
      relapse.

      Early identification of patients with micro-metastases in the sentinel node makes it possible
      to treat these patients at the earliest possible moment. Absence of metastases could lead in
      the future to a less intensive follow up protocol than the present one.
