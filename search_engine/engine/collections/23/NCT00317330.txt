      effectiveness for two TB prevention strategies on the community incidence of TB: DOTS versus
      Enhanced DOTS (DOTS-Ampliado, or DOTS-A). DOTS-A will add intensive screening of household
      contacts of active TB cases and the provision of TB treatment or prophylaxis as needed to the
      standard DOTS regimen. Adult contacts in the DOTS-A communities will be offered enrollment
      into a randomized clinical trial comparing rifapentine/isoniazid preventive therapy to
      rifampin/pyrazinamide. Subjects will be recruited from TB cases identified for treatment at
      the Health Clinics of eight urban communities. These communities will be matched and randomly
      assigned to receive either DOTS or DOTS-A strategy. The change in the incidence of TB in the
      two groups of communities will be measured after a 4-year period to determine whether DOTS-A
      strategy significantly reduces the incidence of TB compared to DOTS alone.
