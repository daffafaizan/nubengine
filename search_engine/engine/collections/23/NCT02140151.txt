    
      This is a multicenter, prospectively randomized, masked and controlled, interventional
      investigator sponsored phase I/II study of subjects with high-risk nonexudative age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab quarterly for prophylaxis of
      conversion to exudative age-related macular degeneration.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy with ranibizumab to prevent the
      development of exudative AMD in eyes with high-risk nonexudative AMD. In addition, baseline
      characteristics of high-risk eyes (fundus features, optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      parameters and genetic profile) will be evaluated to determine their predictive value in
      conversion to exudative AMD. The effect of ranibizumab on the atrophic component of AMD will
      also be monitored.
