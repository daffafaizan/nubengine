    
      This is a single ascending dose study that examines the safety and tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of single doses of LY3009385
      administered subcutaneously to healthy participants. The planned dose levels are 0.3, 1, 3,
      9, 27, and 54 milligrams (mg). Within each dose level, participants are randomized to receive
      either LY3009385 or Placebo.

      Adjustments to the dose levels were permitted after review of emerging safety, PK, and
      glycemic data.

      The actual LY3009385 dose levels tested during this study were 0.3, 1, 3, 9, 22, and 54 mg.
