      induced by the contiguous pneumonia. It has been demonstrated that exposure of pleural
      mesothelial cells to bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to increased release of
      angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin
      (IL)-8, which induce vascular hyperpermeability, fluid exudation, and neutrophil influx into
      the pleural space, and may play a pivotal role in development of PPE. With persistent
      inflammation and angiogenesis, amplified vascular and mesothelial permeability leads to
      increased plasma extravasation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and repression of
      fibrinolytic activity within the pleural cavity, which contribute to the development of a
      ''complicated'' PPE, manifested with fibrin deposition and pleural fluid loculation. Fibrin
      turnover in the pleural cavity is greatly affected by fibrinolytic activity mediated by
      plasmin, which is regulated mainly by the equilibrium between plasminogen activators (PAs)
      and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs).VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability and may
      facilitate the genesis of fibrin gel in PPE. Previous studies reported that VEGF plays a role
      in the modulation of tPA and PAI-1, and that anti-VEGF antibody attenuates pleurodesis
      induced by transforming growth factor-Î²2. These findings suggest that VEGF may be involved in
      the regulation of fibrin turnover, fluid loculation and tissue fibrosis in the pleural space.
      Enhanced procoagulant and depressed fibrinolytic activities have been observed in PPE.
      However, the relationship between angiogenic cytokines and fibrinolytic activity in PPE
      remains unclear.
