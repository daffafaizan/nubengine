      differentiation process of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, we explored the
      hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage matrix can promote chondrogenesis of MSCs. Cartilage
      matrix was harvested from the health-like parts of osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. Cartilage
      fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted
      subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis showed a round and elongated cell
      appearance with positive Alcian blue staining of cartilage matrix formation in the
      constructs. However, the cells in fibrin glue only were condensed like MSCs in pellet
      culture. Immunohistochemical staining was abundantly positive for type II collagen in
      neo-cartilage regions of cartilage fragment-fibrin glue-MSC constructs, while the constructs
      without cartilage fragments were negative in staining for type II collagen. The gene
      expressions of type II collagen in the constructs with 60 mg fragments were significantly
      elevated after 4 weeks of implantation. Conversely, constructs without cartilage fragments
      failed to express type II collagen, which indicated that MSCs could not differentiate into a
      chondrogenic lineage. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effects of osteoarthritic cartilage
      matrix in promoting chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. This was a favorable method without
      exogenous growth factors induction.
