      colorectal and kidney cancers, a prospective enrollment will be done for patients who have
      consented to the study. A retrospective enrollment will be done for patients with liver
      cancer only and who have consented to a national biological resource center form with genetic
      study approval.

      The tumor samples will be taken during surgery. Blood and tumors samples will be taken as
      part of the treatment.

      In case of a accidental germline discovery a management by a genetic consulting will be
      proposed.
