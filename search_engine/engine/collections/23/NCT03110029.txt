      for toenail onychomycosis. This study will examine the compatibility of topical efinaconazole
      and nail polish in patients with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO). It is
      hypothesized that the treatment of DLSO with efinaconazole 10% solution will not be adversely
      affected by the application of nail polish.
