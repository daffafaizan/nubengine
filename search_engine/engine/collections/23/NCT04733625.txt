      fatalities worldwide. Vitamin D plays an essential role in the immune system. Vitamin D
      interferes with the majority of the immune systems cells such as macrophages, B and T
      lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. We aim to find whether supplementation of
      vitamin D deficient diabetes with a single intramuscular cholecalciferol injection could
      improve the prognosis of those patients.

      Patients and Methods: This was a placebo controlled randomized prospective study, included
      cohorts of 40 diabetes elderly patients who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with 16
      elderly diabetes patients matched of the same age group who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 but
      given a placebo instead intramuscularly were used as a control. Clinical, laboratory,
      treatment, and outcome data were recorded after six weeks of follow up especially ICU
      admissions and fate of COVID-19 disease.Vitamin D was given as a single intramuscular
      injection during period of the study.
