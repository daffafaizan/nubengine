      Tufts-New England Medical Center and Imperial College, UK. It is a population based
      cross-sectional study using a 2-stage cluster design. The study would be performed on 650
      adult subjects from the general population in Karachi.

      A new GFR equation specific to a Pakistani population would be developed and validated using
      the gold standard of measured Insulin GFR. The performance of the new equation will be
      compared to the existing ones developed in other populations with respect to bias, precision,
      and accuracy.

      The project is likely to contribute significantly to moving the field to kidney disease
      forward, and its results are likely to have far reaching implications for understanding of
      CKD and, ultimately, its prevention in Indo-Pakistani populations worldwide.
