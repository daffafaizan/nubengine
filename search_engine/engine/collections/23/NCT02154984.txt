      I. Feasibility of fostering adherence to self-monitoring of dietary intake using a smartphone
      application (app).

      II. Feasibility of the goal of following a time-restricted diet.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify potential molecular biomarkers and/or signatures to explore its efficacy for the
      normalization of metabolism.

      II. Assess the systemic endocrine effects of a time restricted diet (tRD) intervention in
      overweight and obese pre and postmenopausal women.

      III. Assess weight change following a tRD intervention. IV. Evaluate the effects of a tRD
      intervention, and identify a specific and reproducible genomic signature, in breast samples
      obtained by random fine needle aspiration in the tRD study population.

      V. Assess the volume of parenchymal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants follow a time restricted diet, which restricts daily eating to an 8 hour time
      window between 12:00-8:00 pm. Participants are allowed to consume non-caloric beverages
      (water, black tea, black coffee, diet soda, etc.) during the fasting hours and required to
      record daily food consumption in the smartphone app for 6 months. Participants are also
      coached by telephone over approximately 10-15 minutes weekly for 1 month and then biweekly
      for 5 months.

      After completion, participants are followed up for 3 months.
