      patients originated from 10 centers will be included over a period of 12 months and follow-up
      for 24 months. All patients have an external evaluation at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. They were
      randomized into the usual treatment group (unknown sST2 level) or the interventional
      treatment group, for whom sST2 level was known at all external consultation and used to guide
      the treatment. The primary endpoint was the QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years). The secondary
      endpoints were the Cost-efficacy ratio, Cost to avoid an hospitalization for heart failure,
      the readmission rate for any cause at 1 month and at two years, and the evolution of cardiac
      remodelling determined by the collagene biomarkers.
