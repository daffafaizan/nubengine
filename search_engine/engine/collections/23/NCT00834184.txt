      multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z.
      Nikkomycin Z has previously been studied in a single dose protocol in healthy male subjects.
      This study is designed to run in parallel to protocol VFCE-2007-001 to provide additional
      data on safety and pharmacokinetics. The study will involve a total of 32 subjects (6
      active/2 placebo per group) with a multiple, rising dose strategy.
