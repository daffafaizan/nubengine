    
      Objectives:

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of
      Promoting Action Towards Health (PATH), a brief health-enhancement and risk reduction
      intervention targeting newly HIV diagnosed men who have sex with men (MSM).

      Specific Aims:

      The investigators will establish the efficacy of PATH. The following hypotheses will be
      tested: Participants in the experimental condition will (1) achieve significantly greater
      suppression of HIV viral load; (2) demonstrate greater uptake of care and adherence to
      treatment; and (3) engage in less sexual HIV transmission risk behavior across the study
      duration than participants in the comparison condition.

      Procedures:

      440 newly HIV diagnosed (within 12 months) men will be randomly assigned to either: (1) the
      PATH experimental condition, or (2) the PCC comparison condition and followed for one year.
      HIV counselors will be trained to deliver the interventions within each condition.
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

      Significance:

      Given increases in HIV incidence among MSM, advances in HIV treatment, and the demonstrated
      efficacy of early treatment in preventing HIV transmission, there is a critical need for
      effective interventions that can increase engagement and retention of MSM in care and reduce
      sexual HIV transmission risk behavior. PATH can be seamlessly integrated into medical care
      and translated into a sustainable model of care for newly diagnosed MSM to meet the urgent
      need for care programs that identify, treat, and prevent HIV infections.
