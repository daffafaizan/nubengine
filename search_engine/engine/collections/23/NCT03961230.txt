      infiltration of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of epidermal keratinocytes, and abnormal
      differentiation. Latest data estimate that the prevalence of psoriasis in adults has
      increased to 11.43%, which shows that the control and treatment of psoriasis is still
      insufficient. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the
      effective methods for the treatment of psoriasis. More and more evidences support the
      recognition of psoriasis not only affects the skin, but also suffers a chronic multisystem
      inflammation. Chinese medicine believes that the blood heat is the root of the onset of
      psoriasis, so the treatment of psoriasis should focus on the method of clearing heat and
      cooling blood. Therefore, the method of promoting clearing heat and cooling blood. has always
      been the focus of TCM treatment and prevention of psoriasis. This multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will provide high-quality clinical evidences for
      evaluating the efficacy, safety and recurrence rate of Jueyin granule, a representative
      prescription for the treatment of psoriasis with blood heat syndrome, in the treatment of
      psoriasis.
