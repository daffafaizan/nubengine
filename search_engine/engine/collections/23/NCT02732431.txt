      though undervalued by parents and physicians. Several sleep questionnaires are used in
      paediatric patients to detect high risk children who have OSA, but not really appropriate for
      DS patients. The aim of the study is to determine the reliability of four questionnaires used
      in paediatric patients (PSQ-SRBD: Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire-Sleep-Related Breathing
      Disorder, CSHQ: Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, CAS-15: Clinical Assessment Score-15
      and SCR: Sleep Clinical Record) in screening of OSA in DS population.

      Study design: Prospective study concerning children with Down syndrome (age 1-18y). Parents
      will complete two sleep symptom questionnaires (PSQ-SRBD and CSHQ) and children will be
      evaluated by a paediatric pulmonologist and allergist with skin allergy test. An Ear, Nose
      and Throat specialist will complete two questionnaires (CAS-15 and SCR) carrying a
      nasopharyngoscopy. Then, children will perform an overnight polysomnography in the Department
      of Paediatric Functional Investigations of University Hospital in Nice.
