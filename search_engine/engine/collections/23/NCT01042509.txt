    
      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most common long-term complication in patients who
      underwent allogeneic transplantation. First-line therapy for chronic GVHD is based on
      immunosuppressive agents (usually cyclosporine and corticosteroids) achieving satisfactory
      response in around 30% of patients. There is no ideal second-line treatment for chronic GVHD;
      however, numerous studies have been published with therapeutic options such as alemtuzumab
      (anti-CD52) and rituximab (anti-CD20).

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, nonrandomized study in which alemtuzumab and rituximab
      will be administered at low-doses to patients with refractory chronic GVHD. Clinical response
      will be evaluated based on the Working Group Report 2006, published by the National Institute
      of Health Consensus. Follow-up sessions will be weekly for four weeks, every two weeks until
      achieve response, and finally every four weeks.
