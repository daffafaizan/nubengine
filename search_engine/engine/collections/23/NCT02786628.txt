      can serve as both a risk stratification variable and clinical outcome for patients prior to
      or during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Many cytotoxic therapies cause premature aging and frailty
      in a sizable portion of patients, so measuring and improving physical function may also limit
      late morbidity and mortality in certain patient populations. Clinician-rated performance
      status (cPS; e.g., ECOG or Karnofsky PS) in addition to organ-specific function have been
      used to prognosticate risk and determine treatment strategy, but cPS only readily identifies
      individuals with significant functional compromise. Objective evaluations of physical
      function, such as aerobic capacity and measured daily activity, may have greater potential to
      improve the precision of performance status evaluation.
