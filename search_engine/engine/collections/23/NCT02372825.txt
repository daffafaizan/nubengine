      patient records. The study design included three outcome measures to assess the clinical
      long-term outcomes. These were the Visual Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle (VAS FA), the
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the 15-dimensions (15D) health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) instrument. The data was collected with postal approach and a written informed
      consent obtained from the seven participants.
