    
      We plan a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical study (phase III) in 80 patients with
      diabetes mellitus. All of them will receive the optimum metabolic treatment for their
      underlying disease. The treatment group will be administered HBO according to the problem
      wound schedule, the controls will have sham treatment in the hyperbaric chamber. Routine
      wound care (dressings, physiotherapy, antibiotics if necessary) will be identical in both
      groups and according to its clinical needs.

      Before treatment, indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG), transcutaneous (partial) oxygen
      pressure (TcPO2) and LifeViz 3D (three-dimensional medical imaging and reconstruction)
      documentation will be done and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) as well as markers of bone
      metabolism will be determined in all patients.

      The measurements will be repeated according to the schedule during the treatment period and
      at controls after 3, 6 and 12 months.
