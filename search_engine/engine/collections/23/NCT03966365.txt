    
      Number of patients: n = 24 12 subjects per group (both eyes). Main inclusion criteria:
      Clinically healthy subjects.

      Treatment duration: 7 days. Duration of subject in the study: 15 to 22 days.

      Adverse events will be reported and cataloged based on the MedDRA dictionary and will be
      reported to the corresponding regulatory entity.

      The sponsor will carry out monitoring or quality visits to the research sites where it
      corroborates the information of the source documents and will contrast them with the
      information presented in the electronic CRF. Electronic case report forms will be evaluated
      by the clinical research associate and the clinical team of the sponsor (medical
      ophthalmologist researcher and pharmacologist of clinical safety).

      Statistical methodology:

      The data will be expressed with measures of central tendency: mean and standard deviation for
      the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out by means of the Mann-Whitney U test
      for the quantitative variables for the difference between the groups. The difference between
      the qualitative variables will be analyzed by means of X2 (Chi2). An alpha â‰¤ 0.05 will be
      considered significant.
