    
      This PMOS will be conducted in a prospective, single-arm, multicountry, multicenter format.
      The assignment of the patient to Humira is not decided in advance by this protocol but falls
      within the current practice. The prescription of Humira is clearly separated from the
      decision to include the patient in this study. No additional procedures (other than standard
      of care) shall be applied to the patients. As this study is observational in nature, its
      follow-up is not interventional and is left to the judgment of each physician within the
      14-17 months period (including tuberculosis (TB) screening and prophylaxis, if indicated),
      which defines the survey for each patient. The TB screening period per patient will be 1-4
      weeks and, if applicable, the TB prophylactic treatment period before Humira administration
      will be 1 month in accordance with local guidelines. For indicative purposes, follow-up of
      patients should entail approximately 7 patient visits during this period. These visits will
      take place at average intervals of 3 months, apart from the first visit following TB
      screening. The first visit following introduction of Humira and final visits are required
      because of intercurrent events. If treatment with Humira is discontinued, the standard
      practice is to review the patient after a period of 70 days or 5 half-lives following the
      intake of the last dose of physician-prescribed treatment. If the physician decides to
      permanently discontinue Humira before the end of the planned observational period of 13
      months, the reason for discontinuation and the new treatment regimen prescribed, if
      applicable, will be documented. The next routine follow-up visit will be the termination
      visit for this patient in the PMOS.
