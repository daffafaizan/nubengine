    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the biodistribution of indium-111 BU-12 in patients with refractory CD19+
           leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody BU-12

        -  Determine the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response.

        -  To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody
           BU-12.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody BU-12/indium-111 BU-12 IV over 60
      minutes on day 0 and undergo whole-body imaging on days 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7. Patients also
      undergo blood collection and bone marrow biopsy periodically for dosimetry calculations and
      pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
