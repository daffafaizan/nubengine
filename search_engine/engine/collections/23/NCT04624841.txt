      diagnosed with Acute Cholecystitis and posted for emergency Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy will
      be randomly assigned to receive either ICG or not as a method to identify the Critical View
      of Safety during the operation.

      The primary outcome is whether there was a precise and satisfactory visualization of the
      junction between the cystic duct, the common hepatic duct, and the common bile duct by
      indocyanine green compared to the control group. The time taken to achieve this will be
      measured in minutes from video recordings of the laparoscopic surgery. The process will be
      further assessed by a surgeons' satisfaction score.

      The expected duration of the study will be 12 months involving a total of 80 patients
      randomized into two groups- 40 patients in the intervention group and 40 patients in the
      control group.

      The expected outcome of the study is that ICG is more effective than the control group in
      providing precise and satisfactory visualization of Critical View of Safety and takes less
      time. We predict the surgeons to be equally or more satisfied with ICG compared to control.
