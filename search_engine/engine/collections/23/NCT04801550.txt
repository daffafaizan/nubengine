      side-effects.

      However, its mechanism of action is still partly unknown. Preclinical studies showed that the
      use of millimeter waves near highly-innervated areas stimulates subcutaneous receptors, even
      at low power.

      To achieve safe millimeter wave stimulation, we will use a bracelet (Remedee Labs) emitting
      millimeter waves, that has been developped for human use. It complies with radiofrequency
      exposure regulation (CE-marked).

      This study aims to provide a better understanding of the mechanism by which millimeter waves
      interact with somatosensory system in brain.

      For this purpose, the analysis of brain activity will focus on somatosensory responses
      elicited by electrical stimulation of the right thumb.

      Subjects will complete two sessions during which the brain activity will be recorded by
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) before, during and after the use of a bracelet emitting
      millimeter waves.

      Magnetoencephalography is chosen for its good temporal resolution, its sensitivity in the low
      frequencies and its accuracy to locate neural sources when matching with an Magnetic
      Resonance (MR) Imagery. It will allow us to study the shape and the delay of the
      somatosensory response in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and secondary somatosensory
      cortex (SII) cortical areas of the brain.
