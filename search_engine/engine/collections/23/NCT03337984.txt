      (HP) is still considered the safest treatment for generalized peritonitis as a consequence of
      a complicated acute diverticulitis (stages III and IV of the Hinchey's classification).
      Almost the half of those patients do not have their stoma reversed because of its association
      with significant morbidity and mortality. To date, the use of resection with primary
      anastomosis (PA) is a matter of debate, as it is reported in the literature that it is
      substantially equivalent to HP in terms of morbidity and length of postoperative stay. For
      these reason, PA is often reserved for younger patients with few co-morbidities and a lesser
      degree of peritoneal contamination. In the last decade, Damage Control Surgery has been
      emerging as a valid alternative to HP and RA in patients presenting a severe sepsis caused by
      purulent or fecal peritonitis in acute diverticulitis. Initially described for the treatment
      of major abdominal injuries, indications for DCS have subsequently been extended to septic
      shock, abdominal compartment syndrome and impossibility to perform a primary closure.
      However, there is still no consensus about the use of DCS in perforated acute diverticulitis.

      The aim of this study was to describe "how-to-use" the Damage Control Surgery in patients
      with purulent and fecal peritonitis following a severe acute diverticulitis and report the
      impact on patients' outcomes after the application of this technique in several Italian
      centers of emergency surgery
