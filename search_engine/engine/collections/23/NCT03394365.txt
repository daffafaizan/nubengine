    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      tabelecleucel for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD in the setting of SOT after failure of rituximab
      and rituximab plus chemotherapy (SOT cohort) or HCT after failure of rituximab (HCT cohort).

      Enrollment will be preceded by confirmation of availability of partially human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) matched and restricted tabelecleucel for the participant.

      Study procedures and product administration will be the same for each cohort. Tabelecleucel
      will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, participants
      will receive intravenous tabelecleucel at a dose of 2Ã—10^6 cells/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15,
      followed by observation through Day 35. Treatment will continue until maximal response,
      unacceptable toxicity, initiation of non protocol therapy, or failure of tabelecleucel with
      up to 2 different HLA restrictions (SOT cohort) or up to 4 different HLA restrictions (HCT
      cohort). The study includes a total of 5 years of follow-up for disease and survival status.

      This protocol has been amended to include the HCT cohort from clinical study ATA129-EBV-301
      (NCT03392142).

      NOTE, 29 April 2020: Enrollment is temporarily paused at study site/locations with status
      "active, not recruiting" due to COVID-19 restrictions.
