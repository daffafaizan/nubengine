      congenital atrioventricular block (CAB) and more frequently elderly patients affected by
      progressive Cardiac Conduction Disease (PCCD).

      The aim of the study is to uncover the genetic model, likely more complex than previously
      appreciated, and characterize the gene expression remodelling leading to high degree of
      conduction defect.

      The recent technological developments in genomics coupled to the availability of large and
      highly characterized biobanks of patients have now set the stage:

        1. To identify rare genetic variants/new genes contributing to CAB and PCCD by exome
           sequencing on familial form suspected to impact strongly the phenotype

        2. To identify common genetic variants modulating the risk of developing (severe) PCCD by
           GWAS

        3. To estimate the prevalence and relevance of genes uncovered by TASK#1, #2 in large
           patient sets (PCCD and CAB) by NGS.
