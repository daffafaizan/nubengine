      Interestingly, in addition to ginseng root, ginseng berry and leaf were also shown to reduce
      blood glucose in diabetic models. In our recent study, ginsam, vinegar extraction from Panax
      ginseng, which is enriched in the ginsenoside Rg3, has distinct beneficial effects on glucose
      metabolism and body weight control in an obese animal model of insulin resistance by changing
      the expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Our group has also
      published that Rg3 improves insulin signaling and glucose uptake primarily by stimulating the
      expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4. Thus, we have evaluated the efficacy, dose-response
      relationships and safety of a ginsam, a vinegar extract from Panax ginseng.
