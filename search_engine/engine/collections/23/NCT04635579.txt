      reestablish the function of the knee. However, regaining previous levels of strength is
      challenging, with long-term muscle weakness frequently reported and thought to play a key
      role in the increased risk of knee osteoarthritis for individuals with a history of ACL
      damage. Effectively building muscle strength requires exercises with high resistance loads,
      however the joint stress and risk of further injury makes these types of activities
      inappropriate and unsafe for those rehabilitating after ACL reconstruction surgery and other
      injuries. Personalized blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a technique where the blood
      flow to the muscles being exercised is controlled by a pressure cuff to a predefined level,
      and has been shown to increase strength while exercising with significantly lower loads.
      Early results have been promising, however the effects of BFR on the biomechanics of the
      exercise as well as the acceptability in the ACL reconstruction population have not been
      explored. In this application, we propose a cross-sectional study designed to test the
      acceptability of BFR training for those undergoing rehabilitation from ACL reconstruction
      surgery and healthy controls during free standing exercises. We will also investigate the
      biomechanical effects of this rehabilitation technique. This application is part of a larger
      program of musculoskeletal research in this area being developed by the team. The results
      from the proposed project will inform the design of a clinical trial of personalized BFR
      after ACL reconstruction.
