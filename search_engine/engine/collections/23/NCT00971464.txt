      Canada, affecting people over the age of 55 years. It causes loss of central, detailed
      vision, resulting in difficulty with fine vision tasks, such as reading and writing. At
      present there is no fully effective prevention or treatment for this condition, but people do
      benefit from visual rehabilitation. Two of the most common rehabilitation techniques are
      eccentric viewing training and an electronic magnification system called a Closed circuit
      television (CCTV). In eccentric viewing training the person is taught to use his or her
      remaining side vision, instead of central vision. The CCTV provides high levels of
      magnification to compensate for the loss of detail vision. The purpose of this randomized
      clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of these two interventions. In the study
      people will be randomly assigned to either receiving eccentric viewing training or a CCTV.
      This will happen after they have received basic, optical low vision services and training
      through the CNIB. We will assess their performance with either the CCTV or EV training with a
      variety of reading tasks and questionnaires. The results will give evidence for how it is
      most beneficial to use resources and as such will be very important in future planning of low
      vision services.

      Hypothesis: Eccentric Viewing Training will improve reading speed over CCTV by at least 10
      words per minute in patients with advanced AMD.
