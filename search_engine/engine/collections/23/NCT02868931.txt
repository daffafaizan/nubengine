    
      INPUT is a self-management-based treatment and education program for diabetic patients with
      an insulin pump (CSII). It is designed to empower patients to adequately perform their
      therapy in daily life and to integrate their diabetes and their insulin pump into their lifes
      in order to enhance quality of life.

      INPUT ist tested in an randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waiting-list control group
      since no certified and effective treatment and education program for CSII exists.

      This study is a multi-center study. Study centers are specialized diabetes practices
      throughout Germany. Patients will be approached by their respective practice and informed
      about the study. Study measurements as well as the conduct of INPUT will take place at the
      respective practice.

      Baseline measurement will take place 2 weeks prior to the beginning of INPUT. After
      completion of baseline measurement, all patients from one study center will be randomized
      centrally by the Research Institute of the Diabetes Academy Mergentheim (FIDAM). 2 weeks and
      6 months after the completion of INPUT, follow-up measurements will be conducted at the
      respective study center.

      HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control will be analyzed in a central laboratory. Secondary
      outcome measures will be assessed via psychometrically tested questionnaires, Case Reports
      Forms, or patient files.
