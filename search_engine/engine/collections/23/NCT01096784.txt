      to important factors, normally found in utero, such as proteins, growth factors, and
      cytokines. It has been demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one such
      factor. In utero these biological factors are introduced to the fetus via placental
      absorption or ingestion from amniotic fluid. Deprivation of such factors is likely to cause
      inhibition or improper stimulation of important pathways, which in the case of the eye may
      cause abnormal retinal vascular growth, the hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

      Retinopathy of prematurity is the major cause of blindness in children in the developed and
      developing world, despite the availability of current treatment of late-stage ROP. As
      developing countries provide more neonatal and maternal intensive care, which increases the
      survival of preterm born infants, the incidence of ROP is increasing.

      This phase 2 study was originally designed in 3 sections, Sections A, B, and C which are now
      complete. The protocol was amended and patients enrolled from this point forward will be
      enrolled into Section D.

      In Study Section D, a total of 120 subjects (GA of 23 weeks + 0 days to 27 weeks + 6 days)
      will be randomly assigned with 1:1 allocation ratio to either treatment with
      rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 or to receive standard neonatal care (Control Group) to obtain at least 80
      evaluable subjects. Duration of infusion will last at longest from Study Day 0 (day of birth)
      up to and including PMA 29 weeks + 6 days, when the subject's endogenous production of IGF-1
      is considered sufficient to maintain physiologic serum IGF-1 levels. After discontinuation of
      study drug infusion, each subject will be followed to PMA 40 weeks Â± 4 days.
