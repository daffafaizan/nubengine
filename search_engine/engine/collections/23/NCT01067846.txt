    
      Primary Hypothesis:

      Enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission with DCS facilitates CBT-related relapse prevention
      by potentiating the behavioral and neural representation of the diminished drug motivation
      associated with cocaine cues.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Determine if the short-term oral administration of DCS relative to placebo prior to CBT
           sessions facilitates cocaine abstinence and functional recovery, and reduces cocaine
           craving in treatment-seeking cocaine addicts.

        2. Determine if DCS administration relative to placebo facilitates CBT-related decreases in
           the behavioral and neural response to conditioned cocaine cues.
