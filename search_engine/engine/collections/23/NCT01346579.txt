    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the relapse free-survival difference between patients with PIK3CA mutated and
      wild-type (WT) tumors and therefore validate PIK3CA mutation status as an important biomarker
      in women 70 years or older diagnosed with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via mutation analysis of PIK3CA.
