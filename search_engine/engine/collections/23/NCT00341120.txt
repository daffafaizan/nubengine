      infertility. Studies of children fathered through intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI
      have revealed mutations on the AZF region of the Y chromosome linked to male infertility.
      Mutations of other genes may also be involved. Candidates would include genes for the
      androgen receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, and genes involved
      in the regulation of spermatogenesis and sperm motility. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have
      been linked to poor sperm motility and raise the possibility that some types of male
      subfertility may be inherited only through the female line.

      We propose to assess the role of folate/homocysteine status and MTHFR and CBS gene variants
      in infertile men in Sweden with no known cause for their infertility and whose wives/partners
      appear to be fertile. We propose to perform the study in Sweden since Sweden, unlike the
      U.S., at present does not mandate the enrichment of flour or other foodstuffs with folate.
