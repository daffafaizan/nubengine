      comfort and appropriate surgical environment. However, side effects of medications such as
      respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia and desaturation cannot be avoided.
      Recently, there have been developed a virtual reality experience equipment and a variety of
      virtual reality programs including visuo-haptic computer technology. There have been clinical
      studies that apply this technology to the pain medicine, sedation and medical education.
      However, no study has been reported for the purpose of replacing sedation during spinal
      anesthesia.

      Therefore, we attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sedation using virtual reality
      meditation program during spinal anesthesia for urologic surgery.
