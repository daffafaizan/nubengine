    
      The project is a clinical trial assessing the effects of GTS-21 (an Î±7 nicotinic receptor
      partial agonist) on smoking, mood, neurocognition, and neurophysiology, in a small sample of
      chronic smokers who are currently healthy and interested in smoking cessation. Using a
      double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, 54 (27 women) community smokers who
      have demonstrated a readiness to quit will participate over a 7 week active trial. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to active drug or placebo groups. Across the study period,
      participants will undergo repeated neurobehavioral testing, laboratory assessments of
      cardiovascular and liver function, and provide weekly updates regarding smoking behavior,
      mood state and side-effects.
