    
      This is a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in approximately 1350
      adult male and female patients with CIC comparing 2 doses of plecanatide to placebo. The
      study will be conducted at approximately 180 clinical study sites in the United States (US)
      and Canada. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3.0
      and 6.0 mg of plecanatide administered once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in a population of
      patients with CIC. The study population will include only patients without other causes of
      constipation or other chronic conditions that could interfere with study assessments.
      Patients may not take laxatives (with the exception of the study-provided rescue medication,
      bisacodyl 5mg tablets), or a number of prohibited drugs that are known to cause constipation
      or diarrhea, during study participation.

      There are 6 scheduled study visits, including the screening and follow-up visits. The planned
      duration of participation in this study will be 112 days and up to 155 days, with washout and
      all visit windows considered.
