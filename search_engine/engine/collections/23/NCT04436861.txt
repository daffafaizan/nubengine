      entire population: separation of loved ones, loss of freedom, uncertainty about the
      infectious status, boredom. All of these factors can cause negative mental health
      consequences. Having little social contact was one of the factors increasing the negative
      psychological impact of confinement.

      People suffering from psychological disorders are particularly vulnerable during quarantine
      periods. On March 17, 2020, the French government implemented national containment measures
      due to the Covid-19 epidemic.

      Although the effects of containment have been studied for fragile populations, no study to
      date has focused on the specific population of healthcare facility staff. These caregivers
      have for the most part continued their professional activity, but they have been confronted
      with the fear of contracting or causing patients to contract Covid-19.

      At a distance from the lifting of confinement (1 month), the investigator wish to study
      whether the highlighting of anxiety or depression in these healthcare professionals is
      associated with their context of life (professional and personal situation) during
      confinement
