      into two groups -in test group 1 -the defects will be filled with a mixture of
      autograft(which will be obtained from the surrounding buccal cortical plate by using a
      trephine bur) and prf(will be prepared by Choukron's method) and the defects and denuded root
      surface will be covered with a collagen membrane and in test group 2 -the defects will be
      filled with a blood clot and over that the collagen membrane will be placed. Radiographic and
      clinical healing will be assessed after 12 months, 2D healing will be assessed by Rud and
      Molven criteria and 3D healing will be assessed by Modified Penn 3D criteria.The clinical
      parameters recorded including periodontal pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL)
      and gingival margin position (GMP) and will be measured on buccal aspect of the interproximal
      space and mid buccal aspect of the involved teeth using Williams 'O' periodontal
      probe.Routine examination procedure will be used to evaluate any evidence of signs and/or
      symptoms.. The criteria for a successful outcome included the absence of clinical signs
      and/or symptoms and radiographic evidence of complete or incomplete healing.
