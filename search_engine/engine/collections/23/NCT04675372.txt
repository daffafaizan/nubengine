      spinal microglia and astrocyte decreasing noxious stimuli evoked release of nociceptive
      substances and further interrupting the spinal neuron-glia cross talk and regulating the
      nociceptive transmission under chronic pain condition. in this study, the analgesic efficacy
      of Dexmedetomidine was evaluated by a new non-invasive nociceptive index (qNOX). In this
      study, Anagel6000 analgesia monitor was used to quantitatively compare the analgesic efficacy
      of Dexmedetomidine compared with Midazolam.
