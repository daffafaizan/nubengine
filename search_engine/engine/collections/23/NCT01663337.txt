      Although combined treatments have been developed, they are complex and lengthy with mixed
      results as to their efficacy. Excellent treatments exist for PTSD or AUD alone, however, it
      has not been adequately addressed to what extent these treatments are effective in treating
      comorbid symptom presentations. To address this research gap, the investigators will evaluate
      two widely accepted treatments for each respective disorder; Cognitive Processing Therapy
      (CPT) an effective PTSD treatment and Relapse Prevention (RP), a widely used effective AUD
      treatment.

      The investigators will build on our prior work using a daily telephone Interactive Voice
      Response (IVR) system to test models of self-medication and the sequence of symptom change
      for both primary and secondary symptom targets associated with each therapy.

      Creating a more comprehensive model of symptom change in PTSD and alcohol use with widely
      used selective treatments is critical in testing theories of PTSD/AUD, evaluating these
      treatments for use with PTSD/AUD, and implementing these therapies with PTSD/AUD patients in
      standard clinical practice
