      their community-dwelling female partner. Using an adapted version of an efficacious
      couples-level HIV prevention intervention for community populations (CONNECT; PI: El-Bassel),
      this study will pilot test a single in-prison intervention session using face-to-face or
      teleconferencing modalities and a brief community follow-up session. Feasibility and
      acceptability among the inmates and their partners will be assessed.
