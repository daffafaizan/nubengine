    
      Brodalumab is an anti-interleukin 17 receptor A antibody (IL-17RA) and blocks the
      inflammatory effects of different IL-17 cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17F, IL-17A/F
      heterodimer, and IL-17E) in the skin. With increasing availability of novel biologics with
      new targets, the complexity of choosing the appropriate biologic treatment is ever more
      challenging for physicians. Therefore, the primary objective of this trial is to compare the
      efficacy of brodalumab versus guselkumab in adult participants with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis and inadequate response to ustekinumab, thereby providing new scientific
      information that could support decision making in the clinical setting. The study will run
      approximately 32 weeks for each participant (including a 2- to 4-weeks screening period and a
      28-week treatment period), with the primary endpoint measurement at Week 16. Participants
      receive subcutaneous injections of brodalumab or guselkumab. Dummy injections are also given,
      so participants, assessors, and investigators are unaware of which treatment is given.
