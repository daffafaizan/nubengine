      known as active metabolite. Until know therapeutic range for z-endoxifen to improve treatment
      response was not known. Variation response on tamoxifen can be cause of genetic polymorphism
      CYP2D6 that can be different between interindividul and ethnic.

      The aim of this study is to determine phenotype and genotype of CYP2D6 as predictors of
      z-endoxifen concentrations in plasma of outgoing patients treated with tamoxifen for at least
      4 months
