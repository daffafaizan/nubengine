      acne, and many other skin conditions. Personal care products are widely used on a daily basis
      but it is not know how these personal care products shift the skin's microbiome. The
      diversity of the skin microbiome is important in the maintenance of skin equilibrium as a
      loss of diversity predisposes to development of skin disease.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate multiple over the counter products that are used on the
      face daily to assess how they alter skin microbiome and diversity of microflora on skin after
      a week of daily treatment.

      A second aim of the study is to assess how baseline diversity of microbiome are different
      based on self-graded skin types.
