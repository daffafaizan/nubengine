      zygomatic fractures were divided into experimental and control groups. Patients in the
      experimental group were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with the assistance
      of surgical navigation technology, and patients in the control group without it. Preoperative
      and postoperative CT data were obtained to measure surgical landmarks discrepancy between the
      2 groups. The Chi-square Test and t-test were conducted to test whether there was significant
      difference in the accuracy between the two groups. Evaluating the effect of fixation by the
      data and clinical symptoms.

      Twenty patients with unilateral complicated zygomatic-complex fractures received operation.
      All patients healed and their function and facial contour were improved obviously.
      Postoperative clinical symptoms were not significantly different between the two groups
      (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, discrepancy of surgical landmarks measured by
      software Geomagic studio 11, Brainlabiplan CMF 3.0 were significantly low in the experimental
      group (P<0.05). Software measurement showed the symmetry of zygomatic area and the effect of
      the fixation in the experimental group were more satisfactory than the control group.
