    
      The purpose of this study is to establish biocomparison of 2 types of tablets containing
      macitentan: a pediatric dispersible tablet and the adult film-coated tablet. A single oral
      dose of each tablet will be given to healthy subjects on 2 different periods separated by a
      washout phase of 10 to 14 days.

      Biocomparison will be based on the comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of macitentan
      with the two types of tablets using specific statistical methods. The pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be considered equivalent if specific criteria defined in the study protocol
      are met.
