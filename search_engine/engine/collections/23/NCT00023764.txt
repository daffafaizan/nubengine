      I. Determine the frequency and duration of complete and partial response rates in patients
      with grade I, II, or III follicular lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma treated with bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response of minimal residual disease by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      detectable or clonotypic PCR minimal residual disease in bone marrow of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (follicular lymphoma vs mantle
      cell lymphoma).

      Patients receive an infusion of bortezomib over 3-5 seconds once weekly for 4 weeks.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve at least a partial response lasting at least 6 months may
      receive retreatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 2 years.
