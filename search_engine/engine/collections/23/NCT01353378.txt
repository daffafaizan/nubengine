      Dexmedetomidine, because of its sedative and analgesic properties, might be useful for the
      management of this adverse effect. In the pediatric population, it has been shown to provide
      sedation for magnetic resonance imaging. Intravenously, it is has been shown to decrease
      emergence delirium following sevoflurane based anesthesia. The ability to administer a
      medication intravenously might solve the problem of emergence delirium and emergence
      agitation posed by the young patients undergoing oral maxillofacial surgery.
