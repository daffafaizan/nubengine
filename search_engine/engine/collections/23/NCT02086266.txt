      after radical prostatectomy. One physiotherapist, with experience in urogynecology, was
      responsible for all the assessments. Urinary frequency, nocturia, 24-hour pad test, number of
      pads used per day, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short
      Form (ICIQ-SF) were the variables evaluated.

      The subjects were allocated in one of two treatment groups (G1: Pilates; G2: anal electrical
      stimulation combined with pelvic floor muscle training). Volunteers participated of 10
      sessions of the corresponding treatment and were reassessed objectively by the number of pads
      used per day, and subjectively with the score of quality of life.
