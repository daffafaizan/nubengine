      mechanisms by which E regulates bone metabolism is critical for developing novel approaches
      to prevent and treat this disorder. We will focus on defining mechanisms for the age-related
      decrease in bone formation and the role of E deficiency in mediating this decrease. We will
      use novel methods we have developed to examine gene expression in highly purified bone marrow
      osteoblastic cells. We will test whether the increase in bone formation previously observed
      following acute E treatment in women is associated with an increase in markers of Wnt/bone
      morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and/or production and in othe genes related to bone
      formation by osteoblastic cells.
