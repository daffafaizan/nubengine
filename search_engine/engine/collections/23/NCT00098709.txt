      physician. The current use of the fetal heart rate monitor provides some information on fetal
      condition, and is the primary tool used to determine if immediate operative delivery is
      required. The fetal pulse oximeter can provide additional information regarding fetal oxygen
      saturation.

      Intervention: A fetal oxygen saturation sensor is placed in the uterus, between the fetal
      cheek or forehead and the uterine wall. In half of the patients, the managing physician will
      have access to fetal oxygen saturation and fetal heart rate monitoring. In the other half of
      the patients, labor will be monitored by fetal heart rate alone.

      Study hypothesis: The additional information provided by the use of the fetal pulse oximeter
      will reduce the chances of a cesarean delivery. The primary outcome is cesarean section for
      any indication and secondary outcomes are cesarean delivery for non-reassuring fetal heart
      rate or dystocia, and neonatal morbidity.
