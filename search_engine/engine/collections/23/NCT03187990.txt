      with elevated PSA (ages 30-50 PSA >2.5 ng/mL; ages 50-80 PSA > 4ng/mL), which are assigned to
      a MRI guided biopsy.

      These patients will undergo one additional PET/MRI scan with [68Ga]PSMA within two to three
      weeks before the biopsy (Arm A), or in case of an unclear/negative MRI scan but positive
      biopsy two to three weeks after biopsy (Arm B). In Arm A a radiologist will delineate the
      suspected areas on (A) multiparametric magnetic resonance image (mpMRI) and a nuclear
      medicine physician will delineate and color code the suspicious areas on the PET/MRI: (B)
      [68Ga]PSMA. The images will be loaded into the BiopSeeÂ® system. Lesions positive on both
      modalities will be labeled as "AB". Every suspicious lesion will be targeted with 3 cores. A
      maximum of 3 targets will be selected per patient.

      For arm B: PET/MRI results will be correlated with the template biopsy results.

      The data analysis of Arm A and Arm B will be identical. For the analysis the Gleason score
      from the histology of the core biopsies will serve as standard of truth.
