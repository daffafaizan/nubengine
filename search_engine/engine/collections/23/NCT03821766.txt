      cardiac catheterization as required by their medical condition.

      The SCG and BCG signals will be recorded simultaneously to the catheterization by the mean of
      an unintrusive and friendly device consisting of two houses, the first one placed on sternum
      and the second one in the lumbar column. The device will record a continuous tracing
      synchronized with the intracavitary pressure profiles recorded during the invasive procedure.
