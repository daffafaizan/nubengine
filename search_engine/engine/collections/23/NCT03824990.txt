      truly reflect the epidemiology, intervention status, and outcomes of neonatal
      hyperbilirubinemia and the cost. Hopefully, by improving the quality of management of
      neonatal jaundice,we can explore and obtain a healthy term and near-term jaundice management
      model suitable for China's national condition, which can eventually reduce the incidence rate
      of neonatal severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy.
