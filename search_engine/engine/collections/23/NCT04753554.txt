      heart-lung pump process they involve. It is essential to avoid hypoxia in such patient groups
      in order to prevent perfusion disorders. While preventing hypoxia, hyperoxia processes can be
      observed frequently in patients. In order to avoid complications related to hyperoxia and
      oxidative damage, oxygenation management should be followed closely. Today, non-invasive
      monitoring methods are being used in this field. In our study, we aimed to observe the
      usability of this method in oxygenation management and avoidance of hyperoxia by performing
      oxygenation management over ORI (oxygene reserve index) value using the Masimo Root + Radical
      7 Rainbow SET device with SPHB finger probe.

      30 patients will bi included in our study; and they will be divided into two groups: In one
      group oxygenation management will be performed by conventional method, such as blood gas
      analysis. In other group ORI values will be used to manage oxygenation. Lung ultrasound will
      be performed in both groups to see if there will be any sign for atelectasis, preoperatively
      and postoperatively.

      Kidney and liver functions will also be investigated before and after surgery. For cognitive
      disfunction evaluation; CAM-ICU scores will be recorded in both groups at 24 hours after the
      operation.
