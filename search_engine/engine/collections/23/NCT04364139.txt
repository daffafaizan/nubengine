      design to evaluate the effects of level of blood pressure control and type of
      anti-hypertensive medication on progression of chronic renal disease among African American
      men and women with chronic renal insufficiency caused by hypertension (hypertensive
      nephrosclerosis). Two levels of blood pressure control were defined in terms of mean arterial
      pressure (MAP = 2/3 diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 systolic blood pressure). A usual goal is
      defined as an MAP of 102 to 107 mm Hg, and a low goal is defined as an MAP of 92 mm Hg or
      less. The three antihypertensive drug regimens contained either a calcium channel blocker
      (amlodipine), β-blocker (metoprolol; Toprol XL), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
      (ramipril) as initial therapy. Progression of renal disease was measured as the rate of
      decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
