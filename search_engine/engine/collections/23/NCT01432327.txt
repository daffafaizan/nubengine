      self-monitoring and real-time feedback from the SenseWear Armband (BodyMedia) alone and in
      combination with Personal Coaching to enhance physical activity and influence consciousness
      about its own physical activity patterns over a 12-month period in sedentary Flemish
      employees. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the feedback will increase awareness
      and subsequent physical activity levels of inactive office workers. Another hypothesizes is
      that the weekly meeting with a Personal Coach will add a controlling element and therefore
      employees of the 'coaching group' will have a higher physical activity level at the end of
      the intervention period compared to the other groups.
