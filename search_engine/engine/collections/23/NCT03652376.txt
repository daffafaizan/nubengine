      decrease in exacerbations and a significant increase in lung function and quality of life in
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading
      to this clinical benefit of benralizumab treatment are not completely understood. Dendritic
      cells are key regulators of the adaptive and innate immune system. There is evidence that
      eosinophils have a direct influence on the function of dendritic cells. In addition, there
      are multiple indirect interactions between eosinophils and dendritic cells in asthma.
      However, there is currently no information on the impact of benralizumab treatment and a
      complete removal of circulating eosinophils on the number and phenotype of human dendritic
      cells. Benralizumab is chosen for this study because it is the only anti-IL-5 biologic which
      results in a complete removal of eosinophils from peripheral blood.
