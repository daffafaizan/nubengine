      prior conducting the study. Validation and reliability test were done for USG operators by
      assessing IVC in 20 patients supervised by intensivists. Subjects were given informed consent
      before participating in the study. Subjects underwent the chest x-ray examination with supine
      position. The measurement of VPW was done by radiologists, considered normal if the value is
      53 Â± 5 mm, overload if VPW > 71 mm. The subjects then underwent the IVC diameter measurement
      using USG Philips En Visor C, with transthoracal subcostal approach. The result is considered
      normal if IVC diameter is 1.5 - 2.5 cm and overload if >2.5 cm, otherwise the subjects is
      excluded. If the IVC can not be done, subjects will be excluded.
