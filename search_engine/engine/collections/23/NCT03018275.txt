      function, susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection, and immune imbalance. There
      is currently no cure for AD. Preclinical data in a mouse model of AD suggest that commensal
      Gram-negative bacteria (CGN), such as Roseomonas mucosa, from a healthy source can relieve
      symptoms of AD and have antimicrobial effects. In this study, we will first evaluate the
      safety of R mucosa-based biotherapy in adults with AD (age 18+ years; part 1), and then
      evaluate the safety and activity of R mucosa-based biotherapy in children (ages 3-17 years)
      with AD (parts 2A and 2B). In part 1, participants will receive twice-weekly doses of CGN
      biotherapy for 6 weeks, with dose escalations at 2 and 4 weeks. In part 2, participants will
      receive twice-weekly doses of CGN biotherapy for 4 months, with possible dose escalations at
      4 and 8 weeks (part 2A only). Starting at 12 weeks for both parts 2A and 2B, dosing frequency
      may be increased to every other day. Participants in part 1 will be contacted 30 10 days
      after end of treatment for assessment of safety. Participants in parts 2A and 2B will also be
      followed for up to 1 year after the end of treatment for evaluation of long-term activity and
      safety. This will be the first study to test cutaneous live biotherapeutic products for AD.
      We hypothesize that altering the strains of CGN on the skin of people with AD will improve
      the patient s clinical outcome. We do not expect serious toxicities because R mucosa is
      rarely pathogenic; reported cases of bacteremia have typically been associated with
      percutaneous catheters in immunocompromised patients, who are excluded from this study.
