      opioids and/or an interscalene brachial plexus block(IBPB). Opioid consumption often leads to
      unpleasant side effects including nausea, vomitting and sedation. IBPB offers very efficient
      pain relief but includes the discomfort of a paralyzed arm. Furthermore this approach often
      also leads to unilateral paresis of the phrenic nerve causing reduced respiratory capacity.
      The latter offering discomfort and a potential risk in patients with lung diseases or heavy
      overweight.

      The suprascapular nerve is the most important nerve to the shoulder and a selective block of
      this nerve could offer a good pain relief without the mentioned side effects.

      In this randomized study the investigators wish to examine the pain relieving effect of a
      selective block of the suprascapular nerve after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

      40 patients are randomized to a block of this nerve with either active drug (Ropivacaine) or
      placebo (Saline). All patients will get a PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) pump for
      administration of i.v. morphine in doses based on age and weight.

      Patient are being monitored for 6 hours. The primary outcome is reduction in VAS at rest from
      baseline to 30 minutes after nerve block.
