      in combination with transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) may provide synergistic effects
      for the reduction of angina in patients who are not treatable with conventional coronary
      artery bypass or percutaneous coronary intervention. This safety and feasibility study is
      intended to confirm the work previously done at one hospital in a larger, multicenter
      setting. Patients who are candidates for TMR will be asked to participate.
