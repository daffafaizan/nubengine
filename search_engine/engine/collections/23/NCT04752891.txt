      represents the first reason for visiting physicians and for antibiotic prescription in
      children in developed countries. However, the diagnosis is not easy because of the narrowness
      of the ear canal, the discomfort of the child during the otoscopic exam. Moreover, the
      accuracy of the AOM diagnosis depends on the subjectivity of the physician mostly. This can
      result in an misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment with, as a result, the emergence of
      multi-resistant germ.

      Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is booming and has already proven its worth in terms
      of prevention, monitoring and diagnosis. I-Nside, an app based on Artificial Intelligence is
      able to make automatic diagnosis of many ear pathologies, after capturing picture of any
      eardrum using an otoendoscope fixed on a connected smartphone (SmartScopeÂ®).

      Therefore, the investigators aim to assess the accuracy of AOM diagnosis the existing app, by
      comparing the inter-rater agreement between the diagnosis made by a senior physician using a
      traditional otoscope (considered as "gold standard" ) and the one made by a junior physician
      using the app
