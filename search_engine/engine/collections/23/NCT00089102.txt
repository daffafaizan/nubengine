      Primary

        -  Determine response in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic renal
           cell carcinoma treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerance to and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine median and progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive 2 additional courses beyond best
      response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 30 months.
