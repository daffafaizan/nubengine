    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safe dose of BMS-986156 and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) (30 mg versus
      [vs] 100 mg) when combined with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) for patients with metastatic cancer.

      II. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of ipilimumab (3mg/kg) with BMS-986156 (30 or
      100 mg) administered in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting
      1-4 LIVER lesion(s) for patients with metastatic cancers.

      III. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of ipilimumab (3mg/kg) with BMS-986156 (30
      or 100 mg) administered in combination with SBRT targeting 1-4 LUNG lesion(s) for patients
      with metastatic cancer.

      IV. To determine safety and toxicity profile of nivolumab (480 mg) with BMS-986156 (30 mg)
      administered in combination with SBRT targeting 1-4 LIVER lesion(s) for patients with
      metastatic cancers.

      V. To determine safety and toxicity profile of nivolumab (480 mg) with BMS-986156 (30 mg)
      administered in combination with SBRT targeting 1-4 LUNG lesion(s) for patients with
      metastatic cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab therapy with BMS-986156 (30 or 100 mg) as
      well as nivolumab with BMS-986156 (30 mg) with SBRT treatment for 1-4 lung lesions in both
      the SBRT treated lesion and non-irradiate tumors.

      II. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab therapy with or without BMS-986156 (30 or
      100 mg) as well as nivolumab with BMS-986156 (30 mg) with SBRT treatment for 1-4 liver
      lesions in both the SBRT treated lesion and non-irradiate tumors.

      III. To compare response and progression of the non-irradiated tumors between BMS-986156 with
      ipilimumab vs BMS-986156 with nivolumab, using both immune-related response criteria (irRC)
      and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (V) 1.1.

      IV. To evaluate the predictive potential value of tumor-associated and systemic immune
      biomarkers for therapy effectiveness and toxicity prediction.

      V. To evaluate whether skeletal mass, neutrophil, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tumor
      bulk are correlated with clinical outcomes and adverse events.

      VI. To evaluate whether tumor kinetics in combination with clinical correlates can help
      determine treatment response.

      VII. To evaluate whether tumor mutational burden correlates with improved clinical outcomes
      and response criteria.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of anti-GITR agonistic monoclonal antibody
      BMS-986156, followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and anti-GITR
      agonistic monoclonal antibody BMS-986156 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Beginning day 1 of cycle 5 (day 85), patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and anti-GITR agonistic monoclonal
      antibody BMS-986156 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of
      cycle 2, patients then undergo SBRT on days 29-32 for 4 fractions or on days 29-40 for 10
      fractions. Beginning day 1 of cycle 5 (day 85), patents receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and anti-GITR agonistic monoclonal
      antibody BMS-986156 over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo SBRT over 30-45 minutes
      on days 1-4 for 4 fractions or on days 1-12 for 10 fractions. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 26 cycles of nivolumab and for up to 4 cycles of anti-GITR agonistic monoclonal
      antibody BMS-986156 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 2-4
      months for up to 1 year.
