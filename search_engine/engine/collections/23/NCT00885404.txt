    
      This is a prospective, controlled, before-and-after study. The baseline pre-intervention
      period will include collection of data while doctors and nurses are unaware that such
      collection is taking place. During this time, high chloride fluids (saline, Gelofusine, 4%
      albumin) will continue to be used according to standard practice with an estimated 30,000
      liters of saline as well as 2,000 bottles of Gelofusine® being consumed.

      Following a wash out period of education and preparation, there will be a complete shift to a
      working environment where use of saline, Gelofusine and any other fluids with a high chloride
      level (>110 mmol/L)will be restricted and substituted with fluids of lower chloride
      concentration similar to blood; either Hartmann's solution or Plasmalyte® or 20% albumin.

      The study will compare a 6 month control period (before) and a six month intervention period
      (after).
