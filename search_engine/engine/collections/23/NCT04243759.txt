      and consequences.

      The cued go/no-go (CGNG) task is an ideal choice for in-the-moment impairment feedback. Its
      instructions are simple; practice effects are minimal; and is sensitive to alcohol. The CGNG
      tests ability to respond fast to "go" targets (activation) while withholding response to
      "no-go" targets (inhibition). Activation/inhibition tension is externally valid. Dual process
      models posit risk behaviors stem from overactive appetitive drives that are compelling and
      hard to inhibit. Poor CGNG performance post-alcohol has been related to poor simulated
      driving, enhancing external validity. Moderate dosing to .05-.06% blood alcohol content (BAC)
      reliably increases inhibition errors, but slowing reaction time (RT) to "go" cues requires
      higher doses. RT to go cues often recovers later in a drinking episode (acute tolerance) but
      ability to inhibit does not. Thus at this BAC, ability to respond remains but inhibition is
      impaired, which relates to risk behaviors like DUI as young adults underrate impairment.
