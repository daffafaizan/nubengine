    
      Initially the investigator(s) will focus on imaging breast, pancreas, sarcoma, prostate
      cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, and head and neck cancer.

      STUDY AIMS

        1. determine the dosimetry for gallium-68 labelled (68Ga-) FAP-2286,

        2. evaluate the uptake and retention of radiotracer in a variety of solid tumors with
           FAP-2286, and

        3. evaluate the ability of FAP-2286 to detect metastatic disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        1. All cohorts: Safety of 68Ga-FAP-2286

        2. Cohort 1: determine the organ dosimetry of 68Ga-FAP-2286

        3. Cohort 2: determine the feasibility of detecting tumor uptake using 68Ga-FAP-2286

        4. Cohort 3: determine the feasibility of detecting metastatic disease using 68Ga-FAP-2286

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

        1. Correlation of 68Ga-FAP-2286 uptake with FAP expression determined by
           immunohistochemistry.

        2. Compare 68Ga-FAP-2286 scan results to archival Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET images.

        3. Compare biodistribution of 68Ga-FAP-2286 in normal organs and blood pool based on renal
           function.

        4. Determine impact of administered dose of 68Ga-FAP-2286 on image quality.

      A repeat 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET may be obtained after initiation of subsequent treatment in order
      to evaluate changes in PET uptake due to treatment effect. Patients will be followed for up
      to 3 days after the injection of 68Ga-FAP-2286 for evaluation of adverse events.
