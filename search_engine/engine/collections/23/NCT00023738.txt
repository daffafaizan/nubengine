        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when administered with neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-grade
           stage IIC-III soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival, local control, and overall survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine histological response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quantitative antiangiogenic effects of SU5416 in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SU5416.

      Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine
      IV continuously on days 1-3, 22-24, and 43-45. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.
      Patients undergo 2 courses of radiotherapy, given once daily for 11 doses per course over
      days 7-20 and 28-41. Patients also receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly beginning on
      day 1 and continuing until 2 days before surgery. Patients undergo surgical resection on day
      80. Patients then receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and
      dacarbazine IV continuously on days 101-103, 122-124, and 143-145. Patients also receive
      SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly beginning on day 101 and continuing until the end of
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with positive surgical margins receive additional
      radiotherapy beginning 2 weeks after resection for a total of 8 doses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 68-80 patients will be accrued for this study.
