      mortality and are increasingly being scaled up throughout sub-Saharan Africa. However, ITNs
      alone are unlikely to reduce transmission to zero in most settings and additional vector
      control tools are necessary. One new promising strategy is the use of insecticide treated
      wall liners (ITWLs). These are textiles treated with an insecticide that are used to line the
      inner walls of houses. The wall liners are considered a long-lasting alternative to indoor
      residual spraying which is also used for malaria vector control but is expensive to
      implement.

      Within 6 pairs of villages, we plan to randomly allocate one village in each pair to receive
      either ITNs or ITNs plus ITWLs. Households will be randomly selected from each village and
      all children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years will be enrolled in a cohort study.
      The children will be cleared of existing infections and then followed monthly until they are
      found to be infected with malaria. The study will last for 6 months and will demonstrate
      whether the ITWLs provide additional protection against malaria over that provided by the use
      of ITNs.
