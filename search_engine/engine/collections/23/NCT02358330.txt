      healthcare practices that are designed to efficiently identify smokers and recruit them into
      a chronic care treatment for smoking (which will be developed and evaluated in Projects 2-4).
      The EHR enhancements will include: 1) smoker identification and documentation aids, 2) a
      "Smoker Registry" (which stores relevant data on smokers and facilitates tracking their
      smoking status over time), 3) a 1-click system to refer smokers to the chronic care treatment
      for smoking, 4) a closed-loop function to provide EHR feedback to clinicians on the outcomes
      of their referrals, and 5) communications resources to inform smokers of treatment options
      and to increase their recruitment into treatment. The effects of the EHR-based enhancements
      and the chronic care smoking treatment will be evaluated with a multiple baseline design
      involving 18 primary care clinics in three healthcare systems in Wisconsin; all participants
      for affiliated clinical research Projects will be recruited from these clinics. This highly
      innovative research will evaluate the impact of an integrated set of EHR enhancements-coupled
      with a chronic care approach to smoking treatment-on smoker identification, and smoking
      treatment referral and engagement. In addition, this research will explore factors that
      influence the use of EHR-based enhancements in clinics. In sum, this research will develop a
      set of EHR-based health system enhancements that increase both the adoption of chronic care
      treatment by healthcare systems and smokers' engagement in that treatment.
