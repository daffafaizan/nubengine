      cornea department of our clinic with thin cornea and hydrops in chronic stage and minimal dry
      eye symptoms. Minimum corneal pachymetry in the right eye was 378 Âµm as measured by optical
      coherence tomography(AS-OCT-Zeiss). Atlas corneal topography showed steep K-values 82.60
      ax.37 and flat K 75.15 D ax 127 with -7.45 corneal astigmatism. Her best corrected visual
      acuity was 0.0.5 in right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed intense
      punctate epitheliopathy (Figure 1), tear film break-up time (TBUT) was measured as 7-8 sec
      and Schirmer test was 10 mm in right eye, and the other eye examinations were determined
      normally.
