    
      This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled pilot clinical
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of two infusions of Wharton Jelly mesenchymal stromal
      cells (WJ-MSC) in patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary
      to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study will enroll 30 patients who after signing the informed
      consent will be checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will then be
      randomized (1:1) to one of the 2 treatment arms: Treatment A WJ-MSC/WJ-MSC; Treatment B
      Placebo/ Placebo. The 2 infusions will be administered endovenously on day 1 (D1) and on D3.
      Thereafter, patients will be followed-up on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 Once the study is
      completed, controls will be established at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months as long-term
      follow-up.

      The study treatments (A or B) will be added on top of the Standard of Care treatment
      prescribed by the attending physician. Each dose of MSC-WJ will consist of the intravenous
      administration of 1E6cells/Kg.

      Recruitment will be competitive for the centers participating in the study. A Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to review safety and efficacy along the trial.
