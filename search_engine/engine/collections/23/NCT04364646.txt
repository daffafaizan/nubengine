      prescribed sleep schedule to usual treatment for depression can reduce depression and anxiety
      symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum. The study is enrolling pregnant woman between
      the ages of 18 and 40 who have been diagnosed with depression and (possibly) anxiety.

      This study takes place from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 18 weeks postpartum. Women who
      take part in this study will be randomly assigned ("randomized") into one of the study
      treatment groups (1) the "usual care" group (UC); or (2) the group that receives bright light
      therapy and a prescribed sleep schedule, also called the "Personalized Integrated
      Chronotherapy" group (PIC). The usual care group will receive medications and/or talk therapy
      as decided by the woman and her doctor. Women in the integrated chronotherapy group will
      receive usual care (as above) and will also receive a bright light box to sit with every
      morning for up to 60 minutes as prescribed by the study doctor. Light will be delivered with
      a portable, broad-spectrum light box. Both groups will have their sleep and light levels
      monitored during 3rd trimester of pregnancy (weeks 28-40) and weeks 2-6 and 18 after the baby
      is born (postpartum weeks 2-6 and 18) Sleep monitoring takes place in the home using a small
      wrist activity monitor called an "actigraph." Participants will also be asked to provide
      three saliva sample sets over the course of the study to measure melatonin levels.

      In addition to the "Personalized Integrated Chronotherapy" study treatment that will
      supplement the clinical care as described above, participants will be asked to come in for
      research study visits.
