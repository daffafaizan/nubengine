      (insulin pumps, CSII) will be randomized and take part at four dosing visits. The dosing
      visits are separated by 3-7 days. For the three lowest dose levels (0.03 mg, 0.08 mg, and 0.2
      mg) the patients will receive two doses of ZP4207(dasiglucagon) (the first at euglycaemic and
      the second at hypoglycaemic conditions) and one dose of glucagon at euglycaemic conditions at
      visit 2-4. The first two dose administrations (Day 1, visit 2-4) will be separated by at
      least five hours. The third dose, which is ZP4207(dasiglucagon) during hypoglycemia, will for
      all dosing visits be administered the next morning after a standardized carbohydrate-rich
      meal in the evening before. The patients will stay at the clinical site over night between
      Day 1 and Day 2. The dose of 0.6 mg will only be administered for ZP4207(dasiglucagon). The
      order of the micro-dose levels as well as the order of the treatment, ZP4207(dasiglucagon)
      vs. glucagon, will be randomized. For all patients the 0.6 mg dose of ZP4207(dasiglucagon)
      will be administered at visit 5.

      For each dose level there will be 2 sets of PK/PD profiles for ZP4207(dasiglucagon), one
      initiated during euglycaemia and another during hypoglycaemia. Each patient enrolled will
      therefore provide a total of 11 PK/PD profiles covering four different dose levels; 8
      profiles from ZP4207(dasiglucagon) and 3 profiles from glucagon
