      non-inferior to CT or MRI in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) treatments. All patients will receive standard
      of care CT/MRI and will also get a contrast ultrasound to directly compare.

      Timepoint 0- Our proposed study population includes subjects with diagnosed HCC, who are
      treated with TACE. Patients will be identified and enrolled at the time of initial TACE.

      Timepoint 1- Following initial TACE, patients will receive a CT or MRI, as routinely ordered
      in the post-TACE setting, to assess for residual or new HCC. At this same imaging follow-up
      visit, patients will also receive a one-time additional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).
      Timepoint 2- Per standard clinical care, patients typically return for repeat imaging
      (CT/MRI) within 2-4 months following the first imaging visit.
