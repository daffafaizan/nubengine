      Bleeding from esophagogastric varices (EV) is a major complication of portal hypertension.
      Beta-blockers are a well-established cornerstone of portal hypertension treatment. Band
      ligation is the best endoscopic treatment to prevent EV bleeding. The exact benefit of
      beta-blocker association to band ligation remains to be defined, especially for primary
      prophylaxis. This prospective randomized controlled trial will compare EBL with propranolol
      and EBL alone in primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding among cirrhotic patients with
      high-risk varices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients with high-risk varices will be randomly
      allocated to EBL plus propranolol (Group I) or EBL alone (Group II). EBL will be performed at
      3-week interval till obliteration of varices. In Group I, incremental dosage of propranolol
      (sufficient to reduce heart rate to 55 beats/min or 25% reduction from baseline) will be
      administered and will be continued after obliteration of varices until the end of the study.
      The follow-up of patients will be 2 years. The primary outcome of this study will be EV
      recurrence during two years of follow-up. The secondary outcomes will be EV eradication,
      bleeding before eradication, mortality and complications during the same follow-up.
