      weeks of infusions. A maximum of 27 total subjects will be dosed with KD-247 and up to 9
      total will receive placebo. Per cohort subjects randomized to active treatment will receive
      iv infusions of KD 247 over 2 hours at each dosing visit. Subjects randomized to placebo will
      receive 2-hour iv infusions of saline solution at each dosing visit. Following the first
      infusion of KD-247 (or placebo) for each subject in the study, there will be a 24-hour
      in-patient observation period before the next subject can be randomized within the study.
      Dose escalation will proceed only after safety data through Day 18 for all subjects in the
      lower-dose cohort is reviewed.
