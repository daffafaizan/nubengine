        -  Determine the differences in frequency, severity, and duration of hot flash activity
           using an ambulatory sternal skin conductance recording tool and patient hot flash diary
           in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.

        -  Assess the recordings made by an ambulatory sternal skin conductance measuring and
           recording tool during a 30-minute exercise period in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients wear an ambulatory sternal skin conductance hot flash device continuously
      for 24 hours.

      Patients complete hot flash diaries over 24 hours. Patients undergo treadmill exercise over
      30 minutes and record hot flash activity using the skin conductance device during 10 minutes
      of sweating. Patients also complete the Comfort, Bother, and Weight Questionnaire at the
      completion of the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3 patients will be accrued for this study.
