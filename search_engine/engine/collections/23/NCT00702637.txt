      today. These persons may face many issues, however, two chronic problems seem common to a
      strikingly large number of those who survive TBI: fatigue and EDS.

      Need for Research: Modafinil has been shown to be useful for fatigue and sleepiness in
      patients with depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and individuals with EDS
      secondary to a variety of sleep disturbances. However, there has not been any controlled
      evaluation of Modafinil use for the treatment of individuals with TBI to date.

      Current and Future Research Activity: Approximately 60 participants with post-TBI fatigue
      will be randomly assigned to two 10-week periods of taking either Modafinil or placebo.
      Participants taking Modafinil during the first 10 weeks will be switched to placebo for the
      second 10 weeks. Similarly, participants taking placebo during the first 10 weeks will be
      switched to Modafinil for the second 10 weeks. Outcomes relating to fatigue and EDS will be
      collected weekly throughout the study. Other outcomes (including general health, depression,
      and cognitive function) will be collected at the start of each period, 4 weeks into each
      period, and again at the end of each period. It is hypothesized that participants taking
      Modafinil will report significantly less fatigue and EDS, report significantly better general
      health and depression scores, and perform significantly better on tests of cognitive
      performance in comparison to participants taking placebo.
