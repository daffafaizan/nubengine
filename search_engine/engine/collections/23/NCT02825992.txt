      A prospective, single-arm, multi-center, multi-national non-randomized study designed to
      provide clinical data regarding the use of the AcQMap™ System in the ablation of persistent
      atrial fibrillation. (CL-AF-001 - Canadian)

      The research study was conducted in the EU and Canada. The protocol and the corresponding NCT
      number is as follows:

      NCT02462980 (Protocol CL-AF-001, Site Ontario, Canada Dr. Verma = PI)

      The above record was combined into one as both protocols are essentially identical (one is
      post market [EU] and the other pre-market [Canada] and one study report will be written that
      encompasses the data/results for both protocols.
