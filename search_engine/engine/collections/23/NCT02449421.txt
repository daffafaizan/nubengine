      and improved CPT delivery: Fidelity-oriented learning community (FID-LC) and Continuous
      Quality Improvement Learning Community (CQI-LC). Clinics in which clinicians have previously
      received CPT training will be randomly assigned to one of these conditions. Outcomes will be
      observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment, independent expert
      assessment of clinician fidelity and adaptations in delivering the psychotherapy (via
      audio-recordings), proportion of eligible caseloads that receive CPT, and capacity to deliver
      CPT. Data will also be collected to assess clinician and setting characteristics that may
      contribute to the success of each strategy. The study results will help inform how best to
      support the ongoing implementation and benefits of evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT)
      in routine clinical settings. This is a knowledge translation project in partnership with 3
      systems; VA Canada, U.S. Veterans Health Care System and the National Centre for PTSD.
