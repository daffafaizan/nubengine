      CS can effectively prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity however, there are
      many short and long-term complications of CS. One of the most common complications is the CS
      scar defect. CS scar defects can develop after transverse incision of the lower uterine
      segment, which may result in prolonged postmenstrual bleeding, spotting, pelvic pain, and
      infertility. Suture material is an essential part of any major surgery, serving to hold
      opposing tissues together and accelerate the healing process, resulting in decreased scarring
      of the affected areas. We sought to evaluate the effects of different synthetic absorbable
      suture materials on cesarean scar defect formation.
