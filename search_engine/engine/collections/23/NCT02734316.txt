    
      This observational study is aimed at evaluating the peri-endoscopic management of DOACs in
      patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures and the adverse events
      (bleeding and thromboembolic events) associated with.

      All consecutive patients undergoing elective procedures and providing informed consent will
      be included.

      Primary end-point:

      incidence of major bleeding events according to International Society Thrombosis Haemostasis
      (ISTH) criteria and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events occuring during the
      endoscopy procedures or within 30 days, according to International Society Thrombosis
      Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria in patients in which DOACs have been managed according to
      European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines

      Secondary end points:

        -  incidence of major bleeding and clinically relent non-major events in the overall
           patient population

        -  incidence of bleeding events in the overall patient population

        -  incidence of thromboembolic events in the overall patient population and in patients in
           which DOACs have been managed according to ESGE guidelines

        -  compliance with ESGE guidelines
