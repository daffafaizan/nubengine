      flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride and attached on the hubs of the TCC. As recommended by the
      producer, the TEGO® remains during 3 consecutive HD sessions and is changed every week. By
      constituting a mechanical barrier, it could be an interesting alternative to reduce the
      intraluminal contamination and the risk of TCC-B.

      The TEGO® connector is supposed to provide an automatic positive displacement of fluid at the
      end of each TCC flush. This positive pressure could prevent the reflux of blood into the TCC
      lumen, possibly resulting in TCC-D.

      As the impact of the TEGO® connector on TCC-D and TCC-B has never been studied, we conducted
      a randomized controlled study in our center by comparing the anti-thrombotic and
      anti-infectious efficacy of the TEGO® connector to trisodium citrate 46.7% (Citralock®,
      Dirinco, www.citra-lock.com) . The global cost of both procedures was also evaluated.
