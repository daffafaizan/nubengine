        -  Evaluate the toxicity, immunologic reactivity, and possible therapeutic efficacy of
           immunization with dendritic cells presenting the MART-1 and gp100 melanoma antigens with
           or without interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1 and gp100
      antigens.

      Patients receive vaccinations with dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1 and gp100 antigens,
      either intralymphatically every 4 weeks for 2 doses, or IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Some
      patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously or IV, over 3-5 days, beginning 24 hours
      after immunization.

      Cohorts of 2-9 patients receive escalating doses of pulsed dendritic cells IV until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Subsequent cohorts receive cells
      with or without interleukin-2. One cohort may expand to 15 patients to determine the accuracy
      of immunologic response to the vaccine.

      One cohort of 11 patients receives cells intralymphatically without interleukin-2 every 3-4
      weeks for 2 courses. Patients with stable disease or who achieve minor, mixed, or partial
      response may be retreated.

      Patients with stable or responding disease undergo a second course of vaccination. Patients
      who completed treatment with vaccine alone and have stable disease, progressive disease,
      disease progression after a response, or a partial response with no further improvement may
      receive 2 additional courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
