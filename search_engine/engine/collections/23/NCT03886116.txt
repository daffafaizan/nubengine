      Disease (ESRD) is steadily increasing in Singapore as well as other countries worldwide.
      Around 85 - 90% of the prevalent dialysis population is on Hemodialysis and Arteriovenous
      Fistula (AVF).

      AVF is considered the Gold standard for safe and effective vascular access for hemodialysis
      treatment due to its low rates of complication. However, Primary Failure rate of AVFs remain
      high at around 20 - 25% depending on the site of the surgery, contributed by several factors
      including the diameter of the artery and the vein used for AVF formation.

      If Pre-operative exercise improves the hemodynamics of the AVF and aids the maturation rate
      in our study, it can be incorporated into clinical guidelines to reduce the primary failure
      rate of AVF.

      Even though, there is sufficient evidence to support the beneficial role of the forearm
      exercises on fistula blood flow and maturation, there are no studies looking at the effects
      of Pre-Operative Exercise on AVF maturation. Our Study is aiming to fulfil this gap in
      knowledge.
