      exposure-response study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pediatric systemic lupus. The study
      will measure a participant's adherence to HCQ self-administration using an electronic pill
      bottle cap that records date/time of bottle opening and provides participants with a reminder
      when a dosage is due and/or missed. All participants will be provided with the electronic
      pill bottle cap to use with their regular HCQ prescription at the start of the study. For the
      first 2 weeks of the trial, the electronic notifications will be disabled to determine a
      baseline measure of adherence. Within 1 day after Visit 2, the electronic notifications will
      be turned on for all participants, resulting in a series of alerts (via electronic pill
      bottle cap alerts and smartphone push notifications, text message, and/or automated phone
      calls). Participants will continue to receive notifications via the electronic pill bottle
      cap through Visit 4. Throughout the study, participants will undergo a series of blood draws
      and urinalysis collections, and be asked to complete various questionnaires.
