      ethnic/racial minority adolescents due, in part, to poor sleep hygiene. Despite successful
      sleep hygiene interventions in younger children, none focus on adolescents, a group with
      unique developmental needs. Urban adolescents face unique contextual stressors, which may
      contribute to ineffective use of sleep hygiene behaviors. Mind-body integrative (MBIH)
      approaches (e.g. yoga, meditation) improve sleep quality in adults, but are rarely applied to
      adolescents. MBIH has been shown to reduce stress among adolescents. Taken together, this
      suggests that integrating MBIH with sleep hygiene strategies has the potential for a
      synergistic effect on improving sleep quality, yet no interventions concurrently use MBIH and
      sleep hygiene with adolescents.
