      Gung Memorial Hospital between 1992 and 2004 with continuous serum creatinine values measured
      before admission were included in this analysis. Data were obtained from medical records of
      the database center of our institution. Demographic and clinical data were assessed. The age,
      sex, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), underlying comorbidities, CAD risk
      factors (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity,
      defined as a BMI > 30) and clinical presentation were included in this study. Hemodynamic
      parameters including the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and left
      ventricular ejection fraction were also obtained. Coronary angiography was performed using a
      low-osmolarity non-ionic contrast medium (iodixanol) by experienced cardiologist. Coronary
      artery disease was defined as a 50% or greater lumen narrowing of a major epicardial artery
      or its branches. A left main stenosis of 50% or greater was regarded as equivalent to
      2-vessel disease. Blood samples were collected during admission before angiographic
      procedure. Values of hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelet, high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CRP) and troponin I was included. The treatment modality was divided into three
      categories: medical, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, including balloon angioplasty
      with or without stent placement) and coronary artery bridge graft (CABG) on the basis of
      clinical condition and angiographic finding. The outcome was followed-up until 12 months
      after angiographic procedure. The estimated total study patient number is approximately 1000
      patients.
