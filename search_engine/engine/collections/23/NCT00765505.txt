        1. To determine whether aerobic exercise improves both skeletal muscle fat distribution and
           insulin sensitivity of older men and women. We will test two hypotheses.

           i. Physical exercise in older adults will decrease the amount of fat interspersed within
           muscle, specifically the fat between muscle groups (intermuscular adipose tissue) as
           well as decrease specific lipid metabolites within muscle cells, compared to controls.

           ii. Exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity of older men and women will be
           related to the changes in muscle fat content independent of changes in total body fat or
           visceral abdominal adipose tissue.

        2. To determine whether increased capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism within
           muscle results in improved insulin sensitivity in older adults. We will test two
           hypotheses.

           i. Exercise training will increase the capacity of muscle to oxidize fatty acids
           assessed both in vitro and in vivo.

           ii. Improved capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism will predict improvements in
           insulin sensitivity.
