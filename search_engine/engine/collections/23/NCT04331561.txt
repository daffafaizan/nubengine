      visually-induced dizziness may result in falls. The researchers created new tests of
      orientation and balance, as well as a new treatment for visually-induced dizziness. It is not
      known whether the new tests of orientation and balance are better, worse, or the same as
      existing tests in the ability to detect problems, nor is it known if the new treatment
      technique is any better, worse, or the same as existing treatments for dizziness and
      imbalance. However, the researchers hypothesize that the new tests will improve the ability
      to detect problems. They hypothesize that the treatment will result in less dizziness, better
      balance, and reduced risk of falling for those who receive it and that it is a better
      alternative to treatments that are already available to patients.

      In order to see if this is true, the researchers will use the new tests and treatments with
      adults who are affected by dizziness. All participants in this study will undergo the same
      tests and will receive the same treatment. Testing is done twice before and once after the
      treatment period. The tests and treatment are done while standing on a computerized platform
      that measures balance and can tilt people from side to side. During these study procedures,
      participants wear virtual reality goggles that show them simple images in an otherwise dark
      environment.

      The goal of the tests and the treatment is for participants to use what they feel to help
      them decide if the images shown inside the goggles are aligned with the person's sense of
      gravity. Participation in this study is voluntary and people who decide to participate may
      stop at any time without penalty.
