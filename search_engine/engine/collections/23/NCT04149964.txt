      controversial, as there is no consensus statement regarding current guidelines to direct
      clinical practice. Recent legislation limits opioid prescription length to 5 days only, which
      brings into question whether legislation will affect prescribing practices of physicians and
      whether or not giving patients an alternative to opiates will be a more efficacious route.

      Current prescribing practices for septum and sinus surgery of the Otolaryngology private
      practice group includes as-needed acetaminophen 325 mg and as-needed
      acetaminophen/hydrocodone 7.5 mg/325 mg. If it can be demonstrated that use of 650 mg
      acetaminophen in scheduled doses of every 6 hours can decrease postoperative opiate use in
      the first week without significantly increase in patient pain, this may be deployed as an
      effective strategy of pain control as the use of opiates has come under scrutiny and attempts
      are being made to decrease or limit the use of these medications in the medical setting.

      This study would look to demonstrate that scheduled doses of acetaminophen as opposed to
      reactionary as-needed acetaminophen can control post-operative pain to the point where
      narcotics would not be necessary.
