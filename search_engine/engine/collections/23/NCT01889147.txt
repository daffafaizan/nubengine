    
      In the current study the peak plasma concentration (pharmacokinetics/elimination) of
      [14C]-labelled hRESCAP in healthy volunteers will be investigated at increasing single doses
      (up to anticipated therapeutic dose), with a microdose (≤30 nmol) as a safe starting dose.

        -  Part 1: To assess the peak plasma concentration of a single microdose (≤30 nmol) of a
           recombinant human protein (hRESCAP), administered intravenously, as a suitable technique
           to predict the pharmacokinetics in humans at pharmacologically relevant doses;

        -  Part 2: To determine the safety and tolerability of single dose of hRESCAP up to 5300 µg
           in healthy male volunteers administered intravenously;

        -  To determine the peak plasma concentration of hRESCAP in healthy male volunteers within
           a pharmacologically relevant dose-range and compare this with BIAP pharmacokinetics with
           emphasis on half-life (t1/2).
