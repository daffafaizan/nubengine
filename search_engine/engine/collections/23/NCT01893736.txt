      support improves breastfeeding outcomes.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. Exclusive breastfeeding rates at 1, 2, and 3 months will be increased among
           mother-infant pairs who receive professional lactation support or telephone follow-up
           support (intervention groups) when compared with those who receive usual post-natal
           breastfeeding support (control group);

        2. The rate of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) at 1, 2, and 3 months will be
           increased among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those
           in the control group;

      The secondary hypotheses are:

        1. The overall duration of exclusive breastfeeding will be increased among mother-infant
           pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the control group;

        2. The overall duration of any breastfeeding (predominant or partial) will be increased
           among mother-infant pairs in the intervention groups when compared with those in the
           control group.
