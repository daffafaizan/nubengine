      over the past decade for both its known and theorized health benefits. Patients, clinicians
      and researchers have all been alerted to the increasing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
      (defined as level of 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL) and the significance of the extra-skeletal health
      effects of vitamin D. Aside from the skeletal impacts of Vitamin D, there has been recent
      evidence about potential health benefits of vitamin D related to the multiple extra-skeletal
      roles of this hormone. In fact, vitamin D receptors are found in many organs including brain,
      heart, skin, small intestine, gonads, prostate and breast as well in almost all nucleated
      cells including osteoblasts, activated T and B-lymphocytes, and B islet cells. Studies in
      children and adolescents as well as in adults show associations of vitamin D deficiency with
      cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal health, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.

      While Vitamin D deficiency is quite prevalent, adolescents who are obese or who are darker
      skinned are consistently shown to have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than lean and
      lighter skinned adolescents. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency and maintenance of sufficient
      levels in adolescents are largely under-studied leaving patients and clinicians without clear
      evidence-based guidelines to follow.

      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of different treatment regimens for vitamin
      D deficiency in our population of predominantly minority adolescents and to examine the
      effect of correction of vitamin D deficiency on selected extra-skeletal targets of vitamin D
      action including musculoskeletal, cardiometabolic, and immune function.
