      Primary

        -  Evaluate the activity of etoposide, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, celecoxib, and
           fenofibrate, in terms of prolonging the time to disease progression, in young patients
           with relapsed or progressive cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the biologic activity of this regimen, in terms of tumor
           response and overall survival, in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate different radiographic techniques as markers of tumor response in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the predictive ability of in vitro correlative studies as markers of tumor
           response.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: Patients were classified into one of 8 strata according to diagnosis:
      leukemia/lymphoma, bone tumors, neuroblastoma, high grade glial tumors, low grade glial
      tumors, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/PNET, and miscellaneous. A two-stage design for each
      disease stratum was planned. The accrual goal at the end of the two-stage design was 20
      subjects for each stratum. A stopping rule was applied after the accrual of the first 10
      eligible subjects enrolled in each disease stratum. If 1 or more patients in the first 10
      evaluable patients were alive and progression-free at 27 weeks and have tolerated therapy
      then accrual to stage two would proceed. Among 20 patients within a stratum, if 3 or more
      patients met primary endpoint then regimen would be considered successful. The probability of
      concluding the treatment is feasible is 0.95 if true success rate is 30% and 0.07 if true
      succes rate is 5%. Overall accrual target was 80-160 patients. Please see published
      manuscript (Robison et al Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014) for results within disease strata.
