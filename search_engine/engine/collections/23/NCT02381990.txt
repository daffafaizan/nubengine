    
      CLINICAL TRIAL OF OBSERVATION NATURE

      PRIMARY OUTCOME

      Cancer control of treated areas 5 years after intervention based on prostate biopsy of
      initial treated area

      SECONDARY OUTCOMES

      Lack of cancer presence or progression 5 years after initial intervention by MP-MRI imaging;
      urinary and sexual function changes in quality of life; anxiety related to cancer and cancer
      control, number of biopsies required during study period; need of further treatment for
      prostate cancer; treatment tolerance to local anesthesia

      DATA COLLECTION

        -  Complete H&P, family history, past medical and surgical history, social history,
           allergies, and medications

        -  Procedure Specifics Assessing Prostate, Seminal Vesicles and Urethral Contouring by
           MP-MRI. Dominant lesions and secondary lesions contouring my MP-MRI. Co-Registration
           quality, date of procedure, cryoprobes used, freeze/thaw cycles timing, temperatures at
           neurovascular bundles, denonvilliers fascia. Urethral warmer requirements

        -  Follow up information: 30 day perioperative outcomes (incidence of UTI, urinary
           retention, failure of local anesthetic, pain measures). 6 week, 3,6,9,12 month and then
           every 6 month measures of PSA, Testosterone levels, Urinary Function and Sexual Function
           inventories, Overall anxiety and regret related to diagnosis and treatment

        -  Uroflow and PVR measurements by 3 to 6 month of treatment

        -  MP MRI on a yearly basis, for years 2,3,4 after treatment, biopsy driven by new
           suspicious MRI findings

        -  MP MRI triggered by elevation in PSA velocity or PSA level 10% above diagnosis

        -  Transperineal Fusion Guided Prostate biopsy at 1st year - emphasis on treated areas,
           suspicious MRI areas

        -  Transperineal Fusion Guided Prostate biopsy at 5th year - emphasis on treated areas,
           suspicious MRI areas

      SAFETY MEASURES

        -  Periodic evaluation of registry to ensure consistency in follow up

        -  Patient remainders of tests required
