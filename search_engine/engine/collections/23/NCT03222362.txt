      above, who underwent pars plana vitrecromy in the Tel Aviv Medical Center during the years
      01/01/2006 - 31/12/2013, and were followed by physicians in the ophthalmology department in
      the center until December 2015. We will be measuring visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure,
      demographics (age, gender), indication for surgery, ocular co-morbidities, surgical
      parameters (time of surgery, type of anesthesia - general or local, type of suture), and
      intraoperative and postoperative complications.

      Primary outcome - visual acuity will be measured at base line, after 1 week, 1 month, 3
      months, 6 months / last follow up (until December 2015). visual acuity will be determined by
      a standardized chart test (Snellen chart). For statistical analysis, all VA values were
      converted to logMAR scale. According to Holladay and the University of Freiburg study group
      results, blindness was set at 0.00125/2.9 (decimal/logMAR), light perception at 0.0025/2.6,
      hand movements at 0.005/2.3 and counting fingers at 0.014/1.85. Data will be analyzed using
      SPSS software. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant and t-tests
      analysis will be used to compare between means.

      Secondary outcomes - demographics, Indication for surgery, ocular co morbidities will be
      measured at baseline. Surgical parameters and intraoperative complications will be measured
      at 1 week. Postoperative complications will be measured during follow up after 1 week, 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months / last follow up (until December 2015).

      Complications will be measured by examination of intraocular pressure, slit-lamp and fundus
      (Ophthalmoscopic Exam).
