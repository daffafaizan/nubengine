      or toxicities, which, if untreated, can lead to poorer quality of life, decreased patient
      well-being, and worse clinical outcomes. Routine monitoring of patients while under active
      treatment can entail the routine practice of clinic visits at regular intervals with the
      acquisition of vital signs, routine laboratory testing, patient-reported outcome surveys, and
      face-to-face interaction with their physician.

      In recent years, the availability of commercially-available wearable fitness sensors has
      allowed end-users to monitor their fitness progress and activity levels. These devices depend
      on small sensors that can collect minute-to-minute data on heart rate and activity level that
      may be transmitted to a smartphone or computer. Through this system, users can easily track
      and monitor their fitness progress.

      In this trial, the investigator will seek to determine the feasibility of wearable biometric
      sensors to acquire high resolution biometric data, including heart rate and activity level
      (i.e. steps) for patients undergoing radiation therapy and surgery, with or without
      postoperative radiotherapy. The investigator believe that changes in heart rate may predict
      for increasing pain, dehydration, and stress in general. Moreover, changes in daily step
      count are a surrogate for performance status on treatment, and the investigator will perform
      a series of preliminary analyses to assess whether there is validity to this hypothesis. The
      investigator hope to use biometric monitoring to identify patients at risk for adverse
      outcomes, with the ultimate goal of intervening before these outcomes occur.
