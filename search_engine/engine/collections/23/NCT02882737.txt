      A randomized placebo-controlled single-blinded study will be conducted. The subjects do not
      know if they get glucagon or placebo but the investigator know if the subject get glucagon or
      placebo. Study participants have to complete three study days and serve as their own
      controls. After participants have given an informed consent, they will go through three
      steps:

        1. Screening day

        2. Run-in period

        3. Three study days in a random order:

             -  Exercise and glucagon injected after cycling/or during cycling in case of
                hypoglycemia

             -  Resting and glucagon after resting

             -  Exercise and glucagon subcutaneous before cycling

      47-49 hours before the study visits one CGM device is placed on the abdominal wall on the
      participant at least 7 cm from the site of the insulin pump infusion set. One CGM is placed
      on the non-dominant upper arm between 10 cm from elbow and 10 cm from shoulder on the
      posterior/lateral side on the arm. The CGMs will be in place for seven days. The CGM readings
      on the CGM placed at the abdominal wall are not blinded for the participant. The CGM readings
      on the CGM placed on the arm is blinded for the participant. In the period from the study
      visits to 4 days after the study visits the participant will do self-monitoring of blood
      glucose 8 times a day on standardized times.
