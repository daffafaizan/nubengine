      in-residence at the treatment center and meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V criteria
      for substance use disorder in Mental Health and Neurological Diseases Training and Research
      Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosurgery; Child and Adolescent Drug and Alcohol
      Dependence Treatment Center (CEMATEM) in Istanbul.

      Sample Size Determination: The sample size and power calculations were performed using the
      Instat sample size calculator. The calculations were based on the average value of the
      6-Minute Walk Test in the 15-20 age group was 725.8 meters and the standard deviation (SD)
      was 61.2 meters (28), in the 95% confidence interval, an alpha level of 0.05, a Î² level of 5%
      and a power of 95%.These parameters generated a sample size of at least 18 participants for
      each group.

      Randomization Study Protocol: The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 parallel
      groups to receive either Exercise or Control. To allocate the participants to the groups,
      using the method of randomly permuted blocks using Research Randomizer, a program published
      on a publicly accessible official website (www.randomizer.org). Computerized random numbers
      were conducted, and sequentially numbered index cards with the random assignment were
      prepared. The index cards were folded and placed in sealed, opaque envelopes. Then, the
      investigator opened each envelope and allocated the participants to the Exercise or control
      group according to the selected index card.
