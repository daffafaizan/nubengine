      action. Information on the occurrence of diseases and cardiovascular risk in the participant
      and his family was collected from research studies. Anthropometric parameters were measured
      (body weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, neck circumference) as well as blood pressure
      and pulse measurement. In addition, fasting venous blood was collected and secured. In venous
      blood currently marked with the following concentration: glucose, required cholesterol, LDL
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, a method of salting out and
      protecting DNA was developed from blood.

      Furthermore the polymorphisms of VEGF genes (in positions: -2578 and -634) using the HMR
      (High Resolution Melt) method was determined.

      Also VEGF and leptin by ELISA was determined. After obtaining the results of comparative
      analysis of the correlation between the occurrence of VEGF gene polymorphisms, serum levels
      of leptin and VEGF, and anthropometric and biochemical parameters of cardiovascular risk.
