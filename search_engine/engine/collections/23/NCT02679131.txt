      A phase I, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine safety and pharmacokinetics of
      belinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies
      and to determine the PK profiles in patients with renal impairment. Eligible patients will be
      assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts (A, B, C or D) based on their level of renal function (normal,
      mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment) and receive belinostat dose A for normal or mild
      renal impairment, and dose B for moderate or severe renal impairment.

      Enrollment into all cohorts will occur simultaneously rather than sequentially except in the
      following instance: Before any patient is enrolled in Cohort D, safety will be assessed for
      at least 1 patient in Cohort C through the end of Cycle 6. If the patient in Cohort C
      experiences a toxicity that is at least Grade 3 in severity, Cohort D will proceed at a
      reduced starting dose.

      Belinostat will be administered via a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion once daily on Days
      1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle (for up to 6 cycles). Clinical safety will be monitored in each
      patient, and up to two dose reductions from the starting dose (not less than 250mg/m^2) is
      allowed based on pre-defined criteria.

      If a patient cannot tolerate the reduced dose due to Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, belinostat
      administration must be discontinued. Dose escalation is not allowed. Blood samples for PK
      analysis will be collected from Day 1 to Day 3, and urine samples for PK analysis will be
      collected from Day 1 to Day 4.
