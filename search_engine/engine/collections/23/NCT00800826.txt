      Morphine is the commonest opioid for PCA, however its side effects are troublesome.
      Morphine-related side effects include pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary
      retention, respiratory depression, and sedation. Many studies had been conducted to reduce
      the side effect of morphine. The current trend of reducing morphine side effect is direct
      combination of other drugs and morphine in PCA. The advantages of this method are convenient
      in clinical use and preventive for side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selec¬tive
      α2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been reported to cause sedative effects and reduce
      opioid requirements in the perioperative period. The main advantage of this drug is that it
      does not cause serious respiratory side effects. The analgesic, sedative/hypnotic and
      anxiolytic prop¬erties of dexmedetomidine make this drug potentially useful for postoperative
      sedation and analgesia. No previous study had investigated the effect of direct combination
      of dexmedetomidine and morphine in PCA. The goal of this study is to investigate the
      combination effect of dexmedetomidine and morphine in postoperative patient-controlled
      analgesia.
