      sleep deprivation has been shown to result in marked improvement in 60% of depressed
      patients, although maintenance of therapeutic effects have not been sustained with wake
      therapy alone. This pilot study will assess the effectiveness of wake therapy in treating
      both bipolar depression (5 participants)and major depression (5 participants), as well as the
      effectiveness of concomitant light therapy and lithium in maintaining the therapeutic
      effects. Participants will undergo direct observation in the hospital for one week during
      initial treatment with alternating nights of sleep deprivation, light therapy and lithium
      treatment, and then will be seen weekly as outpatients for 6 weeks.
