      warfarin may lead to serious complications and ineffective. Based on the results of the
      research on the transformation of warfarin pharmacogenomics, this study investigates the
      clinical application of gene-directed warfarin dose prediction model through the preset
      dosage regimen of warfarin during the initial treatment phase. Compared with the conventional
      treatment, that is to say empirical medication, this study is to verify the feasibility and
      value of gene-oriented warfarin dose prediction model, in order to establish a practical
      guidance to optimize the rational use of warfarin treatment program, to enable patients to
      obtain effective, safe warfarin dose, and to achieve the established anticoagulant strength
      faster and safer, as the same time, to reduce the times of patients was blood and the
      incidence of bleeding/embolism, and to save costs and ensure the safety of warfarin clinical
      medication.
