      renal toxic threats in children given their immature kidney. This toxicity is increased
      especially after nephrectomy and/or concomitant radiotherapy. In pediatric oncology, the
      evaluation of the renal function is carried out according to the clinical trial protocols and
      to the center practices. To date, the standard methods (eg. creatinine clearance), as well as
      the available predictive formula (eg. Schwartz formula) are not well adapted to monitor
      children renal function. Indeed, the reliability of these methods depends on several
      parameters such as the diet and the muscle mass and could be very restrictive to perform on
      children. To circumvent these practical difficulties, the investigators intend to use the
      cystatin C as a biological marker of renal toxicity in children treated with cisplatin and /
      or ifosfamide. This cysteine protease has witnessed an upsurge of interest as an endogenous
      glomerular filtration rate marker and could be a good candidate to assess tubular toxicity
      when measured in urine.

      This study aims to describe the kinetic of the appearance of the urinary cystatin C and
      explore its proprieties as an early and cost-effective marker for glomerular and tubular
      renal toxicity in children. In addition, this method could allow enhancing the calculation
      models routinely used for glomerular filtration rate.
