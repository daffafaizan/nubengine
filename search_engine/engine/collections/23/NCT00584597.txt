      patients. The severe inflammation of the oral cavity can be detrimental to quality of life
      and cause interruption in vital cancer treatment. Despite numerous proposed therapies, an
      effective agent for oral mucositis has yet to be found. TRAUMEEL S, a homeopathic remedy made
      up of highly diluted botanical extracts and minerals, has shown benefit for mucositis in
      children undergoing chemotherapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of
      TRAUMMEL S in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. The patients
      will use the medication as a mouthwash during radiation therapy and will be evaluated weekly
      with physical examination criteria and questionnaires for symptoms and side effects.
