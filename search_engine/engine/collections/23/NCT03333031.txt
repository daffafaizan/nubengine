      Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) is a chaperone protein that aids in the folding, stabilization,
      and degradation of cellular proteins and is found in virtually all living organisms. Cancer
      cells in particular have high expression of Hsp90. Hsp90 has three structural domains
      including an N-terminal domain that contains an ATP binding site. Small molecule inhibitors
      of HSP90 (Hsp90i) can selectively and competitively to the Hsp90 ATP binding domain. HS-196
      consists of a HSP90 inhibitor that binds competitively to the Hsp90 ATP binding domain
      connected by a linker to a contrast agent (near infrared (NIR) dye) that can be used for
      imaging. HS-196 can freely enter tumor cells to selectively bind Hsp90. Due to the the NIR
      dye, HS-196 accumulation in the malignant cells allows for specific visualization of tumors
      within the body.

      HS-196 will be used in this investigation for the imaging of solid tumors The objectives of
      the study are to determine the dose of HS-196 that achieves the greatest ratio of tumor to
      normal tissue fluorescence in patients with malignancy, the safety of HS-196 administration
      in patients with malignancy, the average radiant efficiency in resected tumors following
      HS-196 administration, the localization of the HS-196 by microscopy of tumor slices, and the
      PK metrics of HS-196 when administered to patients.
