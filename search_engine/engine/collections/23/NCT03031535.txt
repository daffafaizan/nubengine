    
      Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide analog of naturally occurring somatostatin, with
      similar pharmacological effects but a longer duration of action. It inhibits the pathological
      secretion of GH from pituitary adenomas, and of serotonin and other hormones by tumors of the
      gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system. Currently, only injectable octreotide and
      somatostatin analogs have been approved, for the indications of acromegaly, carcinoid tumors,
      and vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors.

      DP1038, an intranasal formulation of octreotide, is being developed for the treatment of
      acromegaly, a rare chronic disorder arising from the overproduction of GH, predominantly by
      pituitary adenomas. Excess GH and associated IGF-1 levels are responsible for multiple
      symptoms (e.g., headache, tissue swelling, perspiration, joint pain) and significant
      comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, sleep apnea, cardiovascular abnormalities such as
      hypertension). In most patients with acromegaly, octreotide consistently normalizes GH and
      IGF-1 serum concentrations, thereby markedly reducing clinical symptoms.
