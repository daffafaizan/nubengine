      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising
           autologous CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones targeting cancer-testis antigens in
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of this therapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the antitumor effects of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells and then
      CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones are generated ex vivo. Patients receive cellular
      adoptive immunotherapy comprising autologous CD8+ CTL clones targeting cancer testis antigens
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12
      hours on days 1-14 of courses 2-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who demonstrate a clinical
      response after completion of the fourth course are eligible to receive additional T-cell
      infusions.

      Patients are followed for 9 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
