    
      Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), patients with psoriasis (PsO), and healthy
      individuals aged 18-60 will be recruited and assessed according to inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. Eligible participants will be randomized to two groups. The intervention group will
      receive a combinational nutraceuticals plan for 6 months as part of a Mediterranean diet and
      the control group will follow usual diet. Data will be collected at baseline and at the end
      of the study including levels of organic and fatty acids, lifestyle and anthropometric
      measurements, adherence to Mediterranean diet through the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and
      disease-specific quality of life through the Thyroid Patient Report Outcome (THYPRO) and the
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires for the HT and the PsO group
      respectively.
