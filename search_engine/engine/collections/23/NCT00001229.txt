      attempt to ascertain biochemically whether or not they really have such a tumor. These
      procedures will include a standard clonidine suppression test and a standard glucagon
      stimulation test. Once the diagnosis has been made on the basis of biochemistry, then
      localization and therapy will be done via standard procedures. Measurement of plasma
      metanephrines on mailed samples is available for physicians who seek further evidence for the
      diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
