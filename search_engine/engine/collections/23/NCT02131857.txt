      All participants will initially undergo an initial assessment interview. Personnel trained
      and certified in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) will run mindfulness-based groups
      in 6-8 weekly 1 1/2 hour sessions (the staff group will comprise of 6 sessions and the
      parents' and patients' groups will be 8 sessions long). Participants will learn and engage in
      various formal and informal meditation practices during experiential learning of skills,
      including concentration, mindfulness of thoughts, emotions, feelings and bodily sensations,
      decentering, and letting go. Each group will include both practical exercises and a
      psycho-educational component. Daily homework, an essential aspect of the course, will include
      meditation practices together with exercises designed to integrate application of awareness
      skills into daily life. On day 0, participants will complete a battery of questionnaires as
      well as tests of the physical status of CF disease. This battery will be repeated at 8 weeks,
      and again at 6 months.
