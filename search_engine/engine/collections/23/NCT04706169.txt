      participation. Purpose: To assess differences in force and motor recruitment patterns of
      shoulder muscles between age groups to understand functional disorders. A cross-sectional
      study comparing thirty adults (20-64) and 30 older adults (>65). Surface-electromyography
      (sEMG) of the middle deltoid, upper and lower trapezius, infraspinatus and serratus anterior
      muscles was recorded. Maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) was determined at 45°
      glenohumeral abduction. For the sEMG signal registration, concentric and excentric
      contraction with and without 1 kg and isometric contraction were requested. Participants
      abducted the arm from 0° up to an abduction angle of 135° for concentric and excentric
      contraction; and from 0º to 45º and remained there at 80% of the MIVC level while
      isometrically pushing against a handheld dynamometer. Differences in sEMG amplitudes (root
      mean square, RMS) of all contractions, but also onset latencies during concentric contraction
      of each muscle between age groups were analyzed. Statistical differences in strength
      (Adults>Older adults;0.05) existed between groups. No significant differences in RMS values
      of dynamic contractions were detected, except for serratus anterior, but there were for
      isometric contraction of all muscles analyzed (Adults>Older adults;0.05). The recruitment
      order varied between age groups, showing a general tendency towards delayed onset times in
      Older Adults, except for the upper trapezius muscle. Age differences in muscle recruitment
      patterns were found, which underscores the importance of developing musculoskeletal data to
      prevent and guide geriatric shoulder pathologies.
