      suspected. Emerging literature suggests each additional attempt past an initial laryngoscopy
      correlates with a two-fold increase in complications. Therefore, striving to secure the
      neonate/infant airway on the first attempt is optimal for infant safety. Novice trainees lack
      experience with airway management in small children. To promote a patient safety culture
      among the multitude of rotating trainees at Boston Children's Hospital the investigators
      would like to augment airway management with Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice Simulation
      Training (RCDP). Rotating trainees at BCH main campus will be prospectively randomized to
      experimental vs. control group for intubation of neonates and infants less than or equal to
      12 months of age. Infants with known congenital heart disease, known or suspected difficult
      airways, or COVID-19 positive status will be excluded from the study. The experimental group
      will review a pre-induction airway management plan for their upcoming case and rapid cycle
      deliberate practice (RCDP) on a simulator with an anesthesia attending coaching on technique
      prior to real patient intubation. Primary outcome measure will be first attempt success rate.
      Other outcome measures include: complication rates, a team developed Likert scale that
      investigates intubation competency and utility of JIT/RCDP training, and NASA-TLX (a
      validated cognitive task load index).

      The study would be the first to directly determine how and if simulation-based pediatric
      airway interventions are immediately transferable to actual clinical environments in
      pediatric anesthesiology. Such a study may change how training programs prepare novices for
      "game time" performance and become a new standard of care in airway management training.
