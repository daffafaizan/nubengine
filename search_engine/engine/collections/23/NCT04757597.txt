      hemorrhage, while cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related intracerebral hemorrhage is the second
      factor, accounting for approximately 20-30%. It is often characterized by repeated and
      multifocal lobar hemorrhage, which will not only cause neurological deficit on the limbs, but
      also influence the cognitive level of patients and may even be life-threatening. At present,
      the role of surgery in CAA-related ICH is controversial, and there is no effective prevention
      and treatment strategies have been established. Additionally, it is always associated with a
      low rate of good prognosis(11%-60%) and a high risk of recurrent ICH (10%-60%). Thus, a novel
      approach which can improve the clinical outcome and reduce the risk of recurrent
      intracerebral hemorrhage is urgently needed.

      Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to
      prevent and treat acute ischemic stroke and small cerebrovascular disease. Additionally,
      clinical research testified that RIC is safe and feasible for patients with subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. In animal studies, RIC is efficiency in accelerating the absorption of hematoma.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to carry out this research to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RIC in patients with CAA related ICH.
