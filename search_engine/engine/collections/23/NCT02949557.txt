      with the use of bone graft materials. It is necessary to choose the most appropriate material
      and procedure in order to obtain the desired regeneration. Among the bone grafts,
      Demineralised freezed dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and xenografts have shown good results in
      the management of intrabony defects. Recently, a novel bovine xenograft i.e., Cerabone™ has
      shown maximum resemblance to human bone with the potential to reconstruct bone defects.
      Decortication or intramarrow penetration of the bone has shown favourable results in guided
      bone regeneration procedures. So the goal of the present study was to check the efficacy of
      decortication with decalcified freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and Cerabone™ bone grafts
      and to compare the response between the bonegrafts placed following decortication using RVG
      and CBCT, in intrabony defect.

      The combination of decortication with bone grafts i.e., DFDBA and (Cerabone)TM can be an
      added advantage in the treatment of intrabony defects. To the best of the investigators
      knowledge no clinical trial reports this combination therapy in scientific literature. There
      is need for further research in this area.
