      behavioral interventions: (i) mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week
      intervention program based different meditation & yoga techniques and teaching information
      regarding the relationship between stress and health. or (ii) into an active control group
      teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation
      PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine. The investigator will measure the frequency and
      intensity of migraine attacks before during and after the intervention by headache diaries as
      well as secondary variables on pain sensation, psychological well being, generic quality of
      life, pain regulation, pain acceptance, mindfulness, compliance and satisfaction with the
      intervention. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR intervention will reduce
      the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active control group and compared to
      their own baseline.
