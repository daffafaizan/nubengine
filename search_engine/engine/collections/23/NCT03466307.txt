      subjects were included in the study. The demographic characteristics and body mass indexes of
      the patients were recorded. The visual analogue scale was used to determine pain severity.
      The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Scale Assessment, Short Form-36 and Beck Depression
      Inventory were used to determine patients' shoulder function, general quality of life and
      depression levels, respectively. The peak systolic velocity and resistive index of anterior
      circumflex humeral artery was assessed with power doppler ultrasonography.The peak systolic
      velocity and resistive index of anterior circumflex humeral artery values of the affected and
      unaffected sides were compared.
