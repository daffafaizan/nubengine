      visualization by collapsing the lung. The double-lumen tube (DLT) and Bronchial blockers
      (BBs) are the commonly used device for OLV.The objective of this study is to comparison the
      safety and effectiveness of the intubation of the Left-sided Double-lumen Tube and the
      Uniblocker under the guidence of chest computed tomography (CT) image(the operator count the
      number of CT slices (slice thickness is 5mm) from vocal cord slice to carina slice to
      calculate the distance between vocal cord and carina) then measure a distance on the DLT or
      Uniblocker from the upper edge of the cuff to the mouth side and made a marker on the DLT or
      Uniblocker.During the intubation the operator insert the DLT or Uniblocker into the trachea
      via video laryngoscope, after passing the glottis the DLT or Uniblocker are advanced toward
      the left main-stem bronchus, once the anesthesiologist see the marker on the DLT or the
      Uniblocker just above the vocal cord stop the insertion.
