      assures suitable intensity immunosuppression to avoid the appearance of rejection episodes,
      but minimizes the doses to prevent over-immunosuppression in a population with a theoretic
      minor immune response.

      On the other hand, the delay in the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors will prevent
      increasing the risk of early graft dysfunction allowing the highest post-transplant renal
      recovery in organs with less operative mass and greater sensibility to the nephrotoxic effect
      of these drugs.

      The results of several studies confirm the goodness of regimes that include low doses of
      calcineurin inhibitors, delay their introduction or avoid them.

      Nevertheless, although it is standard practice to evaluate the effectiveness of the regimes
      for a time to assure, with certainty, the response to the treatments, these follow-ups are
      still relatively short to assure the efficacy for a long-term study and to detect the
      problems. The studies with a high number of patients and long follow-up periods are
      difficult, so several authors have proposed different alternatives of control in a short-term
      study that could be useful as surrogate markers or predictive efficacy variables for the long
      term.

      If the drug or study regime is efficient, the observed change after the transplantation
      surgery will have to be fast and objective. The increase of serum creatinine between 6 and 12
      months post-transplant is a reliable marker of graft failure risk, and the magnitude of the
      serum creatinine change in these months is a marker of the relationship with long-term
      survival. For that reason, renal function (serum creatinine) is included as a main efficacy
      variable.
