        1. To assess the safety and adverse event profile of Silymarin compared to placebo.

        2. To assess the efficacy of Silymarin as defined by an improvement in non-alcoholic
           steatosis (NAS) activity score by at least 30% from baseline compared to placebo.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare NAS activity before and after Silymarin therapy.

        2. To characterize changes in ALT and AST during Silymarin therapy.

        3. To compare insulin resistance measured by HOMAr during Silymarin therapy.
