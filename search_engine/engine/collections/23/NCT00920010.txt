        -  Establish a central lung cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for current
           and future scientific studies.

        -  Correlate clinicopathologic information in the Southwest Oncology Group clinical data
           base with results of studies using the repository.

        -  Test new hypotheses with the specimens in the repository.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood, sputum, and biopsy specimens are collected from patients. Tissue
      samples are frozen and stored in a lung cancer specimen repository for later use in
      correlative studies.
