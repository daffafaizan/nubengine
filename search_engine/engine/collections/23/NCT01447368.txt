      vascular calcification. There is some suggestion that subtotal parathyroidectomy may reduce
      or stabilize vascular calcium scores in dialysis patients. Experimental data suggests that
      SHPT plays an important role in mediating uraemic arterial disease and that parathyroidectomy
      largely prevented the development of calcification. Cinacalcet has emerged as a novel therapy
      for the treatment of SHPT and has been shown to reduce the need for surgical
      parathyroidectomy. However, their effects on vascular and bone status have not been
      evaluatedand compared with parathyroidectomy.
