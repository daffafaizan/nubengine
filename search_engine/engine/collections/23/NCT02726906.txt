      older adults with substantial cognitive impairment, like those with Alzheimer's Disease in
      the US is approximately $200 billion a year, causing major societal, economic, and caregiving
      burden. Despite great advances towards diagnosing these problems, the discovery of effective
      treatments has been minimal. Exploring non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise
      and healthy living, have gained momentum. These promising, modifiable lifestyle interventions
      have the potential for delaying disease onset and slowing decline in cognition. However, the
      therapeutic effect of lifestyle interventions in patients with mild cognitive impairment, a
      prime intervention period for treatment, is not well understood. Therefore, in this study,
      the investigators will examine brain, body, and cognitive changes in older adults who engage
      in moderate-aerobic walking or healthy living education.
