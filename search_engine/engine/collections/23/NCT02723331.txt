      chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, followed by re-staging CT scan, if re-staging
      CT does not show evidence of metastatic disease. Patients will receive SBRT and definitive
      surgical resection. Subsequently, patients will receive 3 cycles of adjuvant combination
      chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Each cycle of combination chemotherapy will
      be a total of 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated for response at completion of the 3 cycles
      of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients
      will undergo surveillance CT scan at 3-month intervals until evidence of disease progression.
