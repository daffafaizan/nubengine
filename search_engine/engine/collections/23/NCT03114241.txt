      become a significant outcome measure in patients with COPD. Recent studies have demonstrated
      an independent association between PA, hospitalizations and mortality. Increased PA has
      significant benefits for patients with COPD. In most studies PA has only been assessed at one
      time point. Little is known about longitudinal changes in PA and data on determinants of
      changes in PA are scant. Moreover, information on best approaches to enhance PA in a
      population with decreasing PA is missing. To evaluate the long-term effect of a coaching
      program which is aimed at helping patients with severe COPD (FEV1<50%) to enhance their level
      of daily physical activity, in addition to usual care. Furthermore, this study aims to
      evaluate mechanisms that are responsible for changes of physical activity over time such as
      sociodemographic factors, lung function, comorbidities, vascular function, exacerbations, and
      medication.
