    
      -  To understand the mechanism of relapse by genome sequencing with tissues/blood obtained
           at diagnosis and relapse in patients with diffuse B cell lymphoma who relapsed after
           standard chemotherapy, to evaluate their response and survival following a salvage
           therapy depending on the genomic sequencing results, and to understand the prognostic or
           predictive value of genomic mutation.

        -  To understand the predictive value of genetic information with regard to the response to
           salvage chemotherapy and survival outcome in patients with newly diagnosed/relapsed or
           refractory large B cell lymphoma

        -  To determine the association between gene mutation, treatment response and prognosis in
           relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and to develop a clinically
           applicable platform by establishing a genetic data register based on prospective studies
