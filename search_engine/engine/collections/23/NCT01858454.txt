      indication for hysterectomy. Despite the fact that laparoscopic myomectomy is becoming
      increasingly popular, laparoscopic myomectomy remains underutilized because of inherit
      limitations. The limitations include technical challenges such as dissection of the myoma
      from its bed using the correct plane or multilayer closure of the myoma bed and the concern
      about the strength of the suturing and the subsequent risk of uterine rupture. As a result,
      laparoscopic myomectomy is currently performed only by expert surgeons.

      Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a unique surgical approach that may overcome the
      limitations of pure laparoscopic surgery. HALS is not only less invasive than open surgery
      but also causes less technical challenges than laparoscopic surgery based on its manual
      nature and ability to use retractors. In gynecologic field, HALS has also been employed in
      ovarian cancers and large ovarian tumors.

      In theory, HALS seems appropriate procedure, similar to the open approach, for patients with
      multiple or huge myomas. To date, no report has evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of
      HALS compared with open surgery (OS).
