      (postmenopausal) have osteoporosis according to a definition of Bone Mineral Density at any
      site being more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for young healthy adult women.

      A known risk factor for development of osteoporosis and fracture is diabetes mellitus, with
      correlations to duration of disease and poor glycemic control.

      Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes. Preclinical studies to date on the bone effects of thiazolidinediones have
      not clearly identified a mechanism of bone loss. While there is evidence of increased bone
      fractures in postmenopausal diabetic females treated with a thiazolidinedione, the mechanism
      is not known. Initial studies with thiazolidinediones in humans have focused on short term
      exposure (12 to 14 weeks) and non-diabetic females. These studies have shown acute changes in
      circulating bone markers and bone density, but have been questioned because they may not
      represent bone metabolism in states of abnormal glucose metabolism. Impaired glucose
      tolerance has been identified not only as a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, but
      also at higher risk for known complications of diabetes. Examination of the effect of
      thiazolidinediones on bone metabolism in IGT patients will provide data in patients with
      abnormal glucose tolerance, but without the potential confounding effects of oral
      hypoglycemic medications to treat type 2 diabetes.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on bone mass
      and metabolism in postmenopausal women with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose
      tolerance. Total participation time in this study is approximately 1 year and six months.
