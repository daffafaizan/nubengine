      population-based, genetic-epidemiologic study of familial colorectal cancer in Puerto Rico.
      Through this feasibility study, we will assess the feasibility: (1) of recruiting colorectal
      cancer patients using the PR Central Cancer Registry, (2) of evaluating family pedigrees and
      recruiting the relatives of probands (3) obtaining tumor, blood, medical and exposure
      information from both probands and their relatives. Providing important data on Hispanic
      populations that would enable family-based case-control studies of risk factors for CRC, with
      an emphasis on candidate genes in selected carcinogenic pathways, genetic and epigenetic
      modifications. Furthermore, information obtained from this proposal may serve to identify
      families that would be informative for linkage studies to potentially map new genes, evaluate
      genotype-phenotype correlations, gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions.
