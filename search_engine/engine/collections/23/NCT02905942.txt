      Factor applying to AHSCT in China. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in lymphoma patients after autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to PEG-rhG-CSF group or rhG-CSF
      group. Patients in PEG-rhG-CSF group received PEG-rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a
      dose of 100μg/kg. Patients with the weight more than 45kg were suggested a dose of 6 mg.
      Patients in control group received rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 5μg/kg
      once per day until the recovery of neutrophil.
