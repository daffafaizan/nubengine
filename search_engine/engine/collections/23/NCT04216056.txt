    
      A 30-month trial, which will be divided into three phases, namely study preparation and
      subject recruitment (6 months), data collection (18 months), and data entry and analysis (6
      months), will be conducted.

      This study will be a non-randomized controlled study using a controlled before-and-after
      study design. Eligible subjects will receive a baseline assessment in the community
      facilities. After that, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two groups: frailty
      intervention program, or control group without any intervention, over 12 weeks. Subjects in
      the frailty intervention program will be invited to participate in the following components:
      exercise, game training and nutrition education; while subjects in the control group will be
      asked to maintain their usual diet and physical activity patterns. A total of 152 subjects
      (76 per group) will be recruited. Outcome measurements will be collected at two time points,
      namely baseline (T0), and 12 (T1) weeks.

      The primary outcome will be the improvement in gait speed over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes
      will include the change in the following parameters over 12 weeks: frailty, handgrip
      strength, 5 chair stands, balance test, Frontal Assessment Battery, dietary intake,
      nutritional status, physical activity, self-rated health, life satisfaction and self-efficacy
      of chronic disease management. In a sub-sample of 25 subjects from the intervention group,
      their views towards the frailty intervention program will be obtained from the focus group
      study.
