      therapy practice with the underlying diagnosis of pelvic floor tension myalgia. This
      diagnosis may be secondary to various underlying etiologies including interstitial
      cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, vulvodynia, endometriosis, adhesive disease, unknown
      etiology, etc. At the time of enrollment, participants will be randomized into one of two
      groups: either standard pelvic floor physical therapy with weekly saline placebo injections
      or standard pelvic floor physical therapy and weekly pudendal blocks for 6 weeks. Standard
      physical therapy techniques will be utilized in both groups. Weekly injections of a mixture
      of a steroid and local anesthetic or saline will be administered depending on the
      randomization. Injections will be administered by a urogynecology physician. The participant
      and the treating physical therapist will be blinded to treatment assignment. The participant
      will be evaluated with for pelvic floor muscle strength and tenderness and will have pain
      assessed by a visual analog scale at baseline, weekly throughout the study, and at 6 months
      after study enrollment. Vaginal electromyography will be performed and standardized
      questionnaires regarding pelvic floor symptoms, quality of life and sexual function will be
      administered at baseline, after 6 weeks of injections and at 6 months after enrollment.
