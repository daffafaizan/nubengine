      I. Determine the dose of pre-administered cold antibody that optimizes image quality of
      64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET without increasing the radiation dose to the heart in women with
      metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer.

      II. Determine whether tumor uptake on 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET correlates with tumor
      expression of HER2 in women with metastatic disease.

      III. Perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship between uptake on
      64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET, HER2 overexpression, and inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a part one dose-determining study followed by a part two study. PART ONE: Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels. Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection
      of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab. PART TWO: Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection
      of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab at the optimal dose as determined in part one of the study.
