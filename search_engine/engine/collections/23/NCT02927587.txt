      physician to proceed for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The risks of this
      procedure are low and depend mostly on the health of the patient. In our study we only
      considered the elderly ( age > 65 years old) which makes the risks even higher.

      Target-Controlled Infusion (TCI) of Propofol has been proved to be a safe agent for conscious
      sedation in flexible bronchoscopy (FB) due to its fast onset of action and rapid recovery
      time. By virtue of an aging population, the number of bronchoscopy performed will likely
      increase in the elderly patients , however, the target setting of "effect-site"concentration
      (Cet) of propofol is still unclear among this population.

      The aim of this study was to compare two induction Cet of propofol in elderly patients
      undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.

      METHODS: Seventy patients were randomly divided into 2 groups . All patients were of American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I-III, aged more than 65 years old and
      between 45 and 100 kg in weight. The induction Cet was targeted respectively at 1 and 2
      ug/ml. Upon reaching the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation(MOAA/S) score
      0-3, the Cet was increased or reduced during the procedures and the Ce level was set for the
      maintenance of sedation. Induction time, diagnostic procedures as well as the occurrence of
      adverse events such as apnea , hypotension or hypertension, heart rate, oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) ,any cardiac event, cough score, frequency of adjustments of drug doses were recorded.

      The patient will be monitored during the procedure with periodic blood pressure checks,
      respiratory rate, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring of heart and oxygen measurement.
