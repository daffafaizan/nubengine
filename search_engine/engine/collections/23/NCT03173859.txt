    
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II study to investigate the feasibility of
      alternating cycles of treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone and apalutamide compared to
      sequential treatment of abiratereone plus prednisone followed by apalutamide. 7 centers in
      Greece will participate in the study.

      The study population consists of adult patients (over 18 years old) with histologically
      confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma who have disease progression - as defined by
      PCWG2 criteria - despite androgen deprivation therapy and who have not received prior therapy
      for their castration resistant disease.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the progression free survival, feasibility and
      safety profile of the experimental arm compared to standard of care.

      In the experimental arm alternating treatment will consist of repeating cycles of 24 weeks of
      treatment consisting of 12 weeks of abiraterone acetate 1000mg orally qd and prednisone 5mg
      orally bid, followed by 12 weeks of apalutamide 240 mg per day. There will be no wash out
      period between cycles.

      The comparative arm will be the standard regimen of abiraterone 1000mg orally qd plus
      prednisone 5mg orally bid until progression, followed thereafter by apalutamide 240mg orally
      qd until progression.
