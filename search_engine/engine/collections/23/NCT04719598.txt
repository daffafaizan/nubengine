      menopausal transition (MT) and the subsequent post menopause (PM).As a result of hormonal
      changes women experiences such symptoms as hot flashes, mood swings, anxiety, and sexual
      dysfunction that deteriorate their quality of life. Those symptoms usually begin in
      45-53-year-olds and it varies in onset and severity from women to another and from country to
      another.

      Symptoms of sleep problems include the difficulty of falling asleep, fractioned sleep,
      night-time awakening, the inability of resuming sleep, problems in waking up, fatigue, and
      daytime sleepiness that potentiate poor physical and mental quality of life.

      The goal of CBT is to teach women how to modify maladaptive behaviors and thoughts that may
      contribute to a particular problem as sleep problems, anxious thoughts, and vasomotor
      symptoms
