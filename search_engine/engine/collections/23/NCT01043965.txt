      with an impairment in endothelium-dependent dilation of the coronary microvasculature,
      indicating that the pathophysiological consequences of atherosclerosis may extend into the
      coronary microcirculation.

      The investigators will evaluate three parameters of myocardial quantification with contrast
      Stress echocardiography and correlate with HbA1C levels.
