      reconstruction with different supportive materials:

      the trial will comprise two arms: A-PRE-PECTORAL technique with a biological Acellular Dermal
      Matrix (ADM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT GRAFTING VS B-PRE-PECTORAL technique with
      a synthetic Titanium Coated Polypropylene Mesh (TCPM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT
      GRAFTING
