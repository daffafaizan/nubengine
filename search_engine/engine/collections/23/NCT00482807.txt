      Primary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the grade III or IV toxicity rate of concurrent extended-field
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), docetaxel, and androgen deprivation therapy in
           patients with high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer with pelvic lymph node
           metastasis.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when administered with concurrent IMRT
           in this patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive combined androgen deprivation therapy (if not already on combined hormonal
      therapy) comprising goserelin acetate* subcutaneously once every 3 months for up to 2 years
      and oral bicalutamide once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until the completion of
      radiotherapy. Beginning at approximately week 9 of androgen deprivation therapy, patients
      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for up to 9 weeks. Concurrently with
      chemotherapy, patients undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days a week for up to 45
      fractions (9 weeks).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      NOTE: *Not required for patients who have undergone bilateral orchiectomy

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
