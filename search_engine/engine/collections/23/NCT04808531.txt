      monotherapy in cancer participants. Proving analgesic efficacy requires demonstrating that
      (i) the analgesic is significantly better than placebo and (ii) that the magnitude of the
      improvement is clinically important. The latter is standardly done by measuring the change in
      pain levels from a baseline (no analgesia) to the end of a treatment period. A 30% decrease
      in the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) has been correlated with participants reporting a
      moderate improvement in their pain and this was adopted as the standard method of
      demonstrating a clinically important magnitude of improvement. In this strategy, the measure
      of analgesic efficacy is the proportion of participants in the treatment group whose pain is
      adequately treated (responders). A responder is defined as a patient who completes the
      treatment phase with an acceptable level of pain (NPRS ≤ 5) and without requiring excessive
      amounts of rescue (breakthrough analgesia) medication. Unlimited breakthrough analgesia
      (oxycodone) is allowed throughout the study; however, excessive use will result in
      discontinuation. Comparison of the proportion of responders in the NanaBis™ arm and placebo
      arms will determine if NanaBis™ is significantly better than placebo. Demonstrating that the
      proportion of responders in the NanaBis™ arm is non-inferior to the Oxycodone controlled
      release (CR) comparator arm will determine if the magnitude of improvement (provided by
      NanaBis™) is clinically important because Oxycodone CR has been established as the benchmark
      analgesic that provides a clinically important effect.
