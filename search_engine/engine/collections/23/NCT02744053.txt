      I. To determine the predictive value of advanced imaging modalities Tc99m sestamibi
      (technetium Tc-99m sestamibi) molecular breast imaging (MBI) and dynamic contrast enhanced
      (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare the ability all imaging modalities including standard of care
      digital mammogram (DM) and ultrasound (US) as well as novel modalities DCE-MRI and MBI to
      assess and predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine effect of molecular subtype of TNBC on diagnostic performance of different
      types of imaging modalities in predicting treatment response.

      II. To determine the Utility of Dynamic Tc99m sestamibi MBI and DCE-MRI together with
      molecular profiling to identify a subgroup of chemoresistant TNBC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DCE-MRI over 45-60 minutes. Patients receive technetium Tc-99m sestamibi via
      injection, and after 5 minutes patients undergo MBI scan over 1 hour. Both DCE-MRI and MBI
      are performed at the time of enrollment, at the end of anthracycline therapy, and at the
      conclusion of NAC before surgery. All patients also undergo standard of care imaging with DM
      and US (at the same time points if the treating doctor chooses to do so).
