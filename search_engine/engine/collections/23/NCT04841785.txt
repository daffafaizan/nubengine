           Primary objective:

           To assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by the incidence of COVID-19 in
           patients with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, on dialysis and patients after kidney
           transplantation who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

           Secondary Objectives:

           - To assess the safety of vaccination

           In a subgroup of participants:

             -  To assess the level of antibody response at 28 days and 6 months after SARS-CoV-2
                vaccination

             -  To assess durability of the antibody response at 6 months after SARS-CoV-2
                vaccination

           Exploratory Objectives:

             -  The vaccination coverage rate

             -  The severity of COVID-19 in case of infection

             -  The influence of vaccination on health-related quality of life by patient reported
                outcome measures (PROMs) in patients on dialysis.

             -  The SARS-CoV-2 genotype in patients with COVID-19

           In a subgroup of participants:

           - To assess the level of antibody response at 28 days and 6 months after SARS-CoV-2
           vaccination between patients with COVID-19 and without COVID-19

           If data are available and applicable, outcomes in vaccinated patients on dialysis or
           after kidney transplantation will be compared:

             -  with outcomes in the general population

             -  with outcomes in patients with severely impaired kidney function (CKD stages G4/5),
                on dialysis or with a kidney transplant who are not vaccinated.

             -  according to the type of vaccination they received

        2. STUDY DESIGN

           This is a prospective observational registry-based cohort study to evaluate the
           long-term efficacy and safety after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on clinically important
           outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, on dialysis or after
           kidney transplantation.

           All participants will receive vaccination against COVID-19 via the national vaccination
           program and according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the immune response
           after vaccination, blood samples will be collected at 28 days and 6 months after
           complete vaccination. In total a maximum of 1 ml blood will be drawn.

           Data of the following cohorts will be analyzed in this study.

             -  Patiens with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, data to be derived from the
                Santeon hospitals.

             -  Patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, data to be derived from the
                existing national registry RENINE

             -  Kidney transplant recipients, data to be derived from the existing national
                registry NOTR

             -  Patients on dialysis or after kidney transplantation with COVID-19 disease, data to
                be derived from the ERACODA database.

        3. METHODS

      Main study parameter/endpoint:

      The primary endpoints is the incidence of COVID-19 in a two years period after SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, on dialysis or after kidney
      transplantation.

      Secondary study parameters/endpoints:

      Safety in all patients:

        -  Incidence of mortality

        -  Incidence of adverse events of specific interest as defined by (inter)national
           authorities in collaboration with LAREB

        -  Incidence of a combined endpoint of acute rejection or graft failure in patients after
           kidney transplantation

        -  Incidence of HLA antibodies defined as calculated Panel Reactivity Antibodies (cPRA) >
           5% in patients on the waiting list for their first kidney transplantation

      Efficacy in a subgroup of patients:

        -  The antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain at 28 days after
           the final SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

        -  The durability of antibody based immune response against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding
           Domain at 6 months compared to 28 days after completion of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

      Exploratory study parameters:

        -  Vaccination coverage rates

        -  Disease severity in patients who develop COVID-19, assessed as

        -  Hospitalization

        -  ICU admission

        -  Mechanical ventilation

        -  Mortality

        -  The influence of vaccination on health-related quality of life by patient reported
           outcome measures (PROMs) in dialysis patients

        -  SARS-CoV-2 genotype in patients with COVID-19

      In a subgroup of participants:

      - To assess the level of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain antibody response at 28 days and
      6 months after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination between patients who develop COVID-19 and who do not
      develop COVID-19 after vaccination

      These data collected after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease
      stage G4-G5, on dialysis and after a kidney transplantation will (if applicable data are
      available) be compared:

        -  to those obtained in the general population

        -  to those obtained in patients with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, on dialysis or
           with a kidney transplant who are not vaccinated

        -  according to the type of vaccination received These comparisons will allow us to analyze
           whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination offers efficacy to prevent COVID-19 and sufficient safety
           in patients with chronic kidney disease stage G4-G5, dialysis and kidney transplant
           patients when compared to non-vaccinated patients with chronic kidney disease stage
           G4-G5, dialysis and kidney transplant patients, whether the efficacy is similar as in
           the general population, and whether there are differences in the risk-benefit ratio
           between the various vaccines.
