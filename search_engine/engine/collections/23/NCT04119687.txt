      painful OA of the index knee with Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2, 3 or 4.

      Part 1 - SAD Phase: Up to three ascending doses of FX201 (low dose, mid dose and high dose)
      will be tested in cohorts of 5-8 patients. Each patient will only receive one injection of
      FX201. A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled (range 15 to 24).

      When a minimum of 4 weeks have elapsed since the last patient of the current cohort has been
      treated, all safety data will be collected and reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring
      Committee (DMC). After evaluating cohort safety data, the DMC will evaluate continuing the
      trial and initiating treatment in the next dosing cohort as well as expanding enrollment in
      dose level(s).

      Part 2 - Expansion Phase: After the DMC has met to review safety data from each Cohort and
      has recommended expanding dose level(s), enrollment slots for dose levels reviewed by the DMC
      will be opened.
