      primary repair and gastrocnemius turn-down flaps for acute Achilles tendon rupture, so as to
      guide clinical decision. Methods: This retrospective study includes 74 patients with acute
      Achilles tendon rupture from March 2012 to September 2018, whose surgeries was completed by
      the sponsor with either primary repair or gastrocnemius turn-down flaps. The recovery and
      motor function of the patients were followed up by outpatient clinic and telephone at 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after operation, respectively, so as to
      statistically analyze the med-term curative effects of two surgeries. Specific indicators
      include: Visual Analogue Scale, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot
      Score, The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles, The Achilles tendon Total
      Rupture Score, the Tegner Activity Score, Biodex isokinetic dynamometer system, Postoperative
      rehabilitation index and complications.
