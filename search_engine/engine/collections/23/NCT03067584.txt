      non-tumor DNA and permission to perform biologic studies on previously stored tumor tissue if
      applicable and available. Participants diagnosed with cancer at outside institutions will be
      requested to sign a release form to allow the outside institution to send germline and/or
      tumor tissue to St Jude if available. For patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant,
      a buccal swab or saliva sample will be requested (for germline DNA). For patients with active
      leukemia, non-tumor cells (for germline DNA) may be obtained using a remission blood sample,
      a skin biopsy (to obtain fibroblasts) or may be purified by fluorescence activated cell
      sorting of leukemia samples. The skin biopsy will be obtained in participants 18 years of age
      and older. In participants less than 18 years, the skin biopsy will be accessed only if it
      was already collected as part of another research protocol or for clinical care.

      All patients being considered for enrollment will have a clinical genetics consult by one of
      the study team members at which time a family history will be taken and information about
      genomic testing will be introduced. Detailed medical history will be obtained which includes
      but is not limited to demographics, clinical data including laboratory results, cancer
      history/diagnosis, treatment outcomes, environmental exposures and cancer risk factors to
      enable phenotype/genotype correlations.
