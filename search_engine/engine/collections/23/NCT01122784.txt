      different schedules through 28 days after each vaccination and cumulatively to Day 210; to
      compare the immunogenicity of rF1V vaccine administered in two different schedules through 28
      days after Vaccination 3; to compare the safety and immunogenicity of rF1V vaccine
      administered by two different schedules through 12 months after Vaccination 3; and to assess
      the contribution of the adjuvant to the immunogenicity of the rF1V antigen.
