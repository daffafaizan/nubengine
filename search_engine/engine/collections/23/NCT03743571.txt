      many individuals do not achieve full remission. Furthermore, some research suggests that fear
      responding toward ethnic out-group members may be more resistant to extinction. Enhancing
      activation of the mPFC during exposure therapy may improve overall response to treatment, and
      also facilitate extinction of fear toward ethic out-groups. Researchers have found that
      greater mPFC activation during exposure therapy is associated with better outcomes, and that
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used enhance learning and cognition
      with no known serious adverse effects. This study will therefore examine whether
      active/anodal (versus sham) tDCS targeting the mPFC (a) enhances overall reductions in social
      anxiety symptoms, and (b) facilitates extinction of fear responding toward ethnic/racial
      out-groups for both Latino and Caucasian/non-Latino participants. Participants will receive
      either active/anodal tDCS or sham tDCS during a brief exposure therapy intervention involving
      public speaking in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The public speaking audience in the VR
      environment will alternate between audiences that are either matched or unmatched to the
      participant's ethnicity (in a randomly assigned order). Participants' fear reactivity will be
      assessed with behavioral, physiological, and subjective measures at baseline, post-treatment,
      and follow-up.
