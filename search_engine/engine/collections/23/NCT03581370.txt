      rapidly life threatening Gram-negative Bacillus infections. Moreover, they present
      pathophysiological disturbances responsible for major pharmacokinetic changes (volume of
      distribution and glomerular filtration) which may lead to drugs under-exposure. Any delay in
      management or inadequate antibiotic therapy can have serious consequences in terms of
      prognosis. The association ceftolozane-tazobactam is an alternative to carbapenems in
      documented infections. Ceftolozane is a new cephalosporin, marketed, in combination with
      tazobactam (beta-lactamase inhibitor) under the name ZERBAXA速. ZERBAXA速 is active on
      Gram-negative Bacillus, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study that compares
      two modalities of administration of a novel antibiotic, ZERBAXA速 ceftolozane-tazobactam, by
      4-hours infusion at the dosage of 2 gram three times a day vs. 1-hour infusion at the dosage
      of 2 g three times a day, among patients with ventilator associated-pneumonia to Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.

      The patient will be randomized either in the 4-hours or in the 1-hour infusion group. Follow
      up visits are daily for any intensive care patient. Those provided for biomedical research
      are carried out during the treatment period, at Day 15 and Day 28. For the pharmacokinetic
      study, 7 blood samples will be collected from 24 hours to 48 hours after the first ZERBAXA速
      administration.
