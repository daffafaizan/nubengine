      like wound infection, pain, and prolong the hospital admission Corse, in the other hand,
      early chest tube removal is associated with increased the need for recurrent active
      intervention like pleural tapping for re-accumulated pleural effusion.

      Method: randomized prospective study includes 60 patients who underwent thoracoscopic
      lobectomy/segmentectomy/ thoracoscopic mediastinal biopsy.

      The study will exclude patients with difficult operative course ( intraoperative finding of
      significant adhesions/ intraoperative injury of the lung parenchyma/ intraoperative
      bleeding/failure of extubation ) and patient with post operative findings of ( bleeding in
      the chest tube more than 100 ml in the first hour, persistent air leak, non expanded lung on
      chest x-ray ) The patients will be divided into two groups, the first group - 30 patients -
      will undergo chest tube removal after three hours, and the second group will undergo chest
      tube removal according to the treating department protocol.

      All patients will be evaluated regarding the pain level - subjective and objective -,
      admission period, infection, and the need for invasive intervention.

      The patients will be evaluated during the admission, after one week and after two weeks.
