      improve the negative properties of composite resin systems applied by the traditional method
      thanks to the fact that the fibers act as a crack stopper, reduce polymerization shrinkage by
      decreasing the the mass of composite resin material between the remaining dentin structure
      and the fiber. Many authors having conducted tremendous experience in this field of research
      have reported that the polyethylene fiber is an innovative approach because it not only
      increases the flexural strength but also improves fracture toughness. Its woven fiber
      orientation provides the stresses to be dispersed throughout the restoration, and therefore
      reinforces the restoration and the remaining tooth structure in multiple directions.
