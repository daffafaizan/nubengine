      expression, transcriptome profiling, HLA typing, single cell analysis, and TCR affinity
      assays, the investigators will define a set of immune metrics for the prediction or early
      diagnosis of disease that is superior to the current examination of auto-antibodies, which is
      a fairly late stage in the disease development. This can also be used to guide therapy in
      advanced disease.
