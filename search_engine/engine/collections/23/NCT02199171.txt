    
      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carboplatin given as HIPEC for primary
      treatment of women with advanced ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the dose limiting toxicities of HIPEC carboplatin.

        2. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of HIPEC carboplatin.

        3. To quantify changes in tissue temperature during HIPEC and compare to conventional
           temperature measures (esophageal and bladder).

        4. To describe the extent of thermal damage and DNA platinum adduct formation in tissues
           resulting from HIPEC carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive hyperthermic carboplatin intraperitoneally over 60 minutes during the
      planned surgical cytoreductive procedure.
