      patient by leukapheresis. An established BTSC line will be used as an allogeneic source of
      tumor antigen. Approximately 4 weeks will be required after the leukapheresis for vaccine
      production and the first vaccine administration.

      Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every 2 weeks
      during the first 8 weeks, followed by injections every 4 weeks for an additional 10
      vaccinations. Imiquimod will be applied to the vaccination site just prior to and 24 hours
      after each vaccine administration.

      This study will use an accelerated dose escalation design (1 subject per level) until dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) is encountered, after which a traditional phase I design (3 subjects
      per level) will be implemented. DLT is defined as grade 3 or greater treatment related
      toxicity. A total of 6 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, in
      the absence of DLT, at dose level 3.
