    
      This is a Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sequential pembrolizumab (200
      mg every three weeks) and accelerated, dose-painted radiotherapy for patients with locally
      advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression â‰¥ 50%. Patients with PD-L1 expression < 50% will also be
      enrolled and treated with standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy to serve as a non-randomized
      comparison group.
