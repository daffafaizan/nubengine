      feasible with encouraging short-term results both for crypto glandular and Crohns anal
      fistula. The long-term results are still insufficient but based on only a few studies
      conducted with small patient series and various techniques and type of stem cells. In the
      present study the patient's own adipose tissue derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) will be
      used. Traditionally the stem cells are injected into the fistula tract; however survival and
      retaining the stem cells in the fistula tract is problematic. Alternatively, one may apply
      stem cells enriched fatty tissue around and into the fistula tract. The aim of this project
      is to develop a method for treatment of patients with Crohns fistula. The results of
      conventional surgery are disappointing and followed by a high degree of recurrence and
      complications.
