      biliary tree and the condition can lead to end-stage liver disease. PSC is strongly
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a prevalence of IBD in PSC as high as
      60-84 % in Northern Europe and North America. The majority of patients with IBD and PSC have
      ulcerative colitis (UC).

      Considering all patients with UC, around 30% will ultimately require surgery; the most common
      indications are acute colitis, chronic refractory disease or colorectal dysplasia. The
      standard procedure is proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). However,
      ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) or conventional ileostomy are options. The prognosis after
      surgery is generally considered good.

      Previous studies have shown that the course of colitis in patients with UC/PSC is different
      from that of patients with UC-only.

      In a patient with UC, several aspects have to be considered at counselling before surgery.
      However, in many aspects, the literature is substantial for patients with UC-only (for
      example function and quality of life after IPAA) and key information can be safely provided.
      Conversely, patients with UC/PSC that require colectomy are rare and as a consequence, data
      on most aspects is sparse (18-20).

      The aim of the study was to assess outcome after surgery (IPAA or IRA) in patients with
      UC/PSC. Focus was on pouch/rectal function, pouchitis, surgical complications and failure.
      Patients with UC-only were employed as controls.
