      metastatic recurrence in patients treated by radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy in the anal
      canal cancer setting. There appear to be an FDG intensity variable and a metabolic response
      criterion enabling establishment of two groups of patients: low recurrence risk versus high
      recurrence risk at 2 years.
