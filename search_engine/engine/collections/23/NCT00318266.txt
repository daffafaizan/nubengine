    
      Patients who have been previously treated for bladder cancer and are at a high risk for
      recurrence are being monitored for recurrence every 3 months with urine cytology and
      cystoscopy as part of standard care.The NMP22 Bladder Cancer Â® Test Kit has been designed to
      provide an alternative to regular urine cytology. A urine sample will be provided and divided
      with a portion being used to assess the NMP22 test kit and the remaining sample to be sent to
      the lab for regular urine cytology. Patient charts will be reviewed by a medical student to
      record age, clinical stage, pathologic stage, time to disease progression/recurrence, site of
      recurrence and survival data.
