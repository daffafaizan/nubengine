    
      A Phase 1, multi-center, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and safety, study in which neonates
      will be randomized in an open-label fashion to receive 5 days of open-label treatment with
      either lansoprazole pediatric suspension 1.0 mg/kg/day orally or lansoprazole pediatric
      suspension .5 mg/kg/day orally. On dosing Days 1 and 5, blood samples will be obtained for
      drug assay. All subjects will be evaluated for inclusion in the pH monitoring portion of the
      study and will undergo pH monitoring, provided it is clinically indicated, at the discretion
      of the investigator. Intragastric pH monitoring (up to 24 hours) will be performed at
      baseline, on dosing Day 1 (or Day 2) and on dosing Day 5 (or Day 6). Intraesophageal pH may
      be done in addition to intragastric pH at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects will
      be evaluated for safety, including a follow-up visit on post-dosing Day 14.
