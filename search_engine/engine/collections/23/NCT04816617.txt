    
      This is multi-center, psycho-education randomized controlled trial, consisting of two periods
      with each of 6 months (i.e supervised and maintenance period). In the exercise intervention
      arm, during the first 6 months, participants will be asked to do moderate-intensity aerobic
      exercise 3-4 times a week, which will be supervised in person by physical
      educators/professionals. In the next 6-month maintenance period, participants will be asked
      to continue doing aerobic exercise at the same intensity and frequency, which will not be
      supervised in person by educators/professionals, but they will be sent reminders and report
      adherence weekly. All of the physical activity will be recorded by accelerometer at scheduled
      time points (e.g. the first week, 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month).
      Psycho-education group will be given 6 sections of general psycho-education onsite and/or
      virtually dependent on the surroundings with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      The main aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of long-term aerobic exercise on
      prevention depression in young people with subthreshold depression.
