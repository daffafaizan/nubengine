      deposited in the skeleton after about 100 days. During this time subjects will collect 24 h
      urine monthly to monitor the decrease in 41Calcium urinary excretion. Subsequently, the
      baseline level of 41Calcium urinary excretion will be evaluated over a 50 day baseline period
      with 24 h urine collections every 10 days. Participants will then be randomized to one of
      three doses of soluble corn fiber (0,10,20 g/d) to be consumed in two equivalent doses per
      day for 50 days. Women will collect 24 h urine every 10 days. Each 50 day period will be
      followed by a 50 day washout period during which the subjects will continue to collect urine
      every 10 days.
