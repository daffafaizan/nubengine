      workers in their community-based diabetes prevention awareness efforts. This study will
      tailor/adapt, implement, and evaluate an innovative internet-based virtual world model to
      remotely deliver a diabetes prevention awareness training program to community health
      workers. A sequential mixed-methods design is used to address these specific aims: 1. Use
      community-based participatory research methods to guide the overall study and inform
      tailoring and adaptation of our virtual world model to deliver the CHW training program; 2.
      Conduct a randomized pilot study to compare change in primary outcomes (0, 12 weeks) after
      the in-person versus virtual world delivery of the program; and 3. Conduct summative focus
      groups to gather information to refine the program and study methodology.
