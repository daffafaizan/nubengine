      Lombardy. For instance, it affected the job organization and the possibility of responding to
      general health needs.

      First of all, the study will consider the calls to the Emergency Medical Service, the number
      of accesses to the Emergency Department, the waiting time before hospitalization, the ED
      output home (discharge, hospitalization, death, self-discharge before the end of the visit).

      Secondly, a statistical model will be implemented, in order to predict the number of patients
      in need of hospitalization for each day during the pandemic period. This model could help the
      re-organization of the hospital itself in case of a new Covid-19 outbreak.

      Finally, it will evaluate the impact on non-Covid patients, to see the difference in the
      mortality trends and their possiblity to be cured in a proper way.
