      admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to the diversity of injuries
      as well as the breadth of comorbidities present in this population. Clonidine may be a useful
      adjuvant to traditional analgesics such as opioids and sedatives such as benzodiazepines and
      propofol. Ventilator dependent trauma patients frequently fail extubation trials secondary to
      inappropriate sedation, inadequate analgesia or undertreated delirium. Patients that fail
      extubation for these reasons have a potentially preventable prolonged ventilator, ICU and
      hospital course. Ventilated trauma patients that meet criteria for our institution's SBT
      protocol and have the diagnosis of delirium will be considered for the trial if they have a
      documented failed SBT. We hypothesize treatment of this patient population with transdermal
      Clonidine will decrease delirium in trauma patients during their ICU stay. Patients enrolled
      in the treatment group will receive an oral loading dose of Clonidine 0.3 mg and placement of
      a Clonidine Transdermal system at a dose of 0.3-mg/day (Catapres TTS-3) covered by a patch
      overlay. In 12 hours the patient will receive a second and final dose of Clonidine 0.3 mg.
      The placebo group will receive a placebo oral tablet and the overlay patch only and in 12
      hours they will receive a second and final placebo tablet. A total of 120 patients will be
      enrolled, 60 patients in each group. All patients will complete the study at end of Day 14 or
      upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. Ventilator times will be measured
      in each group as well as the prevalence of delirium by the amount of positive CAM-ICU scores
      over the course of the trial.
