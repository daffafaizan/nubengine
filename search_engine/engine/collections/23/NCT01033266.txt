    
      Patients presenting to the Oklahoma City VA sleep clinic with obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome and a desire to initiate CPAP treatment will be included if they have overlap
      syndrome. Patients will undergo a spirometry and CPET before being started on CPAP as part of
      standard clinical care. The CPET will be repeated after 8-12 weeks of CPAP use. Patients will
      be excluded if they have any contraindication to mild exercise or they cannot perform an
      exercise test due to limited mobility.
