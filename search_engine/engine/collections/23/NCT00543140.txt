      (CI-02-0006), completed on November 10, 2008. As a condition of approval, the FDA required
      additional subjects with long-term safety data. These subjects enrolled under protocol
      CI-07-0006 (NCT00813462)-5 Year Post-Approval Study With the REALIZE (TM) Adjustable Gastric
      Band. Protocol CI-06-0001 was amended to combine these study subjects with study subjects
      from CI-07-0006. NCT00543140 (CI-06-0001) will not be completed (analysis of results) until
      the additional subjects in NCT00813462 (CI-07-0006) complete this study since the original
      intent was to pool the data together from the above two studies to obtain the appropriate
      sample size for estimation of the re-operation rate at 4 and 5 years post implantation.
