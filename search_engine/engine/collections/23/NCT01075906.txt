      into a 1 week dose-titration period (Days -7 to -1). Beginning on Day -7, a pre-dose blood
      sample will be collected from the colchicine-naïve patient population for determination of
      pharmacodynamic markers. Patients will then be administered a low starting dose of colchicine
      (as determined by the principal investigator) titrated up to the study colchicine dose which
      is 0.6 mg (2 capsules) in children ≥2 to < 6 years old, 0.9 mg (3 capsules) in children ≥6 to
      < 12, 1.2 mg (4 capsules) in children ≥12 to < 16 and adults ≥16 and < 65. On Day 2, patients
      will return to the clinic for collection of a pre-dose blood sample followed by
      administration of the study dose of colchicine. On Days 3-7, patients (parent/guardian) will
      self-medicate with the study dose of colchicine recording the time of dosing and any adverse
      events. On Days 8-14, patients (parent/guardian) will self-medicate with the study dose of
      colchicine recording the time of dosing and any adverse events. On the morning of Day 15,
      patients will return to the clinic for collection of a pre-dose blood sample followed by
      administration of the study dose of colchicine. Blood samples will be collected post-dose at
      times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its metabolites.
      Safety and tolerability of this dosing regimen will be determined by evaluation of vital
      signs and adverse events during the study and upon completion of the study. All adverse
      events will be evaluated by the investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.
