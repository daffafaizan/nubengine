      three designs in the replacement process of one single tooth (i.e. a missing premolar or
      molar.) The first design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal
      surface from e-max press.

      The second design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface
      from e-max press and the internal surface coated with glaze layer to improve the adhesion.

      The third design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface
      from e-max press and the internal surface coated with a layer of e-max ceramic press to
      improve the adhesion.
