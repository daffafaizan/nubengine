      despite recent progress on its standard of care using TMZ as the main trunk of initial
      therapy in the newly diagnosed setting. One of the main reasons accounting for the dismal
      prognosis would attribute to lack of active therapeutic regimens at recurrence.

      Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against cardinal angiogenic factor vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently shown efficacy for recurrent GBM, and has been
      approved in Japan, thereby being a standard care for recurrent GBM. Since there is no
      effective drugs or regimens developed at bevacizumab failure, insertion of another active
      drug prior to bevacizumab induction would enhance survival time for patients with recurrent
      GBM.

      In Japan, there are currently only few chemotherapeutic agents approved and available for
      GBM. Among them rechallenge with alternating dosing of TMZ have shown certain efficacy with
      acceptable toxicities for patients with TMZ-pretreated recurrent GBM, thus being a good
      candidate for the regimen used prior to bevacizumab at recurrence.

      The present proposal of sequential administration of dose dense TMZ (7/14d) followed by
      bevacizumab wishes to define a new standard of care for recurrent disease and hopes to
      identify the subgroups of patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma that respond
      particularly well to dose-dense temozolomide regimens.

      This study is carried out as a JCOG Brain Tumor Study Group multicenter randomized phase III
      trial under approval by Advanced Medical Care B system, Ministry of Health, Labour and
      Welfare, Japan.
