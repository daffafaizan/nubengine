      or olanzapine with escitalopram for treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients with
      incomplete response to adequate trials of either of the two antipsychotic medications. To our
      knowledge, this is the first double blind randomized study designed to examine the potential
      augmentation benefit of escitalopram combined with a commonly used atypical agent in chronic
      schizophrenic patients with incomplete response to risperidone or olanzapine. The current
      proposal offers the possibility to test the efficacy of augmentation treatment in a
      controlled fashion with clinical and biological variables used as indicators of response and
      tolerability. From a broader perspective, it would test the hypothesis of potential validity
      of SSRI augmentation strategy in treatment of resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.
