           daily diet and dietary intake in the daily observation scale (Table 1).

        2. High control diet intervention: the course of treatment was 31 days. According to the
           actual intake of calories, 2 / 3, 1 / 2, 1 / 3 and 1 / 4 of the actual intake of the
           subjects were calculated as the light fasting calories. The treatment course of each
           calorie stage was 4 days. The subjects recorded the daily diet and dietary intake, and
           the nutritionists calculated the daily calorie intake and dietary types of each subject
           according to the daily calorie intake of each subject's normal diet. During the period
           of high control diet intervention, the diet on the day of light fasting was provided by
           the research group. Besides the diet provided by the research group, other foods (except
           water without calories) were strictly prohibited on the day of light fasting.

        3. Low control diet intervention: the course of treatment was 31 days. It is suggested that
           the calorie intake of men and women should be 600 kcal / day and 500 kcal / day on the
           day of light fasting. The diet type can refer to the recipe made by the nutritionist.
