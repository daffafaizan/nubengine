      grazing and time-restricting feeding ("early eating"). While on each eating schedule,
      metabolism (calories burned) will be measured during a 24-hour stay in a respiratory chamber.
      Glucose levels-as well as key diurnal rhythms such in heart rate-will also be measured
      continuously. This study requires two 1-week periods of participation.
