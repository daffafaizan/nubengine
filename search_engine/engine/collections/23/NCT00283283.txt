      immunogenicity of subjects receiving half-dose Fluzone速 compared to full-dose Fluzone速,
      2004-2005 formulation. 1440 healthy subjects, ages 18-64 years old and not currently
      indicated for influenza vaccination under the interim ACIP guidelines, were divided into 8
      strata based on age, gender, and previous exposure to influenza vaccine, and randomized to
      receive either half-dose (0.25mL) Fluzone速 or full-dose (0.5mL) Fluzone速 by intramuscular
      injection into the deltoid muscle.
