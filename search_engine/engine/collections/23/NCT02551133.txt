      cancer-related deaths. Acute pain can contribute to the development of persistent surgical
      pain. Persistent postsurgical pain has been demonstrated to be clinically relevant in 10% to
      50% of patients undergoing various common operations, including breast cancer surgery. The
      pathogenic mechanisms are multiple, including nerve damage related to surgical technique
      resulting in risk of intercostobrachial neuralgia, neuroma pain, or phantom breast pain.
      Multimodal analgesic strategies are important.Glucocorticoid steroids can also provide
      beneficial effects when administered in appropriate doses as part of a multimodal analgesic
      regimen in the perioperative setting. A recent study demonstrated that preoperative
      application of dexamethasone reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in patients
      after thyroidectomy.. It is possible that the already established reduction in prostaglandin
      synthesis mediated by dexamethasone contributes to the analgesia. And also there are a lot of
      mechanisms more.
