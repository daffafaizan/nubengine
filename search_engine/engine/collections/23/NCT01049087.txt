      plasma volume. There are a number of clinical situations in which a nuclide with a shorter
      half-life would be preferred. Furthermore, due to periodic lapses in the availability in the
      delivery of 125I-labeled albumin, there is a need to evaluate another nuclide as a tracer for
      plasma volume determination.

      99mTc-labeled albumin is easily prepared by a simple and reproducible method with a high
      labeling efficiency and short half-life.

      In this study, we want to compare plasma volume determined by 99mTc-labeled albumin with
      plasma volume determined by 125I-albumin (golden standard). In both procedures, plasma volume
      is estimated from multiple postinjection samples for accurate zero-time extrapolation in
      order to correct for leakage of labeled albumin from the vascular compartment.
