      WP0, Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue (BMAT) in CCUS and LR-MDS Patients: The primary objective of
      WP0 is to determine if patients with CCUS or LR-MDS have increased BMAT compared to
      age-matched healthy controls. To investigate this, we will include 12 elderly (â‰¥60 years)
      healthy controls who will have their BMAT measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
      These will be compared to the BMAT measurements from baseline of patients described in WP1.

      WP1, The efficacy of metformin in CCUS and LR-MDS: In WP1, 24 patients with either CCUS or
      MDS will receive metformin 2000 mg/daily for 12 months with a slow-up-titration of the dose
      14 days prior to full-dose treatment. Outcomes of WP1 are listed in the outcome section on
      this site.

      WP2, The efficacy of metformin compared to placebo and vitamin C: The primary objective of
      WP2 is to compare the effect of metformin in CCUS and LR-MDS to the effect of placebo or
      vitamin C treatment. To investigate this, we will include data and samples from 48 historical
      controls from our EVI-2 study (NCT03999723. Half of the controls received placebo for 12
      months and the other half received vitamin C for 12 months.
