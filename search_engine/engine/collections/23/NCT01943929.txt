      will be asked to answer a questionnaire, where he will be able to describe his headache
      features (if present) . This information will be correlated with patient images findings,
      which are going to be evaluated by head and neck radiologists blinded for clinical
      information. Logistic regression model will be used to verify this association; the presence
      of sinusitis and fever will used be as covariates.
