      mainly in the outpatient setting by using interactive modules for education. This study will
      expose some participants to this program while participants are hospitalized on an inpatient
      unit, and give the participants access to it after participants are discharged from the
      hospital. Those participants will still receive treatment as usual, as will the control
      group.
