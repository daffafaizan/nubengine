      Center of the Southwest (BHRCS), a center of the Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation
      (PIRE), the Health Committee of the New Mexico Indian Council on Aging (NMICoA), and the
      University of New Mexico (UNM). The project combines qualitative and quantitative interviews
      with concept-mapping (CM) techniques and focus groups to study insurance coverage,
      help-seeking behavior, and the healthcare experiences of American Indian Elders (AIEs) in New
      Mexico (NM). Practical knowledge grounded in the actual perspectives of AIEs and other key
      stakeholders may improve healthcare practices and policies for a population largely excluded
      from national and state discussions of health reform. The study data will also inform the
      adaptation and development of culturally tailored programming to enrich understanding and
      facilitate negotiation of a changing landscape of healthcare by AIEs. Our four specific aims
      are to:

        1. Assess how AIEs understand, access, maintain, and use insurance coverage.

        2. Characterize AIE help-seeking and healthcare experiences in dominant service delivery
           settings, i.e., Indian Health Service (IHS), tribally-run 638 facilities, and managed
           care programs.

        3. Identify and compare factors that affect AIE access to health care as perceived by
           multiple stakeholders, i.e., AIEs, outreach workers (OWs), healthcare staff and
           providers, public sector administrators, and tribal leaders.

        4. Develop and assess implementation feasibility of a structured intervention for OWs that
           promotes enhanced patient navigation, in addition to healthcare literacy, access, and
           usage among AIEs.
