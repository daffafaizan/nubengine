    
      Review of all massively burned patients treated at Lausanne University Hospital burn
      intensive care unit (ca. 40-60 patients). Analysis of changes in length of intensive care
      unit stay (LICU), skin graft take rate or mortality between 2000 and 2018.

      Hypothesis : the optimization of resuscitation procedures and of nutrition therapy combined
      with the use of novel surgical techniques has brought a significant improvement in outcomes.

      Association between outcomes and year of admission will be assessed through correlation
      analysis and logistic regression analysis. Potential cofounders will be assessed through
      stepwise linear regression analysis
