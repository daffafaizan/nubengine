      (depressive disorders, insomnia, heart rhythm and heart rate disorders, carotid artery
      disease, and hypertension), measures of liver and renal impairment, disorders of carbohydrate
      and lipid metabolism). The evaluation criteria for each category were determined based on
      recommendations defined in the ESC, AHA, EFSD, and KIDIGO guidelines.
