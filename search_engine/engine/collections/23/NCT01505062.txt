      retina by an opthalmic surgeon under anesthesia. Participants then had regular follow-up
      visits where general health examinations, blood tests and ophthalmic examinations including
      best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy,
      autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, perimetry and electroretinogram were
      undertaken.

      At the end of the study, the participants were invited to enter in an open-label safety study
      for long-term follow-up visits (at least once every six months) including ophthalmological
      examinations and recording of adverse events (AEs) were continued for 5 years; then the
      Investigator followed the participants by telephone for a subsequent 10 years at a minimum
      interval of once a year to monitor delayed AEs.
