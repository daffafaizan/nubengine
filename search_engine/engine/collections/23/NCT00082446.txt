      immunogenicity of MVA-BN in vaccinia-naïve adults. The secondary goals of this vaccine trial
      are: to determine the optimum dose of MVA-BN, given twice, to induce an immune response and
      attenuate Dryvax® take reactions; and to compare the ability of 2 routes of administration of
      MVA-BN, subcutaneous and intramuscular, to induce an immune response at the highest tested
      dose. A total of 90 healthy adult volunteers ages 18-32 will participate in this study. The
      volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups to be immunized with: MVA-BN
      (subcutaneously) at 1 of 3 dose levels and Dryvax® (per scarification); placebo
      (subcutaneously) and Dryvax® (per scarification); MVA-BN (subcutaneously) at the highest dose
      level and placebo scarification; or MVA-BN (intramuscularly) at the highest dose level and
      Dryvax® (per scarification). The study will last about 30 months. Each volunteer's
      participation will last 6 months for all treatment groups. Subjects randomized to treatment
      groups D and E will have follow-up for 2 years. During this time, volunteers will return
      periodically for blood draws to check immune responses. Subjects will require visits for
      dressing changes as needed post-Dryvax vaccination. Variables to be investigated include:
      adverse events and side effects to the vaccines, and immunogenicity testing including
      antibody and cellular responses to the vaccines.
