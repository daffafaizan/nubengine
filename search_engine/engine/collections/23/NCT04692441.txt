    
      Overview: The purpose of the study is to enroll 90 older adults, half of whom will have E4
      carrier status, to assess whether E4 status affects change in global cerebral blood flow
      (∆CBF) in response to a high fat drink. The screening visit includes informed consent,
      baseline blood draw, oral triglyceride tolerance test (OTTT), and dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA). The study visit involves assessing cerebral blood flow using arterial
      spin labeling (ASL) MRI - at baseline and at 2 hours after drinking heavy cream. The study
      visit will also include 6 blood draws and a 30 minute cognitive battery.

      Screening Visit Procedures (at Seattle South Lake Union campus): Before the screening visit,
      participants will receive a copy of the consent form in the mail as well as a medical history
      questionnaire to fill out. Participants will be advised to fast the night before the
      screening visit (minimum 8 hours required). After an informed consent process, study
      personnel will check vitals, including waist circumference, height, and weight for body mass
      index (BMI) calculation. An IV will be placed by the study nurse and blood sent for complete
      blood count, chem20 (including liver and kidney function assessment), glycated hemoglobin
      (hemoglobin A1C), lipid panel, and a blood sample for APOE genotyping (Northwest Lipids using
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology). Blood samples except APOE will be sent to the
      University of Washington (UW) Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified lab,
      and participants will receive a copy of the results by mail. After the blood draw,
      participants will then undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): 6 time points (0, 15,
      30, 45, 60,120 min) which will include a blood draw for plasma to measure insulin and C
      peptide (in batches by Northwest (NW) lipids). At time 0 and 120 minutes study personnel will
      also assess vitals and a point of care glucose using a glucometer. The OGTT will be the
      standard 75 grams glucose drink from central supply. After the 2-hour OGTT is complete,
      patients will undergo a DEXA scan. Note, DEXA can be performed before OGTT if needed for
      study flow. Parking will be provided, and participants will be paid with a gift card.

      Screening visit sample day:

      8 am: Check in to the clinic 8-8:30: informed consent in private room, go over medical
      history 8:30-9: Insert IV, fill out depression, anxiety screen, draw baseline blood 9 -11 am:
      OGTT (During gaps in OGTT, do Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) 11-11:25 am: DEXA
      11:25-11:30: Remove IV, distribute gift card and parking validation Time: 3.5 hours, total
      blood drawn 40 mls

      Study Visit Procedures (at University of Washington main campus): Participants will arrive to
      the UW Translational Research Unit (TRU) after an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours required).
      The study nurse will place an IV, and check vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate,
      temperature, and weight. Then, the participant will be escorted to the MRI scanner and
      undergo the fasting imaging protocol. The participant will head back to the TRU and start the
      oral triglyceride tolerance test (OTTT). Time 0 blood is drawn and time documented. Then, the
      participant will drink the dairy product-100 mLs of heavy cream (just under half a cup) which
      contains 370 calories, 40.4 grams of total fat, 23.6 grams of saturated fat. The participant
      will be encouraged to drink the product over 5 minutes as per published OTTT protocols. Blood
      draws will be collected for measurement of glucose, insulin, lipids and appetite hormones
      (30, 120, 180, 240 min). A post-lipid MRI will be done at the 2 hour time point, and the NIH
      toolbox cognitive assessment will be done at 3 hour time point. The NIH battery takes
      approximately 30 minutes to administer and will be done on a portable tablet.

      Study visit sample day:

      8 am: Check in to UW TRU, ask about new medications, place IV 8:15: Escort down to MRI area,
      get pre-MRI 8:45: Back at TRU: T0 blood draw 8:45-8:50: Drink lipid 9:20: T30 min blood draw
      9:50: T60 min blood draw 10:50: T120 min (2 hour) blood draw

      **Return to MRI scanner for 2 hour MRI** (will be ~2 hours and 10 minutes post drink) 11:50:
      T180 min (3 hour) blood draw **Do the NIH toolbox testing now - takes about 30 minutes**
      12:50: T240 min (4 hour) blood draw 12:50-1 pm: Remove IV, receipt of gift card, participant
      checks out. Time: 5 hours, total blood drawn: 80 mls (13 per blood draw x 6 time points)

      MRI protocol: The investigator will use pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to measure
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ml/100g/min as a marker of perfusion for improved signal
      quality. In this approach, magnetically labeled arterial blood water serves as the endogenous
      contrast. MRI images will be stored on external hard drive with encryption and will be
      uploaded to One Drive or another HIPAA-compliant system for further processing and analysis.

      Experiment: As per the consensus recommendations, the investigator will use a sequence (5.5
      minutes) with long label duration = 1.8 s, long post-labeling delay = 2 s, with labeling
      offset = 25-30 mm, slices = 20, spatial resolution = 3.5×3.5×5 mm3, field of view =
      240×240×100 mm3, SENSE-factor = 2, repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)= 5000/18 ms. Dual
      adiabatic background suppression pulses will be applied to minimize gray and white matter
      tissue contamination at inversion delay (TI) = 2.05 and 3.25 s. Finally, the investigator
      will acquire an equilibrium magnetization scan (M0, 1 minute), identical to the above scan,
      but with TR = 10,000 ms and no labeling or background suppression.

      Analysis: First, motion correction will be applied to the arterial spin labeling images using
      motion correction (FSL-MCFLIRT), and these will be registered to the M0 image. Then, the
      investigator will perform a pair-wise subtraction between the control and null images and
      apply a two-compartment model to quantify CBF. The resulting CBF map will be co-registered to
      the T1 scan followed by a transformation to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.The
      temporal regions such as the entorhinal cortex, temporal lobe, hippocampus as well as the
      posterior cingulate and lateral parietal lobules will be identified using standard
      Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical atlas. CBF values will be compared in these regions
      between the groups. The region of interest approach can dilute effects that are smaller than
      the size of the region of interest. Therefore, the investigator will also perform
      permutations testing in FSL to evaluate voxel-wise CBF differences between group. In order to
      ensure that the voxel-wise outcomes are not mere chance, the investigator will impose strict
      family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons.
