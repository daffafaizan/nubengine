      scheduled to receive femoral antegrade intramedullary nailing to treat a femur fracture. This
      study evaluates the clinical ease of use of the Femoral Antegrade Starting Tool (FAST)
      device, and the surgical workflow during entry point selection and guidewire alignment for
      intramedullary nailing of femoral fractures. It is hypothesized that the usage of the tool
      will reduce surgery time and number of images required.
