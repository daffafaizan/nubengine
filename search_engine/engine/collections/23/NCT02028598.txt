      inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Clomipramine may be used in a variety of
      indications. Condencia Tab contains low dose of 15mg of clomipramine HCl as an active
      ingredient, which is newly approved to market for the treatment of premature ejaculation.

      This study is a prospective, randomised, open-labeled, 6-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment,
      crossover, and single-center clinical trial. A total of 30 healthy male volunteers will be
      enrolled and randomised into one among 6 groups (5 subjects per a group). The safety and
      PK/PD characteristics of co-administration of Clomipramine HCl and Sildenafil citrate will be
      investigated closely compared to the effects after single dose administrations.
