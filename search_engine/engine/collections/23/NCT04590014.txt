      ventilation, dyspnea, and related physiological responses relative to the conventional
      Precision Flow device design, with which there are published clinical outcomes data. It is
      hypothesized that the new HVNI device design (V2.0) will be comparable at relieving patient
      dyspnea when compared to the conventional HVNI device design (Precision Flow).
