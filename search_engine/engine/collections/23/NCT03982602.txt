      one-third of injury-related deaths in United States. The Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1.7 million people in the United States sustain a TBI each
      year. It is responsible for significant disabilities and the total cost of productivity loss
      was estimated to be $76.5 billion in the United States in 2004.

      Several animal models have demonstrated the effectiveness of ketones in brain injury to
      decrease the size of contusion, improving cortical ATP levels, reduced brain edema and
      cellular apoptosis. Ketones have been shown to be effective in neuromodulation in animal
      models. Evaluation of carbohydrate free diet has been done in traumatic brain injury patients
      and it was noted to not cause fluctuations in blood glucose. There is a need for safety and
      feasibility study of ketogenic diet in traumatic brain injury patients and to understand the
      effectiveness in neuromodulation in humans. The present study focuses on identifying the
      safety and feasibility of KD in traumatic brain injury patients.

      This pilot project data will be utilized to design future randomized clinical trials. Based
      on the safety data, further trials will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of KD in
      traumatic brain injury patients and its effectiveness in controlling elevated intracranial
      pressure. It will open the avenue for consideration of new treatment option for intracranial
      pressure management and functional recovery. From a nutrition perspective, Ketogenic diet
      might become the standard of care for this patient population.
