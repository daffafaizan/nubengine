      plaque accumulation in vitro, whereas only few performed a modern in vitro assessment of the
      plaque accumulation. In this study we intend to find out the pattern of biofilm accumulation
      in vivo on various surface finishings.

      Our intention is to prepare Polymethylmetacrylate squers on orthodontical brackets,then
      prepare the surface of the sample and measure the surface roughness with a profilimeter and
      get the mean value in Ra units, then place the brackets on lower premolars and molars for 12
      hours, remove them and examine the biofilm formed with confocal scanning microscope.

      Statistical evaluation of pilot study determined the need to perform this research on
      twelve(12) candidates. It is our intention to check two materials in each candidate:
      composite resin and polymethylmetacrylate.
