    
      Adults that are not colonized with O. formigenes, have no history of stone disease and are in
      good health as judged by their medical history, a complete metabolic profile of their serum,
      and ranges of ions that influence stone formation in two 24-hour urine collections, will be
      recruited from within the greater Birmingham area. Recruited subjects will be between the
      ages of 18 to 65 years and with a BMI >19 and <32.

      Subjects not colonized with O. formigenes will consume, firstly, a controlled diet containing
      50 mg oxalate and 1000mg calcium (low oxalate/normal calcium diet), followed by a 250 mg
      oxalate/400mg calcium controlled diet (moderately high oxalate/low calcium diet), with at
      least a one week washout between each diet, and then repeat the same sequence of diets after
      colonization with O.formigenes Group 1 strain OxCC13. Controlled diets will be prepared in
      the Metabolic Kitchen of the UAB Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Each subject will perform a
      sodium 13C2-oxalate oral load once at the end of each of the two dietary phases to assess
      dietary oxalate absorption. Sustainability of colonization will be determined over time. Loss
      of colonization will be confirmed by having the subject consume an oxalate-rich meal with
      subsequent testing for O. formigenes.
