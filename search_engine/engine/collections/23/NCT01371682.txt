    
      This is an open-label, randomised, two-period crossover, single dose study to demonstrate
      bioequivalence between the extended release 2 mg ropinirole XL tablets manufactured at two
      different sites in healthy subjects. Dosing will be under fasting conditions and there will
      be a minimum one week washout between doses. Domperidone will be administered to control
      dopaminergic side effects. Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken following each dose. Safety
      assessments will include screening and follow-up vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratory
      tests. Vital signs and adverse events will be monitored periodically throughout the study.

      The manufacturing of ropinirole XL tablets will be moved from the Crawley (UK) manufacturing
      facility to the Aranda (Spain) manufacturing facility. The tablets manufactured at Aranda
      will have the same characteristics as those manufactured at Crawley.

      The present pharmacokinetic study is designed to assess bioequivalence of ropinirole XL 2 mg
      tablets manufactured at Aranda vs ropinirole XL 2 mg tablets manufactured at Crawley.
      Bioequivalence between the two tablets will be tested in healthy subjects and administered in
      the fasting state.
