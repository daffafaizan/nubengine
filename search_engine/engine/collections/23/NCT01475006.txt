    
      This study of AMG 595 will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (dose exploration) and Part 2
      (dose expansion). Part 1 of the study is in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM) and/or anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and Part 2 is examining the MTD in subjects with
      recurrent GBM. Approximately 30-40 subjects may be enrolled in Part 1, and up to 36 subjects
      may be enrolled in Part 2. The dose of AMG 595 utilized in Part 2 will be dependent upon data
      obtained in Part 1 of the study.
