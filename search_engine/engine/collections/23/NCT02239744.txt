      Shanghai, China in 2014. These students lived in dormitories that were randomized into two
      groups and alternated the use of true or sham air purifiers for 48 hours with a 2-week
      wash-out interval.All participants and research staff were blinded to the group assignment.
      We requested all participants to stay in their dormitory room with the windows/doors closed
      throughout each 48-hour intervention period. We delivered foods and drinks to each room
      during the intervention period. All interventions started at 8 a.m. to avoid issues related
      to diurnal variation. We evaluated health endpoints and drew blood immediately after the
      completion of each 48-hour intervention. We measured 14 circulating biomarkers of
      inflammation, coagulation and vasoconstriction, lung function, blood pressure (BP), and
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).
