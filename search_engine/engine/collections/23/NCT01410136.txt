      middle age adults and can lead to progressive joint degeneration. In response to challenges
      with current cartilage repair options, Chondrofix Allograft was developed as an off-the-shelf
      treatment option adding to the variety of cartilage reparation offerings.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, post-market clinical outcomes study designed to
      assess the clinical outcomes of Chondrofix Allograft used in the treatment of both primary
      and revision cartilage repair cases. Study design includes up to 6 qualified investigational
      sites with 50 subjects enrolled across all centers during an 18 month enrollment period.
      Study subjects will be followed postoperatively for 5 years. The Investigators who are
      responsible for the conduct of this study in compliance with this protocol will be orthopedic
      surgeons who are skilled in the techniques of articular cartilage repair.
