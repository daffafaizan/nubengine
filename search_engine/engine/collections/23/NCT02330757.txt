      preparation by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the other will be subjected to minimal
      ovarian stimulation (MOS). Women in the HRT group will be given estradiol valerate 4 mg daily
      from day 2 to day 12 of the cycle then the endometrial thickness will be assessed on day 13
      by transvaginal sonography (TVS). If the endometrium is â‰¥ 8 mm and of moderate echogenicity,
      luteal phase support (using progesterone supplements) will be started but if the endometrium
      is < 8 mm, estradiol valerate will be continued until reaching appropriate endometrial
      thickness and echogenicity then the luteal phase support will be started. Women in the MOS
      group will be given clomiphene citrate in dose of 100-150 mg daily for 5 days (from day 2 to
      day 6 of the cycle) then switched to low dose gonadotropin (75-150 IU daily) followed by
      monitoring of the follicular growth (folliculometry) ); starting from day 10 of the
      stimulation cycle and repeated every 2 days. Final oocyte maturation will be induced by
      administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) when there will be at least one leading
      follicle > 18 mm in diameter followed by luteal phase support (using progesterone
      supplements) after 48 hours. In both groups, FET will be planned in the appropriate day
      according to the stage that the embryos have been cryopreserved in it.
