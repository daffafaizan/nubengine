      and malignant neoplasms and cysts of specific histopathologies develop in the kidney, adrenal
      gland, pancreas, brain, spinal cord, eye, inner ear, epididymis, and broad ligament. Retinal
      angioma may be one of the earliest manifestations of VHL disease and may lead to a
      significant decrease in visual acuity of the affected individual. These tumors rarely regress
      spontaneously. The main cause of vision loss is retinal edema, specifically macular edema
      secondary to enlargement of peripheral retinal angiomas or angiomas found on or around the
      optic disk. Treatment of retinal angiomas depends on the location and size of the lesions but
      typically consists of photocoagulation or cryotherapy. However, there is no proven effective
      therapy for the treatment of VHL ocular lesions on or surrounding the optic nerve or lesions
      in the peripheral retina too large to respond to the traditional therapies. The genetic
      mutation found in VHL disease up-regulates the production of vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF). Immunochemical studies of the VHL ocular lesions, as well as others found
      elsewhere in the body show marked increase in VEGF. This open-label study will pilot the use
      of anti-VEGF therapy (EYE001) in 5 patients to investigate the potential efficacy as a
      treatment for retinal angiomas associated with VHL. Patients will receive 6 intravitreal
      injections of study drug over a 30-week period, then return for a follow-up visit 1 year
      after initiating injections. The primary outcomes will be improvement in best corrected
      visual acuity of 15 letters or more at 1 year, reduction in retinal thickening and leakage at
      one year, changes in ERG amplitude and implicit time, and adverse events including local and
      systemic toxicities.
