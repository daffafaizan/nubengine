      Asthma, a disease characterized by increased airway reactivity and inflammation in response
      to a variety of stimuli, is emerging as the most prevalent and serious environmental health
      problem among children in the United States. Numerous studies, both prospective and
      cross-sectional, suggest that exposure to ETS is one of the predominate risk factors for
      childhood asthma, but this has not been confirmed in a controlled trial.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The randomized, double-blind prospective trial involving 225 children with doctor-diagnosed
      asthma who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke tests the efficacy of reducing such
      exposure on unscheduled asthma visits and asthma symptoms. The intervention consists of
      placement of 2 high efficiency air filtration with activated carbon, potassium permanganate
      and zeolite filter insert to reduce exposure to ETS in the experimental homes and inactive
      (placebo) units in the control group homes. The following hypotheses are tested. (1.0)
      Children assigned to the ETS reduction group will have a greater than 20 percent reduction in
      unscheduled asthma visits during one-year follow-up compared with those in the control group.
      (1.1) Children assigned to the ETS reduction group will have significant improvements in
      asthma symptoms compared with children in the control group. (1.2) Children assigned to the
      ETS reduction group will have greater than 10 percent reduction in ETS exposure and exhaled
      nitric oxide, a measure of airway inflammation during one year of follow-up compared with the
      control group.
