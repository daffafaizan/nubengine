      and the technique used for reconstruction of the bile duct. One of the main techniques of
      performing biliary reconstruction is a choledocholedochostomy which can be performed over an
      anastomotic stent. Although placement of biliary stents is routine practice in many liver
      transplant centers around the country, there is no clear evidence to support their use. As of
      now both the placement and non-placement of a stent are essentially "standard of care". In
      the investigators' center, many of the transplant surgeons now perform the biliary
      anastomosis over a pediatric feeding tube which is used as a stent. The practice of using
      stents in biliary anastomosis is not uniform and there are no established guidelines to
      support their indiscriminate application. The investigators have designed a prospective
      randomized trial to evaluate the effect of stent placement on biliary complications and its
      effect on morbidity.
