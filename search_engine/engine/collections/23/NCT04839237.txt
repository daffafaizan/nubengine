      social problem. Obese often associated with kinds of metabolic disorders, especially type 2
      diabetes, and Liraglutide can effectively reduce weight and improve blood glucose.Previous
      studies have indicated that most patients will experience different degrees of weight loss
      after using Liraglutide, but there is also a small number of patients with no significant
      weight loss.The gene polymorphism among individuals may affect the weight loss effect of
      Liraglutide.

      Objectivesï¼š1.To find the relationships between genetic variants and the response of
      Liraglutide to treatment of obese patients.2.To investigate the effects of Liraglutide on
      weight, metabolism (blood glucose, blood lipid, uric acid, etc.) and gut microbiota in obese
      Chinese patients.

      Intervention:Half of participants will receive Liraglutide alone,while the other half who can
      not achieving adequate glycaemic control will receive Liraglutide and metformin in
      combination.
