    
      DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-comparison noninferiority trial

      POPULATION: Adults aged >18 years intending to undergo elective primary unilateral TKA at the
      Kaiser Permanente Northern California, San Leandro Medical Center

      INTERVENTION: Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:

        1. Adductor canal catheter placement in the pre-operative area immediately prior to TKA
           surgery OR

        2. No adductor canal catheter placement

      DURATION: The intervention phase will occur between randomization and three days
      postoperatively (or until the ACC is removed by the participant or the ACC falls out
      spontaneously among ACC-randomized participants); the primary outcome will be measured on
      postoperative day 2, secondary pain and medication outcomes will be collected for two weeks
      postoperatively and the electronic medical record (EMR) will be examined for evidence of
      adverse events at 3 months postoperatively

      SAMPLE SIZE: 118 participants randomized using balanced allocation to the two study arms
