    
      -  Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) will be enrolled in
           this study.

        -  A computerized randomization process is used to obtain similar distributions within each
           group. Stratification will be done by the severity of coronary artery disease, age and
           sex.

        -  Routine blood sampling will be performed the day before surgery as well as a
           transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) study to determine ventricular volumes and valvular
           function.

        -  A modified Minnesota quality of Life questionnaire will be assessed and these data will
           be compared with 30 days outcome data screened in an outpatient environment.

        -  A 12 lead electrocardiogram will be obtained. To assess eligibility and to assure
           grouping (stratification & randomization) patients will be scored using the additive
           EuroSCORE. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative (up to 72 hrs) measurements of myocardial
           enzyme leakage will be performed using standard diagnostic procedures (cardiac troponin
           T, CK-MB, and total creatine kinase), as well as serial electrocardiograms and
           echocardiograms.

        -  Perioperative infarction will be assessed as the development of new persistent regional
           wall motion abnormalities in echocardiography together with electrocardiographic
           alterations and CK-MB increases and new Q-wave PMI.

        -  Sequential cytokine analyses (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, VEGF and TNF- alpha )
           preoperatively, at the beginning of the operation, the beginning of ECC and 6,24 h and
           30 days postop.

        -  Serial quantification of global and regional wall motion will be recorded using TEE
           measurements during surgery.
