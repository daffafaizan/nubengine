      dose of CP-609,754 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the predictability,
      duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose relationship of any observed toxicities
      in these patients when treated with this regimen. III. Determine any preliminary evidence of
      antitumor activity of this treatment as assessed by response rate and time to disease
      progression in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral CP-609,754 1-2 times daily.
      Treatment continues every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CP-609,754 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed at 4
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 12
      months.
