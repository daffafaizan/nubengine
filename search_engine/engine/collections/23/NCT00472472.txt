      femoropopliteal arteries by percutaneous intervention is still limited by high rates of
      restenosis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel
      method of short time local drug delivery based on a paclitaxel-coated balloon in
      femoropopliteal arteries.

      Methods and results: The double-blind and randomized study enrolled n=79 patients with
      occlusion or stenosis of femoropopliteal arteries. Inclusion criteria were clinical
      Rutherford stage 1-5, occlusion or hemodynamic relevant stenosis (â‰¥ 70 % diameter) of
      femoropopliteal arteries and successful guiding wire recanalization. The primary endpoint was
      the late lumen loss after 6 months follow-up as seen in angiography. Secondary endpoints
      included the rate of restenosis (a binary variable), change of ankle brachial index (ABI),
      rutherford class and major adverse events.
