      bilirubin comes from the destruction of RBC which heme is released and catabolized. If the
      bilirubin enters into the brain and deposits in basal ganglion, it will cause apoptosis of
      the neuronal cells, that is so called kernictrus, which is the major complication of the
      neonatal jaundice. However, the bilirubin has its own antioxidant protective effect. Many
      clinical or basic studies tried to find out the relationship of bilirubin and reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) in recent years.

      The American Association of Pediatrics proposed the management principle of neonatal jaundice
      in 1994. It postponed the management criteria of neonatal jaundice Besides, early discharge
      (before 48 hour-old) was the trend in many countries. It may be dangerous because the
      neonatal jaundice appears after 48 hour-old. Whether the criteria and the trend will cause
      the elevation of the incidence of kernictrus, is always the major concern of clinicians. So,
      searching factors to predict neonatal hyperbilirubinemia causes the interest of many
      investigators. The predictors are divided into risk-factor based and normogram based. But
      they are still not suitable for all populations.
