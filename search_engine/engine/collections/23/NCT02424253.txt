    
      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in
      approximately 90 subjects (60:30 in the active:placebo groups respectively) with a pruritus
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥5 (0-10 scale), an Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) > 3 (0-5 scale) and moderate-severe AD Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥12 and ≤
      48 (0-72 scale). Each subject will have a screening visit(s) to confirm suitability to enter
      the study. At a subsequent visit (start of Run In), the subject will be provided with the
      electronic diary (eDiary) to capture pruritus, sleep disturbance and emollient use, which
      must be completed on Days -7 to -1 (Run In). Subjects will then attend the clinic at Baseline
      (Day 0) when they will be reviewed to confirm they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and have
      completed the Run In diary appropriately. If appropriate, they will then be randomized to
      receive either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily (od) or placebo od for 8 weeks (56 days).
