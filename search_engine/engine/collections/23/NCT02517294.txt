      in the nasopharynx causing less mucosal damage than standard nasotracheal tubes.

      The investigators aim to test whether mucosal injury during nasotracheal intubation in
      children undergoing general anesthesia for dental procedures can thus be minimized taking
      into consideration adenoid size, and differences in nasopharyngeal diameter.
