      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of denileukin diftitox, in terms of objective response and time
           to progression, in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the 1-year overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 20-80 minutes on days 1-3, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36,
      43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, and 99 (weeks 1-16) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial response at week 16 may continue
      treatment once monthly for up to 8 additional doses or until a complete response (CR) is
      achieved. Patients achieving a CR (at any time) receive 2 additional monthly doses of
      denileukin diftitox beyond CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
