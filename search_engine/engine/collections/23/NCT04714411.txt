      historical control patients) evaluating the use of omadacycline for treatment of diabetic
      foot infections (DFI). Omadacycline (NuzyraÂ®) is a FDA approved antibiotic for skin and skin
      structure infection and community-acquired pneumonia. This study is considered to be
      investigational because data is being collected on the use of Omadacycline for the treatment
      of DFI.
