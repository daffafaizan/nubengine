      Central venous pressure is the indication of the pressure in the right atrium of the heart
      and it can be measured by determining the height of the blood column in the internal or
      external jugular vein. Clinical use of CVP has a wide range of applications including
      diagnosis of heart failure, pleural effusion, hypervolemia, hypovolemia, and sepsis. The
      standard clinical method for attaining CVP non-invasively is the physical examination of
      jugular venous pulse (JVP). The JVP provides a useful estimate of the CVP.

      It is often difficult to identify the internal jugular vein to determine the JVP. The
      internal jugular vein is deep and adjacent to the carotid artery and pulsations derived from
      the artery may obscure the subtle venous pulsations. Manoeuvres to differentiate carotid
      pulsation and jugular pulsation are helpful in identifying the internal jugular vein, however
      determining the JVP based on the internal jugular vein examination is difficult.

      Examination of the external jugular vein to determine JVP is an appealing alternative. The
      external jugular vein is easier to visualize and studies have demonstrated that this is a
      reliable method that correlates highly with catheter measured CVP.
