      University is that this initial challenge study will support additional challenge studies
      planned for the future. In these future studies, a bovine milk immunoglobulin containing high
      levels of antibodies specific for colonization factor antigen (CFA/I) or CFA/I-derived
      colonization factor will be investigated as a potential oral prophylaxis to neutralize
      subsequent challenge against CFA/I-expressing H10407 in the clinical setting. The goal here
      is therefore to validate a challenge dose of 1x109 h10407 organisms in the hands of the Johns
      Hopkins investigative team and to then use this dose in the future prophylaxis/challenge
      studies. Challenge doses equal to or comparable to the 1x109 dose proposed for the Johns
      Hopkins University (JHU) study have been used in 6 of the 9 challenge studies that have been
      done with the H10407 strain. The subsequent challenge studies using H10407 will be registered
      as part of other protocols.
