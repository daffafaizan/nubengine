      This study is not intended for use in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing, or preventing
      disease.

      66 women at normal risk for developing breast cancer will be recruited and enrolled. 22 women
      will be randomized into each arm, with anticipation of 2 women in each group will not be
      evaluable, leaving 20 in each group for evaluation.

      A combination of vitamin D and celecoxib act synergistically to decrease breast cancer risk
      by decreasing cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium through their action on
      prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism.

      Specific Aims:

      -Evaluate vitamin D metabolism, through the measurement of CYP24 in the breast.

      2-Evaluate breast specific levels of vitamin D and celecoxib, and assess if the levels of
      these compounds correlate with response to markers which influence prostaglandin synthesis
      and metabolism. Additionally, in women without active breast cancer , we will determine the
      effect of vitamin D, with or without celecoxib, on 1) PG synthesis and metabolism, through
      the measurement of PGE2, COX-2 and 15-PGDH in the breast, 2) proliferative activity in the
      breast,, and 3) circulating levels of vitamin D and celecoxib, to determine if levels of
      these compounds correlate with response to markers of PG production, metabolism, or cell
      proliferation.
