      consideration there is no minimal interesting difference (MID) (i.e. a difference of clinical
      interest) after initial 3 months of maintenance.EuroQ5D (EQ5D) questionnaire total score and
      EQ5D visual analog scale (VAS)are validated and very simple to be administered.The
      statistical hypothesis tests described above are performed with t-test for unpaired data (or
      equivalent non-parametric, pending verification of normality of distribution by Shapiro-Wilk
      test), with alpha error = 0.05 (2-sided). It is assumed that:

        1. about 20% of randomized patients experienced a progression of disease before the time of
           evaluation of the primary endpoint, and that

        2. this eventuality was not significantly different between the two treatments. The total
           sample to be enrolled for this study will then be increased to 118 patients [(49 +49)
           +20%)]
