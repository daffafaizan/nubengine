      iron-fortified formula or mother's milk, increased the hematocrit (Hct) at 36 weeks'
      postmenstrual age (PMA).

      All infants have a decline in hemoglobin(Hgb) after birth because of increasing PaO2 and Hgb
      saturation after birth. In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight ,1500 g), the
      nadir at 1 to 3 months after birth is lower than in term infants because of (1) greater
      phlebotomy losses for blood tests, (2) shortened red blood cell survival, and (3)rapid
      growth.

      VLBW infants may be at increased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia because of (1) low
      iron stores at birth, (2) rapid depletion of iron stores owing to phlebotomy losses, and (3)
      inability to regulate iron absorption by the gastrointestinal tract.
