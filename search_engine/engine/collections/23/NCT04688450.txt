    
      This is a feasibility study for an investigational clinical decision support system ("the
      System") intended to optimize the management of blood pressure (BP) for patients during
      vasopressor infusion. Enrollment is planned of a convenience sample of 20 individual
      patient-subjects and also the 20 nurse-subjects who correspond to the primary nurses managing
      the patient-subjects. Consent will be obtained by the investigative team from the
      patient-subject (or close family member or healthcare proxy) and from the nurse-subject. The
      nurse will receive training in the intended use and important limitations of the System. The
      System will be deployed to the patient's bedside and the System will be initiated. This
      intervention will continue for a duration of between 4 to 8 hours. A Technical Observer
      ("TO") will be present to continually oversee the operation of the System, watching to ensure
      that there are no observable technical failures. The TO will also watch to see if any early
      termination conditions are met (specifically any concerns by the clinical staff or the
      patient or the patient's family; any observed technical operational problems; maximum dose
      vasopressors or hypoxia despite maximum respiratory support; or unplanned bedside response by
      the clinical care team) and also will make annotations about the exact time that specific
      clinical interventions are performed. After the intervention, the nurse-subject will be
      surveyed. Prior to enrollment of a subsequent subject, additional data analysis -- sufficient
      to identify or exclude any early stoppage condition -- will be performed on the System's
      archived electronic data and log files. Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB and
      the FDA as per FDA and institutional policy.
