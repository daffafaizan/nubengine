      diseases. However, HLA identical donor (sibling or unrelated) is available for 50-60% of
      patients and alternative donors are needed. Haploidentical donors have been used for many
      years, mostly after extensive T-cell depletion of peripheral stem cell, to avoid Graft Versus
      Host Disease (GVHD). Recently, promising data have been reported with haploidentical
      transplantation using T-replete bone marrow (BM) and high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy)
      post-transplantation. However, the conditioning regimen did not contain drugs active against
      hemopathies, enhancing the relapse risk.

      In this study, the investigators want to test the feasibility and efficacy of T-replete BM,
      infused after a RIC regimen and post-transplantation Cy, in patients with poor prognosis
      lymphoproliferative diseases.

      The RIC regimen consisted of modified regimen used in different studies conducted in Italy on
      behalf GITMO.
