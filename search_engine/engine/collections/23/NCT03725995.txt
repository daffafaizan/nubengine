      a burning sensation of the nasal mucosa. However, despite its significance, this subject has
      received little adequate research focus. The objective of the current study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of topical lidocaine in relieving pain related to INM administration.

      Design: This was a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-three uncooperative
      children, aged 4 - 11, were randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive the drug
      nasally via a pre-calibrated spray as per the following assignments:

      A: received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam, B: received lidocaine 2% prior to 0.5 mg/kg midazolam.

      C: received saline 9% (placebo), 0.5mg/kg. Children were asked to record the degree of pain
      using Wong-Baker-Faces- (WBFS) Scale.
