      positions, they are known to be at higher risk of complications (cesarean section,
      instrumental delivery, severe perineal laceration).

      Maternal posturing is used during labor to facilitate the rotation of the fetal head in
      anterior position. Asymmetrical lateral decubitus is used frequently, without having ever
      been evaluated.

      Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy of this maternal posturing, through a randomized open
      trial.

      We hypothesized that posturing women in asymmetrical lateral decubitus allows increasing
      frequency of anterior fetal position after 1 hour.
