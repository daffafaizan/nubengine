      on any other racial or gender group. Nearly 80% of AAW are overweight or obese. Reduced
      insulin sensitivity is more prevalent among AAW as compared to white women and men of both
      races. This condition puts AAW at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. The exact mechanism underlying these pathophysiological differences remains
      unknown. The investigators have found that obese AAW have decreased parasympathetic nerve
      (PNS) activity compared to whites and recent studies in animal models showed that the PNS
      confers protection against oxidative stress. In our AA cohort, PNS activity was directly
      correlated with insulin sensitivity in obese AAW even after controlling for differences in
      age, blood pressure and visceral adiposity. Equally important, the investigators also showed
      that the decrease in insulin sensitivity was associated with increased oxidative stress as
      measured by plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes. Taken together these findings lead us to
      hypothesize that the decreased PNS activity in obese AAW compared to white women has
      deleterious effects on oxidative stress and insulin sensitivity.The investigators will test
      the hypothesis that acute central acetylcholinesterase inhibition will restore PNS activity
      and reduce oxidation in AAW compared to whites.
