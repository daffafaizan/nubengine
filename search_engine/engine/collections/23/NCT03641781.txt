      athletes completed the training programs, 25 in each group. Data was also collected from
      healthy athletes for normative values. International Knee Documentation Committee subjective
      knee evaluation form was used to report the athlete's knee condition and severity of symptoms
      including pain. Biodex isokinetic system was used for isokinetic and isometric strength
      trainings and kinetic data collection. Physical performance of an athlete was assessed by
      components of fitness through two commonly used tests: Illinois agility run test and vertical
      jump test. The athletic single leg stability test was used to assess the stability of
      athletes on Biodex Balance System.
