      Voluntary sleep restriction is common, with 28% of the US adult population reports getting 6
      or fewer hours of sleep per night, and those who do are 24% more likely to have
      cardiovascular disease and have twice the risk of hypertension. Insufficient sleep may
      conceivably be one of the most common, and most preventable, cardiovascular risk factors. The
      investigators wish to determine whether 9 nights of modest sleep restriction results in
      activation of cardiovascular disease mechanisms, thus potentially increasing the risk of
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators will combine our cardiovascular studies with
      state-of-the art sleep monitoring and neurocognitive tests to provide unambiguous data on the
      physiologic effects of sleep restriction. Together, the investigators findings will help
      explain whether the reduced sleep duration in the general population may be contributing to
      the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, and suggest strategies to reduce this risk.
