    
      Single center, dose-escalation, prospective study with TH-302 single dose at 575 mg/m2 or
      placebo administered preoperatively, followed by postoperative combination therapy
      bevacizumab at 10mg/kg every 2 weeks and TH-302 at 240 - 670 mg/m2 every 2 weeks (4 week
      cycle) until disease progression. Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive pre-operative
      dose of TH-302 (surgical subjects only). Subjects not receiving surgery will receive
      combination therapy of bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and TH-302 at 240-670 mg/m2
      every 2 weeks (4 week cycle) starting from Cycle 1, Day 1 until disease progression.

      This study will use a classic dose escalation design to determine the MTD of TH-302 when used
      in combination with bevacizumab. The dose of TH-302 will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6
      subjects. The initial dose of TH-302 will be 240 mg/m2. A dose level minus 1 will be built
      into the study in the event that subjects experience excessive toxicity at Dose Level 1. Dose
      escalation will continue to 340 mg/m2 and 670 mg/m2.
