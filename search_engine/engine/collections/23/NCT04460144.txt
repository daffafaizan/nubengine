      arthritis (SA) is the most common cause of acute arthritis (around 45% of cases). Juvenile
      Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a disease characterized the presence of arthritis in one or
      more of unknown origin in children under 16 years of age, lasting more than 6 weeks. It is
      the most common pediatric rheumatological disease with a prevalence of 16 to 150 cases per
      100,000 children. Finally, in approximately 40% of children the origin of acute arthritis
      remains undetermined (ND arthritis). In this group, all the examinations performed are not in
      favor of a bacterial origin and the evolution of arthritis do not allow the diagnosis of JIA
      to be retained and no other disease is found.

      During the first few days of arthritis, differentiation between AS and non-septic arthritis
      is difficult. The available clinical and biological parameters do not allow for easy and
      rapid differentiation between AS and non-septic arthritis.

      This project aims to develop a new diagnostic technique based on molecular analysis of the
      proteome in the joint puncture fluid.
