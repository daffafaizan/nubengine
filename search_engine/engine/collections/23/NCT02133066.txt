      of Philadelphia (CHOP), quality improvement data demonstrates a failure rate of ~40-50%.
      Research has shown that bedside ultrasound can improve visualization and improve the success
      rate of spinal taps. Increasing the proportion of successful spinal taps in the emergency
      department could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary hospitalizations, additional
      interventional procedures and antibiotic use. Our objective is to determine if bedside
      ultrasound-assisted site marking will increase the proportion of first attempt successful
      spinal taps. This will be a prospective, randomized controlled study that will take place
      over the course of 18 months with the goal to recruit a sample of approximately 128 patients.
      We will recruit subjects from the CHOP Emergency Department. The patients will be randomized
      into an ultrasound-assisted group versus a non-ultrasound-assisted group. Our hypothesis is
      that bedside ultrasound-assisted site marking will increase the number of successful spinal
      taps.
