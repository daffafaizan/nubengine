      progression of the disease. It is therefore essential to look for these viruses. No
      recommendations are made for the virological follow-up of CF patients and no optimal strategy
      for the type of sampling required. In non-CF patients, the search for a viral infection is
      performed by nasopharyngeal sampling. This method of sampling is invasive and uncomfortable
      for the patient. In CF patients, sputum, non-invasive sampling, is routinely used for
      bacterial research and may be used for viral infections to avoid invasive nasopharyngeal
      sampling in patients whose management is heavy.

      After giving consent, both sputum and nasopharyngeal swab are collected for each participant.
      A record of clinical and biological data is also made at inclusion. A molecular viral search
      is performed on both samples by a multiplex technique detecting a broad spectrum of
      respiratory viruses. A bacteriological analysis is carried out on sputum. The molecular
      results will be interpreted blindly according to the main criterion of evaluation, presence
      or absence of viral infection.

      Comparison of expectoration to nasopharyngeal sampling of CF patients for respiratory
      virological diagnosis should analyse agreement of the molecular viral detection and position
      CF sputum as an optimal assay for respiratory viruses with the advantage of not being
      invasive and in all cases routinely taken for the control and bacterial follow-up.

      The promotion of sputum as an ad hoc sampling for viral research and epidemiology would
      facilitate the establishment of surveillance for viral infections in cystic fibrosis and
      thereby contribute to the CF register data.
