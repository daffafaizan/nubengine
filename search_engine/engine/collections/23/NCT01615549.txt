      principles of laparoscopy without jeopardizing patient safety. However, access to a Virtual
      reality simulator and initial instruction alone followed by free training of the surgical
      novice may not be sufficient to achieve the training goals efficiently. The aims of this
      study are to determine if proficiency based laparoscopic training on the Simbionx LAP Mentorâ„¢
      with external formative assessment using peer group derived benchmarks is superior to free
      training with self-assessment using the simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure with
      different endpoints (time to extract the gallbladder, serious complications, safe cautery and
      instrument pathways) as outcome parameters.
