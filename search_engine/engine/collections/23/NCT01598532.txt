    
      This is a four month, outpatient, single center study investigating whether transcranial,
      high intensity LED applied outside the skull can improve frontal lobe executive function and
      working memory in participants with chronic, mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), with or
      without mild posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to closed head injury.

      Participants will sign the Informed Consent Form(ICF) before Neuropsychological Screening
      test are administered. If the participant's neuropsychological screening test scores meet the
      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and the participant meets the other Inclusion/Exclusion
      criteria, then he/she will be tested again on the tests that are part of the
      Neuropsychological Outcome Measures, the week before the Transcranial LED treatments, and
      during the week after the last LED treatment and again at one and two months after the last
      LED treatment. Treatment with Transcranial LED will be for 6 weeks. Participants will be
      treated three times per week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday. A total of 18 Transcranial LED
      treatments will be administered.
