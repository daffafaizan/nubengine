      with abnormalities in neurological, neuropsychological, biofluids and neuroimaging
      assessments. The primary objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine the effects of repeated concussions on neurological, neuropsychological and
           psychosocial functioning.

        2. To determine the relationship between repeated concussions and neuroanatomical
           abnormalities in brain gray and white matter subserving cognitive and motor functions
           using structural MRI assessment.

        3. To determine the relationship between repeated concussions and changes in the
           cerebrospinal fluid composition.

        4. To (i) establish the infrastructure to conduct ongoing pathological examination of
           donated brains.

        5. In order to investigate whether the effects of repeated concussions on brain function
           and brain structure are progressive and related to the condition known as Chronic
           Traumatic Encephalopathy, prospective, longitudinal, follow-up data will be collected
