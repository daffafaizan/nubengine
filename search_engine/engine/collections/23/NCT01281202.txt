    
      The objective of this 26-28 week study is to demonstrate that the rate of cocaine dependent
      subjects treated with CPP-109 vigabatrin in addition to counseling, who completely stop use
      of cocaine in the last 2 weeks of the study's Treatment Phase (Weeks 8 and 9) will be higher
      than seen in subjects treated with placebo in addition to counseling.

      There are 3 Phases to this study:

        -  a 2-4 week Screening/Baseline Phase during which eligibility to be included in the trial
           will be tested;

        -  a 9 week Treatment Phase during which subjects will receive CPP-109 or placebo tablets
           in addition to counseling; and

        -  a 15 week Follow-up Phase, during the first 4 weeks (Weeks 10-13) of which subjects will
           continue to receive counseling.
