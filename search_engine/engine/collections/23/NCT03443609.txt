    
      METHODOLOGY:

      Phase II imaging study, prospective, multicenter non-randomized.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the added value of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET / CT in imaging investigations in terms
      of the sensitivity of detection of biologic suspected prostate cancer recurrence site
      locations on the elevation of plasma PSA, while all conventional imaging exams are negative
      or questionable ("occult recurrence")

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Evaluate the clinical impact of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET / CT in imaging exam by the
           predicted rate of change in therapeutic attitude.

        -  Evaluate the relevance of decisions made after PET / CT 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA.

        -  Determine the added value of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET / CT in terms of specificity and
           predictive value for detecting secondary locations. This determination will be at the
           "patient" level and at the "lesion" level

        -  To determine the added value of the 2nd PET / CT at 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (2h after the
           radiopharmaceutical injection) in terms of specificity and predictive value for the
           detection of secondary locations in relation to the added value of the 1st PET / CT
           acquisition at 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA. This determination will be at the "patient" level and
           at the "lesion" level.

        -  Confirm the perfect tolerance of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA.

      STUDY PROCEDURE :

      All the imaging sequences will be done in an outpatient setting. There will be no
      premedication or other treatment before and after 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET scans. PET / CT will
      be performed at participating centers on a hybrid PET camera.

      68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA will be administered to the patient by single intravenous injection
      (Y-infused with isotonic saline infusion) within 60 min of reconstitution of the
      radiopharmaceutical.

      The first TEP 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA whole body acquisition starts 60 min after the injection of
      150 MBq of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA and continues for 20-30 minutes, the second full-body
      acquisition of the same duration takes place 120 minutes after the injection is a total
      duration of 1 hour of imaging and 2:30 to 3:00 in the service.
