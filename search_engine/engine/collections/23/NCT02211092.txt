      undertake caregiving responsibilities for patients at home. While caregiving is often
      rewarding, the physical and emotional demands of caregiving have significant impacts on
      caregivers' health, including a wide range of emotional responses and high levels of fatigue.
      Caregivers' own health is important and their ability to continue to provide care also
      necessitates that their self-care needs are met. However, few supportive interventions have
      been developed specifically to address these needs. One way of doing so may be increasing
      physical activity. The physical and psychological benefits of physical activity are well
      documented. A lifestyle approach to physical activity can be tailored to the needs,
      preferences, and circumstances of the individual and is therefore a logical way to address
      some of the self-care needs of caregivers within the context of their personal caregiving
      situation. The main objectives of this pilot study are to develop an individually tailored
      home-based physical activity intervention for family caregivers of people with advanced
      cancer and assess the feasibility of a future randomized controlled trial to test the effect
      of this intervention on caregivers' positive and negative affect, fatigue, and overall
      self-rated health.
