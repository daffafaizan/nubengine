      effects of a novel bone-targeted regimen consisting of Samarium Sm-153 lexidronam combined
      with docetaxel and prednisone. This present study design permits evaluation of the clinical
      activity of combining two distinct agents that have shown benefit for the treatment of
      patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases. It enables
      assessment of potential synergistic interactions between a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent and a
      bone-targeting radioisotope agent in the setting of a bone-targeted therapy.
