      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering most closely human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) specific T cell
      lines generated by ex vivo expansion as therapy of COVID19 pneumonia in cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering most closely HLA-matched
      SARS-COV-2 specific T cell lines generated by ex vivo expansion.

      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SARS-COV-2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment may repeat every 14 days at investigators' discretion if patients
      fails to respond, the infection reoccurs, until the viral load becomes negative or until
      complete resolution of clinical and radiological signs.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 45 days,
      and 3 months after each cytotoxic T lymphocyte infusion.
