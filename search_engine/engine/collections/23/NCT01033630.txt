      ancient Chinese medicinal literature. Recent studies suggest their therapeutic effects in
      blood pressure and lipid-lowering, anti-oxidation, microcirculation-promoting, foam
      cells-modulation and have beneficial effects on atherogenic process in coronary patients.

      To evaluate the potential of D&G in primary atherosclerosis prevention in high risk
      hypertension. Patients with high risk hypertension associated with left ventricular
      hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency were randomized to receive D&G herbal
      capsules (2gm/day), or (1gm/day) or identical placebo capsules in double-blind and parallel
      fashion for 12 months on top of their anti-hypertensive treatments. Flow-mediated dilation
      (endothelium-dependent dilation, FMD) and nitroglycerin-induced dilation
      (endothelium-independent dilation, NTG) of brachial artery, and carotid intima-media
      thickness (surrogate atherosclerosis marker, IMT) were measured by high resolution B-mode
      ultrasound.
