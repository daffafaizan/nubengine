      the study and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two groups
      (computer-assisted randomization method will be used.) In the first group of patients
      classical closure method of Kerr incision (double layered continuously locked suturing) will
      be used. In the second group of patients double layered purse string closure technique will
      be used. The two groups will be compared after 6 weeks in terms of healing, operation time,
      blood loss, incision size and incisional scar defect( if present). A physician who does not
      know the method of closure will evaluate incision size by transabdominal and/or transvaginal
      ultrasound. The length of the incision and myometrial thickness in Kerr incisional line will
      be measured and recorded in longitudinal and transverse axis separately. If any incisional
      scar defect is determined it will be measured and recorded also.
