    
      COPD is a long term lung condition where patients suffer recurrent symptom flare-ups, called
      'exacerbations'. Patients who have lots of exacerbations have a worse quality of life, poorer
      ability to breath, and may die earlier than those who don't. Previous research by our group
      has shown that patients who have an exacerbation and have not completely recovered two weeks
      after the start of treatment are more likely to suffer another one early than those who
      completely recover.

      This study aims to test whether we can prevent this early re-exacerbation by giving an extra
      course of antibiotics, compared to a placebo. Patients who experience an exacerbation of COPD
      and are treated with antibiotics will, two weeks after the start of their treatment, be
      invited to attend a screening visit. Patients will be eligible for the study if they have not
      fully recovered at this visit (i.e. if they either still have symptoms or if blood tests show
      there is still inflammation present) and fulfil other diagnostic measures for COPD. Patients
      will be allocated to the treatment groups at random, and if eligible will be treated with a
      further 1 week of ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily or a placebo.

      Patients will then be followed up in the study for a further 3 months, and the primary study
      outcome will be the time to the next exacerbation.
