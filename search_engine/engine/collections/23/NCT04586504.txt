      emergency departments has been described. However, the doses of intranasal midazolam used
      have varied greatly, with no identified optimal dose. Doses most commonly described in
      literature reviews, research studies, and clinical guidelines range from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg.
      There is only one study, retrospective, that compares doses and suggests that clinical
      efficacy is improved with higher doses, without any clear difference in safety. There is a
      need for a rigorously-conducted trial to determine the dose of intranasal midazolam that
      optimizes the adequacy of sedation state without leading to adverse events or compromising
      emergency department-centric outcomes such as time to onset of sedation and time to recovery.
      To fill this important and persistent gap in knowledge, the investigator will conduct a
      dose-finding study using an adaptive trial design to compare intranasal midazolam doses of
      0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/kg in children undergoing laceration repairs, one of the most
      common types of minor trauma treated in emergency departments.
