      Brazil. The study population consisted of 30 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years with
      superficial "partial-thickness" burns admitted less than 72 hours from the thermal injury. In
      the test group, the tilapia skin was applied. In the control group, a thin layer of silver
      sulfadiazine cream 1% was applied.
