    
      This study is performed by monitoring the cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared
      spectroscopy from general anesthesia induction to 10 min after releasing the carotid artery
      clipping.

      Study group: Sevoflurane - remifentanil anesthesia group (S) Propofol - remifentanil
      anesthesia group (R)

      Monitoring: near-infrared spectroscopy (SOMA sensor) BIS, HR, arterial blood pressure, SpO2,
      body temperature
