      self-management intervention for PwMS delivered via web-based video conferencing. Data
      derived from interviews will be used to guide the adaptation of Stuifbergen's 8-week Memory,
      Attention, and Problem-Solving Skills in MS (MAPSS-MS) intervention to be delivered via
      web-based video conferencing. The adapted MAPSS-MS intervention will be feasibility tested in
      small groups of PwMS. Outcome variables include: (1) neurocognitive function assessed using
      the NIH Toolbox®, a comprehensive set of psychometrically sound neuro-behavioral measures
      that quickly assesses cognitive functions using an iPad, (2) objective PA and sleep using
      Actigraph™ accelerometers, (3) self-reported sleep, depression, and fatigue using the
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and (4) MS specific
      self-management using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Management Scale (MSSM). Community-residing
      PwMS, age 21 to 70, will be recruited from Central Texas to participate in Phase 1 interviews
      (n=5) and Phase 2 pilot testing (n=20) of the adapted version of the 8-week MAPSS-MS
      cognitive self-management intervention emphasizing PA delivered via web-based video
      conferencing. In Phase 2 pilot testing (n=20), an intervention group (n=10) will be compared
      to an "enhanced usual care" control group (n=10).
