      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel when
           administered with carboplatin and capecitabine as neoadjuvant induction therapy in
           patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the clinical and pathological response in these patients treated with
           neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine
           followed by chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes
           on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 2 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Approximately 7 days after completion of induction therapy, patients proceed to
      chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-42 and
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on days 1-40.

        -  Surgery: Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
           surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
