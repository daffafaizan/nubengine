      prognostic factors, including conventional cardiovascular risk factors and measure
      ABI,SUA,asymptomatic target organ damage, for mortality and cardiovascular diseases. All
      population were separated into ABI ≤0.4，0.4 <ABI ≤0.9，and 0.9 <ABI≤1.4 three groups according
      to the ABI. ABI ≤0.9 was selected as cut point for the definition of PAD. Factors related to
      CVD and all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up was
      observed by multivariate Cox regression analysis and log rank test. Potential confounding
      variables with P <0.10 were adjusted for multivariate analysis.
