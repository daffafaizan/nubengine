    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial is designed to look at safety and
      efficacy of cenobamate adjunctive therapy as compared to placebo on PGTC seizures in subject
      with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Subjects will be randomized to receive either
      cenobamate or placebo on a 1:1 basis. The study will have three periods, pre-randomization
      period where a baseline seizure frequency is established, treatment period and follow up
      period. The treatment period consists of a 10 week titration phase where subjects are
      titrated slowly until they reach the target dose and a maintenance phase. During the
      titration phase, subjects will receive 12.5 mg study drug, followed by 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg,
      and 150 mg study drug every two weeks. During the maintenance phase, subjects will receive
      the target dose of 200 mg study drug. Subjects will take their once daily dose of study drug
      at approximately the same in the morning with or without food. If tolerability issues arise,
      subjects can switch to evening dosing. There is also an option to down-titrate to 150 mg
      study drug, one time only. If tolerability issues continue, subjects may be discontinued.
      Upon completion of the maintenance phase, eligible subjects will have an opportunity to
      enroll in an open-label safety study. Subjects who discontinue early or do not wish to
      participate in this additional study will complete the three week follow up period. Subjects
      may receive a one week down titration to 100 mg and return for a follow up visit 2 weeks
      later.

      Throughout the study, subjects will keep a diary containing the type and frequency of
      seizures. This will be the primary efficacy measure.
