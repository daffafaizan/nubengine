    
      In the emergency room a nasopharyngeal swab sample will be collected from subjects with a
      suspected LRTI for the FilmArray respiratory panel assay plus a blood sample for the PCT
      assay if the PCT measurement has not been already prescribed.

      The FilmArray® Respiratory Panel 2 plus (RP2plus) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended
      for use with FilmArray® 2.0 or FilmArray® Torch systems for the simultaneous qualitative
      detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in
      nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract
      infections.

      Both results will be reported in real-time to the treating physicians with the recommendation
      to withhold or withdraw antibiotics if:

        1. PCT<0.10 µg/L with either a positive (with a viral respiratory pathogen) or negative
           FilmArray assay or

        2. PCT<0.25 µg/L and FilmArray positive with a viral respiratory pathogen. For the control
           arm, patients will benefit from the usual care of patients with suspected LRTI at the
           discretion of the attending physician. Care may entail a CRP and/or a PCT measurement,
           but no nasopharyngeal swab sampling.
