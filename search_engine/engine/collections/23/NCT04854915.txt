      Hey Children's Hospital (LOOP@ Alder Hey). 40 participants will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups (Control n=20, Intervention n=20). Patients in the control
      group will continue to follow the LOOP@ Alder Hey programme but physical activity sessions
      will be monitored during the 12-week intervention using a heart rate monitor. Importantly,
      the heart rate monitor will not provide any feedback to the patient. The intervention group
      will be provided with exercise counselling and to support this they will also be provide with
      a wristwatch that can monitor everyday activity and their heart rate, a smartphone app and
      access to a website. The intervention group will also participate in 5 consultations with an
      exercise specialist to plan their exercise programme and be updated on their progress towards
      physical activity targets. Weekly text message updates will also provide feedback to the
      intervention group with participants able to respond to these updates. Before and after the
      3-month supported interventions, volunteers will participate in testing to assess changes in
      physical activity, blood pressure, glycaemia control, body composition and health related
      quality of life. Interviews with participants, parents and the LOOP Clinic multidisciplinary
      team will form the basis for a review of the pilot randomised control trial. Participants
      will also fill out 6 validated questionnaires about motivations, the impact of their
      condition on daily life and their typical exercise levels.
