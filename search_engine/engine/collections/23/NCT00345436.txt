      type 2 diabetes. This phenomenon may be related with the fact that American adolescents are
      now becoming less physically active in early puberty, explaining the largely pubertal and
      post-pubertal onset of type 2 diabetes in adolescence. Although regular physical activity has
      been suggested to attenuate obesity and prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk children and
      adolescents, the magnitude of exercise training-induced improvement in the risk factors for
      type 2 diabetes has been only recently studied in adults and studied very little in pediatric
      populations. It is clear that exercise, diet, and genetics all contribute to the development
      of type 2 diabetes in children. However, the few studies that have been done to dissect the
      relative contributions of these three risk factors have generally used only lipid profiles as
      the end point. There have been a number of recent advances in our understanding of the
      molecular basis of type 2 diabetes, particularly, with regards to insulin regulatory pathways
      modulated by exercise within muscle tissue.
