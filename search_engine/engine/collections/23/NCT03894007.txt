      anti-HER2 based systemic therapy, can be increased by addition of atezolizumab.

      Secondary aims are to assess safety and tolerability of this treatment combination, and to
      identify therapy predictive factors for the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab plus-minus atezolizumab with a backbone of chemotherapy, using modern molecular
      biological investigational procedures with analyses by repeated biopsies from an
      intra-patient longitudinal study design.
