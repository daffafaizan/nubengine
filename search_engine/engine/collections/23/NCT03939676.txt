      aspects, of anhedonia. The investigators are primarily interested in motivation, reward
      valuation, and reward learning towards addressing the measurement of each of these respective
      subdomains, eligible participants will complete validated gold standard measures (i.e. the
      Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) (reward valuation), Probabilistic Reward Task
      (PRT) (reward learning), and the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task (reward anticipation)).

      Twenty adults with overweight/obesity will complete all tasks at a single visit with two of
      the tasks being completed prior to MRI and one of the tasks (i.e. EEfRT) will be completed
      during MRI acquisition.

      The primary aim of this pilot study is to determine whether associations exist between
      obesity and decreased performance on the respective motivation/reward paradigms. In addition,
      associations between performance on reward tasks and functional connectivity, as measured by
      MRI and DTI, a secondary objective is to ascertain whether associations exist between
      performance on the motivation reward tasks and gold standard measures of food intake (i.e.
      food diary) and energy expenditure (i.e. calorimetry).
