      hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
      bacterial endocarditis or other chronic bacterial infections . Idiopathic Type I MPGN is
      rare. Biopsy samples usually stain for C3 and properdin. However, immunoglobulin G is also
      present in most cases, especially if the biopsy is performed early in the course of the
      disease suggesting antibody production as a possible therapeutic target.

      Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human immunoglobulin g1 kappa monoclonal antibody targeting
      the cluster of differentiation 20 antigen found on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes, but not on
      hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells or the cells of other normal
      tissues. In the United States it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997
      for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was later approved for rheumatoid arthritis. Intravenous
      administration of rituximab results in rapid, selective, prolonged B cell depletion.

      Anecdotal reports have demonstrated the efficacy of rituximab in treating MPGN secondary to
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Rituximab has also been shown to be effective in patients with
      MPGN related to a monoclonal gammopathy.

      In an open label trial with rituximab, six patients with MPGN type I were treated with
      rituximab 1000 mg on days 1 and 15 and followed for 1 year. Proteinuria fell in all patients,
      at all time points, after rituximab administration. Renal function did not change.
