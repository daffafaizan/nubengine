      program (CBM) to treat attention and interpretive biases in patients with Intermittent
      Explosive Disorder, a disorder characterized by habitual engagement in aggressive behavior.
      Efficacy of the CBM program will be assessed via a small randomized controlled trial
      comparing CBM to a computerized control condition. This training program would consist of a
      four-week regimen of twice-weekly 30-minute sessions (8 sessions total) during which
      individuals would learn to: (a) focus attention away from threatening words toward neutral
      words [attention bias], and (b) to disambiguate ambiguous interpersonal scenarios using more
      benign, rather than threatening, interpretations [interpretive bias]. Participants will be
      asked to complete behavioral measures of attention bias and interpretive bias, as well as
      self-report measures of anger / aggression, interpretive bias, emotion regulation and life
      satisfaction at baseline (pre-training), post-training, and 1-month follow-up.
