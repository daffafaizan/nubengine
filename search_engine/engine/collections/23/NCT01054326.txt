      were offered to participate in the study. After surgery they were randomized to either
      Supervised Physical therapy with early activation of the rotator cuff (PT-group) or to home
      exercises (H-group). Patients in the PT group met the physical therapist twice a week for
      exercises and in between these visits they did their exercises at home daily. The H-group did
      home exercises daily. Shoulder function and pain(primary outcomes)and health related quality
      of life, returning to work(secondary outcomes)were assessed before surgery, one week
      after(baseline), 1,2,3 and 6 months after surgery by an independent physical therapist.
