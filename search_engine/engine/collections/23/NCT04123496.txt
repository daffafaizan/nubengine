      magnetic field on-and-off repeatedly over your head, which passes directly through your hair,
      scalp, and skull and onto your brain, and can temporarily increase brain activity under the
      magnetic field. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved
      treatment for depression, and is used commonly to treat people for their depression. The rTMS
      treatment regime used in this study is different from the FDA approved treatment because you
      will receive up to ten treatments per day over five days instead of the FDA approved rTMS
      treatment regime of 25 treatments over 25 days. This sort of accelerated or high dose
      protocol has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of depression. We are
      hoping to find out if this treatment can be used as a treatment for improving cognitive
      function and stress resilience.
