      on HIV+ women, HIV+ participants will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio, with a total of 210 HIV+
      women and 420 HIV- women. We will recruit in the postpartum ward of Bwaila Maternity Hospital
      in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants will complete a baseline survey about demographics,
      reproductive health history, and family planning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. At 3,
      6, and 12 months postpartum, we will complete follow-up phone calls to determine what family
      planning methods they are using and if they encountered any barriers to receiving LARC if
      they had been interested in using them.
