      I. Demonstrate that differentiation therapy with DNMT1 depleting but non-DNA damaging doses
      of decitabine is efficacious and can be administered weekly for > = 12 months. SECONDARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess safety of the regimen.

      II. Retrospectively compare study and standard regimen clinical responses. III. Assess the
      ability of a pharmacodynamic assay that measures DNMT1 depletion in peripheral blood white
      blood cells to predict clinical responses to decitabine.

      IV. Assess PCR for aberrant methylation signature as an early marker of relapse. V. Identify
      biologic features of MDS that correlate with response to decitabine, thereby facilitating
      future patient selection.

      VI. In cases of relapse or resistance, assess the role of the enzyme CDA in altering
      decitabine metabolism and preventing DNMT1 depletion.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive decitabine subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly for 4 weeks or
      thrice weekly until achieving bone marrow blasts < 5%.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients then receive decitabine SC twice weekly for up to 52 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed periodically.
