      small amount of positive outcomes other than surgery.

      However, as with other spinal and nerve disorders, non-surgical treatments are getting more
      attention in terms of patient safety, and because they provide patients with more choice in
      treatment than in terms of surgical treatment, they can provide closer approach to
      patient-centered care.

      Physical therapy and medication are well known for the currently known non-surgical and
      conservative treatments, but research reported on the treatment of cervical myelopathy by
      using Korean medicine treatment so far has its weak level. Therefore, it is expected that
      this study will demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment of cervical myelopathy in Korean
      medicine treatment and will further pave the way for non-surgical treatment of spinal
      myelopathy.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      Korean medicine treatment in spinal myelopathy. Retrospective data will be extracted using
      electronic medical records and computerized data of hospitalized patients. Based on this,
      investigators will conduct research in the form of prospective survey and analyze the causal
      relationship and factors using the two data.

      The hospital's medical records will be used to analyze the patient's condition during the
      hospitalization period and to determine the situation after the end of treatment through
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be developed after consultation with experts from
      musculoskeletal system and related societies, and will be used for the questionnaire.
