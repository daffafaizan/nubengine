        -  Determine the 18-month survival rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
           treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the objective rate of response of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine post-transplant immunological reactions and recuperation of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antitumoral activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups based on availability of a compatible family member for stem cell
      transplantation.

        -  Group I: Patients with a compatible family donor receive conditioning chemotherapy
           comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV once
           daily on days -5 to -1. Patients undergo filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic stem
           cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive immunosuppression therapy with
           cyclosporine beginning on day -2. Patients who have persistent or progressive disease,
           mixed chimerism, and no evidence of grade 2 or greater graft-vs-host disease, and have
           been off immunosuppression therapy for 1-2 weeks receive donor lymphocyte infusion on
           days 7 and 21.

        -  Group II: Patients without a compatible family donor receive treatment (immunotherapy,
           vaccination therapy, or chemotherapy) at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 170 patients (60 patients for group I and 110 patients for
      group II) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
