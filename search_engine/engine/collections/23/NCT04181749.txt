      Attenuation Index (FAI) measurements to detect changes in coronary artery inflammation
      following treatment with atorvastatin and aspirin . CT scan images are used to evaluate the
      presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the wall of the coronary arteries. The new CCTA
      technique, FAI, detects and quantifies coronary artery inflammation by analysis of the
      characteristics of the adipose tissue (fat) around the wall of the artery - the peri-vascular
      adipose tissue (PVAT) This is a pilot study, involving patients undergoing a clinically
      indicated CCTA as part of their routine clinical care who are shown (on their scans) to have
      mild coronary artery plaques (<50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI value (>70.1 HU).
      Patients will have 6 visits (one of which screening) with hospital attendance on 3 occasions
      for blood tests and drug supply. The pilot study will provide the rationale for power
      calculations from which further studies can be developed to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of FAI.
