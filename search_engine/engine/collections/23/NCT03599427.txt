    
      2X30 patients which are planned for elective knee arthroscopy are randomised: Lidocaine-group
      and Placebo-group.

      All patients receive standardised multimodal intravenous analgesia. After standardised
      induction of anesthesia, patient positioning and administration of basic analgetics
      paracetamol & diclofenac, the patient is administered either linisol 2% (1.5 mg/kg) or
      placebo NaCl 0.9% (0.075 ml/kg = equivalent volume). At the end of the procedure, linisol or
      placebo is readministered at the same dose. The surgeon and anesthesiologist are blinded for
      patient allocation.

      Postoperative analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting (PONV), general comfort and pain
      scores are recorded. Visual Analogue scores (VAS) for knee pain are assessed before surgery,
      1-15 minutes after awakening, at the moment of discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU) and at hospital discharge.
