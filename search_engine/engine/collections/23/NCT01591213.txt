      International Outreach Program to deliver the St. Jude Cancer Education for Children
      curriculum to 4th grade students over the course of 1 week. Pre and post survey data will be
      collected from students to measure knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, perceptions of
      vulnerability, intentions, and behaviors associated with cancer and healthy living. Rates of
      compliance and feedback about the curriculum will be collected from teachers via curriculum
      checklist, survey, and interviews.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine if it is feasible for classroom teachers to implement the St. Jude Cancer
           Education for Children Program.

      Secondary/Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To determine factors that may contribute to the program's feasibility such as school and
           teacher characteristics.

        -  To measure the impact of the intervention on student knowledge, beliefs, attitudes,
           perceptions of vulnerability, intentions, and self-reported health behaviors.
