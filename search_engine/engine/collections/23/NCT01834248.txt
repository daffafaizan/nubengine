    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESOI (CDX-1401) fusion protein (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1
      fusion protein CDX-1401) given in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-1
      specific antibody, and T-cell clones following standard treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
      (decitabine) in conjunction with immune sensitization with Anti-DEC 205-NY-ESO-I fusion
      protein (CDX-1401).

      II. To determine the impact of decitabine treatment on peripheral blood cells from patients
      treated in this manner on NY-ESO-1 target gene expression, NY-ESO protein expression,
      NY-ESO-1 promoter methylation, and global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological
      improvement) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients treated with the combination in order to provide descriptive characteristics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 subcutaneously (SC) and
      intradermally (ID) and poly-ICLC subcutaneously (SC) on days -14 and 15 of course 1 and on
      day 15 for courses 2-4. Patients also receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.
