      standard-of-care procedure to diagnose glaucoma is visual field testing with disc
      photography. Visual field testing is subjective both in the patient's feedback and the
      physician's interpretation of this feedback, and disc photography requires a physician's
      subjective interpretation. As a result, it is estimated that current methods can diagnose
      glaucoma only after 40% of the nerve fiber layer (NFL) has been lost. Since glaucoma leads to
      significant changes in both NFL thickness and NFL optical birefringence, non-invasive imaging
      of these properties could potentially enable diagnosis of glaucoma prior to changes in
      vision. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is routinely used in retinal imaging, and its
      ability to detect changes in NFL health is being actively studied. To detect NFL optical
      birefringence, a specialized variation of OCT termed polarization sensitive OCT (PS-OCT) is
      required. Because of high noise in PS-OCT images, prior studies have been unable to detect
      NFL changes in birefringence.

      We have recently developed new methods for performing highly sensitive polarization-sensitive
      OCT. These changes are algorithmic in nature, and use the same optical wavelengths and powers
      as clinically deployed OCT retinal imaging instruments. In benchtop studies, these
      algorithmic changes improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PS-OCT images. We propose to
      conduct a pilot study in normal, healthy subjects to evaluate if these changes improve the
      SNR of NFL birefringence images.
