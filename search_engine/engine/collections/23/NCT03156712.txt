      three iron-treatments : ferrous sulfate (10mg), AspironTM (10mg), and AspironTM (20mg). Each
      iron treatment was given with a test meal consisting of cabbage, green peas, green beans, soy
      sauce, peanut oil, 40 g baby carrots, steamed rice, and orange juice. Each subject consumed a
      meal with one of the three iron supplements in a random order and all participants consumed
      the three supplements 2 weeks in between each treatment. Prior to consuming the test meal
      with iron supplement for each treatment, blood was collected for baseline serum iron
      measuremt. Following consumption of the meal with iron, subsequent blood draws were taken
      every 30 minutes over the time period of 4 hours to assess the incease in serum iron.
      Ferritin, hepcidin, iron , and c-reactive protein concentrations were measured in the serum
      at baselime. After two weeks other treatments were administered to each participant. The
      serum iron response curves for each treatment were constructed and the area under the curve
      (AUC) was calculated with the change of serum iron from baseline.
