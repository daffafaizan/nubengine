      investigate the effect of pre- and post-neuroimaging, intraoperative monitoring, and clinical
      outcome during the surgical management of brainstem lesions in our neurosurgical center. The
      data of demographics, neuroimaging, IONM and patients' outcomes will be acquired based on the
      medical records and follow-up visits. All data is stored in the personal file of the clinical
      information system for each patient. The expected duration of each subject's participation is
      confined to the surgery itself and the routine visits during the follow-up. The overall study
      duration is expected to collect all the brainstem surgery in next five years.
