    
      Ten patients with extensive scalp alopecia areata (>95% hair loss)of less than 2 years
      duration will be invited to participate in this study. For six months each person will be
      asked to apply Aldara Cream 5% daily to the right half of the scalp. No drug will be applied
      to the left side. Skin biopsies will be taken of the right scalp before and at the completion
      of the therapy.
