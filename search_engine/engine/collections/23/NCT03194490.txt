      divided into two groups (combined intervention group and standard intervention group). The
      following questionnaires were completed in the following order: Neck Disability Index (NDI),
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC). Next, Cervical
      Range of Motion (ROM) and Pain threshold were measured for both groups. The combined
      intervention group received the cervical passive mobilization, stretching, and home program
      (Stretching and ROM exercise). The standard intervention group received cervical mobilization
      and home program (ROM exercises).
