      measure of flow-mediated dilation (reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tone index). The
      pulmonary function will be assessed by the measures of the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in
      one second), the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the expiratory flow between 25% and 75%
      (FEF25-75%). The relationship between these parameters of the pulmonary function and the
      peripheral endothelial function will be analyzed. In addition, a relationship between
      peripheral endothelial function and the severity of COPD (classification according to GOLD
      (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2010 and GOLD 2011 and the COPD
      assessment test, the cardiovascular risk factors (SCORE INdex) and the smoker status will be
      also assessed.
