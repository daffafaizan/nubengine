      to be added to the 900 subjects which are collected as part of the GENFIEV project which has
      been designed as a 6-yr follow-up study to ascertain the rate of conversion to type 2
      diabetes in the Italian population. In particular the goal of the present research program
      will be to determine in a sample of the Italian population at greater risk for type 2
      diabetes than the general population:

        -  the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the disorders of impaired glucose
           regulation (IGR). In particular we will evaluate insulin action and insulin secretion as
           a function of the degree of glucose tolerance by analyzing these parameters in normal
           subjects as well as in IFG/NGT, NFG/IGT, and IFG/IGT individuals;

        -  the biochemical markers associated with the disorders of impaired glucose regulation
           (IGR). In particular we will evaluate several biochemical parameters (lipid profile,
           coagulative profile, microlbuminuria, free-fatty acids, PAI-1, fibrinogen, creatinine,
           uric acid, HbA1c);

        -  the cardiovascular risk profile associated with the disorders of impaired glucose
           regulation (IGR). In particular, the relevant biochemical parameters will be integrated
           with measurements of arterial blood pressure as well as ECG recording;

        -  the genetic markers associated with the disorders of impaired glucose regulation (IGR).
           In particular subjects will be screened for HHEX, IGF2,BP2 CDKAL1,TCF2L7, CDKN2A/B,WFS1;

        -  the impact of environmental factors on the disorders of impaired glucose regulation
           (IGR).

      Finally, we will endeavour to assess the cellular pathways that may be affected by metabolic
      alterations typically occurring in concomitance with the disorders of impaired glucose
      regulation (IGR).
