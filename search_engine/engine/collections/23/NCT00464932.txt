      affects as many as 8% of individuals in industrialized nations. There is an increase in the
      number of woman and men suffering from COPD. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are
      common sequelae of chronic airflow obstruction, but the precise mechanisms of increased
      vascular resistance are unclear. Potential causes of pulmo-nary hypertension in COPD include
      emphysematous destruction of the capillary bed, remodeling of pulmonary vessels and hypoxic
      pulmonary vasoconstriction. This proposal, a new immunomodulatory therapy of COPD with
      vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was evaluated. Based on preliminary unpublished clinical
      and experimental results, the course of disease under VIP treatment and the molecular
      mechanisms involved were assessed.

      34 patients with severe COPD were treated either with VIP inhalation in addition to
      conventional therapy or inhalation of placebo plus conventional therapy for a period of 3
      months. The trial was conducted as a double blind, comparative study with two parallel
      groups.

      In the absence of acute infection or acute worsening of the disease due to other conditions,
      2 transbronchial biopsies were collected before treatment, and after 3 months of treatÂ¬ment
      for assessment of the regulation of a) the immune response, b) the extracellular matrix and
      c) the epithelial growth. This assessment will be performed in fully equipped and experienced
      laboratories at the University of Vienna.
