      Canada) under the direction of the same principal investigator. Eighty (80) subjects were
      enrolled in the study. Subjects were asked to report to the clinic for four visits (D0, D28,
      D56, D87). The LHA formulation was applied twice a day (morning and evening) and benzoyl
      peroxide was applied daily (evening) on a clean face for a total of 12 weeks.

      Efficacy was evaluated at day 28, 56 and 87. The number of papules, pustules, opened and
      closed comedones were counted at each visit by a blinded assessor. The overall efficacy was
      evaluated with a 4-point scale (no improvement, moderate, good and excellent) by the subject
      and the blinded assessor. Clinical examination included evaluation of sensitivity of the skin
      (presence of erythema and desquamation) by the investigator and of pruritus, tingling and
      burning sensation by subjects on a 4-point scale. Finally, the subject and the skin assessor
      both evaluated overall tolerance on a 4-point scale.
