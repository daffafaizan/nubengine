    
      This is an observational, cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the frequency, magnitude
      and quality of the anti-Tat antibody response in both antiretroviral (ARV)-treated and
      treatment-na√Øve HIV-infected South African adults, and at exploring the correlation between
      the presence of anti-Tat antibody response and the immunological status of participants as
      well as with the presence of co-infections such as HBV, syphilis and HPV (the latter only for
      female participants).

      The study has involved 531 participants and provided important information for the planning,
      design and conduction of future therapeutic clinical trials with the Tat-based HIV vaccine in
      South African individuals.

      This study is conducted in the frame of the Government-to-Government cooperation program N.
      AID 8421, funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs-Directorate General for
      Development Cooperation (MAE-DGCS) and jointly implemented by the Italian Istituto Superiore
      di Sanita' (ISS) and the South African Department of Health in collaboration with the South
      African AIDS Vaccine Initiative of the Medical Research Council (MRC-SAAVI)
