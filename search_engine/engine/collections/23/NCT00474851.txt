      adolescence. Untreated endometriosis may lead to chronic pain and infertility. As recognition
      of the need for prompt therapy increases, so does the length of time patients will be exposed
      to treatments. As a result, there exists a pressing need to evaluate adjunctive measures that
      may limit the associated negative health consequences of treatment.

      A gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is one medication utilized for patients who
      have failed other treatments. While GnRH-agonists are effective in relieving symptoms, their
      long-term use is problematic. GnRH agonists induce a low-estrogen state, causing deleterious
      effects on bone mineralization. These negative consequences are especially important for our
      pediatric patients. Adolescence is the critical period in a woman's life for bone acquisition
      and attainment of peak bone mass. Anything that interferes with this process puts patients at
      risk for lifelong low bone density and future fracture.

      "Add-back" therapy appears to be a promising adjunct to treatment for prevention of this bone
      loss. Daily therapy with low-doses of hormones preserves bone density in adult patients,
      without altering the efficacy of the GnRH-agonist. However, no data exist on the effect of
      add-back therapy in adolescents.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two add-back regimens,
      norethindrone acetate + placebo or norethindrone acetate + conjugated estrogens, for the
      preservation of skeletal health and quality of life in adolescents with endometriosis treated
      with a GnRH-agonist.
