      (SSRIs) in decreasing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms; to date the SSRIs are
      the only medication class with demonstrated efficacy in treating all three PTSD symptom
      clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal). No studies have evaluated the impact
      of SSRIs on PTSD symptoms in children or adolescents. Trauma-focused CBT has been shown in
      several studies to be efficacious in decreasing PTSD symptoms in sexually abused children and
      adolescents. Many children and youth with PTSD are currently prescribed SSRIs and other
      medications. This study will evaluate whether adding the SSRI sertraline provides additional
      benefits over TF-CBT treatment for sexually abused children and adolescents with PTSD. If
      adequate numbers of children with comorbid PTSD and depressive and/or anxiety disorders are
      included, it may also be possible to evaluate whether any benefit of adding sertraline is
      restricted to those children with comorbid disorders.
