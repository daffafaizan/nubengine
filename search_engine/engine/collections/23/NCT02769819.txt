      laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway
      characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined.
      Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental
      distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult
      situations with the direct laryngoscope. When direct laryngoscopy is difficult, early
      conversion to an alternative technique reduces the risk of airway compromise and associated
      morbidity.

      Many alternative intubation devices are now available, and part of the anesthesiologist's
      task is to select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features.
      Despite its use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria
      for successful airway management with the flexible fiberscope have not been developed.

      The purpose of this study is to identify patient morphometric or morphological
      characteristics, if any, that could predict difficult intubation when using the flexible
      fiberscope for perioperative tracheal intubation in an elective surgical population.
