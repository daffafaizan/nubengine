      Rehabilitation outpatient clinic in Suez Canal University Hospital, Ismailia, EGYPT and
      diagnosed with CTS according to clinical examination and to the American Association of
      Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) practice recommendations for CTS.

      Study subjects will be divided into two groups:

      Group (1): (active group) will include 42 patients with CTS and will receive anodal tDCS of
      M1 for 20 minutes, at 2 mA for 5 sessions and less than 72 hrs. may be allowed between
      experimental sessions for each participant to avoid any interference.

      Group (2): (sham group) will include 42 patients with CTS and will receive sham tDCS M1 (the
      set will be turned off after 30 seconds) for 20 minutes, at 2 mA for 5 sessions.

      The study sample will be collected from all patients with CTS attending to the Physical
      medicine, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic in Suez Canal University Hospital
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria, will be eligible to join the study (either referred for
      electrophysiological study or presented to the clinic for primary assessment). To make sure
      that no bias should enter the assessment of the results, neither the patient nor the
      clinicians will be aware whether active tDCS will be applicated to a particular case. To
      ensure this result, two symbols (Square and Triangle) will be applicated to the physiotherapy
      sheet and only the physiotherapist knew the key for each symbol. The triangle may represent
      the cases of CTS for active tDCS and the square may represent the sham group or vice versa.
      At the end of the study the two groups will be revealed in order to analyze the results
      according to proper statistical measures.
