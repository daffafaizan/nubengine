      Rest pulse-oxymetry values are used in the clinical setting to make therapeutic decisions
      regarding the need of supplemental oxygen. The primary goal of this study is to measure the
      change of pulse-oxymetry values during an experimental protocol of 10 deep breaths during one
      minute in patients with chronic hypoxemia. 45 patients will be studied in this first phase.
      In a second phase, secondary goals will be to measure Vd/Vt vent, noninvasive cardiac output
      and CT densitometry during the same deep breaths protocol in a subset of 13 patients with the
      grater increase observed in the first phase of study.
