      Primary

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy with autologous
           tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) following cyclophosphamide conditioning and
           post-infusion aldesleukin (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Assess the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred lymphocytes.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred autologous TIL following
           cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2 and autologous
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) IV on day 0. Beginning 6 hours after TIL infusion,
      patients receive high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) IV three times daily on days 0-5 (for up to 14
      doses) OR low-dose IL-2 subcutaneously twice daily on days 0-14 (for up to 28 doses).
      Patients may then receive two additional courses of TILs and low-dose IL-2 (with or without
      cyclophosphamide), if indicated.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
