      together and our idea for the mobile service robot will discussed. A demonstration of the
      telepresence feature of the robots and the NAO robot greeting and helping them with simple
      exercises will follow (e.g., pick up and object that is handy and lift their hands over their
      heads). The approximately 30-minute demonstration part of the study will start with an
      introduction and explanation about the project and a short speech about the Rehabilitation
      and Robotics Lab. After the demonstration the oral consent will be read and surveys will be
      handed out to those study participants who agree to complete them; if necessary, the research
      team will assist the study participant with the survey. Surveys will then be collected, and
      the group will be thanked by the research team.
