    
      Hypothesis:

      Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients who experience music listening will report
      decreased anxiety scores and improved pain control scores compared with patients listening to
      relaxation and breathing.

      Null Hypothesis:

      There will be no difference in reported anxiety scores and pain control scores between
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients listening to music versus listening to relaxation
      and breathing instructions.

      Music listening participants who meet inclusion criteria will be consented in the PreOp Unit
      and asked to complete the Spielberg State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire.
      Patient vital signs will be taken and patient will be invited to listen to music study iPod
      for 15 minutes prior to changing into a hospital gown.

      Intervention:

      The music listening group will receive the standard care and a 15 minute patient-preferred
      music listening selection intervention in the Prep Room and unlimited music listening
      selection intervention in the PACU once cognitively ready until discharge criteria met. The
      relaxation breathing group will receive the relaxation and breathing instructions over soft
      monotone music in the PACU once cognitively ready until discharge criteria met.

      Results:

      The experimental music listening group will reveal statistically significant decrease
      postanesthesia anxiety and pain, while lowering the blood pressure, heart rate and amount of
      opioids after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy surgery compared to the control group.

      Conclusion:

      The findings of the music listening intervention will provide further evidence to support the
      practice of music listening to decrease postanesthesia anxiety and pain, while lowering the
      blood pressure, heart rate and amount of opioids after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
      surgery.
