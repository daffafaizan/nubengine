      present, modified BUCY is the standard conditioning regimen for AML undergoing allo-HSCT in
      our institute. However, relapse occured in as high as 30-50% high risk AML patients after
      allo-HSCT. Thus, the best conditioning regimen for this subgroup remains to be optimized. Low
      dose decitabine in combination with chemotherapy have been shown to improve comple remission
      rate of high risk AML patients. To reduce the relapse rate after allo-HSCT, low dose
      decitabine is added in the modified BUCY regimen. In this study, the safety and efficacy of
      low dose decitabine + modified BUCY vs modified BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in
      high risk undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
