      infertility evaluation. At the time of scheduling, the patient will be randomized to either
      the cervical vacuum cup, balloon catheter (H/S catheter set, UA Medical, Biotech America), or
      the acorn-tipped cannula using stratified blocked randomization. 100 subjects will be
      randomized to one of the three cannulas. Patients will be stratified into 4 groups
      representative of the four reproductive endocrinologists in order to overcome any potential
      interoperator bias.

      Four reproductive endocrinologists will perform the HSG procedures in a standardized fashion.
      Fluoroscopy will ensure proper location of the cannula and check for uterine filling of
      contrast. Digital images will document tubal filling and spilling of contrast. The patient
      will be rolled to right and left side to confirm free spillage of contrast in the peritoneal
      cavity. The last image will be taken after the balloon tip is deflated or the cannulas are
      removed to best evaluate the lower uterine segment.
