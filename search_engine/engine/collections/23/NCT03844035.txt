      interdental brush or oral irrigator in treatment of periimplant mucositis.

      Material and Method: Forty-five patients with periimplant mucositis having at least one
      implant (age range:45-60) were included in study. Study was planned as randomized,
      single-blind, parallel-design. Patients were divided into 3 equal groups; i)toothbrush+oral
      irrigator ii)toothbrush+interdental brush, iii)only toothbrush. After baseline examinations
      [Silness-Löe plaque index(PI), Löe-Silness gingival index(GI), probing pocket depth(PPD),
      clinical attachment level(CAL), bleeding on probing(BOP)], initial periodontal therapy was
      completed using full-mouth disinfection method. Periimplant crevicular fluid(PCF) were taken
      from patents to assess levels of interleukin-1beta(IL-1β), Transforming growth
      factor-beta(TGF- β), tissue-type plasminogen activator(t-PA), plasminogen activator
      inhibitor-1(PAI-1). Clinical records were repeated at 2, 4 and 12 weeks.

      The hypothesis of our study is that oral irrigators may be effective in oral care of
      individuals using an implant-supported prosthesis because of the ease of use.
