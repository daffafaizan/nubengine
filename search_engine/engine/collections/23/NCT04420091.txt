      patient will undergo 3 visits (V0: Inclusion visit at baseline, V1: Follow-Up Visit after 1
      month ± 3 day and V2: End Visit after 3 months ± 5 days).

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether oral administration of Cartidyss,
      a concentrated fish cartilage extract, can contribute to the improvement of knee joint
      functionality and discomfort in adult population, using a specific self-administered
      questionnaire. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of Cartidyss
      on knee function and pain at rest and while walking, with patient global assessment and
      quality of life at each time point. The tolerance, compliance, satisfaction, rate of
      responder to the supplementation and pain killer's consumption would be also evaluated as
      secondary endpoints.
