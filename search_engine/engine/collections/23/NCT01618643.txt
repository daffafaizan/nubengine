      for the detection of neoplasia. No patient would receive any additional intervention that
      would not normally be performed.

      We will record the surface and vascular patterns before and after acetic acid spray. As usual
      we will then apply acetic acid spray to the Barrett's epithelium and time how long it takes
      for the aceto whitening to disappear. It is the timing of the disappearance that is the key
      study intervention. We will biopsy these areas to confirm the diagnosis. Again this is
      standard practice and no patient will be denied an intervention that is normally performed,
      and no extra interventions will be performed over and above the standard clinical practice.

      We will correlate the histology to the aceto-whitening disappearance time to identify a
      threshold time which can serve as a cut off between neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue.

      We hypothesise that the aceto-whitening reaction lasts much longer in the normal epithelium
      of Barrett's oesophagus and colon. This reaction will be much shorter in areas with abnormal
      pathology like dysplasia or cancer.
