      reduction of intracellular cholesterol leads to an increase in the number of LDL-receptors,
      and subsequent increased uptake and metabolism of LDL in the liver. Several large clinical
      trials have shown that the use of statins decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with
      risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. Unfortunately, 5% of statin users experience
      adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal [GI] and muscular).

      Statins inhibit not only cholesterol synthesis, but also synthesis of other substances in the
      mevalonate pathway. Among these other substances are Q10 and selenoproteins.

      It is well known that serum Q10 levels decrease during statin therapy, and that Q10
      supplement inhibits this decrease. One study has shown reduction of Q10 in blood-platelets
      during statin therapy. Q10 is an important element in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
      Depletion of Q10 leads to a reduction of high energy phosphates, anaerobe metabolism and
      mitochondrial dysfunction. This is suggested to be the cause of muscular adverse events in
      statin therapy. There are several reports of individuals relieved from muscular adverse
      effects after Q10 supplement, but no randomized, placebo controlled studies have been
      conducted.

      Symptoms of selenoprotein deficiency are very similar to adverse events seen in statin
      therapy, but no clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of selen
      supplement on adverse effects of statin therapy.
