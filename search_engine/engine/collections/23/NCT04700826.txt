    
      Designed with a Patient and Public Involvement Team, DaRe2THINK is an individual-patient,
      open-label, event-driven randomised trial with 1:1 allocation to DOAC or no additional
      therapy (usual care). Automated screening will occur of over 12 million patients in England,
      with targeted recruitment to practices with eligible patients, regular updates to General
      Practitioners, simple processes for centre inclusion and patient randomisation, remote
      e-consent and no additional visits for any patient. The primary outcome is a comprehensive
      composite of any thromboembolic event, ascertained entirely using electronic healthcare
      records within both primary and secondary NHS care across the nation. All endpoint data will
      follow a pre-published coding manual for extracted electronic healthcare data. The key
      secondary outcome is the change in patient-reported cognitive function, using remote
      technology solutions to save time for clinical staff and patients. DaRe2THINK will carefully
      assess and validate safety outcomes relating to major and minor bleeding. A systematic health
      economic analysis will determine NHS and societal cost-effectiveness of DOAC therapy in this
      younger population of patients with AF. DaRe2THINK will initially run over a 5-year period
      (outcomes as listed below), with longer-term outcomes (in particular cardiovascular death,
      cognitive function and vascular dementia) reassessed at 10 years.
