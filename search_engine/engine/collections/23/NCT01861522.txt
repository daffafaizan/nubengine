    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel-group comparative
      study to confirm the superiority of TAU-284 over placebo after two weeks of administration of
      TAU-284 (20 mg/day) or placebo to pediatric patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, with
      "the change from baseline in total nasal symptom score (total score for the three major nasal
      symptoms [sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion])" as the primary endpoint; and to
      investigate safety of TAU-284.
