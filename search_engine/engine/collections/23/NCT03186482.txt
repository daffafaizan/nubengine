    
      To assess the pharmacokinetics of TAF, plasma tenofovir, intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate
      (TFV-DP), emtricitabine, and emtricitabine tri-phosphate (FTC-TP), during administration of
      TAF/FTC and TDF alone and during co-administration of TAF/FTC or TDF plus rifampicin in HIV
      negative healthy volunteers.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of the co-administered drugs in HIV negative healthy
      volunteers. To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition
      genes and drug exposure. To investigate the impact of anti-retroviral drugs on platelet
      function in people living with HIV.

      Among patients treated with antiretrovirals (ARVs), many will need to be treated for
      tuberculosis (TB) during their lifetime and Rifampicin (Rifadin) is the most commonly used
      treatment for tuberculosis. Every new ARV that becomes available for the treatment of HIV
      must be studied with rifampicin to understand whether it is safe to be used in patients on
      ARV treatment undergoing anti-TB treatment with rifampicin.

      The total duration of the participant's involvement in the study will be 85 days plus a
      screening visit up to 28 days prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit 27 to 35
      days after the last blood measurement.

      The participants will be asked to visit the clinic on 18 occasions, of which three visits
      involve staying in the unit for approximately 12 hours (day 28, 56 and 84). Blood samples
      will be taken from the participants throughout the study to measure the levels of Descovy,
      Viread and Rifadin in blood. Blood and urine will also be collected throughout the study for
      safety analysis. This is to ensure the participants are healthy to take part or to continue
      taking part in the study. The total amount of blood collected from each participant during
      the study will be approximately 590ml (approximately a pint).

      Participants will be provided with written information about the study in the form of a
      participant information sheet and will be allowed adequate time for questions and to consider
      the study before agreeing to participate. It will be the responsibility of the investigator
      or the co-investigator to obtain written informed consent prior to undertaking any procedure
      detailed in the protocol. As part of the consent procedure, participants will also be asked
      consent to their personal details being entered into TOPS (the over-volunteering protection
      system).

      The investigator or designee will provide adequate explanation of the aims, methods,
      objectives and potential hazards of the study. They will also be explaining to the
      participants that they are free to refuse or withdraw from the study for any reason without
      detriment to their future care or treatment.

      A detailed description of each study visit follows below:

        1. Screening visit If the participant agrees to take part, they will firstly be asked to
           sign the informed consent form and they will be given a copy to keep.

           During the visit the following assessments will be carried out:

             -  Demographic details

             -  Full medical, drug and social history

             -  Physical examination including weight, height, and vital signs (temperature, blood
                pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)

             -  ECG

             -  Chemistry panel

             -  Haematology with a differential and clotting screen

             -  HIV antibody testing

             -  Hepatitis B and C screening

             -  Urinalysis (macro analysis)

             -  Drug screen (urine)

             -  Pregnancy test (urine) for WOCBP (women of child-bearing potential)

             -  Registration of TOPS database

             -  Concomitant medications GP verification of medical history: A medical history
                questionnaire will be sent to all participants' GPs for verification of medical
                history. This information will be reviewed by the Investigator as part of the
                medical history evaluation. If the completed questionnaire is not received from the
                GP, then the available information regarding the participant will be reviewed by
                the Investigator. The Investigator will assess this information and decide whether
                they are sufficiently confident that the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met
                and whether the participant may be enrolled into the study.

           This decision must be documented in writing BEFORE the participant is dosed. Copies of
           sent GP letters and returned confirmation of medical history will be filed in each
           participant's source documentation.

        2. Baseline Visit, Day 1

           Participants will attend the Unit in the morning and will be asked to fast for 8 hours

           dose at home.

           In Phase 1 and 3, Viread® and Descovy® dosing must be witnessed following a standard
           breakfast, made up according to instructions in Appendix 3 along with 240 ml of water.
           This will set the nominal time of dosing. Participants will then be instructed to take
           the study drug at home at the same time every day within 15 minutes after a standard
           breakfast.

           In Phase 2, the Rifadin® dose (either taken in the unit or at home) must be taken on an
           empty stomach. Then, at least 30 mins after the Rifadin® dose, participants should have
           a standard meal followed by the Descovy® dose.

           Participants will be requested to return to site any used/unused Descovy®, Vilead® or
           Rifadin® tablets on Days 28, 56 and 84. Site staff will count the IMP and this will be
           recorded in the source.

      up).
