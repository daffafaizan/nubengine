      Jamshedpur (India) were tested for COVID-19 IgG antibodies specific for the spike subunit
      antigen by the ErbaLisa COVID-19, Erba Corporate Services (United Kingdom) between 28th June
      and 15th July 2020.

      The cases who tested positive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies were repeat tested for the presence
      of COVID-19 IgG at 45-65 days after initially testing positive. This was done with the aim of
      finding out the percentage of cases retaining their IgG antibodies at 45-65 days of initially
      testing positive.
