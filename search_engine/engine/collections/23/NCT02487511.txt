      and 7 days in Europe. In Korea, it is recommended as the first line treatment regimen, 7 or
      14 days treatment of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) based triple therapy consisting of one PPI
      and two antibiotics, clarithromycin and amoxicillin. In case for treatment failure which is
      often related to Helicobacter pylori (HP) resistance to clarithromycin or metronidazole,
      bismuth-based quadruple therapy is commonly used as second-line therapy, however, the
      eradication rates was widely ranged according to the treatment duration.

      The objective of the study is to investigate whether treatment duration would affect the
      eradication rate of HP as a PPI based triple therapy (1st line therapy) and a bismuth-based
      quadruple therapy (2nd line therapy).
