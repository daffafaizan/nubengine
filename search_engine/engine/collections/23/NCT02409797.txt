      for the treatment of LBP is spinal manipulation (SM), which can be separated into 2
      categories: High-Velocity Low-Amplitude (thrust) and Low-Velocity (non-thrust) SM according
      to their force-delivery profiles. One commonly utilized non-thrust SM technique is the
      Flexion-Distraction procedure. Several studies have reported manually applied forces during
      thrust SM; however, the forces used during non-thrust SM, specifically those used with
      Flexion-Distraction treatment are still unknown. The results of this pilot study will provide
      preliminary information on treatment forces and sample size justification for future
      full-scale trials, while also ascertaining the feasibility of the study protocol and patient
      recruitment methods for such trials.
