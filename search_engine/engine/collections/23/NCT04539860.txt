      devices), with most relying on a cuff-inflation. Transdermal Optical Imaging measures blood
      pressure using a video captured by any conventional camera (e.g., those on a phone, tablet,
      laptop) and advanced machine learning algorithms.

      The current study aims to improve the accuracy of Transdermal Optical Imaging algorithms for
      measuring blood pressure. The investigators will recruit participants (patients with medical
      problems and healthy volunteers) to have their blood pressure measured in various ways
      (e.g.,by registered nurses with sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, continuous blood pressure
      monitor, etc.). Further, participants will have their faces video-recorded intermittently
      between standard measurements or at the same time as standard measures.
