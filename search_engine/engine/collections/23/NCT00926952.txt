    
      A total of 20 patients with at least 5 non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AK) of the face
      were included in this open-label study. All AKs were mapped on a transparent template before
      the first PDT treatment. At Day 0, all patients received methylaminolevulinate (MAL) applied
      on the entire face (except the nose and peri-ocular area of 1-2 cm) without any skin
      preparation. One to two 2 g MAL tubes was used for the entire face. MAL was applied without
      occlusion. After a total of 90 +/- 5 minutes the skin was rinsed and exposed to 37 J/cm² of
      red light from an Aktilite™ device. Patients were seen at Week 4; if all facial AKs did not
      show a complete response to treatment, the MAL-PDT procedure was repeated at Week 4. Patients
      were seen again at Week 12 and 24.

      The primary endpoint was at Week 12. Patients came back at Week 24 for a final safety
      evaluation and to verify the recurrence of AK.

      Efficacy is evaluated by assessing the mean number of facial AK at Week 12 as compared to Day
      0.
