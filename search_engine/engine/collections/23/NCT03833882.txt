      procedure and after inclusion/exclusion criteria check.

      Each patient will be planned to perform 6 study visits and at each visit all necessary study
      procedures will be performed according to the clinical investigation plan requirements (see
      flow-chart).

      The study visits will be performed at: screening, baseline, week 2, week 6, week 8, week 12.

      Patients will be enrolled at screening visit and at baseline, after the wash-out period of 1
      week, then will be randomized to receive MAF-1217 or CationormÂ® for the following 6 weeks.

      After this time lapse, patients will be switched to the opposite therapy for 6 additional
      weeks.

      The entire study population will be asked for a TID posology, and will be divided in 4
      different subgroups, according to the different types of evaporative DED.

      Certain test will be performed only in some patients:

      Osmolimetry and tear sampling in 20 patients(10/site) chosen random from groups B, C and D;
      Ferning test only in group D; tear film collection and cytokine expression only in 20
      patients form site nr. 2.

      Patients will be allowed to carry on any systemic or local medications, apart lubricating
      eyedrops, which have to be stopped the day before baseline visit.
