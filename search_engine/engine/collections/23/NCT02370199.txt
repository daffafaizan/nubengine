      measure vessel dilation in human subjects exposed to this energy at different irradiance
      intensities (25 milliwatts (mW)/cm2 and 75 mW/cm2). The intent of this protocol is to measure
      blood flow in the gastrocnemius muscle before and after exposure to 670 nm light energy. This
      protocol will be performed in healthy subjects, who do not meet exclusion criteria. The study
      consists of one visit. Blood flow measurement will be performed using contrast enhanced
      ultrasound, a method by which ultrasound contrast is continuously infused into the blood
      stream. Ultrasound records images in the area of interest and flow is related to the
      intensity of the contrast in each image. After baseline blood flow images are collected, the
      subject will receive red light energy to the gastrocnemius muscle with concurrent blood flow
      measurements with contrast ultrasound. The subject will be monitored post procedure and the
      study will then be completed.
