      Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an
      innovative teen pregnancy prevention program, Healthy U (formally known as Virtual Student
      Health Center), for youthful male offenders to test the impact of this innovative,
      non-curricular, technology-based intervention, that is self-directed, low-cost, user
      friendly, and offers great promise in reaching incarcerated youth. Healthy U was designed to
      give adolescents and teens the tools they need to reduce their risk of unintended pregnancy
      and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, using a low-cost, transportable
      platform that is user-friendly for youth (and staff to oversee). In this project, we take the
      innovative Healthy U intervention and modify its implementation for juveniles in custody of a
      correctional facility.

      This study involved male teenagers (ages 14-19) at high risk for involvement in risky sexual
      behavior, including teen pregnancy. The findings from this study are intended to contribute
      to research on both teen pregnancy and crime prevention. Teen parents and their children are
      at greater risk for subsequent criminal offending, and the children of teen parents also have
      greater risk of child abuse and neglect victimization. The current knowledge base suggests
      that youth exposed to the juvenile justice system have sex more often with more partners at a
      younger age and without protection (Bryan, Rocheleau, Robbins, & Hutchinson, 2005). This
      randomized study was designed to contribute to our understanding of what works with this
      population and to strengthen our knowledge base around developing and implementing
      technology-based interventions in a juvenile correctional environment.
