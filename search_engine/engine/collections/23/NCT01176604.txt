      I. Provide oversight to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere) to
      eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver who are not surgical
      resection candidates.

      II. Evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival associated with TheraSphere
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via a catheter over 5 minutes on day 0.
      Patients may receive additional treatments at 4-12 week intervals until all tumors in the
      liver have been treated in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 weeks, then annually for
      up to 2 years.
