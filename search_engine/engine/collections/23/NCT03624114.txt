      preoperative planning and computer-assisted surgery (CAS) during standard trans-sphenoidal
      pituitary surgery and if situations can be identified, where additional CT yields more
      information for the surgeon.

      A comparison of MRI with CT of the skull base or paranasal sinuses and intraoperative Video
      documentation of the anatomical site will be used.

      50 patients operated the University hospital of Basel [USB] (Centre A) are consecutively
      included into the prospective part of the study. MRI is used to assess the standardized
      variables, confirmed by CT. Additionally, for the 50 prospectively collected patients,
      neuroimaging results are correlated with intraoperative evaluation during endoscopic
      trans-sphenoidal surgery or post-hoc with video analysis of the performed surgery.

      Between 20-50 patients operated at the University of Malaya Medical Centre [UMMC] and
      Specialist Centre [UMSC] (Centre B)will be included retro- and prospectively . MRI is used to
      assess the standardized variables and the results are correlated with intraoperative
      evaluation during endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery or post-hoc with video analysis of the
      performed surgery.
