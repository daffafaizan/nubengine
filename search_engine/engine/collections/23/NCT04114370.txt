      previously diagnosed by resection or biopsy with grade 3 or 4 glioma.

      All glioma cases undergoing resection at UPMC are evaluated by immunohistochemistry for
      mutations in p53, nuclear localization of ATRX, and the presence of IDH1R132H mutation as
      part of standard neuropathologic integrated diagnosis using the WHO 2016 diagnostic criteria.
      All glioma cases resected at UPMC undergo genetic profiling using next generation sequencing.

      MRI imaging will be obtained as part of standard clinical care. The MRI sequences include T1
      pre and post contrast, T2 FLAIR, DWI, ADC and perfusion sequences using the imaging algorithm
      for evaluating treatment response in glioma treatment trials. Radiogenomic analysis will be
      performed using the MRI imaging sequences obtained as standard clinical care.
