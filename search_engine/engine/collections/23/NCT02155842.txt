      arms. Eligible patients are being sampled consecutively by cardiologists, and randomized to
      either high or moderate intensity endurance exercise. Endpoints are measured at baseline, 4
      weeks and 7 months. The intervention is considered safe, and the study has been approved by
      the Regional Ethics Committee (REK-midt).

      This project has been financially supported by the Norwegian ExtraFoundation for Health and
      Rehabilitation through EXTRA funds.
