      screening of 500 patients from the UIA cohort (CIAP-1) and focus on hemodynamics factors,
      high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI), genetic factors and biomarkers. Possible
      risk factors for rupture of UIA, including genetic factors, biomarkers, HRMRI, and
      hemodynamic will be analyzed. The first project of the China Intracranial Aneurysm Project
      (CIAP-1: Chaired by the Department of Neurosurgery, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical
      University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China) will establish a prospective cohort of 5000 patients with
      UIA from 20 centers in China, and collect baseline information for each patient.
      Multidimensional data will be acquired in follow-up assessments. Statistically significant
      clinical features in the UIA cohort will also be analyzed and integrated into this model for
      predicting risk of UIA rupture. After the model has been set up, the resultant evidence-based
      prediction will be used to provide a preliminary theoretical basis for the treatment of
      aneurysms at high risk of rupture.
