      This is a randomized controlled study, unblinded.

      The recruitment occured on Day 3 of teaching: random assignment (1:1) to receive either
      traditional follow up (telephone contacts and FAX communications) with the designated nurse
      OR a follow up with telehomecare PLUS the follow up by a specialized nurse.

      If the patient is designated to telehomecare, the training is provided on day of recruitment
      and patient leaves with the Web e Phone. Activation of the device must be done at home to
      enable for transmission of information.

      Families complete questionnaires to evaluate knowledge, Quality of Life Questionnaires
      (Skinner modified), a validated Life Habits survey and a satisfaction questionnaire at
      recruitment (time 0) and at study completion (3 months) (Children must be aged more than 8
      years).

      All reported hypoglycemias (less than 3 mmol/L) and nocturnal hypoglycemias by any means
      (telephone, FAX or Web e Phone) during the follow up period (suggested for 3 months) are to
      be accounted for.
