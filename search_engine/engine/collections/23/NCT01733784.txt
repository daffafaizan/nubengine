      that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. Some studies have shown that there
      is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during expiration
      (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea.

      The investigators will test how the viscoelastic properties of the airway influence PEN. To
      this end, the investigators will visualize the pharynx of sleep apnea patients using a thin
      endoscope and will induce central apneas during sleep. Pharyngeal cross-sectional area will
      be recorded during incremental changes in pharyngeal pressure during central apneas.
