      is based upon information obtained from a previous Phase IIA dose level and dose frequency
      ranging study. The population targeted is MSI-S metastatic colorectal cancer previously
      treated with two lines of chemotherapy regimens, one containing oxaliplatin and the other
      containing irinotecan. This population is not considered to be responsive to immunotherapy.

      The study drug is called "AlloStim". AlloStim is an "off-the-shelf",
      non-genetically-manipulated, living immune cell immunotherapy. AlloStim is derived from
      precursors purified from the blood of healthy donors and grown and differentiated in
      specialized bioreactors in the laboratory. Because the donors are intentionally mis-matched
      to the host, AlloStim is completely eliminated by the host in a non-toxic rejection response
      within 24h of administration.

      Unlike autologous immune cell therapies, like CAR-T cells or TIL cells, AlloStim is
      allogeneic and is not intended to directly kill tumors. Rather, the novel AlloStim mechanism
      is designed to modify and train the host immune system to kill tumors and prevent tumor
      growth and spread. Uniquely, the AlloStim mechanism is also designed to increase Th1/Th2
      balance, activate innate effector cells (such as NK and NKT), counter-regulate the immune
      suppressive and immune evasion mechanisms that tumors use to evade immune elimination both
      systemically and in the tumor microenvironment.

      The AlloStim mechanism creates self-amplifying waves of temporal and spatial immune effects
      that can lead to an initial non-specific cellular innate NK cell immune response followed by
      a tumor-specific killer T-cell immune response specific for the host tumor through a
      combination of immune processes called "allo-priming" and "in-situ vaccination".
