      fibromyalgia. However, characteristic contrast-enhancement patterns different from those seen
      in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis have been observed in a small
      sample of fibromyalgia patients referred for DCE-MRI of the hands for differential diagnostic
      purposes at department of radiology, Frederiksberg Hospital. In these patients enhancement
      parameters indicative of vasodilatation and diffuse hyperperfusion involving subcutaneous
      tissues and muscles of the hands and fingers were found, whereas no synovial inflammation in
      joints or tendons could be demonstrated in the majority of these patients. Whether these
      observations are part of a "normal" physiological perfusion in healthy individual or a
      potential novel marker of disease activity remains to be studied.

      If a pathological imaging pattern indicative of superficial soft tissue or muscle
      inflammation/hyper perfusion can be demonstrated it will have far-reaching implications for
      future research related to this patient population. Not only may this line of research
      contribute to a better neurobiological understanding of fibromyalgia and the neurobiological
      link between inflammation and pain modulation, but also to the development of more objective
      examination methods, which will make diagnosing more reliable and less subjective. Further, a
      better understanding of the neurobiology and phenomenological manifestations of fibromyalgia
      may have critical treatment implications
