      accomplished by completing the following specific objectives:

        1. To noninvasively assess dyspnea, motor drive, and respiratory timing during prolonged
           periods of resting breathing.

        2. To determine if relationships exist between these breathing pattern components and
           dyspnea.

        3. To determine if the relationships among respiratory timing, drive, and dyspnea are
           altered by a bronchodilator and over its duration of action.

      These specific objectives will be used to test the hypotheses that:

        1. During prolonged periods of resting breathing, respiratory timing will be altered and
           motor drive will be increased and less variable than in able-bodied controls.

        2. There will be a positive association between motor drive and dyspnea.

        3. Improving respiratory mechanics by bronchodilator administration will reduce drive,
           normalize timing and lessen dyspnea over the duration of action of the drug.

      Completion of the proposed studies will expand our existing knowledge of ventilatory control
      in persons with tetraplegia and relate these changes to dyspnea, a common and distressing
      clinical problem in these individuals. These studies will also provide a better
      characterization of breathing patterns and their intrasubject variability in persons with
      tetraplegia. Currently, the only information regarding breathing patterns in tetraplegia are
      of limited duration (15-30 minutes). If this pilot study reveals significant relationships
      between motor drive, timing, and dyspnea, compiling "normative" data for breathing patterns
      from large numbers of individuals with tetraplegia may be useful in evaluating dyspnea in
      different clinical settings.
