    
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery has been performed worldwide since 1990.
      Historically, LASIK has been reported to decrease contrast sensitivity post operatively and
      patients have been advised to take the day off of work and potentially the day after LASIK.
      More recently, utilizing advanced laser technology for optimized corneal ablation and
      creation of the flap has the potential for improved LASIK surgery results and improved
      recovery time. Visual recovery and management of immediate post operative visual acuity is
      important for patient satisfaction.
