    
      Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and
      will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables,
      increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young
      children. Both treatment groups will receive usual WIC care (nutrition counseling and similar
      services). The control group will receive generic printed health and nutrition materials to
      read at their own pace if they wish. The intervention group will watch the culturally
      sensitive DVD chapters according to a study calendar, complete action plan worksheets, and
      call in to peer support group teleconferences to discuss the DVD chapter contents. The
      teleconferences will be led by moderators trained in motivational interviewing (MI) and group
      facilitation. Participants will complete phone interviews and provide body weight
      measurements at baseline (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3 months after (T3) the
      intervention time period. T3 body weight will be the primary outcome.
