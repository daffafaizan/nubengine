    
      A single-center, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, 2-treatment, randomized, crossover study.
      After a screening period of up to 21 days before dosing, 36 eligible men and women will be
      assigned to receive a 50-mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of etanercept administered by each of 2
      methods of injection (Treatment A: administration by auto-injector device; and Treatment B:
      administration by manual injection) on separate occasions in an order determined by a
      randomization list (randomized 1:1 to sequence). Treatment administrations will be separated
      by a minimum of 28 days (maximum of 36 days). Subjects will be required to remain resident
      during the 72-hours after dosing in each period.
