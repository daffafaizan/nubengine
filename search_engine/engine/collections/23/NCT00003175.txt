      patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell urinary tract
      carcinoma. II. Determine the feasibility of this treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive continuous intravenous fluorouracil by a Baxter Infusor for 24
      weeks. Patients are evaluated for complete and partial response at 8, 16, and 24 weeks after
      the start of intravenous fluorouracil. Patients experiencing disease progression or
      unacceptable toxic effects are removed from the study. Patients are followed monthly for 6
      months post treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued.
