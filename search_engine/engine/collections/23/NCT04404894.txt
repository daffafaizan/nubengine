    
      To evaluate use of the Prolaris score in treatment management decisions in an ethnically and
      racially diverse population of men who have been newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and who
      are potential candidates for active surveillance. This registry will evaluate oncologic and
      co-morbidity outcomes in patients who receive Prolaris testing. Additionally, the registry
      will measure the prevalence and distribution of pathogenic mutations in hereditary cancer
      risk-associated genes among men with prostate cancer who meet National Cancer Center Network
      (NCCN) criteria for hereditary cancer genetic testing.

      The primary objective of this registry is to evaluate initial selection of active
      surveillance (Active Surveillance selection) versus definitive therapy (DT) among men with
      newly diagnosed prostate cancer who make treatment decisions with Prolaris testing, and among
      patient subsets defined by race/ethnicity.

      The secondary objectives of the registry are to evaluate progression of from Active
      Surveillance to definitive therapy over time and prostate cancer-associated morbidities that
      affect quality of life among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and who undergo
      Prolaris testing, and among patient subsets defined by racial/ethnic background and ancestry.
