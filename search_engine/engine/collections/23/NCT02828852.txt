    
      This is a monocentric study comparing a group of pregnant women and a group of "no pregnancy"
      women.

      The goal of the present study is to determine the impact of pregnancy on platelet function.
      For this, the study propose to explore, in women in the last month of pregnancy, the ability
      of platelets to aggregate after activation by strong agonists but also their ability to
      adhere to a matrix and form thrombies.

      The study will include 30 pregnant and 30 "no pregnancy" control women, of childbearing age
      and not taking hormone therapy. From a blood sample, two types of examination will be
      implemented:

      A) In whole blood, we will evaluate the percentage of platelet adhesion to collagen matrix or
      fibrinogen and the volume of thrombies formed.

      B) In washed platelets and whole blood, we shall determine the percentage of aggregation
      after activation by different agonists and the amount of certain membrane markers of platelet
      activation. Furthermore, an assay of estradiol plasma will be made.
