    
      This four year study involves a blocked randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the
      effectiveness of school-based CBT to usual care (UC) for approximately 375 students ages 7-17
      diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Randomization will occur at the school level and the
      investigators propose to conduct the study in approximately 46 schools (23 in CBT; 23 UC).
      Evaluations will be conducted by study staff to measure treatment progress at the end of the
      12-week treatment program, at a three month follows up, and at natural termination.
