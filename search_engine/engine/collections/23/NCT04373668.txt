      of key components of the Night Time Care Activities Programme- NightCAP. Particularly
      elements of sleep hygiene and personalised night-time care planning. There may also be
      additional benefit in combining NightCAP elements with pharmacological review protocol to
      enable management of all major contributing factors in sleep disturbance.

      This nine-month cluster-randomised factorial proof-of-concept trial will be delivered in 24
      UK care homes. Participants will be individuals living with dementia and experiencing sleep
      disturbance, as well as staff who care for them. Homes will be randomly allocated to one of
      eight arms. All homes will receive an optimised e-Learning programme; one of the eight is
      optimised usual care only. The remaining seven active interventions arms comprise of one, or
      a combination of two or three, of: (i) personalised night-time care planning (supported staff
      training and implementation); (ii) structured sleep hygiene (staff training); and (iii)
      hypnotic drug review protocol (GP and staff training). Across all 24 homes, 12 will receive
      each active intervention (alone or in combination). The primary contrast is hypnotic drug
      review vs no hypnotic drug review. The primary outcome will be hypnotic drug use at the end
      of intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will be behaviour symptoms, sleep disturbance,
      quality of life, resident falls, job satisfaction, burden and coping in care staff, and cost
      effectiveness.
