      Rapamycin, binds with high affinity to an intracellular immunophilin, FKBP12 and this complex
      specifically interacts with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase,
      inhibiting downstream events such as the initiation of mRNA translation. RAD001 inhibits the
      growth of a wide range of histologically diverse tumor cells. RAD001 is being developed as a
      cytostatic agent to delay the time to tumor recurrence/progression or to increase survival in
      patients with various malignancies. The compound has good tolerability, a partially
      discovered mechanism of action. RAD001 has the ability to arrest cells in the G1 phase, and
      the ability to induce apoptosis. RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on
      its potential to act directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and
      proliferation through possible inhibition of the PI3/AKT/MTOR pathway.

      RAD001 was shown to have activity in human tumor cell lines originating from lung, breast,
      prostate, colon, kidney, melanoma and glioblastoma. RAD001 was also shown to have activity in
      human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, where induction of apoptosis was reported, as well as
      in acute myeloid leukemia cells, adult T-cell leukemia cells, diffuse large B cell lymphoma
      cells, pancreatic tumor cells, ovarian cancer cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
