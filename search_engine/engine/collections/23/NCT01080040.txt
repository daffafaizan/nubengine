      defined as an abnormal velocity-dependent increase in muscle tonic stretch reflexes due to an
      amplified reactivity of motor segments to sensory input. It is part of one of the components
      of the superior motoneurone syndrome and it may cause muscle rigidity and disability.

      The spasticity, which could be measured in electrophysiological, biomechanical and clinical
      terms, has a significant prevalence. It is a frequent cause for consultation among subjects
      with MS and, consequently, has a significant impact on the QoL. Men and those subjects with
      MS of longer duration are the most affected by spasticity.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact that spasticity has on the QoL of subjects with
      MS.

      The total duration of the study is 24 months. The recruiting period will be 12 months. Once
      the recruiting time is over, the collection of data will continue during the full 24 months
      period that was planned.
