      anesthetic and hyaluronic acid given for local anesthesia of the eye for 2 different axial
      length groups of patients undergoing eye surgery. Volume assignment was carried out using a
      biased coin design (BCD) up-and-down sequential method (UDM), where the volume given to each
      patient depends on the response of the previous one. The MEV90 was calculated using isotonic
      regression with bias-corrected 95% confidence interval (CI) derived by boots trapping. The
      mean value of the estimate was obtained from 3000 bootstrap samples.
