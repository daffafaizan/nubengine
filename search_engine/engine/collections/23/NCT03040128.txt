      mortality and poor prognosis with unchanged mortality rates (53-59%). Acute treatment options
      for ICH remain supportive with no available effective drug or surgical therapy. All trials so
      far have failed to improve clinical outcome in randomized, double-blinded trials. However,
      one area of interest has been maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and
      preventing the growth of vasogenic edema. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are a family of
      ubiquitous zinc-dependent endopeptidase enzymes whose primary function is the digestion of
      collagen type IV, laminin, and fibronectin for the purpose of remodeling extracellular basal
      lamina. Elevated MMP-9 as a pathological process associated with larger hematoma volume,
      larger perihematomal edema, and poorer clinical outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage is well
      documented in animal models and patients. One particular MMP-9 inhibitor gaining usage in
      cerebrovascular disease is minocycline. Normally FDA-approved for bacterial infection and
      acne vulgaris, minocycline has also been found to be both a safe and effective treatment in
      ischemic stroke; its potential role as a neuroprotectant in ischemic stroke is currently
      being tested in a large, randomized, double-blinded trial. Minocycline's beneficial role as a
      neuroprotectant may also extend to ICH. By inhibiting MMP-9, minocycline may decrease BBB
      permeability, resulting in less perihematomal edema and decreased mass effect. Although
      numerous animal ICH models support minocycline's role as an inhibitor of MMP-9 and
      neuroprotectant, its use has never been studied in humans with ICH.
