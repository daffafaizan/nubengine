    
      This is a prospective multicenter study. Patients with T1-2 Breast cancer and clinically
      negative axilla on palpation, 1-2 suspicious nodes on ultrasound, and a biopsy proven
      positive node (by core biopsy of fine needle aspiration) will have a radioactive seed (I125)
      placed in their clipped node before surgery. At the time of surgery, patients that are
      scheduled for breast conserving surgery or mastectomy will have sentinel node biopsy (SNB)
      using radioactive dye (Tc99) +/- blue dye as well as retrieval of the clipped node using
      radioactive seed localisation (RSL). Removal of the I125 radioactive seed in the clipped node
      will be performed before the Tc99 counts are performed to prevent "shine through" and biased
      measurements. Imaging of the surgical specimen will confirm retrieval of the clipped node.
      Prospectively recorded information on pre-operative axillary imaging, characteristics of the
      retrieved nodes in the operating room and detailed pathological analysis of each
      corresponding node will be performed. Completion node dissection (CND) is not mandatory in
      this study but recommended if the clipped positive node is not retrieved, if 4 nodes or more
      are positive or if 3 nodes are positive in the absence of axillary radiation. The benefits of
      adding RSL to SNB and the benefits of adding SNB to RSL staging of the axilla will be
      evaluated in this study and will help to better define the value of using TAD in this patient
      population.
