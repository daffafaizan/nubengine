      significant portion of head/neck cancer survivors continue to smoke even though smoking
      negatively impacts their clinical outcomes and increases chance of recurrence. Two tobacco
      chemicals, NNK and nicotine, are respectively responsible for the increased recurrence risk
      and tobacco addiction. Kava s properties as a proven anxiolytic and a potential carcinogen
      detoxifier warrant an investigation of its effects on the metabolism of these two tobacco
      chemicals among head/neck cancer survivors who continue to smoke. The results will
      identifying surrogate biomarkers and provide information regarding kava s potential as a
      future intervention to both promote smoking cessation and reduce carcinogenesis risk.

      Primary Objective:

      To explore the feasibility of recruitment of participants, adherence rate, acceptability of
      treatment and completion rate with 14 day dietary supplement kava treatment in head and neck
      cancer patients who continue to smoke.

      To evaluate distribution of change in nicotine and NNK metabolism after 14 day kava
      treatment.

      Exploratory Objective:

      To evaluate distribution of change in mood after 14 day kava treatment. To evaluate
      prevalence of pain and pain medication use and distribution of change in pain and pain
      medication consumption after 14 day kava treatment.
