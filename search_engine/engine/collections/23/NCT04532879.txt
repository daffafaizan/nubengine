      a daily diary for 2 weeks. Patients will have the HygiRelief procedure with a HygiSample
      evaluation, then they will record their bowel habits in a daily diary for 2 weeks following
      the HygiRelief procedure.

      HygiSamples (stool samples) will be collected throughout the HygiRelief procedure and the
      samples will be sent for microbiome evaluation.

      Patients will complete multiple questionnaires - Happiness Scale, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale (HADS), and a personal assessment which includes the Constipation Symptom
      Score and Adverse Event Screening. These will be completed at Baseline, after the 2 week
      PRE-HygiRelief period, and after the 2 week POST-HygiRelief period.
