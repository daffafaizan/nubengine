      chest wall motion which decreases pulmonary compliance. In addition, anatomical changes lead
      to an increased incidence of airway obstruction in morbidly obese patients during periods of
      sedation. Both a typical nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula provide supplemental
      oxygen to the patients to prevent desaturation and hypoxia. However, the higher flow rates of
      high flow nasal cannulas are able to produce allows for washout of carbon dioxide from the
      respiratory system aiding with ventilation and creates 3 to 5 cm H2O of positive end
      expiration pressure which helps prevent collapse of the airway aiding with oxygenation.
