      University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Air Force, Essentia Health, and the
      University of North Texas Health Science Center. The study will take place in 'real world'
      clinical, socio-cultural, and demographically diverse (rural, underserved, academic, family
      medicine) care clinics (n=34) in 5 states (CA, MN, NC, WI, TX) that include genomic medicine
      'early adopter' and 'na√Øve' sites, as well as those that are EMR-enabled and others that are
      not. The study team will recruit a minimum of 7000 English or Spanish speaking adults over a
      3-year period and will capture process metrics and outcomes that are measured in the course
      of usual care. The goals are: 1) To optimize the collection of patient entered FHH in diverse
      clinical environments for coronary heart disease, thrombosis, and selected cancers, 2) to
      export FHH data to an OpenCDS platform and return CDS results to providers and patients (and
      to EMRs where relevant) and to explore the integration of genetic risk and FHH data at
      selected sites, 3) to assess the clinical and personal utility of FHH using a pragmatic
      observational study design to assess reach, adoption, integrity, exposure, and
      sustainability, and to capture, analyze, and report effectiveness outcomes at each
      stakeholder level: patient, provider, and clinic/system, and 4) to take a leadership role in
      the dissemination of guidelines for FHH intervention across in diverse practice settings.
