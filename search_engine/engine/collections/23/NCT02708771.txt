      acute hearta failure, hypoalbuminemia and high inflammatory activity, promotes an increase in
      serum albumin

      Assess the effect of high doses of ?-3 fatty acids added to standard treatment of patients
      with acute hearta failure, hypoalbuminemia and high inflammatory activity on:

        -  Inflammatory activity (C-reactive protein)

        -  The development of biomarkers (NTproBNP).

        -  The prognosis of patients evaluated by the combined event of death from any cause or
           readmission for heart failure within three months after randomization.
