           planes can be difficult due to a lack of tactile feedback and the inability to manually
           palpate the organ prior to resection. Although this can be minimized by careful
           preoperative planning, the information that can be obtained by images is also of limited
           utility. Conventional imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
           tomography (CT-scan), can provide a detailed view of 2D or 3D internal anatomical
           structures. However, during surgery, surgeons still have to use their subjective
           interpretation to translate this information into three-dimensional spatial
           relationships (ie the patient's actual volume). For this reason, in order to perform
           adequate resection and avoid injury, the surgeon must constantly infer what is the
           actual location of the anatomical structures and what is the position of the surgical
           instruments in relation thereto.

        -  The proposed study aims to evaluate the feasibility of surgical navigation in patients
           with colorectal cancer (sigmoid rectum-right-left rectum) and measure its performance in
           the perspective of a more specific application to rectal cancer approached
           laparoscopically through the abdomen and / or the anus. The study is proposed to
           patients with cancer because the measurement of accuracy will be done on predefined
           anatomical points that will be detectable in the surgical field after oncologic
           dissection. Benign pathologies do not require this type of extensive dissection and the
           application of navigation would imply additional risks for patients.

        -  Surgical navigation will be performed on the basis of preoperative images or
           intraoperative images.
