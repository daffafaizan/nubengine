      that removable partial denture wearers are susceptible to dental caries.

      The mode of action of silver diamine fluoride on caries prevention is dual: fluoride ions
      interact synergistically with silver to react with hydroxyapatite to form fluorapatite, and
      silver is bactericidal by reacting with the thiol groups of the amino and nucleic acids that
      halt the metabolic and reproductive functions of the cariogenic bacteria.
