    
      This is a two-arm, parallel assignment, open-label, randomized control trial comparing back
      pain outcomes in an intervention group (MPT using the Kaia app) to those of a control group
      (usual care without restrictions on treatment). It is designed to enroll up to 184
      participants. The treatment period will last for 90 days. This includes the randomization
      assignment and follow-up evaluations at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days post-randomization.
      After pre-screening and informed consent activities are completed, the study will be
      conducted using electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs); participants can complete all
      study tasks at home by means of internet-enabled devices. Participants assigned to the
      intervention group will implement Kaia's exercise regimen using their personal mobile
      devices. The control group will receive usual care without restrictions and will be provided
      with internet-based information about treatment of non-specific back pain, including handouts
      depicting typical home-based exercises as recommended by American Academy of Orthopedic
      Surgeons.
