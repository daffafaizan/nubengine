      cognitive decline during aging, with mixed results being obtained. However, few studies have
      investigated the health benefits of combining two or more of those interventions (ie, the
      so-called multidomain approach) in older adults. Intensive in-person multidomain intervention
      may difficultly be translated into the "real world" of healthcare systems because currently
      unpractical.

      Therefore, (cost-)effective interventions provided at distance and without the physical
      presence of healthcare professionals have the potential to be better translatable from
      research to real life. Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) have a crucial role
      to play in this context. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated
      the effects of an ICT multidomain intervention on cognition in the elderly yet.

      Thus, the main objective of eMIND is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-month,
      home-based multidomain intervention composed of nutritional counselling, exercise, and
      cognitive training provided using ICT solutions in people aged 65 or over.

      Secondary objectives include to obtaining preliminary data on the effects of the intervention
      on clinical outcomes in order to inform the design and sample size calculations of a future
      trial.

      eMIND has a mixed design, being composed of a randomized controlled trial (RCT, with two
      groups: the ICT multidomain intervention group vs Control Group) and a qualitative study
      (semi-structured interview to assess the easiness-of-use of the website).
