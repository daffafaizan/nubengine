      complication of coronary artery disease.

      Implantation of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) is a well established
      therapy for the treatment and prevention of sudden cardiac death. Evidence for the use of
      these devices has been provided by a number of landmark clinical trials over the last 16
      years.

      Reduction in ischemia can be achieved by coronary artery revascularization but in many
      patients may occur a gradual progression to recurrence of ischemia resulting in further life
      threatening arrhythmias. It is reasonable to assume that unchecked progression of ischemic
      heart disease may result in increased mortality in ICD patients. It has been shown that the
      long term mortality risk for ICD patients can be linked to the time since the last coronary
      revascularization procedure. Both MADIT-II and Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure trial
      (SCD-HeFT) showed that patients receiving inappropriate ICD therapy have an increased risk of
      death. It has been speculated that this may be due to progression of the disease and
      recurrent ischemia.

      A feature available in some ICDs manufactured by St Jude medical enables the constant beat to
      beat monitoring of the intra-cardiac ST segment using the implanted ICD leads. Similar
      systems have demonstrated this approach to be a reliable method of identifying ischemic
      events. However, the predictive value of the ST monitoring feature in identifying pending
      arrhythmic events has yet to be established. Prediction of worsening ischemia could play an
      important part in allowing physicians to identify ICD patients with greater mortality risk
      and allow them the time to personalize patient therapy in order to reduce that risk.
