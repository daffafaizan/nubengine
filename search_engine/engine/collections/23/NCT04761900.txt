    
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver diseases.
      It affects nearly 25% of the global population. Recently, a consensus was proposed by an
      international expert panel for the terminology changed from NAFLD to Metabolic associated
      fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The comprehensive criteria shift to a "positive" diagnosis. It
      helps to increase patient awareness and understanding of fatty liver (FL), for who has
      high-risk metabolic dysfunction. However, a more simplified and easily applicable definition
      is needed. It will have an impact on clinical practice, especially in developing countries.
      It may provide a better understanding of MAFLD, and optimize strategies for prevention of
      extrahepatic complications in clinical practice.
