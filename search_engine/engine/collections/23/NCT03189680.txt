      Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation center

      Participants: 55 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients completed the trial and 42 serves as
      comparison healthy controls

      Intervention: An initial screening established specific dysfunctions of PD patients with
      Hoehn-Yahr stage 2-3 who were then randomly assigned to standard care (n = 20) or standard
      care plus at-limit intensity, individualized agility program (15 sessions, 3 weeks, n = 35).

      Main outcome measures: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale,
      Motor Experiences of Daily Living, a measure sensitive to changes in a broad spectrum of PD
      symptoms

      In group time, repeated measurements of variance analysis were compared to the picture
      parkinson's disease based on MDS-UPDRS M-EDL, Beck depression score, PDQ-39, EQ5D VAS, Schwab
      & England scale. The TUG test and 12 static posturographic measurements are compared and
      compared to the healthy group as a standard.

      An at-limit and individualized sensorimotor and visuomotor agility exercise program vs.
      standard care, will improve non-demented, stage 2-3 PD patients' clinical symptoms, mobility,
      and postural stability by functionally meaningful margins.
