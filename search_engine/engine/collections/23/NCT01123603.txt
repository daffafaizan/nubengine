           affecting women of reproductive age. They account for approximately a third of all
           hysterectomies performed. Symptoms often attributed to uterine leiomyomas include
           excessive menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and so called "bulk symptoms,"
           or symptoms related to pressure on adjacent organs such as ureteral obstruction, urinary
           frequency and urgency, rectal pressure, pelvic pressure and increasing abdominal girth.
           Current treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids includes hysterectomy, myomectomy and
           uterine fibroid embolization.

        2. Lower urinary tract symptoms Although, urinary symptoms like frequency, urgency,
           incontinence, and voiding dysfunction are often attributed to fibroids, the relationship
           between fibroids and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has been poorly studied. The
           public health burden of fibroids has been studied before and after radical hysterectomy,
           supracervical hysterectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy.(1-3) What is missing in
           the literature is a comparison of traditional and non-traditional surgical fibroid
           techniques in a prospective fashion. Moreover, there are no studies evaluating the
           relationship between anatomic factors like uterine size or fibroid number or location
           and the presence of LUTS.
