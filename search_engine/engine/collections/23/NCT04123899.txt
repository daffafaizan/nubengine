           single oral dose, cross-over study

        2. Administration method:

           The subject should maintain a minimum of 10 hours of empty stomach before
           administration, and swallow an oral dose of 1 tablets (Famotidine 20 mg) after
           moistening mouth with 20 mL of water and dissolving completely with saliva on the tongue
           without water at around 8 a.m. on the day of the test at room temperature. The subject
           should not chew the drug or break it, but should swallow in whole with water. The
           difference in administration time between the test subjects is about one minute apart,
           considering the collection time.
