      eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled for another
      assessment session to determine current level of cognitive function. This process consists of
      paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests. Following the assessment process, participants
      will engage in an Internet browser-delivered training sessions conducted on any
      internet-accessible computer. The computerized training sessions can be done up to 7 times a
      week (once a day) or at participant's convenience (we recommend 5 times a week). Following
      the completion of training, the participant's cognitive function will be re-assessed and
      again after 3-month no-contact period. Participation is voluntary and participants may
      withdraw from the study at any time.
