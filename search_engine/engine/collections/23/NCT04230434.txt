    
      We will perform a Effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Design (Curran et al. 2012) to study
      firstly the feasibility of implementing the SPI in our clinical setting and secondly its
      effectiveness. The experimental arm will consist in a group of patients who visit the ED for
      a suicide-related concern in which the SPI is performed. This will be in the Emergency
      Department , unless for clinical reasons, the ED psychiatrist decide to postpone it to the
      first psychiatric appointment (which will be before one week of the ED visit as part of the
      treatment as usual).

      Right after the SPI is performed, both the patient and the clinician will complete
      questionnaire with satisfaction and acceptability measures. Subjects will be followed for 6
      months. At this time medical records will be consulted to obtain suicide reattempts rates and
      follow-up adherence.

      At all times, the anonymity of the participants will be preserved and will require heading of
      informed consent, as well as other ethical aspects indicated by the Ethics Committee.
