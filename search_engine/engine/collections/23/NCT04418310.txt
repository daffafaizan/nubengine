      (McCallum et al., 2008). Its incidence is 26/100,000 and it usually occurs in working males
      of age 15 to 30.

      The disease itself dates back to 1833 when Herbert Mayo, British Physiologist, Anatomist and
      Surgeon described it as a sinus containing hair follicles located in the sacrococcygeal
      region in a woman.
