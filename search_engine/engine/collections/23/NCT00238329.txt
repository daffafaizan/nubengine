        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma
           treated with PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly and oral
      thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for at least 2 weeks but no more than 8 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide for 2 months beyond
      documentation of CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-38
      months.
