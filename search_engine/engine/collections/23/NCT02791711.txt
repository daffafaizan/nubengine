      acute pulmonary disease and dyspnea usually viral (70 to 80% of Respiratory syncytial virus
      (RSV) in infants less than 1 year). It particularly affects infants under 2 years.

      The 2001 consensus conference and bronchiolitis 2006 on the management clarified the criteria
      for hospitalization and simplified therapeutic attitudes. These conferences have highlighted
      the importance of humidification, the nasopharyngeal desobstruction for less severe forms of
      oxygen therapy and for others. Recent literature has also shown that the use of noninvasive
      ventilation type Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) nasal or broadband nasal glasses
      (HFNC: High Flow Nasal canula) in severe forms possible to reduce the work of breathing of
      children with severe bronchiolitis and their use in studies "before / after" was accompanied
      by a significant decrease in the use of invasive ventilation.

      The HFNC and nasal CPAP can deliver warmed humidified gas through a nasal interface, greatly
      improving the safety and efficacy of administering O2. These devices generate a continuous
      positive pressure in the airways, for decreasing the work of breathing. The sealing absence
      of the HFNC at the nasal interface improves patient comfort and avoiding nasal trauma,
      sometimes encountered with nasal CPAP interfaces.

      The HFNC is a simple, effective and safe, commonly used in severe bronchiolitis admitted in
      ICU (Intensive Care Unit). However instead of this technique is not yet well defined.

      The investigators assume that the use of HFNC in severe bronchiolitis in first line allows
      sufficient respiratory improvement to avoid recourse to other technical assistance
      ventilatory more binding.
