      remains a major complication after allo-HSCT and the destruction of recipient tissues by
      alloantigen-activated T cells is a key event in the development of aGVHD. Corticosteroid is
      the standard first-line therapy for aGVHD due to their roles in suppressing T cell responses.
      However, the response rate of corticosteroid was approximate 50%, and the clinical outcomes
      of patients with corticosteroid refractory GVHD were poor. Thus far, no combination therapy
      had been prove to be superior to corticosteroid alone as initial therapy for aGVHD. The study
      hypothesis: MTX combined corticosteroid treatment could help to further ameliorate the
      activity of T cells and control aGVHD.
