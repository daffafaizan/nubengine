      based on whether or not they have received prior radiation therapy to the pancreatic region.
      Treatment may be delivered over 2 weeks, provided that the patient receives at least 2
      fractions per week. Initial patient positioning will be based on volumetric kV (cone-beam
      computerized tomography) imaging with shifts to bony anatomy as appropriate. Orthogonal kV/MV
      or kV/kV projection imaging will be used to verify the location of the fiducials prior to
      delivery of the first treatment beam. A secondary shift based on the location of fiducials
      may be utilized, as indicated by the position of the fiducials. For free-breathing
      treatments, kV fluoroscopic images should be obtained to confirm the anticipated position of
      these fiducials during the entire respiratory cycle. Active monitoring of treatment delivery
      accuracy will be accomplished using kV and/or MV projection imaging, either immediately
      before or during all (or a subset of) treatment fields. Patient-specific dosimetric quality
      assurance (QA) will be performed as per standard practice in the Department of Radiation
      Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine.
