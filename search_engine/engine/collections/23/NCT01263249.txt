      perineural catheter tip during a continuous femoral nerve block (anterior vs. posterior)
      impacts quadriceps muscle strength. These results will help define the optimal perineural
      catheter tip location relative to the femoral nerve used for continuous peripheral nerve
      blocks and help guide both clinical care and future research in this clinically-relevant
      area.
