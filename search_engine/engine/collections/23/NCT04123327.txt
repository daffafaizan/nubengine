      fibrillation (AF) to further improve the understanding of the role of psychological factors
      in AF-related disability. A cross-sectional study (N=400) will investigate the prevalence of
      symptom preoccupation and its role in AF-related disability. Subjectively-rated assessments
      will be gathered from 400 AF patients.
