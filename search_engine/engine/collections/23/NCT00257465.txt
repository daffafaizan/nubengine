      cm (about 1 inch) diameter than can be removed for vaccine production. If the vaccine is
      successfully made and if the patient is eligible, the patient will be assigned to receive one
      of 4 doses of the vaccine, include one group that will receive a zero dose. All patients will
      receive injections of their vaccine as part of immune system testing and will receive low
      dose cyclophosphamide and BCG. Eight injections of the vaccine will be administered as an
      injection into the skin of the arm over a 6 month period. Before and after vaccine
      administration, patients will be tested for immunity to their own melanoma cells by DTH
      testing, which is similar to a tuberculosis test. All side effects caused by the vaccine will
      be recorded.
