      treatment with TAF(25mg/d,oral) will be started on the first day after liver transplantation.
      Post-operative HBV infection is defined with positive HBV marker (HBsAg) and/or positive HBV
      DNA after liver transplantation. Primary outcome will be evaluated at 48 weeks. All the
      patients will be followed up for another at least 1 year to evaluate the long term efficacy
      and safety of TAF.

      The primary endpoint is to calculate de novo HBV infection after liver transplantation when
      treating with TAF. Secondary endpoint is to evaluate the renal safety of TAF after liver
      transplantation.
