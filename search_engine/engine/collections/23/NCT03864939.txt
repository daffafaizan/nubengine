      are missing. The human amniotic membrane includes growth factors and unique immune tolerance
      which can improve tissue regeneration. The preliminary studies could prove the potential
      value of dHAM in the reconstruction of the urinary tract and nerve protection. The
      investigators initially present a randomized trial to improve postoperative continence and
      potency of patients undergoing placement of dehydrated human amnion membrane (dHAM) around
      the neurovascular bundle (NVB) and vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) during RRP for the
      treatment of prostate cancer. RRP is performed in a standardized way by one experienced
      surgeon. The patients are randomized 1:1 to dHAM vs. placebo and blinded during the study
      period. The primary outcome is a postoperative continence measure as 24hrs pad test up to
      12mos postoperatively. Secondary outcomes are potency, insufficiency of VUA, postoperative
      complications and biochemical recurrence. Using the T-test with an alpha of 0.05 and a power
      of 80% and expecting a drop-out of 20% of the patients, an adjusted sample size per arm of
      164 patients is required.
