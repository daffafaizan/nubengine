    
      BACKGROUND:

      The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE was recently identified as a promising
      new marker of alveolar type I cell injury. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
      that acts as a multiligand receptor and is involved in propagating inflammatory responses.
      While the precise function of RAGE remains unclear, the elevated levels of RAGE, and its
      soluble isoform sRAGE, correlate with severity of ALI/ARDS in human and animal studies, and
      RAGE levels could reflect impaired alveolar fluid clearance. Thus, it is possible that
      elevated levels of RAGE in ALI/ARDS derive in part from RAGE's role in systemic inflammatory
      cascades rather than purely from its release from alveolar type I cells.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This observational prospective clinical study will describe and compare sRAGE levels in the
      alveolar edema fluid and in the plasma from ICU patients enrolled within the first 24 hours
      after onset of ALI/ARDS and/or severe sepsis/septic shock, and from patients under mechanical
      ventilation (control group). Edema fluid and plasma samples will be collected simultaneously
      on day 1, day 3, day 6, and day 28 (or at ICU discharge), in order to describe kinetics of
      evolution of sRAGE levels. Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid samples will be collected in
      intubated patients only, and blood samples will be gathered from an indwelling arterial
      catheter. The concentrations of sRAGE will be measured in duplicate by ELISA.
