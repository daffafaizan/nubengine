      specialties that normally may or may not interact. The tissue bank will build the platform
      for a novel application of translational research that links cutting edge molecular
      laboratory techniques to clinical outcome studies in a fast and direct manner. Tissue banks
      can be used for numerous discovery applications such as the identification and structural
      characterization of human genes, expression analysis, or discovery proteomics. Biological
      specimens, when coupled with standardized treatment and outcome data, will be essential
      resources for the identification, characterization, and validation of biomarkers that are
      predictive of disease and treatment.
