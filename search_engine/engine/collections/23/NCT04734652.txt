    
      Primary objective: To characterize viral suppression rates (proportion of patients with
      suppressed viral load) at week 24 in the BIC arm

      Secondary objectives:

      To characterize viral suppression rates at weeks 12, 24 and 48 in the standard of care
      treatment (SOC) arm (currently, TDF 300mg/3TC 300mg/DTG 50mg) and at weeks 12 and 48 in the
      BIC/FTC/TAF arm.

      To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIC when given twice daily and co-administered with
      Rifampicin during tuberculosis treatment vs when given alone after discontinuation of
      Rifampicin

      To assess the incidence of TB associated IRIS in each arm, through week 24.

      To characterize the tolerability of treatment in each arm by assessing frequency of
      clinician-initiated treatment interruptions or switches through week 48.

      To assess frequency of ART drug resistance mutations in participants with detectable viral
      load at study visit weeks 24 and 48.
