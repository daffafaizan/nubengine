      anovulation and androgen excess that occurs in 4-8% of unselected adult women. Although signs
      and symptoms of the disorder typically appear at the time of puberty, diagnosis is often
      delayed until adulthood. At least 50% of adult women with PCOS are obese, resulting in a more
      severe clinical picture. Obesity among adolescents has been increasing in recent years, with
      overrepresentation of females who show evidence of hyperandrogenism and irregular periods,
      suggesting an association of obesity and PCOS at an early age. Recent data, however, have
      drawn attention to the long-term risks of PCOS, including diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease. Insulin resistance plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and is
      thought to be the metabolic abnormality most closely linked to an increased risk of diabetes
      and heart disease. Traditional treatments with oral contraceptives are associated with
      reduction in serum androgens and improvements in menstrual cycles in adolescents with PCOS,
      however these have not been well-studied in obese adolescents. Oral contraceptives may worsen
      the dyslipidemia seen in obese women with PCOS and do not address the insulin resistance.
      Metformin, an insulin sensitizing agent, has been shown to improve metabolic features of
      PCOS, but combination therapy with oral contraceptives has never been studied in the obese
      adolescent with PCOS.

      The major hypothesis of this proposal is that metformin will improve the metabolic profile of
      obese adolescent girls with PCOS treated with oral contraceptives. Additionally, a secondary
      hypothesis will be that compliance with a concurrent lifestyle modification program with be
      associated with the most significant improvements.
