      robotic device in retinal surgery. Specifically, the investigators will determine whether
      particular operations are performed more quickly and safely with robotic assistance. The
      PRECEYES Surgical System is a robotically assistive device developed by PRECEYES Medical
      Robotics, a Dutch-based research group at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven. It has been
      designed to enhance surgical precision, specifically for vitreoretinal eye surgery. The
      device provides accuracy beyond human capabilities of <10Î¼m in all directions (x, y, z
      planes). The surgeon is always in control of the instrument by manipulating the motion
      controller. Patients undergoing one of two operations will be invited to enroll in the study
      (i.e. consent for the following operations is an eligibility criteria for the study itself):
      i) those undergoing epiretinal or inner limiting membrane peel, ii) those undergoing
      subretinal haemorrhage displacement surgery. The study will involve the surgeon performing
      specific surgical steps of these operations, that require very high levels of precision, with
      the assistance of the robot. Efficiency, accuracy and safety data will be collected. Eligible
      study participants will be recruited from the cohort of patients attending the outpatient
      clinics of the Oxford Eye Hospital who require either ERM/ILM peel or sub retinal haemorrhage
      displacement surgery. The expected duration and frequency of pre- and post-operative follow
      up will be identical to standard NHS care for these particular operations i.e. no additional
      study visits or procedures will be required.
