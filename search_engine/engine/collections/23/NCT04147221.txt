      in critically ill patients with Augmented Renal Clearance (ARC). Twelve patients with
      suspected ARC will be enrolled to ensure complete pharmacokinetic data in at least eight
      patients with confirmed ARC. Confirmation of ARC will be established by eight hour urine
      creatine determination. Each participant will receive a single dose of imipenem-relebactam
      (500mg/250mg) followed by six blood samples over a 6 hour interval to determine
      concentrations. Non-compartmental and population pharmacokinetic analyses will be determined
      to assess the effects of ARC on imipenem and relebactam pharmacokinetic parameters.
