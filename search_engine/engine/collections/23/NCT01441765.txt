    
      This study is divided into 2 groups. The first 22 subjects will be in Group 1 and will
      receive CT-011 only. The next 22 subjects will be in Group 2 and will receive CT-011 and the
      DC RCC vaccine.

      Group 1: Subjects in this cohort are not required to have tumor resection (nephrectomy) to
      participate in this study. For subjects who are undergoing nephrectomy and for subjects
      undergoing resection for another metastasis, infusions of CT-011 will begin 21 to 35 days
      post-surgery. Subjects will receive 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose
      of CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28 intravenously.

      For subjects who are not undergoing nephrectomy for standard of care therapy, infusions of
      CT-011 will begin 21 to 28 days following registration on the study. Subjects will receive a
      total of four cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of CT-011 given on days
      1, 14, and 28 intravenously.

      Group 2: Subjects in this cohort will have chosen to undergo a "debulking nephrectomy"
      (surgery to remove a tumor of the kidney, but not all of the cancer cells in your body) as a
      standard treatment for kidney cancer or have tumor lesions that are accessible (may be
      removed without major surgery) and are being removed to treat or diagnose their cancer. All
      subjects in this group will receive infusions of CT-011 21 to 35 days following tumor
      resection.

      Subjects will receive a total of 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of
      CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28. In addition they will receive a vaccination of the DC RCC
      vaccine on day 8 of each cycle.
