      nutrient flow into, as well as waste flow out of the residual limb. Shrinkers are a common
      and effective treatment for edema. However, their influence on healing and long term limb
      volume has not been studied. This study will pertain to human subjects affected by primary
      transtibial amputation. Two interventional groups of patients will use shrinkers with
      different levels of compression as part of their rehabilitation. A third, control group will
      not use shrinkers. The groups will be studied to determine the effects of shrinker use on
      healing and long term residual limb volume.
