    
      This is a single arm pilot multicenter prospective study. We will recruit KRAS/RAS wild
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients who received at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and the
      1st line must include cetuximab/panitumumab combined with chemotherapy. We will repeat RAS
      testing after progression on the last line of therapy. RAS testing will be taken via liquid
      biopsy using ctDNA or tissue biopsy from either a new tumour lesion or a previously present
      lesion which shows evidence of disease progression by radiological imaging. Only RAS-wild
      patients upon re-testing will be enrolled and will receive re-challenge therapy with
      panitumumab combined with chemotherapy similar to that given at 1st line
      (5-fluorouracil/leucoverin combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan). Those converted to RAS
      mutant will not be enrolled.

      All patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or
      withdrawal of consent.
