      cancer, the 7th most common cancer in the United Kingdom. While the equipment to record
      bladder examinations exists, it is not simple or quick to use so examinations are rarely
      recorded. Methods of enhancing the images obtained during these examinations also exist but
      these are generally hardware based, requiring specific equipment, or use a fluorescent dye
      and special endoscope, which is expensive for the clinical service provider, inconvenient for
      the patient and may cause allergic reactions.

      The new proof-of-concept device will record high-definition video in a lossless format to a
      computer hard-drive from any existing cystoscopy equipment to which it can be connected.
      Additionally, the device incorporates a foot pedal which allows the operator to "bookmark"
      points of interest during the examination. These points are marked in the recorded video data
      file and aid later navigation and review of examination session videos.

      The recordings will be used to develop novel image enhancement software, which is intended to
      make abnormalities in the bladder easier to identify. Once the software has been developed,
      the enhanced and un-enhanced videos will be reviewed by experts (clinical urology
      specialists) and non-experts (other healthcare staff and laypeople), who will be asked to
      report areas of interest in the videos, without knowledge of the diagnosis for each
      examination. A statistical analysis of reporting of areas of interest by expert and
      non-expert reviewers will be produced, to assess the usefulness of the software image
      enhancement in identifying abnormalities in the bladder.
