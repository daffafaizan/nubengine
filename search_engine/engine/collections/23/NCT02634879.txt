      inform the structure of provider incentives and the practice environment can improve provider
      performance, especially in settings that are moving away from fee-for-service reimbursement
      and fragmented care towards new payment and delivery models that emphasize coordination of
      care and provider accountability. The project will build upon the recently completed 'Phase
      1' project in which a set of behavioral economic approaches to provider performance were
      identified that could meaningfully improve provider performance, a focused research agenda of
      high-priority tests of these concepts (i.e., content of this proposal) was developed; and
      information on how behavioral economics can be used to improve incentives for physicians was
      disseminated. For this phase, an experimental evaluation will be conducted of the impact of
      social pressure by varying individual and group incentives and the comparative effectiveness
      of two loss aversion framing methods (endowment versus performance gap) on provider
      performance via a multi-arm experiment. We will complement the quantitative evaluations with
      pre- and post-intervention qualitative surveys of physicians and patients to better
      understand the influence on behavior change, culture, acceptability of the incentive program,
      and patient reported outcomes on health and experience.
