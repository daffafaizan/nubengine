      research in this area, such as using retinal implants to restore vision. Without being able
      to accurately measure the change in vision before and after treatment, it is not possible to
      fully assess the effect of treatment.

      The Freiburg Vision Test (FrACT) is a computer based test developed to assess patients down
      to the LP level. It has been used in research in recent years. The FrACT is suitable for
      research but is not suitable for a clinical setting. The Berkeley Rudimentary Vision Test
      (BRVT) works on a similar principal as the FrACT but consists of hand held cards shown to the
      patient. Little work has been completed on how well the BRVT test works. Results from FrACT
      and BRVT will be compared in a group of patients with very low vision. This is important to
      establish how easily research results can be applied to a clinical setting.

      Patients will also be asked to complete a daily living survey to better understand the impact
      of such poor vision on the ability to carry out day to day tasks. This understanding will
      help guide low vision services for patients as well as help direct low vision research to
      achieve a useful level of functional vision.
