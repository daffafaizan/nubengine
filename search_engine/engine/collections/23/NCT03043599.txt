    
      This study is a nonrandomized, phase II, single arm, multicenter trial evaluating safety and
      efficacy of thoracic radiation therapy followed by nivolumab and ipilimumab in participants
      with Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC) who have completed a first-line
      platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and achieved ongoing complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR), or stable disease (SD). This study will determine whether nivolumab and
      ipilimumab delivered 2 weeks following consolidative thoracic radiation therapy demonstrates
      acceptable toxicity and whether the treatment regimen will improve 6-month progression-free
      survival (PFS) compared with a similar historical control cohort in this participant
      population. Additional objectives include further characterization of overall survival,
      adverse event profile, patterns of failure analysis, and potential predictive biomarkers of
      response to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and thoracic radiation therapy in
      patients with ED-SCLC.
