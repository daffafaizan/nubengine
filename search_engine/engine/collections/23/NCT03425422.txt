    
      ANTHEM-HFrEF is a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial with an
      adaptive design. Patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced LVEF will be enrolled
      and randomized 2:1 to receive VITARIA system implantation on the right cervical vagus nerve
      in addition to stable guideline-directed medical therapy (therapy), or to continue receiving
      stable guideline-directed medical therapy alone (control arm).

      Subjects in the therapy arm will receive continuous, periodic VNS stimulation after surgery
      is completed, and will undergo visits for VNS up titration over a period of 3 months.
      Subjects in the control arm will also undergo scheduled visits at a similar frequency as the
      titration visits that are scheduled for subjects in the therapy arm. Data for safety and
      efficacy assessments will be collected for both study arms at 4 weeks post-randomization,
      every 3 months for the first 12 months, and every 4 months thereafter.
