      arterial disease with intermittent claudication that receive supervised exercise therapy
      (SET) and additional transcutaneous electric stimulation (TES) of the calf muscle. SET
      program consists in once weekly walking training for 75 min under supervision of a
      professional trainer. Patients are encouraged to continue the training modules at home. TES
      is performed using the mobile "Veinoplus arterial" device (AdRem Technology, France) on a
      daily base for 60-120 min at home. Patient outcome will be compared to the retrospectively
      analyzed results of patients, that received the same SET program alone in the past.
