      gastrectomy will be enrolled prospectively.

      For the purposes of the current study we want to determine how much paracetamol
      (acetaminophen) can reduce the cytokines levels in these patients

      The study enrollment period is planned to be a year. The follow-up period for each patient
      will be until discharge from the hospital.
