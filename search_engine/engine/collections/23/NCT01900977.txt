    
      HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 071 (PopART) will investigate the impact on HIV
      incidence of universal voluntary HIV counseling and testing (with referral to care) provided
      to a community through a house-to-house campaign, in combination with early ART for
      individuals who are HIV-positive, and other proven preventive interventions. The design of
      HPTN 071 (PopART) will allow the study team to distinguish between the impact of universal
      testing with referral for HIV care in accordance with national guidelines, and the impact of
      universal testing with referral for early ART initiation for those with HIV infection. In
      addition, HPTN 071 (PopART) will determine if a program of universal voluntary testing,
      including early ART initiation, is feasible and acceptable when delivered on a large scale to
      entire communities. Evaluating the effectiveness of universal voluntary HIV counseling and
      testing with the offer of early ART is a key global health priority.
