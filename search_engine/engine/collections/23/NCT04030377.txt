      ways of bladder catheterization as means of management of postoperative urinary retention.
      Based on this information, the patient chooses her preferred way of postoperative
      catheterization in case she experiences acute urinary retention after surgery. After the
      surgery, those patients requiring catheterization postoperatively evaluate their experience
      in a postoperative questionnaire.
