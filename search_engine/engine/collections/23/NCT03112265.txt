      "treatment as usual" (known as Usual Care or UC) through a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      at eight K-8 public schools. The STEPs model has two components: (1) a modular protocol that
      combines 33 modules-i.e., descriptions of common elements within evidence-based therapies for
      anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and conduct problems; and (2) a web-based system
      for monitoring student responses to treatment and providing weekly feedback to therapists to
      guide their selection and sequencing of the STEPs modules. The project will examine: (a)
      whether self-regulation skills at baseline are associated with baseline patterns of mental
      health and school problems; (b) whether self-regulation skills at baseline predict degree of
      improvement during treatment; (c) whether self-regulation skills improve from pre-to post
      treatment, and whether extent of this improvement differs by treatment condition; and (d)
      whether self-regulation improvement (from pre-to-post treatment) mediates the long-term
      benefit of treatment.
