      of these diseases is increasing due to population growth, aging, urbanization, and increasing
      prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. The costs of diabetes affect health services,
      national productivity as well as individuals and families. Hospital in-patient costs for the
      treatment of complications are the largest single contributor to direct healthcare costs.
      Many of these complications and, therefore, their costs, are preventable. Intensive therapy,
      directed at the control of blood glucose, blood pressure etc, has been shown to be
      cost-effective in that, although initial costs are increased, it decreases longer term costs
      as a result of delayed or prevented complications . Diabetes self-management education is a
      multi-faceted process involving much more than helping people with diabetes to monitor their
      blood glucose, or take their medication as prescribed. Diabetes education must be an ongoing
      process rather than a one-time event because a person's health status and need for support
      change over time.
