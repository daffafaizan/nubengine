      treatments used to treat lung cancer. One of the known side effects of this radiation therapy
      is scarring of the lungs and reduced lung function that can result in shortness of breath. At
      this time the radiation treatment plan does not take into account differences in lung
      function between one part of the lung and another. Studies have shown that lung function can
      vary substantially throughout the lungs. This study aims to plan the radiation therapy to be
      away from the highest functioning portions of lungs while still delivering the intended
      radiation dose to the tumor. This study will allow researchers to determine whether taking
      lung function information into account when designing radiation treatment plans can protect
      lung function after radiation therapy.
