      (NoL) Index in neurological impaired anesthetized patients under general anesthesia, by
      evaluating its response to controlled changes in the levels of noxious stimuli/analgesia, and
      to correlate the NoL response to the EEG derived pain score. Validating the performance of
      the NoL Index may provide a tool to monitor the pain/nociception in this population.

      In this study, the PI plan to demonstrate that the NoL Index is a continuous index. It is
      anticipated that a higher level of nociception will correspond to a higher NoL index. On the
      other hand, it is anticipated that higher levels of analgesic agent for the same noxious
      stimulus will lead to a lower NoL index.

      The participants will be monitored as in a typical ICU and according to the local guidelines
      by various types of monitoring devices, such as: vital signs, pulse oximeter, Bispectral
      Index (BIS), Electroencephalography (EEG) etc.
