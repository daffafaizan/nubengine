    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if the Revian Red All LED cap shows potential
      to be an effective treatment for CCCA by recruiting hair follicles back to anagen growth or
      by improving inflammation. The primary outcome is to determine if hair loss regression is
      halted. Secondary outcomes include hair regrowth and alleviation of signs and symptoms of the
      disease.

      Methods and Measures

      Design 5 subjects who are willing to participate in a novel treatment for Revian Red All LED
      cap will be enrolled in this study. The cap uses two wavelengths of light, 620 nm and 660 nm.
      A study caps will be provided for each subject. Subjects will use the cap once daily,
      10-minute treatment regimen which is the current androgenetic alopecia recommendation. The
      subjects will use the cap for a total of 6 months.

      Standardized photos and dermatoscope photos before starting treatment and every 2 months for
      x 6 total months will be taken to assess hairline stabilization and potential for regrowth.

      Prior to study enrollment, all participants will receive a detailed explanation of the
      purpose of the study and will undergo written informed consent. Clinical history of hair loss
      and history of prior treatment will be obtained by administering a standardized questionnaire
      to all subjects. Subjects will also fill out a questionnaire regarding symptoms of their hair
      loss at each subsequent treatment visit and at follow-up. In order to be eligible, subjects
      must be diagnosed clinically and histologically with CCCA. Diagnosis will be made only by a
      board-certified dermatologist.
